\begin{itemize}[label=\bluebullet,left=0em,itemsep=3pt]
  \item \textit{Feature Set 1} refers to the original feature extraction set. 
  \item \textit{Feature Set 2} is customized for comments on social platforms, including the number of function words, the number of punctuation marks, the type-token ratio, average sentence length, readability score, the uppercase ratio, number of slang terms, number of URLs, whether there is a subject, and the type of the subject.
  \item \textit{Feature Set 3} was obtained by modifying \textit{Feature Set 2}, but with the number of slang terms and the number of URLs removed. Instead, part of speech n-gram features were added.
\end{itemize}
\noindent {\small\textbf{What do the results imply?} A plausible explanation of this trend is that social media markers actually \textit{decrease} performance on topically homogeneous sets but have a negligible positive effect on performance in the case of more heterogeneous sets.}
