And you will be building marketable skills in the process.
Wmii and awesome are, from what I've heard, pretty good.
You can try out nginx, or play around with iptables, or ...
I personally can get by with msysgit, which is a fork of msys, which is a fork of cygwin.
Given it doesn't have a package manager... but is enough unix for me on windows... depending on what you really want/need.
Boxes are cheap, especially something to run Linux on.
You can drag and drop between your windows environment and Linux.
You can always network the filesystem so you can use whatever on your Win box to edit, but when you run the code, you are actually running in a Linux environment, no games, no compromises.
Depending on what exactly you need I'd say one of those.
I'm not sure if there's a binary incompatibility  with mingw and msysgit, but in theory they should work together so I would go with that.
Once you've taken the plunge (please return it by Tuesday) you'll find that Linux is far more interesting as a server environment.
I'm running Ubuntu and OpenSUSE on top of my Windows XP.
it's unfortunate that I've noted incompatibilities between msys and msysgit.
(edit) Forgot about Fluxbox, there's an intro to using it on Ubuntu here.
I have a wimpy little garage server that has only 256MB on it and it runs Ubuntu 9.04 server just fine.
You could stick with Ubuntu in a VM (keep the benefits of broad community support etc.)
and try a less demanding windowing environment than Gnome or KDE.
The point is, just get a separate Linux box and all of the problems are "solved."
