Lots of good advice, but none of it (would have) helped me!
Unfortunately I still was not able to boot from the USB.
The helpful folks in the #ubuntu /freenode IRC channel informed me that you do not need a special image secure-linux-12.10-anyfoo.iso as the Ubuntu guide instructs, just use an up-to-date 12.10 amd64 image and it will have included EFI booting support.
For me, after all this, it happily showed up in either F9 or ESC menu for alternate booting.
Just in case you run into more trouble while trying to install Windows onto your GPT SSD - this post might be very helpful: http://www.hodgin.ca/2012/10/02/creating-a-uefibios-windows-7-usb-and-installing-to-gpt-partitions/
(Once it appeared in F9 menu, only after I had removed it during boot.)

I switched to a 2GB "24x" PNY Attache I had lying around, with no embedded U3 partition, and it showed up immediately when I had any EFI-supporting image copied to it.
I was using a U3 16GB stick that never had problems booting on any BIOS-based computer, and I could never get it to show up reliably in the boot menu.
Finally I was able to boot Ubuntu using a DVD media with the same image written to it.
I just went through the same pain... but I found a workaround.
If that does not help, you might need a more recent firmware version.
I just had this same problem with exactly the same symptoms on an ASUS K56CA that I unboxed yesterday, and boy I am glad I did not come to this thread first.
(Grub would load, but no love after selecting any choice from the boot menu.)
