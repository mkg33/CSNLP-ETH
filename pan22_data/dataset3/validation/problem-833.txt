We can get rid of the colors in any number of ways, for example attach to each red a vertex a very long path which will force any isomorphism between two such graphs to match vertex colors.
Informally, hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which an edge can join any number of vertices.
An example of hyper-graph is given below and for example edge $e_3$ is a subset contain $v_3,v_5,v_6$ and similarly for other edges.
Bounded uniformity In this case, you can represent each hypergraph with a colored bipartite graph which has vertices on one side (colored blue) and hyperedges on the other side (colored red).
Given a graph $G$, create a bounded degree hypergraph whose vertices are the edges of $G$ and whose hyperedges correspond to vertices of $G$; a hyperedge contains a vertex if the corresponding vertex of $G$ belongs to the corresponding edge of $G$.
It depends on whether the uniformity of your hypergraphs is bounded.
Unbounded uniformity In this case the problem is GI-complete.
Two hyper graphs $G(V,E)$ and $H(V,E')$ are isomorphic if there is a permutation $g$ on $V$ such that,  $\forall $ $e \in E$, $$e\in E \iff g(e) \in E'$$
These graphs have bounded degree, and so GI for this class of graphs is in P.

Question : Is Isomorphism of bounded degree hyper-graphs in P ?
A vertex and a hyperedge are connected if the hyperedge connects the vertex.
A hyper graph G=(V,E) is a two tuple, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is a set contain subsets of the vertex set of $V$.
Two graphs are isomorphic if and only if the corresponding hypergraphs are isomorphic (this requires some argument but seems correct).
Let me define the degree of a vertex in a hyper-graph:
