then you can recurse or iterate over them as you like.
I need to do this so I can record each item's properties in SVN metadata.
For instance, I want to get it's permissions, its SID, its time of creation, its time of modification, the time it was last accessed, its attributes, and pretty much anything else that is displayed in the 'Properties' dialog box in Windows Explorer.
I've been searching far and wide for explicit information on this, but I have not found any at all.
Here are the properties available from the object:
Using Windows PowerShell (I am using 3.0), how can I get all of the metadata associated with $Item that is not stored in its contents?
now, I'm not sure what you mean by recursive, since you said you didn't want the contents of the directory, but you can get a list of sub items using .GetFiles or .GetDirectories.
Let's say I have a a file or a directory stored in the variable $Item.

The security permissions are not stored in the file, so you have to use the Get-Acl cmdlet:
you can get most of those elements from the System.IO.DirectoryInfo class
