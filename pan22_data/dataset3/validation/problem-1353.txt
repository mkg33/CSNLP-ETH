There are guides for setting up a mysql server there, and you may want to add a web server to host phpmyadmin.
For a basic configuration tutorial, read the Basic Configuration Readme: http://www.postfix.org/BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README.html
Look at the server guides at http://help.ubuntu.com to get started.
"Setting up the DB" is probably something too specific to be covered in detail in any tutorial.
In any case, the MySQL Readem here http://www.postfix.org/MYSQL_README.html is going to be of great help to you.
The official postfix web site has extensive documentation.
Generally, you set up your mail server to match the DB, not the other way around, because the assumption is that you already have your user accounts (or other relevant info) in your database.
Most likely, just installing postfix-mysql and answering the questions will be enough to get you started with the email server side of things.
The postfix section does not talk about using postfix with mysql, but reading it may still be helpful.
This web site is very usefull for install, configuration, use of most program you might need on a linux server!
