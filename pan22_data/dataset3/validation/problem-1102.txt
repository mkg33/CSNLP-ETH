Keep in mind that Windows’ 32 GiB limitation with FAT32 is purely a design decision.
It formats partitions of any technically acceptable size as FAT32, meaning up to 232-1 blocks.
It came preloaded with some software that I don't want:
That will totally wipe the drive and anything that was on it including the partitions and file system.
But is there a more rigorous way to erase everything on the drive?
It can also do a lot of other things, but that’s not relevant here.
FAT32 is a 20+ year old filesystem, which the drive was most likely formatted as to offer compatibility to non-Windows systems.
Afterwards, you can exit diskpart and the command prompt and go to the diskmgmt tool in Windows (it can be found in the search bar) and right click your flash drive, select New Simple Volume, choose NTFS as the file system, and set it up.
NTFS is a much better filesystem that supports more features, faster speed, and higher security.
This will prevent the formatting issue in the future.
Unless you have a need to keep a FAT32 filesystem, which I highly doubt, format the drive as NTFS.
I want to ensure that the preloaded software is completely gone from the drive.
However, Windows will not format a drive larger than 32 GB in FAT32, so formatting the drive to erase the software isn't an option for me.
The easiest way to do this is with the diskpart utility.
Obviously, one way to do it (at least in Windows 7) is:
How can I delete everything on the flash drive without actually formatting it?
