It's possible that the ports weren't added to the bridge (see above).
You need to explicitly tell the bridge which ports it manages:
(Also, dear gods why do people think they need to set the broadcast addresss.
But it's possible that the bridge is still in "learning" mode; it still defaults to 30 seconds – check using brctl showstp br0.
No, a pure bridge only works at Ethernet level – it doesn't even look at the IP header.
It's possible that the port interfaces themselves are still down.
However, you haven't said anything about actually adding the tap interfaces as bridge ports.
It's almost never useful to configure the broadcast address manually, it just becomes easier to accidentally get it wrong.)
Yes, you need ebtables to filter traffic; it does not go through the IP firewall.
When you assign an IP address to br0, you're really assigning it to the host OS, which is connected to that bridge.
The Untangle firewall, for example, seems to work in a cross-breed router/bridge mode, which is somewhat confusing.)
Really, the OS can already calculate it from IP | ~netmask.
