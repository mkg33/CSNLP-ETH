802.11g is from 2003, and it isn't any faster than 802.11a from 2002.
You should consider upgrading your Wi-Fi gear rather than suffering along on nearly decade-old tech.
Other than that, you could spend a lot of effort squeezing another 10% out of it by using more efficient protocols, moving your devices closer to your AP, choosing a channel with less interference, etc.
Given real-world RF conditions (less than ideal signal and noise), and if both your machines are wireless (causing the bandwidth to be halved as Chris Nava mentioned), then the roughly 8 mbit/sec throughput you're seeing is about what one would expect out of a property functioning b/g network.
Since late 2009 we've had 802.11n 3x3 MIMO (3 spacial streams) systems, with 40MHz-wide channels, capable of signaling rates up to 450mbps.
The best I've ever seen for pure TCP throughput over 802.11g is maybe 30 mbits/sec in an ideal RF environment (strong signal, no interference), and that was with a client and AP using chipsets from the same vendor, allowing them to do frame bursting tricks to maximize throughput.
The biggest win available to you would be to wire in one of your machines via Ethernet, for an instant roughly doubling of your throughput.
The other endpoint of the TCP connection was a wired Ethernet machine cabled into a LAN port on the AP.
The best consumer APs are usually simultaneous dual-band now as well, so you can leave older gear and smartphones and things to stay on 2.4GHz where they have to compete with Bluetooth and wireless game controllers and microwave ovens and baby monitors and webcams and everything else, and you can move your important laptops and desktops to the less congested 5GHz band, improving throughput for the most throughput-intensive applications.
