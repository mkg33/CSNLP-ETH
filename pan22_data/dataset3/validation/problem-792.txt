Because I have a boss that seeks impossible things to ask for, he wants to be able to see the people in the distribution groups.
I was thinking maybe a PowerShell script that deletes the distribution group and then recreates it based on who's in an OU.
Then you can create workflows who enters or leaves the company whom wil be added/removed to the defined groups.
A question I posted a little bit ago confirmed that you cannot expand a dynamic distribution group.
I think you need a identity management solution for this.
And specific to you question: Introduction to Distribution Group Management
Someone has to have had this [insert harsh word here] request before, can you help me out?
Or is there a way that I can keep the dynamic distribution group and then create a standard distribution group from that every time someone gets hired/fired?
Have you taken a look what Forefront Identity Manager 2010 can you do for you?
I want the low maintenance of a dynamic distribution group, but I also want to satisfy my boss' [insert harsh word here] request.
I know that title may sound pretty dumb but I'm not looking for "create a dynamic distribution group!"
