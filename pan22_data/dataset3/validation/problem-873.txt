Start Outlook and you will be prompted for your credentials.
The value you want is PromptForCredentials, and it is seemingly stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\Security, according to this forum post.
To force Outlook to login once, which is what I needed:
So you may have to test both keys to find out which one it really is.
I'm not sure if either of these correlates to the setting you have in mind, but I believe the templates are always a good start :)
Regardless, since you want to always prompt for credentials, you would set PromptForCredentials to one (1).
If this works, you can then look for a way of setting this for all users on the server (I don't have an Exchange server to play with).
I believe this can be set for one account on the Exchange server itself via the Security option of "Always prompt for username and password".
Go to Start -> Control Panel-> Credentials manager -> Generic Credentials-> There will be few entries, select each and select option 'Remove from Vault'.
However, this Microsoft KB article and another answer in the above forum post suggest it should be in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\Security.
(Note the addition of the Policies key under Software.)
