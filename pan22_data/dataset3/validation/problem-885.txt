A host with the RDSH role installed will not behave all that differently than one without - at least in this respect.
It is most likely due to the registry entries for the old profiles.
Leaving "old" profiles in the C:\Users directory and setting new profiles to be created in D:\Users would work quite fine.
If you have deleted the storage directory but have left the corresponding key/value in ProfileList in place, you will see profile loading errors in the event log and have users logged on with a temporary profile.
If it is present, the profile storage directory is determined by looking up the ProfileImagePath value inside this key.
You can modify that to the correct location and it should work as expected.
You should see a registry entry for ProfileImagePath.
When the User Profile service is about to load a user's local profile, it first checks HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList for a key named after the logging-on-user's SID.
After you have changed the default storage directory, you will not necessarily have to touch all profiles already present on your system and move them over.
If you currently logged in as one of the users having the issue you will need to logout and back in.
