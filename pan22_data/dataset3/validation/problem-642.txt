I'm trying to get into my 2k8 DC, which is hanging on applying policy settings, but thats a DNS issue that I can fix once getting into safemode.
My guess (based on what you're telling me) is that you have a hardware (or at least a file system) issue.
Server is controlled via a KVM switch if that makes any difference.
If that doesn't help I'd say next test the hard drives by using the manufacturer's diagnostics, and if that comes up clean then start testing the memory using Memtest86+ (for a day or more, we usually aim for 72+ hours of continuous memory tests before we claim it's 'OK').
Use that to run a CHKDSK and see if it thinks anything is up with the file system.
It'll give you three options including Command Prompt.
Thinking that it's going to time things out with no network faster than it will otherwise.
Rebooted in safemode both without and with networking, got to the login screen and it just restarts itself.
If you unplug it from the network does it boot normally (ie- not safe mode) any faster?
If it says there is, then you'll want to rerun CHKDSK with the repair option(s) switched on (usually /F, might be different in the 2008 repair console you'll be going into via the DVD, so do a chkdsk /?
Boot from the Server 2008 install disk and use the “Repair your computer” option.
