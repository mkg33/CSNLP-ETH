The domain controllers are both physical servers (no virtualisation).
The company suffers a disaster (a fire or flood) that damages their servers beyond repair.
This is hypothetical question, but one I’m sure that someone must have encountered and/or given some thought to before.
Consider this, a small business is running an Active Directory domain and has two domain controllers which are located in their office.
Unless a small business has the ability to host one domain controller offsite (to safeguard against a potential disaster that damages all the servers at their office) then at least one of their domain controllers must be virtualised in order to make the restore process hardware agnostic (thus not requiring them to buy the exact same model of server).
This presents them with a problem because Active Directory is backed-up as part of the ‘system state’ which means it’s tightly coupled to the original hardware.
The company would like to rebuild their domain controllers using the backups however they cannot get hold of the same make and model of servers (because they’re a few years old).
A system state backup of the domain controllers is run every day.
