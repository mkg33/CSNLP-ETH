When I'm sitting at my PC in the office, I can share my office PC's screen with another developer using UltraVNC Server.
We currently have 4 developers, all of whom are UK-based, but we're located in different parts of the country and we all work from home most of the time.
So far, we haven't had a great deal of luck getting this working.
Both developers need to be able to see the full desktop, but we also need to be able to easily toggle which developer has keyboard/mouse control.
There are quite a few different remote access and desktop sharing products, and it's occurred to me that it could take a very long time to try all the possible permutations.
Our new requirement is that we'd like to try pair programming, which means 2 developers need to be able to access a single machine at the same time.
However, if I'm at home and connecting via GoToMyPC, the other developer can see my office PC's desktop but cannot control the keyboard or mouse (even if the "View only" option is disabled in UltraVNC Viewer).
If so, what product(s) and/or service(s) did you use?
However, if I'm at home and connecting via LogMeIn, I can't share the desktop of my office PC with anyone.
I thought LogMeIn might solve our problem, as it has a desktop sharing feature built in.
They get an error saying that there's already an active session, or something like that.
I work for a small software company in London, England.
This diagram might help to illustrate the configuration I'm talking about:
Every developer has a high-performance Windows workstation that lives in the London office, and we access these remotely using GoToMyPC.
Hence the question: has anyone managed to get this kind of setup working?
The other developer can take over keyboard and mouse control at will.
The desktop sharing feature only seems to work if I'm physically sitting at the host PC.
