Until you determine this, worrying about cat5e vs cat6 and other hardware related decisions is pointless.
Are you wiring the whole building (probably worth the effort, if you're already in the attic)?
I just have one thing to add on the patch panel, and that is you especially don't need one if you're planning on having everything patched.
If you want to use this network as a learning tool, spending the time to make it truly reconfigurable (e.g.
On the other hand, it's also possible to use your LAN for filesharing among local computers.
I personally just got creative with a shelf and some zip ties.
Since everyone else here has done an excellent job on the technical aspect, I'll speak to planning aspect of this:
I mounted the shelf pretty high up in the laundry room so you can't see the cables at all.
The most important thing is what you want to do with the network.
I would just terminate with RJ45 and hook it up to the switch.
Now if you're going to need to change out what's patched where on occasion, then a patch panel can be a time saver.
CAT6 will show no improvement, and will cost you more.
Cat6 means you are not wiring the system again in a couple of years.
Those who say stay with Cat5e are probably the same ones who said you would not need anything more than MS-DOS to run your computer.
Alternatively, you could just give each building section it's own switch.
Is it going to be used exclusively for Internet access?
If it has multiple tenants, it might be worth considering using VirtualLans to segregate the various networks apart.
It's not as clean, but it'll work and save you time/labor if you really want.
Again, VirtualLans are powerful, and worth learning about if you're interested in networking, but not really worth the bother if pure utilitarian functionality is your goal.
I think they are overkill for a home project, and just considerably add to the cost.
You don't need a patch panel, you can terminate one end with an RJ-45 connector and plug it right into the switch and you can terminate the other end into a wall plate.
You still want to label the ends in case of a fault, but if everything's always patched than there's really no need.
Basically, what I'm saying is that the expected usage of the network is (or should be) a critical factor in determining what and how it's laid-out and configured.
If so, your needs are fairly relaxed, and worrying about switching topologies is unnecessary.
I would personally stick with CAT5e for home wiring.
In that case, having a fast local network becomes quite important, particularly if you invest in a centralized file server that uses some RAID variety.
