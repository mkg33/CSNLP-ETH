One suggestion could be to encrypt the volume with a encryption key only (no passphrase), but keep the key always encrypted on laptops/workstations with EFS (Windows only), so that in reality both the users password (optionally backup agent key) and the encryption key is used by Truecrypt.
The iso contains the key encrypted with the generic password during the initial install.
This gives us the option to reset the encryption passphrase, or to decrypt a laptop is a user is unavailable.
Using Truecrypt in a corporate environment can be challenge.
If a restore is ever necessary, we burn the rescue CD, have the user boot from the iso, enter the generic password, and then have the option to decrypt the hard drive, or replace the key with the original key.
You should specify your OS, but why not keep all the keys backed up somewhere secure?
This way, access to the encrypted devices will be "transparent" to the users, and you can manage passwords, EFS backup keys etc centrally without having to worry about lost keys etc
Also, I would use a passphrase in combination with the key if you are not already, if the key is on something like a thumbdrive, chances are they might lose that with the laptop (ie, they are in the same bag), making the encryption pretty much useless in the first place.
The user can easily change their passphrase on the laptop, which does not change the actual key used to encrypt the hard drive, which is stored on the isos encoded with the generic password.
This directory is regularly backed up to a central server for our laptop users.
Our strategy was to script the install to enter a generic password, and save the rescue iso for truecrypt to the user's "My Documents" directory.
