Have each user logon or SSH to the Linux instance assigned to their role or user access.
Great question-and depending on the person answering, you will probably have a couple of routes to go.
Just make sure to lock down security group, only grant access to specific users on the Linux box.
API keys and access are now inherited from the instance IAM role itself-making the need for storing user keys irrelevant.
Or only allow access based on a tag or subnet for a developer, etc.
Configure security group for each instance to only allow either specific subnets or individual IPs, so you can lock down traffic ingress to SSH.
We have been using this method for about a year now-with additional security tweaks, like leased access time, bought into AWS HSM and it works great.
Launch ec2 Linux instance(s) using specific IAM roles.
https://github.com/realestate-com-au/credulous may be worth investigating.
The user should be able to write scripts using the AWS API/use the API tools functionality as normal.
Set a custom user/password for SSH or join to domain.

Launch an instance for either each specific role or user (adjust instance size/type according to need, budget, etc)
