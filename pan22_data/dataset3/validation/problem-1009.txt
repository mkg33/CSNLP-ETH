A long time to publication is frustrating, but also ultimately irrelevant; this is only an issue of latency, not throughput.
Of course, once you know potential journal candidates, you decide on the basis of additional factors.
These include impact factor, number of issues per year and total number of articles published per year, etc.
And you've put a full version of your paper on the web, right?
If you are able to improve it, then you can publish it unless the improvement is really trivial.
Another factor I take into account is the average time from initial submission to actual publishing of the paper.
Finer distinctions between these categories are pointless.
If the problem is open, try to find a solution and if you come up with a clever one, then you can publish it.
There are crap papers in JACM, and there are groundbreaking papers in write-only journals.
Write a paper that you're proud of and that your target audience will be eager to read.
How to decide when you have enough research results to write a journal paper:
It is not a question related to how much material you have; rather it is strictly related to its quality.
People with the same scientific interests usually (with some exceptions) publish their results in the same set of journals.
Other metrics like the number of issues/articles per year, are utterly irrelevant.
Unfortunately, there are not official data available for this, and you will have to estimate this by yourself by downloading some papers and averaging this data.
See for instance this report from Informatics Europe which specifically warns against using ISI databases to measure the impact of computer scientists.
JCR is part of the ISI Science Citation Index family of databases, which is not especially reliable in its measurement of computer science impact.
Most importantly, you can then submit to conferences/journals to see what comments there are for you to make your experiment/algorithm better.
As soon as you have matching upper and lower bounds.
A big part of scientific research is about doing, trying, failing, and accepting.
However, that doesn't mean that you have to partition your work into least publishable units as you describe your coworkers doing, and it also doesn't mean that saving up multiple small results into a single paper is a good way of making your papers stronger.
(This requires knowing what your target audience cares about.)
In any case, if you want your papers to get attention from other computer scientists, publication in selective conferences is still the way to go.
In other words, stop worrying about how to play the game and just do good science.
FOCS/STOC/SODA) expect their authors to later turn the same material into an expanded and more polished journal paper, but the conference is to a large extent how to signal other researchers that your work is worth paying attention to.
If it has been already solved, find the current state of the art solution and try to improve it.
If you have a good paper that will be interesting to a large segment of some intellectual community, send it to a good journal.
In order to find the proper journal, you must know the relevant scientific community.
It's certainly possible to publish papers like that but to my mind the better ones are often the ones that have a single strong main result, perhaps with additional results on the side not to strengthen the paper but rather to provide more complete coverage of its subject.
I always try to balance impact factor with a decent number of articles published per year.
Meanwhile, you're already published your results in a good conference, right?
I'd advice to talk to your supervisor (if you have one)
Just write your papers (you will feel which area is weak and which area is not)
Then how do you define not enough research results for publication?
Who else could say they have enough research results until they see the word 'accepted' ?
SIGGRAPH) count as a journal directly (their proceedings are published as a special issue of a journal), others (e.g.
If you really have a once-in-a-lifetime breakthrough result, send it to an elite journal.
Ultimately, your work is not going to be judged on the venue in which it's published, but rather on the impact it has on the research community.
If you have some decent results that could be published somewhere but only a handful of people would care about, I suppose you could send it to a write-only journal, but why bother?
We can argue whether it should be, but that's what it is.
If you're not familiar with the conferences in the area, choosing one sponsored by ACM or IEEE over one that isn't is a good rule of thumb, as is choosing one that calls itself a "symposium" over one that calls itself a "workshop".
Otherwise, hunt for a set of papers dealing with a topic close to the one you are investigating, and discover where they have been published.
