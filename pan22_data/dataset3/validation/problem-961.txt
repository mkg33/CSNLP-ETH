What's the best way of keeping a PGP private key file generated by GnuPG?
Needless to say, that if everything fails, you could still sit down and type the key in (bit I doubt that this will ever be the case).
Although others recommend to use different software, you cannot be sure that it will still be available in eg 20 years.
Use your favorite encryption software, or just leave it alone on your desktop somewhere or anywhere you want on your computer (assuming physical access to your computer is secured, there is little/no chance that someone will be able to get the key).
Personally, I would back up my key across any/all computers I own and for good measure put a labeled CD or flash drive somewhere safe.
Where/how best to protect and store the private key file?
Plain text simply means: no need for some special software.
Call me paranoid, but your PGP key is your signature.
Still, you do not have to type it back in, since there is a vast variety of (free) text-recognition software available and will most probably always be.
I hate to remind you of the simple, but with your PGP key I "am" you.
If you go for storing your private keys online to some untrusted location, encrypt the keys themselves, also consider an additional level of protection like steganography (hide the keys in some media files like images).
Seeing as this is a security question, I would be very hesitant to entrust my private key to Google or any other major cloud service.
However, you can benefit from the fact that the key is present in plain text: Print it out and store it in a safe place.
I will just store my public key online, in Gmail, on many of my computers.
