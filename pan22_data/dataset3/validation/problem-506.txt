Minimizing install mistakes is a huge priority when you are on a time budget.
One non-techncial reason to install fiber over copper for switch uplinks and the like, ignoring costs, etc:  People are more afraid to touch a fiber cable compared to copper, so you'll get less of the "Oops, I didn't realize that was the uplink".
No one seems to have mentioned that with Fibre - you have the future option for DWDM.
Cost factor i think is everything when trying to choose.
If speed and long distance coverage is essential in your network design and implementation  Optical Fiber cable is your best suite
I use a mix of both in central offices (usually multi-mode), and the primary reason I choose fiber over copper is that fiber patches are pre-built and it's much harder for a technician to make mistakes on the install.
If you ever feel that you are going to run FCoE over the medium then it is better to run fibre than copper as the BER for copper is significantly higher and most of the time will be outside of the tolerance for the 'lossless' nature of FCoe.
When you have techs building cables, you are adding a lot of potential for human error.
However, I guess if you're debating between fibre & copper on a run - DWDM would probably be your last thought as if you really needed additional bandwidth you'd just run another cable (since the run would be short enough)
But over LONG runs & links - DWDM allows you to future-proof your fibre investment if you have the correct hardware.
