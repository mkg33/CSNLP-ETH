There is nothing to debug in the application in Visual Studio, because it never starts there.
I have a ASP.NET web application and a SQL Server 2014 database installed on the same computer.
I also have a connection string with integrated security:
Create a new app pool with applicable settings and then set the app to use it and see if that makes any difference.
Then accessing the website gives me the 503 and the application pool is stopped.
Suddenly I started getting a error 503 when attempting to access the website on IIS:
I connect to the sql database using my regular windows account.
Run a Wireshark or a TCP/IP sniff of equivalence on the machine see if there are any packets of relevance indicating what the issue may be.
Whenever I access any of the web applications attached to this application pool, the pool immediately crashes (I say crashes, but it just stops running).
Inspecting the application pool in IIS, I noticed that it's not started:
There is no active directory or domain on the network or anything:
Over the last hours, nothing I've tried enables the application pool to keep running.
I've tried to change my windows account password and updating this in the application pool, but I still get the same issue.
I've got the site running in IIS while I'm working on it:
I've been developing with Visual Studio on a Windows 10 PC for the last year.
How can I effectively debug the app pool in order to figure out why it keeps crashing?
