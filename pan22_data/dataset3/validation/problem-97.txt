Would decommissioning the Exchange server remove AD attributes from objects
I've wrote a few post recently regarding my troubles with Hybrid Exchange and a SPLA licence :@
What implications would we have if we just turned off the exchange server
If instead DirSync can go and you can manage Office 365 users separately from AD users, then by all means go and remove your hybrid deployment and DirSync; things will get a lot easier.
That said, you should absolutely maintain at least a single Exchange server on prem in hybrid mode for the management console, otherwise managing things like dynamic DLs is a real pain.
If you need DirSync to stay in place, then all Exchange-related attributes can't be managed in Exchange Online, and need to be managed in your local AD and then synced; doing this without an on-premises Exchange server is a royal pain, as it involves directly editing AD attributes (such as proxyaddresses) and object permissions; thus, you should keep at least one on-premises Exchange server, and the whole hybrid setup.
Now that all mailboxes have migrated to 365, is there any reason why we need to keep the hybrid connection?
Here you'll find the official documentation about how and when to decommission your on-premises Exchange servers.
If you have any other suggestions, please tell me.
Change the license on the current Exchange server if possible
We currently pay our provider monthly via SPLA for this server that is basically used to manage AD properties and can't see how the cost justifies itself.
Do we need to re-run the hybrid wizard (we don't need to move any more mailboxes)
However, this doesn't mean you have to allocate lots of hardware resources or buy Exchange CALs, because you wouldn't be actually hosting any mailbox there: just go with a single Standard-edition Exchange server with no CALs and you'll be fine.
Could anybody advice if any of the below scenarios are do-able:
If you're simply using it for management and not transport or mailboxes, this is included at no cost with your Office 365 subscription.
