On my machine it was a little confusing to get to it but until the "Next" button disappears you're not at the end of the list.
When you installed Service Pack 3, it may have created a System Restore Point.
On my (virtual) machine there is a specific entry for "Windows XP Service Pack 3 (KB936929)"
The date should be indicated next to the "Windows XP Service Pack 3" entry.
The easiest way to tell when SP3 was actually installed is to go to the Windows Update site.
For XP, no such thing exists, so you might want to look at some third party tools.
Well, Vista (and, I assume, Windows 7) have a nice happy interface that tells you all that information.
Keep in mind that there have been like 50 updates since SP3 so you may have to go back a while... Just keep clicking the "Next" button until SP3 is in the list.
There is a piece of freeware caled WinUpdatesList that might solve your problems.
Have a look for one in Start > Accessories > System Tools > System Restore
On the left hand side there will be an item "Review your update history"  Click that and you will get a definitive list of what updates were installed and on what day.
