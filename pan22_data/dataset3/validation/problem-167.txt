Or if you really just need a speed reduction, kick the port into half-duplex.
Vista/Server2008 does have a network throttling mechanism included that is used when there is multimedia playing on the computer.
Generally, however, this is easier to do through your switch and traffic shaping tools.
However, this is only per user, if you have a system that runs all of it's apps as something besides administrator, YMMV.
If you can't throttle at the driver/switch level, you can probably utilize this as a workaround.
I have a Windows 2008 server that needs to have the network card traffic capped at 1 or 2 megabits.
Ummm, why would you want to restrict the network traffic?
This type of setting I believe would have to be done at the switch level.
If you want a very flexible system, you might want to see if a VTun-like system for the TUN/TAP driver (which is available for Windows) exists for Win32 systems - but beware, messing with the TUN/TAP devices can be, well, messy.
You could do it at the user level through group policy -> Network -> Limit Reservable Bandwidth and tuning it up to X% [10mbs would yield 80% reserved, 100mbps would be 98%].
Does anyone know if this can be accomplished by the Network card settings, registry trickery, or open-source/freeware applications?
If not what you can do is set your NIC to 10 Mbps half/full if you want to do that sort of thing on the server-side.
