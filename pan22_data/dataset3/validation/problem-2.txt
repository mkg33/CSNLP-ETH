Remove the Day column and combine the Date and Time data into a single column (I just used simple addition and formatted accordingly), and skip the H/L column, because you can see if it's high or low:
I need to recreate the sinusoid shown on the website while showing the chart in a concise order.
But if you format the line to be smoothed (and remove the markers), it looks like a sine wave (bottom chart).

The only way I thought of doing that is by putting time and the date together for the X-axis as I don't want the points of one day to interfere with another.
I have the data of every day and time of the low and high tides from
Select these two columns and create an XY Scatter Chart (not a line chart).
Excel only plots the high and low points of the tides (the markers in the top chart below), not the whole sinusoid curve.
