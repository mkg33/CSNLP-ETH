I'm willing to switch services to a more powerful/fast VPN service, but as I don't need the features of a VPN, this is merely a quick & dirty way of getting what I want (and at this point, I'm invested enough I'd like to know what I'm missing).
I've configured my linode with a Squid proxy, and the PS4 was able to connect with it's native support, but voice service was still unavailable (received an error about NAT restrictions).
I'm currently using a small ISP that caters to small business and apartment complexes (provided by the complex, only alternative would be $60/month, with a data cap & slower speeds).
I've also looked into using iptables on my DDWRT router to redirect the traffic on a different port (ones the ISP hasn't blocked) to my linode, where I would send the traffic on after redirecting it to the original port.
From what I understand, it will proxy web traffic, but does it do anything else (traffic sent through other ports)?
Due to this, when testing the internet connection, the PS4 would classify the NAT as type 3.
Per the Sony Network Support Site for the PS4, the following ports are required (haven't confirmed if these are only required ports).
After a few hours of debugging and a couple phone calls I was able to confirm that the ISP blocks the ports used by the PS4 for voice chat, and is unwilling to open them.
I'm currently using a VPN connection from my router to allow the full use of my ps4, but it's slow, with high ping times.
Currently unable to use the voice chat feature for parties on the PS4.
