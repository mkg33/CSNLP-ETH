Probably because yum has previously been shutdown uncleanly it's left behind
Two yum processes can't hold the lock at once, or else you'd get corrupt yum metadata and potentially a corrupt RPM database.
Or, perhaps you have something like yum-cron enabled, causing it to periodically be run automatically.
Due to the poise of the question I'd say it may be likely OP, that you have an update window open or may have the package manager open while trying to run yum via shell.
I've manually killed each yum process id, but it keeps on occurring (other application is: yum), although the days ago become more recent (used to be 3 days ago, then 1 day ago)..
In my experience this can cause the error you have specified, when it is trying to check for and install updates in the background as you are attempting to use yum from the command line.
When trying to run yum, I get the following error:
Another app is currently holding the yum lock; waiting for it to exit...
Do you have yum-updatesd set to run on system startup?
If you or another admin leave yum running in another session, you'll get this error.
