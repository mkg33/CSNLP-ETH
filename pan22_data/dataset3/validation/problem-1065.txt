Does anyone know of a bash or similar script that will pull stats from a Linux server and display them on a centralized web page or send a report via email every "x" hours?
Both projects have been around for years and will remain for years to come.
I use NRPE to monitor everything in your requirements list but the CentOS failed logins; for this I use OSSEC.
Either by pulling the values via snmp or with ab agent that will collect that data.
It will take some time to learn these two tools but I believe it will be time well spent.
NRPE is essentially an agent running on the machine you want to monitor; from the Nagios monitoring system you issue commands to the NRPE process on the monitored system and feedback is presented thorugh the Nagios web interface.
This tool is an agent/server based architecture that can monitor your Windows or Linux systems for a variety security related events, to include failed logins.
Have you tried the free server monitoring in New Relic ?
Gmetric provides a quick interface to graph arbitrary metrics as well.
- IPs attempting login (failures from secure log on my CentOS boxes)
I'd like to pull the reports to a central server and display them on a web page but having the reports emailed on a timed basis would be better than nothing.
Nagios is an open source project that should do 90% of what you're looking for in your list of requirements.
OSSEC is an open source project that I would consider for watching your secure log on the CentOS machines.
I've found services that offer something close but they are cost prohibitive and missing some of the stats I'd want and some functions just don't work, etc.
Like most monitoring tools Nagios uses ICMP and SNMP to monitor remote systems, however, it also has an add-on called the Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE).
- TX and RX for a given time period (year to date, month, week and day)
The functionality goes beyond log monitoring though, check out the file and registry integrity checking, anomaly detection, reporting and active response.
