You can refer to Semi-flower automata, as their paper puts it: "A semi-ﬂower automaton (SFA) is a trim automaton with a unique initial state that is equal to a unique ﬁnal
Recall that a submonoid $M$ of $A^*$ is right unitary if, for all $u, v \in M$, $u, uv \in M$ implies $v \in M$.
Your question is adding a further restriction that this state should be the initial state.
Ditto for languages recognized by non-deterministic automata having the same set of initial and accepting states.

This means that a 0-reversible language can have only one accepting state.
The class of reversible languages is interesting because it was one of the first families of languages with infinitely many strings that was learnable from positive examples only.
In the case of deterministic automata, the characterization is given in Proposition 3.2.5.
For unambiguous automata, the characterization follows from Theorem 4.2.2 and can be stated as follows:
state in which all the cycles shall pass through the initial-ﬁnal state".
This is a proper subset of the regular languages (since every such language contains the empty string), but how weak is it?
An important subclass of this family is a sub-class of 0-reversible languages.
The reversing operation is defined as swapping initial and final states, and inverting the edge relation of the DFA.
This question is solved for deterministic automata and for unambiguous automata in the book [1]
Your restriction does not define the 0-reversible languages because minimal DFA for those languages can have distinct initial and final states.

A language is 0-reversible if the reversal of the minimal DFA for the language is also deterministic.
What is known about the class of languages recognized by finite automata having the same initial and accepting state?
Angluin's paper provides an algebraic characterisation as well.
Finally, for nondeterministic automata, the characterization is simply that $L$ is a submonoid of $A^*$.
