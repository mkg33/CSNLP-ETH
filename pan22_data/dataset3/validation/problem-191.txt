I hate having one DC, it would make recovery more difficult and any downtime longer!
In fact, I'd probably rather run a Virtual Server than actually turning any other working server into a domain controller - even if it was just running on a workstation.
However, I'm running SBS 2003 at another (smaller) office and it functions well on a beefy server, although the reboot scheduling issue is sometimes annoying.
If you want to play it safe stand up a Linux server for free and use that as a network file share or print server and try to keep your Domain Server boxes as just that.
If you can't, beg, scream, whimper, bribe, threaten, prophesy, or whatever it takes to put yourself in a position where you can.
Others would have to be weighed carefully...and if possible, stick even a desktop/low end server in as a secondary DC/DNS only box if you must mix on the primary hardware.
The Domain controller holds the AD database so if you want to risk bogging that down with printing (and god forbid) file sharing then that's a risk you'll have to assess yourself.
SBS is physical, but I have a second server running VMware ESXi that has a Windows VM which is also a DC so I have a seconary (second DC is allowed with SBS as long as SBS holds FSMO roles).
They are poor choices for things like Terminal servers (Users do not have rights to log into a Domain Controller and giving them said rights grants requires Domain Admins), Web Application Servers, Line of Business App Servers, Firewall/Proxy/ISA servers, etc
All DCs are DNS servers, and two of them are DHCP servers (serving half of the range each).
I would generally run DNS and DHCP on Domain Controller(s), and have at least two DCs.
My personal opinion is that for stability you need a minimum of three domain controllers which allows you to split the operation master roles, and you should always have at least two global catalogues - but taking into account that the infrastucture master shouldn't be a GC.
Virtualization makes it easy (and depending on how you pay for Windows licensing, affordable) to have task-specific VMs, and I much prefer splitting things out as rebooting one server won't affect others.
If you can, give yourself the best chance of avoiding this by having dedicated DC roles.
I have about 40 branch offices and - for political reasons - a management decision was made to give each a full server infrastructure.
In my environments, I prefer to have all internal DNS Servers running on Domain Controllers as well as my DHCP services.
These are your most important servers, and if your AD goes funny you will have a horrible time getting it back right.
Although, most roles they perform are network infrastructure roles.
I would try and add only something like print and/or file serving to a DC if possible, in addition to DNS and DHCP.
If I had the choice of having just one Domain Controller, or running another DC say on an SQL box, then I would take that option.
For financial reasons it was a single-server environment in each, so it's all DC/File/Exchange (this was in the Windows 2000 days).
Theoretically you can have the whole shebang of services on same box (Small Business Server).
Personally, I have a virtual DC running on two of my virtual hosts (running VMware ESXi, three virtual hosts total) and one physical as well.
Just because you CAN do something, however, doesn't necessarily mean you should.
This seems to be a good mix of roles on the DCs to reduce cost and make the best use of the hardware possible.
Even non-redundant hardware is likely to be up if your primary is down and vice versa (whether it's for a reboot or a crash).
However, management of it is a nightmare, and my preferred rule is "a DC is a DC and nothing else goes on it".
