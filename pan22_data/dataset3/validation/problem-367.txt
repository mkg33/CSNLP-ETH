Usually configuration files from package has postfix .sample (e.g.
Configuration files may be in /etc/, /var/www, /opt, but they shouldn't be in /usr/, /sys/, ...
Automatic inverse renaming or leave it to the user to fix it himself?
Just rename the old config files to config_*.xml.160207 and translate their content to the new format at config_*.xml?
Note: A "user" is in this case the admin of the web app.
The "end user" would then be the real user of the app and it's configured content.
So the application needs read and write permissions on them.
Currently I'm writing a web application that uses (XML) config files that the user will be able to also edit them through the application (in a web interface) itself.
So he has all the power to change the config files.
(But not necessary much Linux know how and is often not root).
As I'm a programmer and not an admin I hope you can help me out:
(As the format of the config files might change slightly from version to version the update process might modify/update the config files as well)
And when the application package get's updated on the system it should, of course, use the preexisting config files that the older version was already using.
And user must copy it to config.xml and customize.
when a PPA is created for beta testers and the user want's to drop out from the beta test and revert to the stable versions) be handled?
If configuration files are in /etc, package manager will ask you what to do on update.
So where is the official (Debian) and the highly official (LSB/FHS) location for these files?
