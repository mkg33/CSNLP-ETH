Hopefully it will continue to work when I move networks again - will comment here if it doesn't.
I experienced this issue with a local Hyper-V instance on a Windows 10 client while working outside of the office network.
In our domain environment, all RDP connections go through an RD Broker.
My issue may be unique, but it's worth noting during the troubleshooting process of this console connection issue.
I had the same issue initially after I set up a VM yesterday, but got it going after some fiddling around.
Unfortunately I can't remember what I did that made the difference though!
I was able to resolve the issue by disabling the RD Proxy to our RD Broker within the registry.
Their state's are running and their status is empty.
However this morning, after connecting to a different network, it failed again.
Since I did not have access to the RD Broker, Hyper-V would try to communicate to the RD Broken then fail to connect to the VM's console.
You will have to go to the - Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services and there you will have to change the value to 0.
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services\UseProxy = 0
Also, if your computer and user account are governed by GPO, your registry tweak on "UseProxy" will probably be reverted.
By using the Connect to server, I am able to see all the virtual machines.
My eventual solution: I turned off the Hyper-V features in "Turn Windows features on or off", restarted, then turned them back on again and restarted again.
I have installed Hyper-V manager on Windows 10 pro and have connected to the server which is hosting all virtual machines.
