Not as a direct answer to the question, but more of an alternative approach.
If you decide not to bridge 2 wireless routers and are looking for another solution try using:
Some higher end wireless routers have support for dual radio setups where the users talk to the network in the G or N band and it talks to the back end network using the wireless A band.
Lower end wireless routers generally would require a direct Ethernet cable between devices for it to work properly.
They use a non web-based utility that's very responsive.
If the routers you had were compatible, some models support "bridge" mode which you can bridge each node together.
You are not going to have much luck trying to get one access point to associate wirelessly with another.
Getting the routing to work will be a bit challenging as well.
However, you would not have any wireless device connectivity because the wireless communications would be dedicated to the "bridge".
What you need is a wireless bridge/access point like this dlink 1522 although updating the firmware on a router seems fun if you have one that would work.
They're more pricey but I've had good experience and the connection is not nearly as flaky as some of the D-Link products I've used.
Apple's airport products, (Express and Extreme) support this out of the box via WDS (Wireless Distribution System).
With the higher end wireless routers it allows you to network all of the access points together into a single network.
There are several products, their price is still a tad high, but one benefit is that you're running the equivalent of a hard line across the house/office and avoid any configuration headaches.
