I'm not a great packet sniffer, so looking over Wireshark/Ethereal logs, I can only see whois and then standard queries to domain.
However, occasionally, and mostly on subdomains I get drop out.
Also, what appears to only happen on subdomains...
If so, you need to check your DNS server configuration.
Could be that queries still go sometimes to OLD nameservers.
And my carbon copy site works fine elsewhere, also pre-R53 loaded in normal speed.
This also can happen if you configured your machine with primary faulty/slow DNS server and secondary working/fast DNS server.
Nameserver addresses May be cached for some while by intermediate DNS resolvers.
If you get a quick response in this case and slow response in the previous case, this confirms that you have a DNS problem.
To confirm that this is a DNS related problem, you can define your subdomains in your machine hosts file (/etc/hosts under Linux and C:\Windows\system32\etc\hosts under Windows).
I've done live HTTP headers and monitored logs, nothing hits the box until it visibly begins loading.
Any advice or pointers in which to try and follow this problem up would be greatly appreciated.
So, you will not get the resolved name before timeout occurs waiting for the 1st server.
