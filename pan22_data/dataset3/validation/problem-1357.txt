I solved this problem in by installing the mysql-community-libs-compat package.
Additionally, we have packages for MySQL 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7, ready to install (mysql55, mysql56u, and mysql57u, respectively).
Postfix Version 2.6.6 (Installed with yum) MySQL Version 5.6.19 (Installed from source)
Could this be an issue with how my OS was installed?
Whats even stranger is that I have another server running the same OS (Installed from the same disk) and postfix starts just fine.
Could it be that my version of MySQL is too new for the postfix version?
(Using the postfix that came with CentOS, nothing has been installed on my other server).
Compiling from source is not something most people have time for, especially when you consider the ongoing maintenance cost to keep the source install updated and secure.
When you update to a newer version of MySQL, you still have to provide this library to satisfy the dependencies.
I have looked in my mail log and messages log and I see no errors regarding why it is not starting.
The reason you had problems is because postfix (and several other packages) compile against the libmysqlclient.so.16 library.
This problem is driving me crazy, any help would be much appreciated.
I am following this guide: http://www.krizna.com/centos/setup-mail-server-in-centos-6/ to install postfix MTA.
check what repositories you have already, at least i know that IUS and REMI have latest mysql packages and all dependencies.
I compiled the newest version of MySQL from source and it is working with apache, but I wasnt able to locate libmysqlclient.so.16, only libmysqlclient.so.18.
DISCLAIMER: I am new to CentOS, so please forgive me if I overlooked something simple.
I have followed all the steps but when I try to start the server (service postfix start) I get this error:
The IUS project has a package named mysqlclient16 that would solve this for you.
I recently just reformatted my server to CentOS 6.5 x64 and I have been having issues getting postfix to work.
having that little experience with linux/Centos etc, you must use yum installer, compiling MySQL server and installing other packages with yum - never do this again.
