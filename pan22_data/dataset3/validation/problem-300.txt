Now rorootusr will have root access but is solely a member of the group roroot and has readonly access to the system.
Make the permissions for the group bits to be r-- or 400 octal, then you can create a user account just like an ordinary user, for example, rorootusr, with the next id set to whatever it is on your system, make it a member of a group roroot only, do not make it to be part of wheel,bin,etc, depending on what your groups are on your installation.
It is the 3rd field (512) that you change it to 0.
Open the /etc/passwd file using vim/nano/emacs/joe/ whatever editor rocks your boat, and look for the id you have just created, ie.
There is a somewhat another way of creating this without using ACL's.
See the man pages for ACL, setfacl and getfacl if you're interested.
Reading from left to right separated by colons you have user name, password (encrypted + shadowed), user id, group id, comment, home directory and shell.
For backing up my server, I would like to remotely access it via SSH.
Firstly, create a group, for example, called roroot (readonly root).
You'd still need a script running as root that changes the permissions of every file.
To minimize all risks, it want to user a user who only has read access, but to all files, just like root.
