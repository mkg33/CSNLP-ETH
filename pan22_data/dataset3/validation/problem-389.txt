The permissions for the Home directory on the destination server was set to 775.
How much time elapses after the publickey packet is sent waiting for the reply when it fails?
From what I discovered, the Home directory permissions must be set to 755 or less.
I would start by checking the syslogs in /var/log on the server for any messages from sshd indicating why it rejected the authentication attempt.
On the remote server, become root and run /path/to/sshd -d -p 2222.
It will accept one connection, and it will print debugging information to your terminal.
I would try cranking the debug up to 11 on the server side and see what it is whining about.
For me, this was a permissions issue involving the Home directory as well.
This indicates the server didn't accept your private key.
If the login fails, check the debugging output printed by the server.
The server does not seem to be sending a reply here.
This will launch an instance of sshd which listens on port 2222.
Then, on the client, run ssh as normally but include -p 2222 to connect to the correct port.
You could also try testing with Userify, see if it works and that you have public key without errors.
Unfortunately, the server doesn't provide the client with any more detail about why it didn't accept the key, so you really need to troubleshoot this on the server.
Chown the root-created files (not just chmod) back to that original user account.
This sets it to where no user other than the owner of the home directory is allowed to have write permissions.
If you have root access on the remote server, you can run a debugging instance of sshd and then connect to it with a client.
