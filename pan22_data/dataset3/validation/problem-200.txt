I use a script on my Fedora/Amahi server to do this.
I've also seen this error on shutdown umount //proc/fs/nfsd: device is busy There are no nfs mounts in my fstab.
I've hunted the internet for information on fixes, and there are plenty of suggestions but no concrete answers.
I added nobootwait but it seems to make no difference (advice on a different forum)
(Its for a media centre type config, so everything should be automatic)
You could create a "service" that unmaps these during shutdown.
I have a handful of cifs entries in my /etc/fstab which are set to auto so that they mount on boot.
Running Ubuntu I've recently encountered an issue with shutting down the computer - it simply hangs whenever I shutdown, whether from the GUI or command line with sudo shutdown -hP now
Is there a better way to mount shares on the network that doesn't suffer from this problem?
The messages I see on shutdown seem to suggest that unattended-upgrades service is trying to use mountall after the network service has already come down, and failing to mount the network shares.
The last bit of output mentions starting then almost immediately stopping  an apache2 webserver for some reason.
It will need to be tweaked for Ubuntu, but the theory works.
When I change auto for noauto the system doesn't hang, but I want these mounts to be attempted on startup.
