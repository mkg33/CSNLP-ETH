Damage to the magnetic layer is most often caused by the head touching the surface of the platter, either through mechanical jarring of the drive or contaminates getting between the two.
Some data centers would have much higher rates of disk failure than others; it was usually traced to improper sealing of cement or concrete walls or floors.
I would like to know the common causes and how to prevent such incidence.
Modern drives are generally sealed better, but this can still be a factor
The majority of disk failure is due to either damage to the magnetic layer, wear or damage to the spindle bearings or failure of the electronics.
Damage to the electronics can be caused by power spikes of poorly regulated supplies but is most commonly simple device failure.
Damage to the spindle bearings is generally through simpe wear and tear, which normally takes quite a few years, of mechanical jarring.
A HD is basically a mechanical device that contains moving parts operating in fairly hostile conditions, so it's really not much different to any other such device.
