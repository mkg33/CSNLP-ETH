I use this for connecting from workgroup to domain.
Set the 'server name' to be the name of the computer and select Windows Authentication then this should log you on locally.
Seeing as how the SQL server is in a workgroup, it doesn't know your domain controllers exist, let alone how to validate your credentials.
Windows Authentication is just that, authenticating with a Window's login.
This can be achieved using runas and a local user on the SQL machine.
Seeing as how you're asking about your domain logon, that's clearly the second kind.
I hope my question is clear, what is want is to be able to logon to sql server using windows authentication from my client, but I am not able to add windows users in sql server because the server is not part of the domain and so cannot identify the domain users that I am trying to add.
However, if your only concern is using windows users to connect to the SQL server, not necessarily using your own credentials (IE you don't want to use SQL users).
So if you are dealing with a workgroup computer where you are on a domain it will not work, because that server can only authenticate a local account.
Is there any way that we can use windows authentication to logon to sql server without having to add the remote server to the domain.
There are two types of windows authentication, local and domain.
We have an SQL server instance running on a standalone server (not part of the organizations domain network).
If you are talking about connecting with SSMS, you can try the runas coomand through command prompt and use the "netonly" parameter.
When you try to authenticate to a domain logon, the local machine will go up the chain in its domain group, and ask for a domain controller to authenticate your credentials.
