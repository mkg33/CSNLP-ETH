However, I would hope you would have fixed those beforehand.
Obviously, if there are profile related errors associated with that user, you might end up transferring that as well.
Which parts of the user directory are safe plain data and which should not be copied?
I am going to set up a fresh install of Windows 10 (I'm getting a new CPU and using the opportunity to install Windows onto an SSD).
This means either you or the user will have to reconfigure those applications.
If you do not copy the hidden folders, like AppData, some program configuration data will not be moved to the new install.
I'd like to keep configuration files that some programs leave in there, but I'm afraid there may be other files that are specific to my current setup.
How much of my current Users/[username] directory will I be able to just copy?
The contents of the Documents, Downloads, Music and Videos directories should definitely be safe, but what about AppData?
(I will of course keep a backup, this question is just about dropping the files in the same location on the new install)
