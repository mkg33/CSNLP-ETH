The display manager itself is a system service managed via service or systemctl.
So are the windows, too – the general 'multiple windows' concept is part of the core X11 protocol, so you can still run apps in X11 without a window manager, but they'll be borderless and you won't be able to move or resize them.
(In Wayland, the window manager is the same process as the graphics server.
The manual approach is to run startx, which launches Xorg plus whatever clients were listed in the .xinitrc file (which could be a DE's session manager, or a plain old WM).
what would happen if some of these components went missing say i ran Firefox without a windows manager or desktop enviroment would it run full screen with out mouse?
So what keeps track of where the mouse is and other interactive activity?
a display) can be started, and usually to show a graphical login prompt as well.
Additionally, DEs also have a set of basic apps – file manager, terminal, text editor, system settings; things you'd see in Windows under "Accessories".
how do i completely start and stop a gui from terminal?
Additionally in most Wayland environments (and even some X11 environments like GNOME 3), window decorations are typically drawn by clients themselves, so the lines kinda blur.)
It describes a collection of components – among other things a DE includes:
(Xorg can be started completely manually but won't do anything useful; since it takes over the screen, you'd have to start the initial clients from elsewhere.)
There are two ways of starting the graphics server – through a display manager, or manually.
The default "no WM" focus mode is focus-follows-mouse.
Common display managers are GDM, LightDM, SDDM, KDM, Xdm – their main task is to automatically detect when a graphics server (i.e.
The mouse cursor is managed by the graphics server – clients receive input events, but do not need to draw the pointer on their own.
