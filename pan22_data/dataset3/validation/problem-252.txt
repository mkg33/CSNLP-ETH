If you have any advice about connecting to gpio pins or helpful links about it feel free to add them as a comment.
The buttons have tabs that accept crimp connectors, so that will be one end of the wire interface.
I am trying to up my pi skills on working with hardware.
I would like to connect a few buttons to my gpio pins.
I am imagining some sort of HAT thay would function like a bread board mounted on top of my pi.
This is my first time ever messing with the gpio pins or any type of hardware (other than usb peripherals) connecting to the pi.
Is there some sort of adaptor to go over the pins to make them female ports?
I have three questions I need answered to help make this decision:
I have seen various ways to do so and want to know the simplest non-permanant way.
I found some that might do it, but I think they were meant for connecting HATS.
Speaking of HATS, is there a HAT of some sort to make connecting the buttons easier?
Now I need to know my options for connecting the wires to the pins.
