I pulled half the ram, the extra graphics card, and an extra PCIe NIC - Win 10 works (well, lets not get carried away - start menu was back).
It turned out that functionality returned after removing a Nvidia NVS-310 dual display port graphics card.
A thorough process of trial and error eventually proved that the issue was somehow related to the graphics card.
I did several more tests trying to resolve this issue and ultimately started pulling out hardware.
Decided that perhaps the SSD had died so I found a painfully slow 5400 HDD and loaded windows onto that.
I checked the update status and there were none - update history was empty.
Unfortunately I have completely wiped my original OS and now face the challenge of reinstalling all the software I use on a daily basis.
For what it's worth I installed a fresh version of Win10 from a USB that was a few months old.
Thank you to everyone that chimed in to help, especially cybernard.
I thought it would be a good idea to disable updates and run the repair tool from Tweaking.com - surprisingly this crippled my system in the same way as Win 10 update did.
From there I created a new Win 10 install USB which was based on Build 1703.0 - on the fresh install everything worked, after update PC is crippled again.
