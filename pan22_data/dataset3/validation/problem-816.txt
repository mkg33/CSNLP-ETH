Because sometimes I'm unsure of spelling, or phrasing, and I like to get the help of the drop-down suggestions.
Why would I prefer plain google.com to do this, versus the about:home page, which also has the suggest-as-you-type behavior?
Why would I want to go to google.com and enter the search term there, rather than just append it to the smart keyword directly?
And you can change google.com if you want to use a different search engine.
Pressing ctrl-k used to take me to the plain vanilla version of Google's homepage.
From discussion on the Mozilla Support Forum, it appears that there is no way to make ctrl-k behave as it did in previous versions of Firefox; the logic is built in to the code.
Pressing ctrl-k did, and continues to, take you to the search window in the navigation toolbar.
The addon is called Keyboard Shortcut and you can download it here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keyboard-shortcut/
If you have customized your nav toolbar to remove the search window, as I have, then ctrl-k, which used to be hard-wired to jump to google.com, is now hard-wired to jump to about:home.
It can either replace the current tab or open a new tab.
Pressing ctrl-k now gets me to some sort of Firefox-branded wrapper around the Google search box.
Following the instructions at Mozilla Support's How to search IMDB, Wikipedia and more from the address bar, define g to point to the search window at google.com, and then instead of ctrl-k, do ctrl-l g.
Is there a way to change this new behavior back to the old behavior?
I came up with a workaround which may be of interest, so I'll repost it here.
(This is what I referred to above as "some sort of Firefox-branded wrapper ...")
I've written a simple addon that takes you to google.com when you press Ctrl-K in Firefox.
