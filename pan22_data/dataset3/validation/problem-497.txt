HD & tapes or HD & DVDs), store them in good conditions, and hope for the best...
Can you suggest a strategy for prolonging the life of the drive as long as possible?
The information I have is that the bearings in a drive can dry out if I leave the drive powered off for a long time.
I've had good results with HP's drives and with WD's RE drives, vs. having a lot of WD Caviar desktop drives fail over the years.
Hard drives are a reasonably cheap way to store a lot of data, and have other advantages.
To give a concrete idea, I am thinking something like: Put all the inactive drives in computer cases, and fire the systems up once a month (week?
In reality you can't win: Even traditional tape backups are subject to the tapes degrading with age, or the one and only drive that can read tape X finally dying.
I've heard that if I disconnect a hard drive and leave it on a shelf somewhere, I can expect them to degrade to unusability over the course of years.
Re: prolonging disk life, here are two equally valid yet totally contradictory schools of thought:
I haven't heard it from anywhere official or particularly authoritative.
About the only short-term advice I can give is to buy the most reliable drives you can afford.
What you mention above is a hybrid that I would consider to be the worst of both worlds: The drives are being spun up and run periodically (so they're getting mechanical wear), then being spun down and stored (giving them the opportunity to bind up and refuse to spin ever again).
There's Google's study, but that concerns lifetime of drives in use.
And then when the drive is turned back on, I guess the bearings would be frozen up and the drive is dead.
WORM media were supposed to last at least 50 years, but in order to read an old WORM disk now, you'd have a hard time finding a drive.
I'd phrase it as "there's no current technology that will let you store data for a long time with no intervention."
In addition to media degradation, when you're talking about long-term storage, you need to worry about technological obsolescence.
to give the drives some "exercise" and run checks for corruption.
If you want to be sure your data is safe, you'd better keep multiple copies, preferably on multiple media, and you'll have to periodically move the data to newer media.
Best advice I can give is have more than one archive (preferably in different formats - e.g.
Similarly if you have an old RLL drive, it might be fine, but you'll have trouble finding a controller to plug it into.
There's not a lot of definitive information about hard drive reliability.
I don't want to spread misinformation--I'm not sure if the above is the truth or not.
I don't think there is a silver bullet for long term storage, in my mind a solution would have several layers of redundancy (RAID, Hot Spare and/or Spare Parts) and be upgraded throughout its life to ensure the accessibility of the data.
The failure rates of hard drives may be much higher than other components in a PC or server, however I suspect the combined failure rates of all the components may in fact be higher than that of hard drives.
Enterprises go to great lengths to ensure that not only their tapes last for 10 years:
To add insult to potential injury I'm assuming the drives would need to be moved to and from storage (bumps shakes and jostles = more potential for failure).
And an actively used drive gives out in maybe 2-5 years.
Ideally, the drives provide a reliable "restore" for decades.
I am considering using them as backup media for long-term storage.
