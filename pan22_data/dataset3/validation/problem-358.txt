I have been searching far and wide for an automatic solution to sync files (pictures, music, docs, etc...) between the three when they are all on the same LAN.
Unison is also a very nice solution, but it would have required quite a bit of scripting (from my understanding) to get it to run automatically on Windows.
Works perfectly, but then you sync over the internet.
To better explain, when I get home and turn my MacBook on, I want it to sync automatically any file changes to Windows 7 and the netbook.
Likewise if I make changes on my Windows 7 box, I want them to be reflected on my Mac.
I have a MacBook Pro, a Windows 7 desktop, and a Fedora 13 netbook.
Biggest issue with Dropbox is that the free account is limited to 2GB by default.
Dropbox is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linus operating systems.
While Live Mesh does not have Linux support yet (I can live without it I guess), and the syncs seem a little slow, it does not require a sync to the cloud and offers the option for browser based remote desktop.
There are ways, via referral and social linking, to increase to a max of 10GB.
I can use rsync, but it is not automatic as far as I can tell, and I would use Dropbox but I have a lot more that 2 gigs and do not want to pay.
I went with Windows Live Mesh because it is automatic.
I wish a program would come out that would easily meet these requirements.
"Enable LAN Sync" is checked (turned on) by default in versions 1.0 and later.
