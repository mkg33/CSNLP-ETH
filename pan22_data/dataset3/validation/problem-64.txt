If you must use Excel, understand the risks of using Excel, primarily data entry errors.
Perhaps taking this one step beyond, there would be another column which takes the difference between the required amount and the quantity on hand so that it would display exactly how many more of the item needs to be ordered, too.
Advanced technique is to use units sold per day to figure when you need to order more based on the lead time.
I am trying to make a sort of "inventory helper" spreadsheet that can track quantities.
Here are some specifics on how to manage inventory with Excel.
It is a bunch of if-then type logic where it calculates some of the concepts I described above.
I've seen some spreadsheets that do things similar to this, but I have absolutely no idea how to do it myself.
On the summary sheet, I want to be able to enter a quantity into a column called "On Hand" and then if that number is under an established threshold (which will be different depending on the item the row is for) a column further across will display a yellow and/or red message informing whoever is using the sheet that they need to order more of said-item.
