EXT2 file system is the predecessor to the EXT3 file system.
It is quite robust and quick, although it does not scale well to large volumes nor a great number of files.
As collaboration (email) and many web serving applications have lots of small files, Reiser is best suited for these types of workloads.
In addition, Reiser was designed to very efficiently use disk space.
ext4 is best for /home and if you want to change the partition size later then you need to look into LVM.
Don't use ext2 except for /boot and ext3 is a fine all-arounder, like Mario in Mario Kart.
Without htrees, EXT3 does not handle more than about 5,000 files in a directory.
The Reiser File System is the default file system in SUSE Linux distributions.
However it is still not as scalable as some of the other file systems listed even with htrees.
To assist you with the "Why" part of your question, the Linux Gazette did an article comparing many of the filesystems used in Linux.
It scales and performs extremely well on Linux, outscaling EXT3 with htrees.
I found the article useful although due to it's age it does lack information on "ext4".
Reiser FS was designed to remove the scalability and performance limitations that exist in EXT2 and EXT3 file systems.
ReiserFS (Reiser3 / type 82 on cfdisk) is best for /var.
As a result, it is the best file system on Linux where there are a great number of small files in the file system.
Recently a scalability feature was added called htrees, which significantly improved EXT3's scalability.
EXT3 file system is a journaled file system that has the greatest use in Linux today.
EXT2 is not journaled, and hence is not recommended any longer (customers should move to EXT3).
