You'll have to partition the new disk, prepare a partition on it, and mount that partition somewhere (/path/to in my example command).
Any software that still complains about partitions that are not so aligned is outdated.)

Before running it, though, I recommend carefully doing a full-disk backup of your current disk to another disk.
You can do this with dd, as in sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/backup-file.img.
