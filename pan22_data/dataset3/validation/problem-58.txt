A DNS or domain provider should provide some sort of interface where you may change this.
And then point individual A or CNAME records to the appropriate addresses.
If you are using Cloudflare, you need to change the A record to point to an IP Cloudflare tells you to use.
The A record needs to be the IP address of your server or web host provider.
Cloudflare may have multiple IP's you can use and you should add alll of them.
It sounds like you might need to get back with your DNS provider and see if there's a subdomain www you need to change as well.
This works only you have a valid IP address you can point to in the hosting provider (in some shared hosting services getting an IP to point to is problematic).
If your site is reachable via multiple IP's, then you have multiple A records.
DNS is simply a Domain Name System that manages how hostnames resolve to IP addresses.
You can have as many A and CNAME records as you want.
Most likely you have an A record for "www" still pointing to the old site.
So, if you've registered mycoolsite.example, you may be able to register www.mycoolsite.example with a separate A record if you wanted.
When your browser does a DNS lookup, what it gets back is the A record.
As you can see from above, DNS returns A records in response to requests.
If your site lives on a single server, with a single IP, then you have one A record.
You may need to do something else on Cloudflare to tell Cloudflare the IP address of your server or web host provider separately.
What you most likely need to do is to go to the registrar on which the domain is registered and simply create another A record for www.foo.com in addition to foo.com.
Typically it is better to manage the DNS records at the place where you have registered the domain.
