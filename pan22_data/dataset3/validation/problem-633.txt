Create a new Ini File entry, with the following settings:
MAKE SURE you enable Run in logged-on user's context under the Common tab.
For laptop users, we also use the Offline Files feature, so that this follows them even when they're away from work.
My problem is that, looking at these folders on the server, they all show up in Explorer as "My Documents", instead of the actual folder name (set to match the username).
Add the column 'Filename' in explorer and you see the usernames
We have a Windows 2008 R2 file server sharing home folders for about 600 users.
This will remove the offending line from the user's desktop.ini folder, fixing the folder display name behaviour, and leaving everything else intact, including any other user-set folder view customisations, etc.
Group Policy -> User Configuration -> Preferences -> Windows Settings -> Ini Files
There's a much easier method, non-destructive, which targets the actual Desktop.ini entry responsible for this behaviour.
Deny yourself (or your security group) read access to the desktop.ini - Next time you refresh the folder, it will show the actual folder names, not "My Documents"
You could make this the default for folders by doing this.
These folders are mapped to a shared drive for each user when they log in on their own workstations, and that mapped drive is in turn set as the default location in the Documents library in windows on everyone's profile, including the default profile on each of our machines.
How can I prevent Windows Explorer from doing this?
Log in to a new machine for the first time, and your Documents library will point at the file server.
You then get an extra column showing the real filename.
