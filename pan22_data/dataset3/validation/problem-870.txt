These are designed only to be used when no other SQL version is installed on the host, these will block Port 1433.
Obviously with all these services running it is going to create a load on the system.
When you use the new SQL 2008 and above installer you need to choose Installation from the left hand side.
Install only the database engine and I recommend you name your instances such as MYPC\SQL2005, MYPC\SQL2008, MYPC\SQL2008R2 etc.
With the introduction of SQL 2008 new additional software was required such as Power Shell and .NET.
You will have to skip lots of compatibility warnings.
This required a new SQL installer which was a bit confusing and rough around the edges.
Ensure you do not have any default instances of SQL installed (that means SQL installs that don't have a named instance).
Using Microsoft Update to install the SQL Service Packs and hot fixes should fix most of these compatibility issues after installation.
Install SQL 2005 Service Manager which will allow you to quickly startup a SQL Service when required from the system tray.
Start with the lowest SQL version first and work your way up.
This was the usual configuration for SQL 2000 & 2005.
Followed by Perform a new installation of SQL Server 2008.
Then New SQL Server stand-alone installation or add features to an existing installation.
With named instances each instance has a dynamic(random) port allocated, the SQL Browser sits on port 1433 and redirects the SQL connection to the correct port for the named instance.
Thankfully the SQL installers improved with each version.
If you are using this for intermittent testing purpose I would recommend configuring the SQL services to manual startup type.
You are correct this can be done using named instances, but only for the database engine.
(Despite the name it will allow you to start or stop any version of SQL)
I suspect your trouble will probably be mainly with the 2008 installer.
You then need to check the box for Database Engine Services.
Don't install Management Studio until the end and use the new standalone SQL Management Studio from https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt238290.aspx
