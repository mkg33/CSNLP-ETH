I'm so relieved i found this solution, I use 3 external monitors 7970M graphics card and moving the mouse to the top right then shaking it around would make it jump from my 2nd to 3rd monitor, after about 5 seconds at most of doing it the mouse fixes itself.
Reorder displays back to original order and apply changes.
Annoying bug but that's always fixed it for me when it appears.
I downloaded them one week ago when I still had mouse corruption issues with the older driver and now they're gone (For the first time since I bought this graphic card).
If you're using multiple monitors you can always right click on the desktop of your side monitor(s) and the main display will be corrected again.
Drivers will not just fix this one, I haven't had it until the 7000 series though which is extra annoying and I've been with ATI / AMD after 3DFX went out.
I've tried everything to fix this, and recently i found out the best way to fix it (Which hasn't failed at all so far) is to move the mouse to the top right of my screen and shake it around a bit.
UPDATE: It seems for me that the new AMD beta drivers (version 14.6, downloadable here) fixes the problem.
Open the "Screen Resolution" context menu by right clicking on the Desktop.
I recommend everyone with an AMD card to check them out and see if it fixes your problem!
Open a window, hover mouse over minimize, expand, close, area at the top right and it will go back to normal, or at least it does for me,  hope this helps.
