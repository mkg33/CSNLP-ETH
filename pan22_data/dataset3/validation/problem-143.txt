Simply said: If you allot 16 bits per number, it will always take 16 bits of storage, even if the only numbers that ever occur are 5 and 6, for example.
bit rates from 128kbit/s to 320kbit/s are rather common).
A WAV file is uncompressed and is a much larger file size than the compressed audio files like mp3.
But converting MP3 back to WAV does not add any information, it just encodes it uncompressed.
It's just a question of encoding data:  a WAV file encodes the raw audio wave (hence its name) uncompressed with (for CD quality) a sample rate of 44,100Hz and sample size of 16 bits regardless the content (thus one minute of silence take the same space as one minute of noise: 60s × 44100s⁻¹ × 16bits = 42,336,000 bits = 5,292,000 bytes = ~5,168 kiB).
There isn't anything being added to the WAV file, but rather it is being stored as uncompressed.
Bearing in mind the fact that when converting Audio file to Mp3 file a quite amaount of loss takes place then after converting Mp3 to WAV what kind of information is added on ıt and ıt becomes 80' and 700mb?
An uncompressed "regular CD-quality" WAV file is simply a series of 44,100 16-bit integers per second of sound.
It is good to note that converting a mp3 to wav does not increase the audio quality of the file as it will only ever be as good as the original source.
In other words the bit rate of a WAV file in CD quality is 44100s⁻¹ * 16bits = 705,6kbits/s.
MP3 (or similar lossy encodings) »throw away« parts of the sound wave an average human being won't be able to hear either (imagine a singing bird next to a motor high way) and compresses the audio to a selectable bit rate (e.g.
