This selects one column extra (p2.Domain_ID) and takes more than a day to complete https://www.brentozar.com/pastetheplan/?id=ByOpUIb0m
There are a lot more columns in that table as well, related to that page.
If we really have to specify every time the index to be used, wouldn't it be better to move to a nosql database?
Once we add another column, it does a clustered index scan, wich can take up to days to complete.
We have a huge SQL 2017 database containing more than 5 billion internetpages.
When we specify the index to be used, it works like a charm https://www.brentozar.com/pastetheplan/?id=SkvkKIbAm
I didn't notice this behavior before when we were using SQL 2016.
This uses the correct index and takes less than a second to complete
If we join with other tables and we join on the UriKey, the query will use the non clustered index only if we only require the UriKey itself.
One of the table contains the info about the page: PageID is the primary clustered key and UriKey is the non clustered index so we can lookup based on the Uri of the page.

I noticed this strange behavior also with other keys and queries.
