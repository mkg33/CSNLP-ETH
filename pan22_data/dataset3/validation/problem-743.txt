This server is 2.8ghz Xeon with SCSI drives(not SAS) and 4gb ram (getting a new servers is NOT an option)
This would speed up my spool while offer reliability on OS and software.
I have this old smtp server that is currently running Windows 2003 and with EOL I want to move it to something that will continue to get security upgrades but at same time I want to improve performance.
Again, this is an SMTP OUTGOING gateway, it will not store any important data.
I am thinking about moving it to CentOS 6 with postfix.
I lose out on write performance but get better read performance for my statistics and queue monitoring.
Software raid allows me to place different RAID for different partitions.
The RAID1 simply exists for insuring the PC does not crash and minimize downtime.
RAID0 also allows to set custom stripping from what I understand.
or would the performance improvement be minimal and I should just go with Option 2, RAID1 only?
I am thinking RAID1 on the OS and Software and put spool in RAID0.
Since I know the general file size of my emails, can I control that each file takes up an individual block so that in case of failure I would only lose half my spool?
I would prefer to go with Option 1, is there anything I should be concerned about?
Right now the data is stored on 2 separate drives, I am thinking of using a Software Raid.
