At the moment, we do have a small set of active rules which is clearly not sufficient.
Why not just change the new rules to "log,auditlog,pass" instead of "block" or "deny"?
I think that it's not possible (or very time consuming) to build up adequate testing scenarios for new rules and I would like to expose those rules to "live traffic" to get an reliable impression.
What I basically need would be a way to set new rules to "DetectionOnly" while others are still active and should lead to actual blocking the detected traffic.
I would like to add new rules from the OWASP ruleset without deactivating the already active rules but cannot risk to lose too much traffic because of false positives.
I'm in the process of modifying an existing ModSecurity ruleset and I'm wondering how I should handle the process of adding new, (mainly) untested rules to production systems.
A somewhat limited possibility in AnomalyScoringMode would probably be to set the AnonmalyScore of new rules to 0.)
How do you update ModSecurity rules on your production systems?
(Also note that we are using ModSecurity in "TraditionalMode".
