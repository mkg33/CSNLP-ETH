The easiest way to get there is entering perfmon or perfmon.msc in your command line or execute dialog (Windows key + R)
Real time data can be monitored with Performance Monitor (perfmon.exe), also found in the Performance sections of Computer Management, under Monitoring Tools.
As Jay already said one way to do this is setting up a performance log.
If you want to set it up going forward, you do it through Computer Management -> Performance -> Data Collector Sets.
As mentioned, collecting this information will increase the serve load slightly (and consume disk space), but once setup, you can then access historical data under the Reports section.
And of course the time span the log shall be conducted.
That information isn't recorded unless you record it, so that information does not exist anymore.
Saving it as comma separated values has the advantage of being easily restructured in a table using Excel or similar programs
There you can set up a new log (protocols item in the tree view) and select the items you want to log and the interval of how often they are supposed to be logged - as well as the output format of your log.
