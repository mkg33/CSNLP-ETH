I tested the scenarios by installing and uninstalling Office to cause system reboot while other chromium browsers were running: including Google Chrome and Yandex Browser.
Try it, it works but you miss the last day or two.
I tested Edge the same way, but the possibility of recovery was case-by-case with the browser and I cannot figure out rules behind its behavior.
Firefox seem to save all tabs and windows, but it becomes very slow when many tabs are open.
Paste from PC (crashed/closed) to USB two files: Current Session, Current Tabs and start thru Opera Launcher on USB ->launcher.exe (very slow, just USB)
If u kitty scary, play with Opera (portable version) on USB, as a test.
Here find and save as a copy two files before u delete them, they have no extension: Last Session and Last Tabs (approx 4 MB and 368 KB) Delete them.
However, I could see tabs and windows I closed by "user action" that took place before and after the forced restart of Opera browser.
Go into C Drive username/AppData/Roaming/Opera Software and rename the folder Opera Stable as Bad Opera Stable
Opera does not retain a log of closed tabs or windows so I could not reopen closed windows that contained about 20 tabs.
In username/AppData/Local/Opera Software copy the Opera Stable folder and paste it into the same location on C Drive.
Go to C:\Users\UrCompName\AppData(hidden folder see below)\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable
Meanwhile (Opera 25.0) there is a built-in feature for retrieving a recently closed window (and it's tabs).
Assuming you cannot even restore previous session.
Go into C Drive username/AppData/Local/Opera Software and rename the folder Opera Stable as Bad Opera Stable
I'm using Opera 35, and the Recently closed menu is under a dedicated button next to the window controls:
In username/AppData/Roaming/Opera Software copy the Opera Stable folder and paste it into the same location on C Drive.
go to Folder Options(menu)-> Show hidden files, folders and drives(choosen)->Apply->Ok
USB X:\opera\profile\data and DEL 4 files: Current Session, Current Tabs, Last Session and Last Tabs(r empty)
