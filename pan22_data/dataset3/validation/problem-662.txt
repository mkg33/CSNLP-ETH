I've done some initial research and to invest in a core switch and managed access level switches is a fair sized investment.
Can you please help me understand when it makes sense to move to a network structure with a managed core switch and managed access level switches.
I've attached a drawing of our current network structure and I would appreciate any thoughts.
The current structure is working for us, but I can quickly see where we are going to run out of ip addresses on our current class c subnet.
I realize I could address this by changing to a different subnet mask with a class A or B address, but I believe breaking the network into logical segments probably makes more sense.
For instance, 192.168.1.x for office, 192.168.2.x for controls, 192.168.3.x for security and dvr, 192.168.4.x for engineering, etc.
Currently, our network is made up of all unmanaged switches (8 of them) that are either home run back to one main switch or in the case of our factory floor network, the switches are daisy chained together and then feed back to the main switch.
We are at a point where I need to plan for future growth and also consider if the current design is optimal for network throughput.
At what point or more specifically, at what size does it make sense to adopt this technology?
