Recently, I've been working on two spare switches which I need to stack at some point, but before I did that I needed the clear the config on both switches.
So you can actually see the data flowing via the link.
After you have verified where the Cisco IOS image file resides, try to boot the image.
-press Mode button while power on the switch to enter in switch: mode.
I feel that I've done everything I can here with the USB stick.
4) If you issue the boot command and the command does not result in a successful bootup, either the switch: prompt displays or you are stuck in a continuous reboot again.
Is there specific software that I need to use to prepare a USB stick for the boot loader?
Unfortunately, I made the mistake of typing erase flash: instead of nvram: and it's obviously caused me a problem.
The random symbols are normal since you are transferring the file via console.
The only option to recover the switch is an Xmodem file transfer
2) Issue the dir flash: command in order to view the contents of the Flash file system.
Just leave it for few hours and image will be uploaded.
I've taken a USB drive and partitioned it to 2GB and formatted it as FAT16.
1) Issue the flash_init command and the load_helper command
When loading the USB onto the working switch, it accepts it without issues and allows me to copy the IOS image to usbflash0: and when doing a dir usbflash0:, it shows me the IOS image so I know it's all ready to go.
When I console into the switch that does not have an IOS image, it takes me to the boot loader which is expected.
Not a massive issue though as I could just load the IOS image of the other switch as they're both 2960x switches.
I've tried diskpart and also Rufus, but it just seems to be the boot loader that doesn't like anything I've tried.
However, it's at this point that usbflash0: is not recognised, and displays the following:
3) If you issue the boot command and the result is in a successful bootup, either the default switch> prompt or the hostname> prompt displays
