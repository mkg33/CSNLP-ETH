It's a little odd for the clients to be unable to route unicast to their DHCP server, but it's not at all a problem; they'll just renew later on in their lease lifetime (which gives you a little less leeway for downtime on the DHCP server).
I should send a L3 unicast message to the DCHP server (siaddr).
Look at the following very basic example to understand:
When it sends out DHCP offers it sets the server identifier (option 54) to its own IP address.
When the clients need to renew they try to unicast to that IP address, which none of them can route to.
Is the expected behavior for the client to fail to renew by unicast during RENEWING state and then to renew by broadcast during the REBINDING state after time T2?
How is unicast to the DHCP server supposed to work when a relay is used?
I have a DHCP server serving a number of subnets over a DHCP relay.
=> Where did I need to know the MAC of the server?
It is a topology issue, and I am not even able to implement a solution where I would send the renew to the 'giaddr' IP, as this is against the standard.
OK It seems I cannot comment on a previous answer but just spam you with an extra answer.
Anyhow, there is a high chance that T1 exceeds the arp cache timeout...
Well I'll eventually drop the request and any successive retry, until I get in REBINDING state.
I cannot be sure that the source MAC of the packets I received, be they in broadcast or unicast, is the MAC of the server.
