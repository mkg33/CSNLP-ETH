Not quite sure I'm clear on exactly what you mean by 'linked agenda', but this sounds weel within the capabilities of OpenOffice.
However they choose to proceed, you'll likely be writing some SQL eventually.
Although unless you're willing to provide some encouragement, this is not a project I would throw at someone who has never programmed before.
So far I advised him to have a look to Opennoffice.org's Base module, because it fits his skill set.
I would personally get this project done with python and sqlite (adding to the mix wxpython for the looks and sqlalchemy for my SQL allergy), but I fear that he doesn't have enough time for this project to acquire some coding skills in the process.
As he does not need a server running, I would advise against a PHP/MySQL solution, mainly for security reasons (I know it's easy to secure, but he would have to also learn about security).
If your friend is serious about this topic, they should get a book that covers the tools and language they end up using.
So, what tool would be best to build a cross-platform client database software with a linked agenda ?
If it's in you're friends skill set, it's a good choice - especially if not willing to learn something new & time is short.
As far as SQL, the O'Reilly Learning SQL and Head First SQL are good beginner books.
They all have excellent docs / examples available on the web, can produce UI quickly & easily (depending on how you feel about 'easy') and have libraries available to make database access relatively painless.
I like the informal visual style Head First uses, but YMMV.
If you're friend could learn (or be willing to learn) Tcl, Python or Ruby, I think these are also good choices.
Regarding some decent simple tutorials & resources:
As a side question, is there some nice resources introducing databases concepts to beginners?
