I recently worked on a project that required increasing upload size limits in IIS7 as well.
If you only need files <= 2 GB, you should follow the others advice (Chris and Janne's answers), but if you are looking to get larger files uploaded, IIS7/7.5 will only allow you to go up to 4 GB (4294967295 Bytes), but  you won't be able to use all 4 GBs...the most I was able to increase it too was 1/2 that.
The above edit will allow you to get 2 GB uploads in combination with changing your php.ini file.
You may want to increase your script execution time within your script using ini_set('max_execution_time', 300); //300 seconds = 5 minutes, as larger files may take longer.
That is the only other setting I can think of that might cause this.
In your web.config file, you can change the maxAllowedContentLength (More info here):
I was trying to get to 10 GB...not possible with IIS7 (MS forums for more info).
Within this module, if you edit the feature settings (on the right sidebar) you'll find a "Maximum allowed content length (Bytes)" setting.
Dragon, Do you have "Request Filtering" module installed?
