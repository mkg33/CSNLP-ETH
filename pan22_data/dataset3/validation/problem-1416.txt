The discharge from RTC and other thing that means that the computer is not completely off will not draw that much.
I have the same laptop, Its actually a feature on the laptop that will extend the life of the battery.
It has do with lenovo Energy Management.It prolongs your battery life as lenovo suggets(charges upto 60%).

In order to change it to a full charge, you have to Energy Management program and select the Maximum Battery life instead of the Optimized battery health option.
days in my case) would discharged to around 60% automatically to extend battery life.
You can try and confirm that nothing on the computer is improperly drawing power by taking the battery out and letting it sit for the 5-6 days, then putting it back in and seeing what the level is at.
A battery should not discharge that fast just due to the chemical self discharge.
It doesn't seem that strange, although maybe a little faster than I'd expect.
It is true that Li-ion batteries will survive longer at around 60% than at full charge, I personally would not want it to do that by itself after just a few days, the battery does have a limited number of discharge cycles after all.
It is possible to turn this off; I will do this to see if it is indeed doing whatever Lenovo is telling me.
You can search for the software which manages its called "Energy Management" itself.
To change the settings so that you can use the device it for long time ,go to energy management software and select(check mark) Maximum battery life(charges to 100%).
