Another thing I hate is to have my keyboard switched from en-Spain/en-LatinAmerica... it breaks the layout!
What I do is completely remove them from the Language Bar, and keep only one.
I hate that, yes, some applications have a default
I think keyboard-settings are maintained per application, for example Word may be running with the Spanish language settings but Notepad is configured with the English language.
It would be good if there was a beep or something to tell you you've done it...
I had the same thing a few months ago, it turns out I was accidently pressing a shortcut key for switching languages.
That happens to me sometimes too, but I think it's just because I've hit Alt+Shift by accident.
You might also want to check what language is configured to be the default.
I think the input language is maintained per-application.
I'm not sure if there's a way to disable that behavior.
I disabled all shortcuts and removed the language toolbar, so that you have to explicitly change language in the control panel.
