Additionally, I've seen posts stating that it will typically take close to a year to satisfy all the requirements and to jump through all the audit hoops.
I think what you'd be better off doing is getting a wildcard certificate from the CA, that way you can use the same certificate on any subdomain of your primary domain, but you can't issue certificates for anything else.
Your question reads to me and to others as "How do I issue certificates to entities inside and outside of my organization that are trusted by arbitrary internet users?"
So, needless to say, this is not an option for a small business.
I also recommend reading "Windows Server 2008 PKI and Certificate Security by Brian Komar"   and consider all of the various PKI scenarios for your applications.
This is because, as Tim notes, you can make a valid certificate for any domain, which shouldn't be allowed unless you control that domain.
This is basically indistinguishable from becoming a reseller for that root CA, which almost certainly costs lot of effort and money to be.

This article is is a bit helpful in the "who does it" and the general "what's involved" ....
Echoing from a few others posts... it is possible... all be it quite expensive and difficult to establish.
You don't need to use Microsoft's CA to get something out of the book.
If that is your question than the answer is "You don't.".
Furthermore, the ancillary costs involved with the entire process can range from $100k to +$1M depending on general contractor+legal+labor costs as well as how many bouts of audit you go through.
An alternative is RapidSSL's reseller program in which they do all the hard work and issue from their root CA.
As for some extras that I've picked up from some scattered sources... some of the requirements are having "substantial equity" and "insurance"... of which I've found to be listed anywhere from $1M to $5M depending on the source.
I know this is an old post, but I was looking long and hard for something almost identical to this.
