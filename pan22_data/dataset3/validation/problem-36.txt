I remembered that I had some issue with copying some big files from the disk.
I had got the same problem last week and I just disabled the windows update service and for my surprise the disk went back to normal activity, also i didn't have to restart my pc, i don't know why is happening this but it worked for me.
For them EASEUS shows 0 KB size in its recovery wizard, even when you know they are videos.
I am using this machine for last almost 6 years now and it was buttery smooth with all Windows 7,8 and 10.
Its not over yet after several hours....Will update once I come to final conclusion.
By seeing what files are being accessed you'll be closer to solving your mystery.
The good thing is that if some files are unreadable, TeraCopy skips them and moves to copy next file.
I'm not convinced that super fetch is your problem.
My machine: Dell XPS 15 L502X (2011 edition) with 16 GB RAM, Core i7 2630QM, HDD 500GB 7200RPM.
In the end it lists all files which had issue while copying.
In the end it looks like i had picked up some maleware on my travels.
It used to give me "Cant read from source file" error.
For me it's a hang up in the Diagnostic Policy Service (Located in the "Service Host - No Network" processes in the task manager).
For me, when I put those files for recovery, my PC crashed to blue screen in multiple attempts.
In fact formatting my C: drive and reinstalling clean Windows...and surprise the issue came back.
You may find it's your antivirus doing a scan, or it's Windows search doing some indexing, etc... then you can work back from there.
I've had the same problem off and on after Windows 8.1 64-bit updates.
You can also sort by Read / Write bytes to see if anything stands out as the culprit.
So I thought now that issue might have become sever.
I downloaded and used the following freeware programs to clean up my machine: herdProtect, ShouldIRemoveIt, Revo Uninstall.
And I believe you're referring to disk active time being 100% not space used right?
So what I did now is to cut paste all files in all drives to external hard disk using software called TeraCopy.
To recover them, I first installed old version of EASEUS data recovery software and then deleted those files and then run EASEUS data resovery's recover deleted files wizard.
I did everything, clean boot, stopping all unnecessary services.
Stopping the service, then disabling it in the scheduler and services seems to have done the trick.
Finally, I tried doing formatting (not Quick Format) drives by right clicking the drive.
I had the same problem and have read many a thread on 100% disk usage this week to try and work out what was wrong.
Also you should let Windows manage your page size for you, tweaking these kinds of settings aren't going to help you.
However note that some files may not be recovered.
Ok, so this is May 2017, and I am facing the same problem with Windows 10.
First identify the files being access during the high disk active time, not just the process... System is much too generic and used for all kinds of local services.
For the record the maleware was called Muvic Smartbar.
I dont know what caused this issue, but I feel that it was due to bad sectors.
I found that it was scheduled to startup hourly in the event logs around the same time as when I started having the 100% disk usage trouble.
To identify what activity is causing the high disk load, open up Resource Monitor and go to the Disk tab > Disk Activity and sort by the Total Bytes/Sec (highest first).
So this was clear indication that my old hard drive was dying.
