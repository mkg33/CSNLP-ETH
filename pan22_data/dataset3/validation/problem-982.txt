If you take it to a mechanic, they would probably get the battery recycled properly, and the case if it's metal, but the rest would probably end up in a dumpster, then landfill.
I save all my stuff and make a trip about once a year.

If the reseller doesn't take it back, the manufacturer might.
I'm sure you'll be able to find a facility that will recycle everything in the UPS (case, battery, internal electronics, etc).
I went to my County's website, they have a program where they take all the electronic and chemical stuff every other week in different Home Depots.
Many manufacturers will take back the batteries when you buy a replacement, like the manufacturers of toner cartridges do.
The only problem here though is the weight of the battery making it too expensive to post (and you shouldn't be sending that sort o chemical filled boxes that UPS batteries are in the post anyway) but you might find they have a local affiliate who will take them as they sell you a new battery.
You could try asking the people who you will be buying the new UPS from if they can take the old one back for recycling (you are buying a replacement aren't you?).
