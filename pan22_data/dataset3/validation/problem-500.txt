It doesn't look to be a firewall issue due to the fact it can be seen externally from canyouseeme.org.A quick google search of net::err_empty_response points to the fact that this is a Google Chrome issue and not necessarily a web server issues.
If you get the same results then confirm the details of the web servers socket with netstat -noab|find /i "listen"|find /i ":80".
I recently reinstalled WAMP and it was working fine before, not sure what changed :-/ Any help would be appreciated.
I would want to rule out that the socket is not binding to 127.0.0.1:80 or something similar.
Checked canyouseeme.org to make sure port 80 is open on my computer, it works fine.
That's your first step, then worry about being visible to the outside world.
If you're running this on a consumer ISP line it is entirely possible that your ISP is blocking well-known ports to prevent you from running servers (which is undoubtedly against your Terms of Service).
I would try reconfiguring Apache to listen on some port other than 80 (like 81, or 8181), reconfigure your router to forward that port to your computer and try it again.
Since you state that it worked before (presumably from offsite) and the 324 error appears to be a clientside issue specific to Google Chrome, I would first try loading the site in a different browser(s).
ISPs generally are not terribly smart, though, and only block well known ports.
So i am trying to access my site using my ip address xx.xx.xxx.xx (don't think it's a good idea to give it out).
Tried to ping my computer ip address from work and it doesn't seem to work.
My first suggestion would be to try another browser other than Chrome to ensure that this isn't just a Google Chrome cache issue.
But i get Error 324 (net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE): The server closed the connection without sending any data.
