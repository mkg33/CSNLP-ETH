This has been very useful as we have over 30 admins updating records on a daily basis.
i'm happy user of ipplan to manage multiple subnets.
Should I just bite the bullet and go with a DHCP server?
That is, there exists one spreadsheet and it is everyone's responsibility to update it.
Now it's gotten to the point that we don't know what IPs we have available unless we consult the documentation, and thus we end up updating it.
some of them do use DHCP - mainly networks for workstations, while other have manual configuration.
Also, I wouldn't use DHCP for any servers, even test ones.
Specifically, our issue is that sometimes an IP is taken for a VM and when we go to build new ones they're not necessarily up for the quick 'n dirty "ping test".
What tools are available for allocating and tracking which addresses are being used?
Right now there's a Google Spreadsheet, but inevitably we forget to update it.
In my experience what works best is the Master IP Spreadsheet to Rule All Others.
We use our documentation wiki, and map out all of our subnets in tables.
We manage our DNS/NIS hosts via an LDAP OU which in turn is used to build DNS, DHCP and the NIS hosts map dynamically every 10 minutes.
Besides, one or two IP conflicts with production equipment generally sets people straight.
The last thing you want on a server is the chance that it's IP might change.
