I'm wondering if you drop the allow from all from the configuration record, this might do what you want to do.
I'm thinking that there is a conflict between the directive:
I'd suggest attempting to see if placing it in a <Location> directive - and try it on 2 different browsers.
How can I configure it to send that header appropriately?
BTW, I'd change the Files index.html to Location /index.html instead as well.
The Apache docs have a nice page detailing how Directory, Files, and Location work, with some examples, for further reference.
It is worth noting that this exact same set of directives work fine if I set them for a whole directory.
You might want to start off by adjusting your Files directive (<Files ./index.htm>), otherwise it will match any index.htm files in the entire directory structure under that .htaccess.
For a simple case, your config looks fine (see this post for an example), so I would start by looking at any factors that might make this a not-simple case and eliminating them until you find the one that's causing the problem.
The configuration you posted works perfect on a Debian - Apache 2.2 install.
I am trying to configure basic auth for my index file, and only my index file.
When I visit the page, 401 Authorization Required is returned as expected, but the browser doesn't prompt for the username/password.
On another note, I found this listed as a bug in Apache 1.3.
Some further inspection has revealed that Apache is not sending the WWW-Authenticate header.
This leads me to believe that this is actually a configuration problem on my end.
It is only when I configure them to a directory index that they do not work.
This is how I know my .htpasswd and such are fine.
