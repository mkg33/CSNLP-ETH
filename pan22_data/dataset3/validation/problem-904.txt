You can do it however you want, as long as what you are doing results in the OS being told to shutdown or reboot.
It comes ready to go, but I would suggest getting the associated case for it, and installing some Anderson Power Poles on it in order to make it easy to connect devices to it.
After the OS is shutdown the only way to reboot it (if you did not ask it to reboot) is to trigger the power briefly, either by unplugging it and plugging it in again, or by doing something which accomplishes the same physical effect, such as using the switch on a power bar.
In this sense it cannot be turned off by any means.
After that the pi consume less power than when the OS is running, but it will still continue to consume power.
This would allow you to connect it via USB to a laptop, which uses wireless, and then you can connect to that laptop.
For example, you could remove the SD card, in which case it
You could also attach an IR receiver for this purpose, or use a physical button on the casing, etc.
You can also trigger a power reset by briefly shorting two special points on the board (debately you can do it by shorting some other points, lol, but that is probably not a good practice).
Reboot/shutdown can be triggered wirelessly if the system is connected to a wireless network.
It works really well, and allows me to connect to it via USB and power on and off individual ports, see the power utilization, and set limits on current draw (among other things).
Not, I think, that will make it more convenient than just leaving it unplugged.
I have several Raspberry Pi, and I use this Power Distribution Unit
There are aftermarket switches you can get (or build), however.
The issue, remember, is that there is no power switch; shutting down the system (whether you type shutdown or use a tool or menu option that does the same thing for you) does NOT actually turn off the power.
