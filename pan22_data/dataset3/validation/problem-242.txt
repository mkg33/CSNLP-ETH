That does beg the question of why the firewall happily allows the (late) returned packet in, without subsequently letting the ICMP error back out.
Why you get this message for 8.8.8.8 Googles public DNS, not shure.
It may be a program that has been terminated while having open session to the DNS server.
You could try the following, from most likely to least likely:
Then, after a couple of these errors are logged (if I recall correctly, this is the syntax):
When a PC/Server is running torrent, it sets up a lot of NAT sessions.
Here is one reason why we do see this message in our ASA:
BIND picks a random(ish) port for each outbound query, and it's possible for a long-delayed response to arrive long after BIND stopped listening for the response on that port.
If none of these things fix the issue, try setting up captures as follows:
ICMP Port Unreachable is being returned by your DNS server, probably in response to a late received packet.
This looks like a mismatch in the firewall's NAT state-table timeouts and the DNS server's own timeouts.
When the user then close/terminate the torrent client we do get lots of this error for a long time.
