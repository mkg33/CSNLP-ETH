If you use the Configuration Editor you may be able to choose which file to use (at the top right of the window).
If Delegation has Read/Write they setting is usually stored in the local web.config file.
The GUI should correctly show you which file is used (in the status line).

I was thinking that the IIS manager was simply a graphical frontend for the textual configuration files, which in turn represent the whole configuration for IIS in a hierarchical fashion.
So when I edit a setting while being on the app level, I would have expected that either
If you have a web.config in a folder or for an Application, settings may also be stored in the parent web.config, either another folder or the site.
If it is Read Only, it is stored in ApplicationHost.config (in %systemroot%\System32\inetsrv\config) or for asp.net settings in (%systemroot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config).
If you don't see changes in the local web.config, check the parent web.configs or the machine-wide configuration files.
Which one is used by the GUI tools depends on the Feature Delegation for that setting.
When I change those settings, the web.config isn't touched.
You are correct, all IIS settings are stored in XML text files, but for each setting there are at least two possible files in which the setting is stored.
