If you use Emacs in the terminal and have multiple vertical frames open, you cannot highlight and copy multiple lines of text from one frame; text across all frames will be highlighted because they are all located in one terminal window.
The X interface obviously can do things that the terminal interface can't do, such as display images, use varied fonts, use more colors, show a fancy menu and even toolbars, understand key combinations that your terminal might not let through, get finer access to the mouse, access the X clipboard and other selections directly, show multiple windows (frames, in Emacs parlance) on your display, ...
Anyway I tend to use the GUI mode, if possible, and I don't see any benefits in -nw mode.
I've experienced some issues concerning font color and key bindings in -nw mode, I didn't investigate but I guess it's up to the terminal.
Since GNU Emacs 23 (or XEmacs 21), you don't have to choose between X and the terminal: you can open frames on any number of text terminals and any number of X displays from a single Emacs instance.
The usual way is to run an Emacs server and connect to it with emacsclient -nw to open a new frame on the current text terminal or emacsclient -c to open a new frame on the current X display.
The terminal interface can run inside screen or tmux, so you can leave an instance running and connect to it remotely.
The terminal interface works even if you don't have X available, e.g.
(For the remote case, if you can run Emacs locally, you get easier workflow and less annoying latency by using tramp, e.g., open host.example.com:/path/to/file â€” see the chapter on remote files in the manual.)
In the GUI, frames are located in a separate window elements so highlighting is constrained within each frame.
Though i don't use emacs/xemacs, i do occasionally use VIM/GVIM, and i prefer the GUI version, just seems smoother scrolling and i don't need to resize my term, which then makes my desktop assume i want all windows that size.
From within Emacs, you can use make-frame-on-display and make-frame-on-device.
when working over ssh from a machine where you don't want to install Emacs, or to repair your X config, or on a hardware text terminal.
In terminal mode, can detach your session and reattach using screen
