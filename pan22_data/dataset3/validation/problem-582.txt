Chances are you are using EBS and not the storage included with your instance.
If it is ephermal, you will need to relaunch the instance, and I believe you are actually moving from a m1.small to a m3.large as a m3.small does not exist.
I have changed my instance from m3.small to m3.large but the space I see in the system is the same.
resize2fs has what you're looking for - online resizing.
If you are using ephermal storage, then everytime you shutdown your instance you loose everything.

First of all the disk space included with your instance is ephermal.
If this is the case you are a considerable amount of disk space, and will need to make substantial adjustments to allow the new instance to start.
The M1 small has 160gb of Ephermal Storage, a M3 large has 32gb of Ephermal SSD Storage.
You didn't mention much about your environment so this is a good starting point.
Depending on your setup, you may have an instance setup with ephermal, or ebs volumes.
I can't afford loosing any data and unfortunately I won't be able to change paths in the scripts so all that needs to remain the same.
