I've been putting a tutorial together to help people make 7 like XP so if that is an issue for you contact me through my site in my profile.
But some programs will need reinstall, and it will be pain in the ass to do it, as well as to make all those settings in windows and programs to make them like before (passwords, settings..).
Restart...again if the problem persists disable the antivirus and any other security software.
If you run in to something else let me know and I'll try to help you out.
Press F8 after the bios though before the Windows boot logo; if you do this correctly you'll see a boot menu, if not then keep pressing F8 after the computer boots frequently/quickly.
Could this have been caused by either MS' "for real this is the last exception" recent XP update automatically being applied (she did have automatic updates set), or possibly the zero-day vulnerability it was meant to patch being taken advantage of (despite her normal usage pattern)?
You may or may not opt to keep your anti-virus running, if the problem persists and you leave it enabled then disable it to see if that is the cause of the problem.
Under the Services tab check the box that says Hide all Microsoft Services.
Go to the Startup tab and disable all the programs there.
This morning whenever she boots she gets a menu where she can choose Normal or Safe Mode, etc., but no matter which one she chooses, she gets the XP logo for a moment, then a blank screen a moment, then the hp logo for a moment, and then her computer reboots itself.
Once in safe mode go to START, Run, type msconfig and press enter.
I dont know about the reason, but it seems to me that the only best and fastest option is to do a repair install of xp; this will only "reset" the whole xp, but you wont loose any of your data.
Everything was normal yesterday, she browsed with Firefox only and didn't go to any unusual sites.
Dont forget to ALWAYS disable updates, there are meaningless, and BTW XP rocks, no matter what the trolls say to you (Yeah, the windows itself and the hackers waited for this last day to frack with xp machines... Yeap..
If that still doesn't work then you'll want to upgrade to Windows 7.
and the other method that you choose the existing xp setup in the disk(s)/partitions and then you either choose "To repair the selected windows xp installation, press R" OR "To continue installing a fresh copy of windows xp without repairing, press ESC.".
Be aware that there are two "repair" methods; the one that uses the recovery console (NOT THIS ONE),
I have done it many times so there is nothing to worry about.
