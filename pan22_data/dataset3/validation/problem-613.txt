If it is literally crashing, you may need to debug some more.
For that purpose you need to keep track of the last known update that was sent to the players.
That you only need to send the data a few times a second and the client can extrapolate the current position of the NPC.
Stats that haven't recently changed, don't need to be sent at all.
If the npc is alerted and changes its behavior because of player characters then update about that.
Health should only be sent when it updates and once every few seconds as a sanity update.
you should try to minimize the amount of data you're sending - only send what is needed.
You could instead compute a spline that describes the npc movement to save space.
Creatures that are out of sight, don't need to be updated at all until the server decides there is a good chance they are visible again to the player (always err on the side of sending a little too much).
Like ratchet freak said, for movement you could only send the direction if it updates.
There is no reason using a lot of bandwidth would crash a properly implemented client.
could you post a "log" of all things you're sending each time?
Remember the client program is only used (normally):
You normally only need to send the "diff" between the previous state and the current state.
You only need to send information about what is visible to the player.
However instead of only the position you also send the speed and direction the NPC is going.
