So you have discovered that TMs cannot solve every problem!
Since the problem with solving the halting problem is knowing when the machine is going to stop, by running the machine in a spacetime that is different from ours can allow you to solve it.
There are other models I know of, but I think they simply expand on the ideas I've presented here or are pure mathematical constructions, so they are more like "neat tricks" than something that could disprove the Church-Turing thesis.
Then you dive in the black hole and you can review the whole infinite timeline of your machine in finite time.
This is all informal, you start reading a more theoretical physics approach from the wikipedia article on the Malament-Hogarth_spacetime.
Informally, you are adding to your machine a new black-box module that can "somehow" solve the problem your machine cannot, let's say the halting problem.
The very first step Turing took and is highly logical (although not trivial if you consider the state of computing at that time) was oracles.
To do this you must have the computing machine very near the black hole but not into its event horizon (so it doesn't get pulled in).
Personally, I don't see any way that an oracle can be used to discover a model that disproves the Church-Turing thesis.
From my sources when I was writing a report on models that can efficiently solved $NP$ , theoretical physicists believe that those conditions are satisfied near the edge of black holes.
Of course, oracles are just a mathematical abstraction and there is no secret behind their inner workings.
This probably means that you get pulled in the black hole, so I guess it's not going to be implemented and tested even if we could reach a black hole.
