Another thing you could look at is private VLAN's and then disabling things like CDP.
Yet, they can send and receive traffic to/from unprotected ports.
No traffic can be exchanged between protected ports.
Juniper, Cisco, Brocade can be muffled with varying degrees of persuasion, Extreme loops everything during EAPS transitions.
This is where switches such as the Metro-E series from Cisco come in, by default all the downstream ports run in UNI mode which means that they dont send out CDP, STP or any frames at all from other UNI ports.
In my experience there are vendors whose software is so bad that their equipment is never silent, for example they ARP out every interface when they boot, or send out some upon a link up event on a port.

also worth ensuring you nail down .1q/tagging negotiation
cisco have the option 'switchport protected' that can provide basic L2 protection between ports.
You can check the Amsterdam Internet Exchange's Config Guide for hints on how to silence switches from a variety of vendors.
