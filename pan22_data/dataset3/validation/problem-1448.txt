If you want your webserver to be found by them in ActiveDirectory, you register it under the HTTP/yourwebserver SPN.
Unfortunatelly I was unable to find description of possible values and their meanings for service classes.
I am trying to set up my Java tomcat service to be authenticated using Kerberos (Negotiate SSO) in MS AD.
From the name I think, the MSSQLSvc is something related to SQL only, but when to use HTTP and when HOST ?
There's no such list, because for example you, as a software developer may create a new service, register it in ActiveDirectory under sPN: KULATAMICUDA/myservice@MY.DOMAIN, write your client, which looks for sPN KULATAMICUDA/myservice@MY.DOMAIN in ActiveDirectory in order to log into it.
Can somebody provide list of common service classes and their usage ?
In case of prefix HTTP, all web browsers construct SPNs in such a way, that they append to "HTTP/" host of the address, which user typed in.
In the documentation of setspn on http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731241.aspx I have found brief description of this command.
What is difference between MSSQLSvc/myserver and HTTP/myserver or HOST/myserver ?
