It was essential I did this for our directors who have a ton of meeting requests that would have been broken.
Once you've migrated the SBS-specific GPOs, etc, in the Active Directory can be removed and it can be cleaned up.
We did the same thing 2003 SBS to 2011 SBS without migrating.
(If you really want to be fancy you can add a "swing" through a temporary domain controller and end up with a new file server that has the same name as the old SBS Server machine.)
The worry that I have is that calendar invites which are currently in, will have their link broken in the new setup, as users + resources are recreated (and I think they are referred to by an ID rather than email address?).
Do you have any advice on how to get exmerge to retain the correct references, so that when I update a meeting request with me, Bob and the Staff Room, they all get the updated request?
Likewise, Migrating to Exchange Server 2010 from Exchange would also be straightforward.
Preliminary testing of a couple of mailboxes seemed to suggest this is the case (though could be some other issue that we are facing).
The firm you've enlisted to assist you is wrong, in my opinion, for suggesting that you ExMerge the data in the first place.
To answer my own question, I discovered a solution for converting the X400 addresses in the 2003 Server to SMTP addresses so that meeting responses work correctly.
I don’t know a lot about it, but he is using Exmerge to transfer mailboxes from the old server into the new server, which is fine.
You're also going to end up with a totally new Active Directory domain, so you're going to have to employ tools like ADMT or USMT to maintain the user's experience.
There's no way, using ExMerge, not to make a mess of your existing data.
When you're done, all your client computers are still joined to the domain and all the Exchange data still works as expected.
There was a lot of strange things from a slew of "IT consultants" on the 2003 box and we wanted to change the name of the domain.
You could export only the certain meeting request for others.
Exchange keeps track of these connections by their LDAP DN; which will be different in the new domain.
If you use a PC client bound to the 2003 box, login to each account, open Outlook, let it cache all of the exchange data, then export as PST file, save these to a network volume or drive.
I can't really comment on whether it was worthwhile or not, I'm not an expert at this, so we just trusted what we were told.
Setup your accounts on the new server, use a PC client bound to the new server and import the PST files.
Invitations/Events that are sent intra-exchange will lose the connection to the invitees.
The firm we have enlisted to assist with the migration has suggested we don’t try and migrate but rather create a new domain and then bring stuff across.
Most places that run SBS don't have too many troubles with this, so nobody has really put the effort in to making a better solution (especially since a direct upgrade retains the LDAP DNs and connection; but there's plenty of reasons to not do a direct upgrade).
Also resources (as long as you recreate the resources with the correct SMTP address on the new server).
you will need to ensure people don't try to reply to old e-mails as they will still reference the old domain.
Migrating from SBS 2003 to W2K8 would be very straightforward.
Depending on how much data you have this could be an afternoon's work.
We are upgrading our server (SBS 2003, 5 year old server) to a Enterprise Server 2008 R2 with Exchange 2010.
It was a bit of a process, so I only did it for people in the office that were likely to have a few of them.
