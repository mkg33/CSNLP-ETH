I think the easiest way I can describe the shape of wifi coverage is as a squashed sphere with the widest part perpendicular to your antenna and the narrowest part along the length of the antenna.
I have just started using dd-wrt as a firmware provider and they seem to do the job nicely - and it's free.
Don't set the value to high because it will cause the router to overheat and probably get fried in case of improper ventilation.
I recently hugely improved the wireless signal to all parts of my house by putting the router on a shelf by itself, further away from the wall than it had previously been, and free of encroachment from books and piles of clutter which had been accumulating around it.
Not sure about the percentage change, but it was enough to make streamed video work in places which couldn't even sustain a stable connection before.
You could try switching channels, I have had luck with that.
Anyway, I'd say the two ways to improve your signal would be putting a more powerful antenna on the router or putting a more powerful antenna on your wireless card (and/or get a better card, like you were thinking about).
Disclaimer: I've read about wireless stuff, but all I have is a crappy Broadcom b/g mini-card in my Dell notebook.
In order to boost signal you will have to install 3rd party firmware.
I have had 3rd party firmware on my router for years and have boosted my signal to 200 mW with out any problems.
If you look through the advanced wireless setting option in the dd-wrt firmware there is an option of increasing the transmission strength.
It should be noted that with increased power comes higer temeretures that may negativily impact the lifetime of other components in the router.
