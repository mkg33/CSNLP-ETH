Convirture is probably exactly what you're looking for - the OpenSource version is free, if you get to the point where you feel you have want to spend some money, they have a couple of commercial products Convirture Enterprise & Convirture Enterprise Cloud.
Some of them may solve your problem either collectively or individually.
There are some compromises and none of the advanced features (no cloning, deploying VM's from templates and VMotion\DRS\HA etc are totally out) but it does provide a single console for powering on\off and some other basic functions.
On the libvirt page, there are a list of applications that leverage libvirt.
Is there some free tool that just gives us consolidated view of all VMs with poweroff and poweron options for each VM.We don't need Vmotion, all other stuff.
Only problem is that Convirture currently does not support ESX (AFAIK) - only KVM and Xen - maybe you should reconsider your Hypervisor choice and go all open source.
VMware Go allows you to do some fairly limited ESXi centralised management.
It's not a GUI, but I know libvirt is able to talk to ESX machines.
