If you are not worried about people getting your password hashes, you shouldn't waste any time hashing them and just store them in plain text.
Can somebody suggest a way which requires least or no work at all for the users.
The crypt system call for blowfish runs 10 cycles and performs very slowly.
Hence want to change the hashing algorithms for all the users on all the machines to MD5.
In order to check, whether a user has used a dictionary word as the password, have written a small utility that uses a crypt system call.
If you want to prevent your users from choosing insecure passwords, it would be better to prevent them from choosing insecure passwords using something like passwdqc than race against crackers to catch them after the fact.
The password hashing algorithm used is the default i.e.
If you are worried about people getting your password hashes and cracking them (like you are trying to do), you should use the stronger hash to make this more difficult.
I have a network of roughly 1000 SuSE machines with 20-200 users on each.
That makes use of blowfish with 10 iterations as the password hashing algorithm not feasible.
