There are many ways to implement animations, generally you would use a sprite sheet.
You could end up with something like this (C# esque assuming tightly packed sprite sheet) :
If you look at some older games, you could have the same animation for each melee attack, but the weapon's animation was put on top of that.
If you have hundreds of animations, this will mean hundreds of sprite sheets and lots of memory.
To check what attack a player currently has, I would simply have an array of animations (pre-loaded or not) which will be referenced by the player depending on the attacks he chooses.
This means a big save in sprite sheets, and could be useful.
If you choose to decouple parts of the animation, an AttackAnimation could contain multiple animations for the top half of the body, the bottom hals, the weapon, etc.
This can get compilcated, but an easy way is to predefine character size, for example 128*64, and pre-calculate the number of lines and columns to get the total number of frames.
