Typically, the computers on the network will use an internal DNS server to resolve addresses.
This internal DNS server (DNSB) typically runs on the router, if it is not a dedicated machine.
If your network is windows based, I would recommend setting up this printer on a specific machine or server that will function as the print server, and then share it on the network, thus users will connect to the printer through that particular machine, which will do all the spooling and coordination of print jobs for all the users.
If it receives DHCP, then you probably have a feature to set a hostname directly on the printer itself, either via the control panel on the printer, or the web interface accessible by http-ing to the printer's IP.
It won't "magically pop-up," but it will resolve when entered.
One way: add xerox_1600n to your network's DNS infrastructure (the internal/local DNS servers your client machines use) .
So, to get your PC to see your PRINTER using a name, you will need to modify the settings in your internal (DNSB) DNS server.
A lot of printers will let you do this, for the exact reason you are looking for.
As the others have explained, I will try to diagram it instead.
Are you able to set a hostname for it in its web interface?
Any address that is not resolved at the internal router is resolved at a higher level DNS, typically your ISP DNS server (DNSA).
Personally, I prefer setting static ip addresses to static equipment in my network - printers, faxes, scanners, etc.
