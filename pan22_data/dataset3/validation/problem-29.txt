Backup is the single most important things that Admins do.
My preference is and always has been to use tapes.
At minimum, you should have a daily backup to tape of all data, and some sort of scheme for keeping those backups off-site.
One major advantage however is that it's physically decoupled from any OS (or other logical) environment, so you greatly reduce concerns such as how do you backup the backup server and how do you implement a clean and easy offsite strategy.
Online backup is something that people can find tempting, but you should always remember that some time you may need to do a full server restore.
Finally you'll need to remember that there at at least 2 layers of restore you need to cover: restoration of individual data items and full server restores.
Backup strategies start by thinking about the recovery plan.
How would your company fare in the same circumstances?
Once you have the business requirements then you can determine what's technically required to implement that.
A lot of it is dependent on what you're backing up and how much of it there is.
I currently work for a company which had to rebuild from the ground up after a fire totally destroyed their last premises, including everything in it.
Backups might not be required to fulfill the functionality required.
Unless you have bandwidth to your provider that's comparable to your local bandwidth I would keep away.
Figure out what needs to be backed up on a daily (maybe even hourly) basis in order to get that particular business function up again in whatever timeframe is required.
The ones in-house are for quick recovery, and the ones off-site are in case your "in-house" blows up.
Regardless of what method you use, a backup is only as good as your ability to do a restore.
3- inadvertent or malicious file/folder/data deletion.
You need to have backups in-house as well as off-site.
I don't know which backup services you know of, but any of them which offer you unlimited space are a seriously bad idea.
A good backup strategy allows recovery from various kinds of data loss, including  ...
I don't think there's any such thing as a single optimal backup strategy.
You'll notice that in the comments the arguments were about cost/performance, reliability etc.
I'll second the point that it should be driven by your restore requirements, specifically how quickly you can get things back and how much you can afford to lose in the event of a failure.
Let me start by saying that any backup system is better than none at all but if you're only going to back up to another machine or storage device at the same location it's only slightly better than none.
A full backup over the weekend and nightly incremental backups are OK.
A good strategy balances the value of the data and the cost of downtime against the likelihood of the failure, the funds available and the cost of the various kinds of backup systems.
For example if I need a file server to be able to recover any file deleted within 30 mins I'd configure the volume shadow copy service in windows to take snaps every 15 mins.
The backups should be tested (via restores and via test server rebuilds) regularly.
My standard advice with backups is to keep them as simple and primitive as possible, so that your restores can also be simple, and so that there's fewer layers of sexiness to potentially go wrong.
Some will suggest an Internet based remote storage but that certainly isn't a globally viable solution.
Backup is the single most important things that Admins do.
Due to adequate off-site backups they could do that.
According to some statistics I've seen, the majority of businesses will fail within the first year after such a disaster and one of the primary reasons is the loss of critical data, which usually results in a loss of business.
I always prefer tape to NAS, but for some reason tape has a bad rep in certain quarters.
It also adds the risks associated with having your data stored at an unknown location and accessible by an unknown number of people.
I'd recommend using RAID-6 as much as possible with a controller with battery backup installed on any backup machine.
BTW -- IMHO our esteemed host needs to improve the off-site component of the Stack Overflow backup strategy.
