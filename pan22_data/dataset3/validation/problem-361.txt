Sometimes kids who are really struggling come in expecting to fail and wishing to evade or let it go.
(This comes not with a subtraction to the final grade, but rather with a lowered maximum possible grade on the assessment.)
Personally, I make multiple versions of assessments to allow students who did not master the material a second chance.
Many of the kids have never programmed at all when they apply, so we run into this problem regularly.
However, you must always create a path by which those standards can be met.
The teachers in my department are all fairly popular, so we don't have a huge number of kids who dislike computer science, but ever year there are a handful who discover, right near the beginning, that CS is not their favorite activity.
As a system, this is terribly motivating for both teacher and student; losing a kid during their freshman year will make the next three years impossible.
Thus, we expend a great deal of effort making sure that the lessons themselves are as crystal clear as they can be.
Students apply into their major as 8th graders, and may not switch once admitted and matriculated.
You always want to make sure that they're on the same team as you are, so to some degree, I treat these meetings as recruitment meetings.
Nevertheless, they are stuck with us for the duration of a 4-year core curriculum.
For us, that can involve once (or even twice) weekly meetings with struggling students, conferences with parents, additional worksheets or small assignments, heart-to-heart discussions with students, or pairing with a tutor.
The test-retest model, especially early in the term, is another tool I have to make sure that I don't lose a kid on the early, prerequisite concepts.
You can assure them that it is extra work for you, too, and that you only give them this work because you want to help them succeed.
When working with the struggling students, always keep the emphasis om empathy, love and on what can be done.
And, most of the time, at least in my experience, they will.
The great strength of a required class is that you can hold students to high standards.
If you give them extra assignments, explain how the assignment will help them, and why you feel it necessary that they go through these extra steps.
I would not dial back the standards for kids in a required class.
