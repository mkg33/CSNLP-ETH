Just a reminder, always make sure you backup your data to multiple storage locations.
I'd strongly recommend you to check if the WD HDD is recognized in Disk Management in Windows then, @Herosix!
I thought about drivers but everything is up to date normally.
After these two procedures have been completed and you have assigned a drive letter to the hard drive, you should be able to access its capacity and use it however you like.
Since this is a brand new drive, you won't be able to access it in the Window File Explorer (This PC/My Computer), unless you Initialize the drive first, and then partition & format it  through the Disk Management.
The thing is that I also have a chromebook, and everything works fine with this HDD enclosure.
I recently bought a 1To HDD from WD with an enclosure giving me a cable to connect the HDD's Sata port to a USB3 port on windows 10 computers (2 computers have been tested, the same result as follow).
This is the surest way to avoid any potential data loss in the future.
