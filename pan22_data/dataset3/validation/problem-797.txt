This is an old post, but the "why" never was answered.
My assumption is that is makes it easy to plug/unplug cables, and to watch the blinkenlights.
Again, easier to change as needed by having everything front facing.
Why is this, and what is a good way to manage the cables?
This is fully supported by the manufacturers who generally place mounting holes for ears both front and back.
Since I have little experience with racks I wonder why the switches have their ports on the front of the rack, while all the devices that connect to it (SAN, servers, tape, firewall) have their ethernet ports on the back.
The network rack will often have patch panels in it, also on the front, so that the cables all just go into cable management - on the side of the racks and/or across the front of the racks.
The same holds true for large data centers, where primary switches will be centralized with distribution out to individual servers or network equipment housed in racks throughout facility.
The reason is most environments (think business office rather than server closet) use switch ports primarily connected to patch pannels.
They do make some switches with the power and ports on the back and led's on the front.
A 42U rack, a 3U EqualLogic SAN, two 1U PowerConnect 5424 switches, three 1U PowerEdge servers, and some other stuff such as a tapedrive, firewall, UPS, etc.
They are usually called AV switches but they function the same.
Any tips or pics on how to layout a rack with such diverse hardware in it?
In server closets, individual or small cluster of racks, as has already been mentioned, people will sometimes choose to mount the equipment reversed.
By having both the switch ports and the patch panel ports facing front, making changes as people move is easier than reaching into the back of the rack.
I have also seen the server/equipment switches mounted reverse with distribution mounted standard.
Very often all wall ports in a building are not live, but will be connected based on need.
Because typically, networking gear goes into its own racks, and servers go into their own racks.
It does make the cable management a bit more awkward though, since I'll have to feed all the cables from the back of the rack to the switch ports on the front, either via the side of the rack or by leaving some vertical space between the devices.
