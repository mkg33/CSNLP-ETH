I have had 2 pc's go through my shop in the last 2 weeks with the same bsod.
Past that some further internet research had another 2 computers, one fixed his issue by replacing the bios battery (unfortunately not easy on a laptop).
Debugging kernel dumps is not for the faint hearted.
The only way to know for sure is to get a kernel dump and use WinDbg.exe to get the stack trace and find out what kernel mode code was involved in the crash.
Once you have a proper dump, you can use the downloadable Debugging Tools for Windows to install WinDbg (pronounced wind-bag by the cool people).
The other had some minor partition problems that were resolved by running a 5 stage check disk, the guide is for vista but the steps are the same in xp anyway.
One had a faulty hp printer driver causing the issue, a quick removal and re-installation of the software and driver resolved it.
To properly diagnose this error you need to configure your machine to create a proper  Kernel Memory Dump (not a mini dump) and make sure your page file is large enough to hold it (physical ram + 1mb).
The other resolved the problem by running memtest86+   and discovering a faulty memory module.
