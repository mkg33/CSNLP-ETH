If you don't have a web server which your website is pointing at then obviosuly you have no place to load scripts.
If you purchased your domain from a registrar you can put forwarding rules against it.
Your domain registrar can always help you making these changes.
So when someone visits www.example.com your index script will kick in and redirect them to whichever URL you specify.
I wouldn't use it, but for some solutions it might work out and just do what you want.
This is done using an iframe, probably depending on javascript.
This solution doesn't require PHP or any other language.
That probably won't work, as you want to redirect to a specific page or path on that domain.
Then, you will reach the domain redirect configuration page.
As someone here suggested, you can use a CNAME to redirect the domain to another domain.
A domain points to an IP address, which you can change to anything you want.
So what you need to do is access the control panel of your domain to set the settings, or if you don't have any, contact the person who has registered your domain and ask them to set it for you.
In your cPanel, click the option called redirects, which is located under the Domains section.
If you only want to do this for yourself, not for others, you can simply edit your hostsfile, and you don't even need to own the domain, but its unlikely that you want this.
If your server uses cPanel, you have to place this file inside the /public_html folder.
This creates a solution where you see your domain name in the address bar of the browser, but underneath the page you redirect to is loaded.
header ('Location: http://www.redirecttohere.com');
If that website will automatically navigate to that specific page when it is being called from the domain level (example: http://site.example.com will automatically load http://example.com/site/index.php), then you can add a CNAME entry for your domain and point it to site.example.com.
In order to point to a specific page on a website, you need a hostingprovider and a script.
A method could be to make an index.php file on www.example.com with something like:
Alternatively, you can make a domain point to another domain.
Note that when people visit www.mydomain.com, they will see their browser change to site.example.com and then to example.com/site/index.php.
Those solutions won't work for you, because they require hosting!
My answer depends on whether you can set DNS for the domain yourself in the admin panel of the provider of the domain.
In that case, you want to use the URL setting in the DNS admin.
