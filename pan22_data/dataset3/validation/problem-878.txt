By adding double quotes, you won't get the error anymore.
That's not a User's responsibility, so they shouldn't have the permission to it in the first place.
Previously, it give error because of oracle's installation tables.
As soon as you add another table, you have to repeat the whole process and you have to do so for each and every User.
I would suggest that this is not an efficient use of your time.
How are you going to explain to your Management how a Production system went down (for however long it takes you to recover it) because some User, somewhere, decided to drop a table, just because they discovered that they could?
When you modify tables, you only have to [re-]grant privileges to the relevant Role(s); Oracle will take care of "cascading" those privileges to the relevant Users.
the problem is due to characters being interpreted by PL/SQL, like the dollar sign or the hash tag.
Grant object-level privileges to a Role, then grant that Role to [many] Users.
If you need different "levels" of privilege for different groups of Users, create multiple Roles.
The vast majority of Users don't need (or want) "all privileges" on any table; select, insert, delete and update is all they need and all they should be given.
