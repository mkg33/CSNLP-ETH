(suexec should be checking that 1001 is a valid user on the system first)
It's the only one I see that's longer than eight characters.
Is this apache with suexec configured such that the PHP scripts run as the user who owns them?
This probably means there's a problem with the password name service...
What does grep passwd /etc/nsswitch.conf say you're using?
I notice all my RHEL boxes show UIDs for an account, and it's the same on all of them.
You can override the width of the field and if it's shorter than your usernames, it will automatically switch to showing UIDs.
It's also possible that you have stuff running as a userid that doesn't exist on the system anymore.
(haldaemon)  Probably due to how long the name is?
Is rv and 1001 the same user, or is rv a different user?
However if I run top, it shows the correct username, not their uid.
Typically, when a numeric UID is displaying in a situation like this, it indicates that there may no longer be an entry in /etc/passwd for the UID.
Some googling for just that seems to indicate that's the issue: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/ps-aux-displays-users-as-uids-instead-of-username-645456/
I doubt that this is your problem, but I include it for completeness.
If you are running NIS or LDAP and having these sorts of problems, you may want to install nscd and investigate performance issues on the NIS/LDAP/whatever servers...
When I run ps aux to look at running processes, some of them show the uid of the user, and others show the actual username.
