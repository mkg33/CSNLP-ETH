Just to hammer this home: If you stay in insert mode for long, you're doing something wrong.
...a good choice would be to define some movements using your <Leader> key:
(I use , as <Leader> key since it's feels close and confortable to my fingers)
...the best choice is to hit ESC, move around, and get back to insert mode again.
(If the ESC key isn't close to your fingers, it would be a good option to create a mapping for it.)
The pattern in Vi(m) is: Move around in normal mode.
Or reject it and use Sublime Text 2 instead, for what we care.
If you want to move more than ONE or TWO positions...
Try to teach yourself to leave insert mode (via <Esc>, hopefully conveniently accessible on your keyboard) as soon as the stream of characters coming from your brain starts to trickle off.
Or manipulate the text with Ex commands like :substitute.
By following that path, you are certainly shooting yourself in the foot.
If you want to move ONE or TWO posistions on insert mode...
Make short inserts (a word here, a sentence there).
There's no point on create mappings like <C-h> to move left and then start hitting it too many times... as a vim user you're not supposed to hit the same key multiple times to achieve a smart movement.
