You can use (usually blue coloured) USB 3.x ports (at least those marked with a battery symbol) if your PC has one.
I do this most of the times on my Moto g4 plus 32GB variant
I have an internal USB 3.x hub in my PC which suffices to power an Raspberry Pi 3 in most cases.
You can use the Y usb cable to get 1A from 2 ports instead of one.
They can provide more than the 500mA of a normal USB 2.x port.
At least Thinkpads (maybe also other devices) also have yellow coloured USB ports (see https://superuser.com/questions/218053/are-usb-3-0-ports-yellow) which can also provide power if the laptop is not on.
That's probably also to consider when choosing which USB socket to use to power an Raspberry Pi.
However I don't know what long-term effects it might have, even if it's always worked fine for me.
I do this most of the time using my Model B Raspi.
You can even connect your otg supported phone to raspberry pi using another micro USB data cable!!
(Occassionally under heavy load the symbol for not enough power showed up on the screen, but it never crashed or rebooted because of that.)
