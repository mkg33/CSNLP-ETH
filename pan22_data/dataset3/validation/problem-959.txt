If you don't want to rely on those terms and want to know the exact word (in case it actually exists), you may want to ask this question on the English Language & Usage Stack Exchange site.
In addition to the other answers, this 'grunting' is used to simplify game localization.
Or, when the sounds are nonsense syllables rather than beeps & typing, Speaking Simlish:
This way the developers don't have to hire voice actors in every supported language, and manage those different recordings per region.
There's no specific word to describe this particular effect.
If you had some sound resources in a project, you could name them 'sndTextTyping1', 'sndTextTyping2'...
Then play a random 'grunt' sound for each syllable in each dialog word.
On the other hand, we can think of printing words letter by letter and playing a sound for each letter written as a typewriter-like animation.
This said, you may call those sounds just 'typewriter typing' or similar.
To replicate this effect, you could record various random 'syllables' in each voice (10 samples might do).
Something like the voices in Banjo Kazooie could be considered either of the above, I'd say.
Manually store the number of syllables for each text word in your dialog.
You could fudge it and just play random grunts regardless of the actual number of syllables.
