However, after I've added a few dozen features (typically a web server), executing for example Add-WindowsFeature -Name Web-CGI takes over 10 minutes.
For example, execute Add-WindowsFeature -Name NET-Framework-Core when I haven't added any other features, it operates at a normal pace.
Once the feature is eventually installed, Get-WindowsFeature returns in an appropriate amount of time (almost instantly)
Executing the command with -LogFile gives a useless log, reading like this:
I'm troubleshooting an issue we're seeing with all of our Windows Server 2016 servers.
Is there any way to delve deeper into the logs to find out what's going on?
So the more you previously added, the more it will take the OS to determine all that are installed.
When you try to add a feature, the 1st thing the OS does is dig around the existing ones and their dependencies.
The more features we add to the operating system, the slower the features are to add.
As you can imagine, this makes spinning up a new server exceedingly slow, as there are around 60 features that get added to each machine.
Performing this operation via the GUI makes no difference - it's just as slow.
With the final two lines repeated over and over again.
