Computers A and B will never ARP for computer C's address since, based on their IP addresses and masks, they know that Computer C's address is not on their network.
When Computers A and B want to send something to Computer C, they realize it is on another network, so they will send it to the gateway each has configured.
Switch only conmunicates equipments on the same network
However, in this example, A will never send a request to C. If A has traffic for C, A will use it's own IP address and mask to determine if C is on the local network or not.
The IP stack of those computers will however discard those packets as they recognise it is outside of their own local network.
Let's extend this example a bit and say that B is misconfigured with a /22 mask (smallest network to include both 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24) instead of the /24 it should have.
The switch doesn't care about what IP addresses are as it is only using the L2 addressing.
For example, if A ARPs for B, C will also see this broadcast.
Instead, it will send the traffic destined for the other network to its configured gateway, and it may need to ARP for the gateway's layer-2 address, but it won't even try for a host which is not in its own network based on its configured IP address and mask.
ARP is a broadcast, but it is looking for a specific address, and Computer C would not have that address, so it won't answer.
L2 broadcasts and unicast floods will be received by all three computers in your example.
But switch see is x.x.x.y and x.x.x.y2 are on the same network(It has his ARP table who match MAC with IP).
To be accurate, based on your description, all three of your hosts are on the same network from a L2 perspective and the switch knows this to be the case.
Nothing on the switch prevents C from answering a request from A.
If you does a capture, you can see that on the same switch, that if from one network to another, you tried to make a ping request, this one "Who has x.x.x.y?
A host doesn't ARP for an IP address it knows is not on its network.
In this case it is not, so A will then look to it's routing table to determine where to forward this traffic (on most computers this will typically be the default route or gateway).
You are correct that on a layer 2 level all computers will receive broadcast packets, including ARP requests for IP addresses of networks other than their own.
The syntax of an ARP request is something like this:
If B had traffic for C, it would determine that C is on the local network and B would ARP for C. When C receives this ARP request, it should not respond as it would determine that B is not on the local network.
