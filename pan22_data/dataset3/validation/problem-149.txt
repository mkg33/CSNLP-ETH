I thought, that it would be convinient to ssh into 101 VM through 101 port, into 102 through 102 and so on.
The best thing you could do would be possibly running different openSSHds on different ports, if what you wish to do is changable in openssh's config file.
This is very similar to my home setup, where SSHing in gets me to the router, but SSH on port 2222 gets me to my server.
No, there's no equivalent to virtual hosts for openSSH.
So I added this routing rules to iptables on hardware node:
If you want this to be fairly transparent to the end user, I recommend setting up two different SSH daemons listening on different ports.
I use openVZ on my server and have three virtual machines with VIDs 101,102,201.
As far as I know, sshd_config has no equivalent to the <VirtualHost> directive of httpd, allowing you to create totally different environments based on the hostname the client uses to connect.
Now, you can just 'ssh user@ssh02.host.com' and ssh will Do the Right Thingâ„¢.
To connect to the hardware node you can use 22 port.
One thing you can do is have different SSH keys launch different commands (eg, xm console /blah/ )
You need to use non-standard ssh-ports for your VMs.
