I would verify you are logging in with your domain credentials ie DOMAIN\user and not just user.
Nothing in the logs aside from failed authentication from a bad username/password.
This can sometimes happen if you disconnect from RDP sessions instead of logging off.
I changed my password two weeks ago, and have been able to log into the domain controllers no problem.
When I want to access any other server in the domain (the entire environment is nothing but IIS and SQL servers) I run into a strange issue.
I have a domain controller that is Server 2008 and another that is 2008R2.
If it's not cached credentials, I would double check if Kerberos is operating properly.
I don't see anything in the logs on the servers either, although I could be overlooking something.
Usually it clears up on its own once the Kerberos tickets expire.
I have had this happen to me in the past, I create a local user account with same pw as domain pw.
Changed my domain pw and forget about local account.
Servers are communicating with the domain controllers.
Once I hit okay and it starts to login, the server I'm remoting into tells me that my credentials are incorrect, and from there I have to use my old credentials.
