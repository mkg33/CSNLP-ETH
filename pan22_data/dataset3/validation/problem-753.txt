Provided there are still at least two online disks (in a mirrored pool) this is effectively a warning--integrity and redundancy remain intact.
Disks which have been offline'd but not detached can later be brought back online with only an incremental resilvering operation ("When a device is brought online, any data that has been written to the pool is resynchronized with the newly available device.").
And, since this is as-yet untested, there is the risk that the delta resilvering operation is not accurate.
After further experimentation I've found a fair solution, however it comes with a significant trade-off.
The "live" pool and/or the offline disks may experience issues.
I'll update if that happens to me, but for now will experiment with this approach.
In my tests this brings resilvering time for a 3-disk mirror down from 28 hours to a little over 30 minutes, with about 40GB of data-delta.
The trade-off is that any pool with an offline disk will be flagged as degraded.
To summarize, if you need to remove a disk from a pool and later add it back without requiring a full resilvering then the approach I'd recommend is:
As others mentioned this overall approach is far from ideal--sending snapshots to a remote pool would be far more suitable, but in my case is not feasible.
