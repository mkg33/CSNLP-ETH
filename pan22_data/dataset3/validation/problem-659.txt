Unlike sleep were it still uses a little bit of power to keep everything in memory hibernation mode doesn't.
No, your computer will not be damaged by a power outage while hibernated.
Power breaks shouldn't effect you so long as you have the computer in hibernation mode:
The UPS has a battery so if the power comes down your system will still be up (usually around 30 minutes).
When you put a computer in Hibernation mode it essentially goes into a shutdown state with the exception that it stores the contents of memory into the hard disk.
Most UPS have software to start a shutdown immediately once it knows the power has gone down.
You will plug the UPS into the wall and the computer into the UPS.

If there's a power surge, I suppose your computer could be damaged, but not because it's hibernated instead of shut down.
If you hibernate a laptop, for example, you can unplug the power cord and remove the battery without any damage and without losing any data.
When you hibernate your computer, you are completely turning the power off.
An alternative if you really want to be secure against these types of threats is to get a UPS (Uninterpretable Power Supply).
