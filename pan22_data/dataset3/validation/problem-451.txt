Obviously you're going to want to follow the recommended hardware guidelines to ensure full uptime.
Some companies (like mine) back up the data over the VPN to an external site.
So, for example, you can buy a cheap netgear NAS (~$700) and backup machines to that and carry them off site.
Clearly there are mission critical systems that run on VMs in the enterprise that cannot go down and need to be backed up.
If you use the VMWare solution, you can use iSCSI targets to backup your data.
Basically it mirrors all changes to an external appliance and then just sends the deltas of the changes.
You may notice some sluggishness on the VM, but it's services will not stop during a back up.
We're not a company that likes to send our data to the cloud.
We haven't added any real-time backups yet, but we're working with our vendors to get that all worked out.
All the major VM vendors provide solutions to back up VMs while they are running.
Every vendor is going to have a solution for this.
For instance, if you run vSphere and use VMWare's VDR (or even Veeam) the hypervisor will quiesce the file system while keeping the VM running.
You can also use real-time backup software that vendors are selling now.
