Performance is far better than on my previous Dual Core.
The Cache may have a major effect, 4 core CPUs tend to have smaller caches (there's only so much silicon) and having more processes running flushes out the cached data you need for a given process.
My own thoughts are that a dual-core should be fine for myself on a simple workstation setup where memory is a bigger issue for me than the number of CPU cores, as it seems that my browser, ASP.Net worker process and IDE can each take up a few hundred megabytes of RAM that adds up quick.
I had a Core 2 Duo and still needed the laptop; but with my Core 2 Quad, I have the first computer that's ever been able to keep up with me by itself.
I have noticed that my quad core box is much faster (wall clock time) in building my large C++ codebases than my dual core box using Visual Studio 2008.
There is also the potential to get a Tri-core CPU that AMD has out that is another possibility for some people.
I have eight cores and having so many really does make a difference - no software utilises all eight at the same time, but as a developer with lots going on at any one time (Visual Studio, SQL Server, multiple browsers, a plethora of Windows services, compressing/decompressing archives etc) the benefits are really noticeable.
I haven't tested this, though I would wonder what kinds of tests would one do to illustrate the difference in terms of performance and responsiveness for developers?
Depends on the multithreadedness of your apps and how many are running and working.
Of course that doesn't help with games like Supreme Commander, which insist on pegging CPU 0 and ignoring all the others.
How much of the full power of my workstation am I using at any given time?
Not that much I think as it isn't like I'm compiling or running tests a high percentage of the time.
A look at Task Manager will show how all eight cores are being utilised.
