Network traffic analysis is the process of recording, reviewing and analyzing network traffic for the purpose of performance, security and/or general network operations and management.
Network traffic is a very generic word , so shortly if you want to dig this field you need to understand two main things.
Or are you being asked to monitor the consumption of bandwidth such as the throughput?
Network traffic is simply the data sent between devices on a network.
I have a task to do research on network traffic analysis in cloud systems, but I'am not really sure what exactly means network traffic.
but lets say cloud network analyses not simply as this example it could include more information like application type and number of sessions payload of each session and so on
Traffic analysis there could mean to measure average speed or top speed, distance between vehicles, size/color/type of cars/buses/trucks, amount of people inside the vehicles, count how many vehicles are passing by per minute (or how many 20th century white convertibles pass) etc.
Therefor, traffic analysis can mean a lot of things.
Similarly you can analyse the traffic on a network to check how many bytes are transmitted, how much (average) delay there is, how much of the traffic is using a certain protocol (IPv4 vs IPv6, TCP vs UDP vs other, etc.)
source mac , source IP , destination mac , destination IP , this traffic is UDP or TCP , this traffic QOS is best effort for example you successfully made network analyses
Do you need to know the type of traffic that is being transmitted, such as what protocol is being used, where the traffic flows to, ie destination or perhaps the source of the traffic?
It is the process of using manual and automated techniques to review granular-level detail and statistics within network traffic.
so simply if PC_1 make traffic to PC_2 (ping for example) and you could obtain the information of
this traffic also could be treated by quality of service (QOS)
this address may be L2 address(mac for example) or L3 address (IPV4 for example) and this address could be source or destination.
It seems opinions on this vary, but FWIW here is mine.
Your question is too wide to answer without any more technical details on exactly the purpose of the analysis.
