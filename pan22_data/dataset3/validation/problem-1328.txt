Well it is just another layer of security so yes if that is what you want.
The downside in doing MAC filtering and hiding the SSID is complexity and increased administrative burden.
You can also do MAC address filtering so that only devices with MAC addresses that you specify will even get a chance to authenticate with a security key.
I would have a read of that article above and then decide if you are comfortable doing what it suggests.
Your router will be able to hide the SSID (router name).
That way your network would not show up when a computer or device scans for available networks.
If you enable WPA2 and have a strong password, the rest is overkill is most cases.
You can do QoS to limit or prioritize bandwidth based on various criteria (not based on a monthly limit however) on that router, but from my experience with Linksys, their QoS does not work all that well.
Yes it is possible to upgrade, or change the firmware on your router to another type.
This way only those that know the SSID by name can attempt to connect, this is a good idea in densely populated areas.
Have a look at this article for a good idea of how to do it using DD-WRT:
You would need to know the devices MAC address before they could connect as you would have to add it to the table in the router's security settings section.
In doing so you will gain access to a far greater set of settings that you wouldn't already have on the factory firmware.
You will need to change the firmware on the router if you want this functionality.
Some additional information to the answers already posted:
As far as security goes, WPA2-PSK (AES) is the best that your particular router will offer, and it is a good choice.
If you aren't comfortable with flashing the device with alternate firmware (such as dd-wrt), the Linksys firmware is fine for the average home user.
The router itself cannot do bandwidth measuring, but you can use various techniques to do this.
What you are also talking about is MAC address filtering which basically adds another layer of security to the connection meaning that if you add MAC filtering to the connection then although you know the passphrase if your MAC address is not in the table you won't be able to connect.
People trying to connect would have to do so manually having to enter your SSID name in the connect to dialogue box.
A MAC address is just basically unique identifier associated to a specific piece of hardware.
Software like Wireshark and Spiceworks, or SNMP monitoring, can give you an idea of bandwidth consumption.
I have some questions and concerns regarding this and figured someone here could give me a hand and steer me in the right direction.
If you want this then that pretty much makes the decision about point 1 for you.

WPA2 is a great encryption method which basically lets anyone who knows your passphrase connect.
These are alot of points but I was hoping someone who has more knowledge than me in this subject could give me a hand and a few pointers.
MAC addresses can be easily spoofed and hidden SSIDs can be sniffed.
Bear in mind though that any serious hacker worth their salt could bypass this without much effort.
Hopefully all this is possible and I'm not dreaming :)
I'm soon going to be setting up a wireless network for me and some buddies and (hopefully) making it secure.
