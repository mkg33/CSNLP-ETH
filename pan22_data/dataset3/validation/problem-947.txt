Go to system setup (F2), select Profile Settings and set Perfomance to custom, then make sure that: C1E = Enabled C States = Disabled.
A few days ago we got two new PowerEdge R220 servers.
The tests were made with random big files to create network traffic and with SuperPI to create at least a little bit of stress on a single core (and that load is sufficient!
One is fine but the second one displays bizarre behaviour:
Now we have ~35 °C when the CPU is idling and a maximum of ~55 °C under heavy load.
If there's minimal load or network activity the fans spin at full speed.
However once it's stressed or receives lots of network traffic the fans slow down considerably.
However, we still had an issue with high CPU temperatures on this machine.
The odd thing about this is, that the fans ran at 40% of their max speed.
Under heavy load the CPU had a constant temperature of about 85 °C, which is - in my opinion too high.
All seems to work fine for the last couple of hours and the fans keeps the same RPM.
Is this a hardware issue which means I should just call a technician?
To lower that high temperature at heavy load we configured the fan offset in the iDRAC settings to 'Low' (http://www.dell.com/support/Article/an/en/andhs1/626602/EN).
My questions are: what else could I try to solve this?
Starting with the 12th Generation, a part of the thermal control is made by the iDRAC management, so you have to upgrade this firmware aswell.
This isn't a real solution, since the fans are now constantly on a high RMP, but we hope a BIOS/iDRAC update will fix the problem!
We got a new R220 (with a xeon e3-1220v3) a week ago and had similar problems with it.
I updated the BIOS to the newest version but couldn't find anything to change thermal or power management.
