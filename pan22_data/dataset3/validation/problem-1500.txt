From other reading I've done, there seems to be a consensus that the cpu (and perhaps gpu) thermal paste likely needs replacing.
However, that being said, your fan is spinning considerably slower than mine when my CPU heats up like that.
You should investigate why the processor is getting so hot in the first place... almost certainly going to be dry thermal paste or a clogged heatsink/vent.
My T420 has also recently started having over-heating issues.
If you are able to set it on max speed with the software, that means the hardware is no problem.
You should fix this problem first as it didn't do it when you first bought the laptop, right?
This is with an external monitor attached, and unplugging from that seems to reduce the overheating a LOT.
I was just seeing the numbers 4460 and 4477 rpm when my cpu temps were in the mid 90's C. I'm also running linux.
I opened it up and blew out all the dust but it didn't help.
You may look for some third party software like Thinkpad Fan Control which is working on my X220 to manually control the fan speed on your computer.
I'm not sure if that could suggest a non-hardware cause or just the integrated intel graphics generating too much heat for the failing thermal paste.
I am not familiar with Linux so I can't tell if there is some fan speed configuration file installed in OpenSUSE is throttling the fan speed.
