Having a conditional statement that is executed for every item in a list, and you know it is false for all items except the last, is not pretty.
You could also change the loops to iterate until the element before the end, and then do the special treatment for the last, outside the loop.
It would be better to find the index of the dot, and then get a substring.
Here you are comparing strings and objects, which may not be super fast.
Extracting the beginning of a string until some character
It could be acceptable, if the condition is super fast, for example a simple comparison of two numbers.
You alluded to the issue of doing social treatment for the last item in a loop.
There are two related relevant places in the posted code:
When opening a file for writing with the w option only, there's no need to seek(0) in it, that will happen automatically, and the file will be rewritten.
That way you can eliminate the conditional statements.
It will allocate a list to store the results, and scan until the end of the string, even though you only need the first part.
You could convert this to a simple numeric comparison by using a range loop, and then comparing indexes instead of objects.
