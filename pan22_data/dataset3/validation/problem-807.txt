Depending on the requirements, this may be a viable option for some people.
(Note: I found this and posted it as a comment in the selected answer but also posting it as an answer so will be easier to find for others.)
It runs through the selected range and replaces overflowing cells with truncated text.
This may not be an option for everyone, but if you import the document into Google Sheets, this functionality is supported by default.
Final note:  I have used it for personal projects and found it reliable but please save and back up your work before trying any unfamiliar macro.
Try entering the formula ="" (that's two double quotes) in the adjacent cell where you don't want to see the overflow.
In Excel, adjust the column to the required width, then enable word-warp on that column (which will cause all row heights to increase) and then finally select all rows and adjust row heights to the desired height.
You now have text in cells that do not overflow to the adjacent cells.
On the top menu bar, three types of text wrapping are supported.
In the same line of thinking that Google Sheets may not be for everyone, this macro may not be for everyone but it may be for someone.
This evaluates to "null" which displays nothing and won't affect math.
