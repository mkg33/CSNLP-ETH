Still, boot order can be changed via efibootmgr on Linux, and I use this way.
Try to save, navigate to some other options and then save and exit.
Some BIOS manufacturers have a separate save action for user preferences.
For a $2 part, it can sometimes be aggravating to troubleshoot.
This could be because the boot order is maybe considered to be user preferences by those BIOS manufacturers.
After you make the change to the boot order it is simply not sufficient to 'Save and Exit' or 'Save and Reset'.
The settings are not being saved on save and exit selection.
Boot back in to the BIOS and you should see the boot order stick to what you wanted.
It does make it a bit confusing as they also have a regular option called 'Save and Exit' or 'Save and Reset' which don't seem to save the boot order preferences.
See if you have an option similar to 'Save User Defaults' or 'Save Defaults' somewhere in your BIOS and try it out.
This is most commonly seen in AMI BIOS -- I have seen this in many server boards like TYAN S5533, Supermicro X9, X10 & X11.
You need to first save the changes as User Defaults and then any one of the above 2 options.
