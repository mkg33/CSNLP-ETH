your best solution to the get the drivers to work properly would be the apple boot camp I believe the latest version is bootcamp 3.0 if you have the original Lion disc it has boot camp drivers on that disc all you need to do is pop that it in, it will then autorun and click install.
I have tried to go to AMD Site and download the right driver, however when I try to install it I get the following message: "AMD Catalyst Mobility cannot be downloaded due to incompatible hardware/software on your computer.
How do I fix this display issue and get right resolution on my monitor?
After when you're done that confirm if there's any new patch or updates version for your bootcamp apple is usually good for that go to their apple site and in their search bar put in bootcamp I bet you, you'll see a couple of different version go with what's the newest and read what the fixes is for they usually explain on there.
