The SAN network is also identified as Unidentified public.
Adding a Windows 2012 Hyper-V server to the network.
NOTE: the only values defined on the SAN network cards are static IP addresses.
You can change this on  each interface via PowerShell.
See this tutorial on how to do this via powershell: http://www.1337admin.org/windows-server/windows-server-2012-r2/change-network-location-using-powershell-in-windows/
Each NIC in the machine receives it's own Index number that you can manually change using PowerShell in  which you can then specify the Type of Network.
Hopefully this can resolve the issue for others who have multiple NICs, only some of which are used for a LAN connection.
When the SAN1-4 network cards are disabled, Windows identifies the LAN network correctly as a domain network on boot.
When the SAN1-4 network cards are enabled, Windows identifies the LAN network as a public network and bang - firewall gets in the way.
Disable the network cards live and network changes from public to domain.
I recently experienced this issue where my network would show up as Public rather than Domain, and it was because of NLA kept trying to authenticate on the non-LAN network cards first.
It can also be resolved by restarting the adapter after the machine boots, but that doesn't seem as efficient.
I resolved it by going into my Windows Services and setting the Network Location Awareness service to Automatic (Delayed Start) from Automatic.
One is for the LAN and the other four are a private SAN network for MPIO.
