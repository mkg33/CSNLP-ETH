The old 2006 program from openvpn.se was started this way:
http://openvpn.net/index.php/download/community-downloads.html
Also, some threads that I encountered during some searching on the net expressed issues with getting OpenVPN to work on Server 2012 - if anybody here has any experience with that and would like to give advice on the subject I would be much obliged.
Didn't have to do anything special either, just install and it was good to go.
The second contains the "2048 bit OpenVPN static key".
Not seldom they can get downright rude when you try to talk with them.
I downloaded the client in ignorance and was surprised to find something that looked incredibly sponsored.
The OpenVPN program that PRQ recommends from http://openvpn.se/ was last updated in October 2006 and I feel like I should look for more updated software if at all possible.
Both of these files are placed in a folder named config in the OpenVPN installation directory.
However when I get there it seems like a scam, or at least like a sponsored advertisment.
I have a tunnel purchased from PRQ.se, previsouly I've been running it on Windows Server 2003 but I've moved on to Windows Server 2012 R2 this week.
Links to "privatetunnel" are everywhere, even with the word "referral" plain in sight in the URLs.
I'm reaching out to you guys, what should I install to get things to work with what I got?
They also have a strict privacy policy for Anonymous guys like me (no questions answered to third parties to date, at least as far as the public knows).
Now, it should be said that normally I would ask the company's support about this but they compleyely, utterly suck when it comes to support.
PRQ aren't helpful and can take days or even weeks to respond (if at all).
The reason I need help in this thread is because when I search the net for "openvpn" I get taken to http://openvpn.net/ - the official OpenVPN site I reckon.
That did everything, the tunnel was up and running.
There seem to be a "community" section on openvpn.net that looks alright but after the fiasco with the first client download from there I'm not risking anything - I want help with this.
The first has configuration stuff (what IP to connect to and a mention of the "prq.key" filename).
However, the service is fairly reliable and they provide a static IP which I need.
