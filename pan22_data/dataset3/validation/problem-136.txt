Is it possible in MS Visio to perform calculations with shape data?
Then any simple text/value inputs theoretically could be incorporated to the formula, which would then update whenever the input(s) change(s).
Building on the first example, if I had two sinks with pipes connected to a common pipe, could I get Visio to tell me what the flow in each pipe was and combine the flows in the common pipe?
You'd have to incorporate automation into your solution, at least to some extent.
For example, if I had a stencil of a sink with a flow rate stored in its shape data, could I set up a "pipe" connector that could determine what the flow rate of everything attached to it is?
I'm not aware of any way to enumerate the glues on a shape via the shapesheet.
But you would have to write at least some automation code to do it.
You could have VBA code (or other automation) that fires when the glues change for a shape, and then process the existing glue state for the shape and generate a new shapesheet formula to make your calculations.
