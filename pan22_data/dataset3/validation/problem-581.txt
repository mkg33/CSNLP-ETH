If you could achieve the theoretical 60 MB/s transfer, you could do it in slightly over 4 hours and 45 minutes.
Note that I use teracopy as the default copy handler of my windows (otherwise I never get the 10Mb/sec average over usb).
I have benchmarked many different USB2 transfers between 2.5" laptop HDs both PATA and SATA, 3.5" HDs both PATA and SATA, and USB Flash drives...
In fact, any properly configured modern drive will transfer at 20-30 MB/sec, it's very rare to see the 30 MB/sec rate be surpassed.
With USB sticks I get about 4 Mb/s with large files from my MyBook I get 25 Mb/s
Given that a terabyte has 1,048,576 megabytes, you just do the math.
Depending on the file transferring rate, you can easily benchmark this copying a file of 100 Mb and try to extrapolate that to 1 Tb
Although I give credit to the guys who correctly converted bits into bytes and calculated a 35 MB/sec maximum, which falls in line with my REAL WORLD PERFORMANCE EXPERIENCE.
Well, based on my rough calculations, somewhere around 7 hours and 15 minutes!
Ignore this talk about theoretical transfer rates and "60 MB/sec", etc.
From experience, I know USB 2.0 copies about 10Mb/sec on average (on my system).
...and I have NEVER seen transfer rates exceed 35 MB/sec!
582,54 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 9.70 hour which gives 9 hours and 43 minutes to copy 1TB on USB 2.0 in one direction.
There is a lot of false information in these answers about "theoretical" performance from people who have evidently never benchmarked USB2 HD transfer rates.
34952,5(3) / 60 seconds per minute = 582,54 minutes
(I'm referring SPECIFICALLY to HDs transferring over USB2 here, to be clear.)
USB 2.0 has a raw data rate of 480Mbps, but the fastest typical usage usually tops out around 40 MB/s.
