The MSN Explorer is rarely used these days, so the user base is very small and the support is limited.
When I re-opened MSN Explorer the old emails and contacts were there.
You should find them in the database folder you mention above.
There should be two files titled msn-com.sdf and msn-com_JMF.sdf.
For a more complete coverage on how to backup and how to restore e-mails with MSN Explorer you can see the two links below.
I backed up my e-mail using MSN Explorer and would like to restore it, what should I do?
The db folder contained the .sdf files from the previous account (the one that was locked out) and the new account.
However, they do have an active forum at MSN Solution Center.
We ended up creating a new account in MSN Explorer.
I had a client that lost his MSN password and was unable to get a new one.
You can try renaming these two by adding .old at the end of the file names.
I deleted the new .sdf files and renamed the .sdf files from the previous account with the name of the new account.
