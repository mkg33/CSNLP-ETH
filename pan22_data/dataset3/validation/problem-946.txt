lsof only found the [loop0] kernel-thread, I tried to kill it (even with -9) but no success.
Also verify that no process running on your machine has your mount point (or a subdirectory of it) set as its current working directory.
sudo ls -l /proc/*/cwd | grep pathofmountpoint will give you those process numbers.
Also when doing your lsof try greping on the mount point not the image file itself.
I've never looked to see if that shows in lsof or not.
If so move out of the pathofimagefile and then re-execute umount.
So the bottom line is: try that umount over and over again, after a certain time you could have luck :-)
run pwd ... is your terminal still sitting in the pathofimagefile?
Make sure you don't have an open shell thats in the mounted directory.
What really wondered me, was that after waiting a few minutes (after trying umount -f /mnt etc.
I had just now the same problem, umount won't  unmount my loop-device.
Strange enough, that neither lsof nor fuser could find any process using that mountpoint.
IÂ´m not sure, but maybe that the kernel itself couldn't free the loop0-thread for a while, but later it could close it?
- did not work), I tried it again, and voila, now it worked?
