Now if you check, you will find that you actually don't have any libraries in this directory.
Since it's not always as easy and your application can have multiple dependencies and each of it's dependencies can have another one's, it will quickly become annoying to this by hand.
In this case, if you copy for example arm-bcm2708-linux-gnueabi directory to /home/user/, it will use the directories inside /home/user/arm-bcm2708-linux-gnueabi to find appropriate files.
You should compile needed libraries before you compile the application that you need.
This is because it's only toolchain that you installed.
For example, it will look for libraries in /home/user/arm-bcm2708-linux-gnueabi/lib.
This is why there are some applications that automates this.
If the library that you want to compile uses autotools, this in most cases should should be fairly easy, just add --host=arm-bcm2708-linux-gnueabi --prefix=/home/user/arm-bcm2708-linux-gnueabi to your ./configure command.
You need proper libraries in order to compile some complicated software.
In most setups, everything in your toolchain in configured to use paths relative to your toolchain's compiler.
It's usage instructions are unfortunately out of scope of this answer but I'm sure you can find a lot of informations about how to use it.
