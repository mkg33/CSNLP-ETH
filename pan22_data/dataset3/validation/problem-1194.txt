Corporations with few employees but with huge amounts of data (media business) will not get happy employees if they have to poll an external server for attachments.
I's my job to ensure that the users have a solid and reliable infrastructure to enable them to do their jobs with the maximum of efficiency.
W/ that in mind, I'd be hard pressed to outsource email for any Customer who was large enough to afford an on-site server computer at their office.
If I can remember, this evening I'll take a recent (last week) Customer deployment of SBS 2008 and break down the costs for the installation and migration to Exchange, and we can see what the break-even looks like for a hosted solution.
It also can be integrated with your user management more easily (I.e., I add a user in active directory, they can get a mailbox configured right away, which in our particular case is rather common to have to alter, and I'm sure there are hosted solutions that can allow for connections to remote sites for active directory integration there are plenty where this would be an extra step).
How much will they need to learn on the curve vs. their needs?
not a lot of months of recurring per-mailbox charges to break even).
A check earlier today shows we are currently connected at 1.6Mb inbound and 675Kb outbound.
Our message limit in Exchange is set at 50MB and even that is sometimes not quite enough and images have to be broken apart and resent to us.
It increases availability (if your external connection goes down, they still have internal email available, keeping communication open among employees) and really aside from the basic tasks for any admin'd server it requires little extra care once things like backups are automated and the system is configured.
It's also my job to ensure reliable backups are performed (and tested) so that when something goes wrong there will be minimum impact to the business.
For a small company such as ours a minimum cost of $25,000 just to get fibre installed is just not cost effective.
Even more so when you take into account that we need to cater for large attachments.
The question heavily depends on your talent pool and needs.
My experience is mainly working with small Exchange installations (up to 2,500 mailboxes) and I've yet to see the "TCO horrors" that I read about in trade rags (mainly ads, really) re: Exchange.
We are in the printing industry and need to cater for large print quality graphics.
Connectivity with any sufficient upload bandwidth to handle even tens of users is going to cost a pretty penny, since the local ISP service offerings are stilted heavily toward consumer-style (cable, xDSL) service offerings that have assymetric bandwith.
There are other factors that apply to us due to our location.
Since I've looked into this a couple times, here's why I opted against outsourcing.
On the surface, I'm going to echo the idea that there can't be a single answer to this.
Quit apart from the costs, due to the bandwidth issue any form of hosted service, other than the web sites, is a no-go.
Yes - cached mode will relief some of this problem, but whenever a user changes PC he/she'll will fall asleep infront of the computer.
If you're asking for your IT department (IT person?)
The boss, as far as he's concerned, just wants the unicorns to keep arriving with minimal spam.
For the IT people it comes down to the knowledge pool and learning curve, but in the end the advantages outweigh the negatives.
(Given that this server will be doing more than hosting Exchange I do think it's a bit unfair, but I'll accept that handicap and we'll see what it looks like.)
OST files in Outlook certainly help, but the message still has to fly out to the "cloud" and back again for no good reason.
Properly configured on solid and reliable hardware, w/ a tested and reliable backup scheme, Exchange has worked very well for me.
Employees get literally lost when their e-mail or cell phone stops working = you make less money.
Although we have an ADSL2 line we are near the tail end of the cable run, so at best might get about 2Mb each way.
Having said that, I tend to think that on-premise hosting of Exchange is a "fits most" solution.
I would never feel comfortable moving that to some faceless remote hosting service.
For businesses with small IT departments and smaller needs then for administrative reasons (not sysadmin) they may prefer outsourcing just because they don't mind writing a check to have a service that gives them email.
then it depends on how experienced they are in handling email.
For me personally, outsourcing is the root of all evil.
In my view if the business is large enough to actually have an IT department and a dedicated IP, they probably shouldn't have any problem hosting a mail server.
For my Customers, Internet connectivity typically comes in the flavors the local monopoly cable provider, or the local monopoly telco.
In the end I think administration would prefer it in house because they don't see the bill and really don't care how it works as long as it works.
Assuming I've got an on-site server computer, it seems silly to me to ship all my internal user-to-user emails out to a server on the Internet, only to bring the right back down again.
If you have the resources aviable to run it internally - run it internally.
Sure, if we'd save a ton of money on it (that we can use to hire more salespeople or similar), it'd be a no-brainer.
Imagine the time it would take to forward such messages on internally.
You may be outsourcing to a company that does little more than what your own company would do, but with it being out of sight you're just going to assume they're handling it (until something goes wrong).
That's all they care about is they have email, they don't care if it's internal or external or delivered by unicorn.
I would agree with statements made by other posters stating that there is no "one size fits all" solution.
Knowledge of mail systems (like why 10 meg attachments are generally a bad idea over the wire, while internally there are users that think nothing of huge attachments to each other then balk about cryptic bounce messages from relatives when emailing them the same attachments).
I'd like to crunch some numbers, but I'm pressed on time this morning.
Windows SBS 2008 sets the financial barrier to entry pretty low (i.e.
My approach to outsourcing questions is to put this question first of all: Will it make our business more productive, cost aside?
Aside from reputation from a particular vendor and things you're already able to factor (like reliability of your Internet connection, caps on your internet transfer sizes) you don't know what the internal procedures or condition of the vendor really is.
