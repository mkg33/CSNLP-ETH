b) You can support traffic over a 3G connection, and set up routing as such.
You'll see a little downtime as the new server boots up and you stop the old one but it's a good way of killing two birds with one stone.
Or you could buy new hardware and test your backup strategy by restoring to the new location and shutting down the old.
Migrate database servers by setting up replication and having them migrate automatically then shut off the master and move it down to the new datacenter and bring it back up.
Risking completely losing data and/or equipment is way worse then a day of downtime.
It's more trouble to keep em running then you'd like!
Not to mention the fact that there wouldn't be any network connectivity during the move, so what's the benefit?
I wouldn't want to move a server up 2 floors that still have spinning disks in them.
Buy some heavy duty servers and migrate some servers to virtual servers to host on the new datacenter.
One other option would be to replace all those servers with fewer and do the move in one go by virtualising the servers using a P2V tool.
Moving powered on servers seems like you're asking for trouble.
Schedule downtime for the cutover, or do the move in sections and do it right.
Maybe all goes well... maybe you knock one of your servers over and damage the components inside.
So that you can unplug one, and connect a UPS, before disconnecting it from the mains.
Give your customers a notice that you might have a possible downtime within a certain 24 hour window.
Downtime and move them, virtualize/replicate them to the second site before shutting down the old, and really long rube goldberg ways of moving them while on, which as others pointed out, will give you about a 80% of screwing up and severely damaging the servers.
All in all, it's a good question and don't feel ashamed for asking because it's good to question what is possible.
Schedule downtime and move them as quickly as possible while not screwing up and damaging them in your haste.
Now if you still have found a way to do this and are insane enough to risk doing it.
Basically setup the new servers on the new floor and do a live P2V conversion from the old floor.
