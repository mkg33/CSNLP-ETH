If you are using Thunderbird, you can try installing the SmtpSelect extension.
On top of all the other crucial setting switches which I swear by when using a laptop across various sites.
If that still doesn't work, sign up for a gmail account and use gmail's mail submission port (smtp.gmail.com:587) to send your mail out.
Probably want to use a comprehensive network profile switcher tool like MobileNetSwitch (see page 24); it allows dynamically adjusting SMTP, Outlook, hosts settings when you select a network profile.
Mail Switch is an application that claims to be able to do this for you, selecting the mailserver based on the network you are connected to.
Make one of them with an invalid incoming mail server (such as test), remove that account from the Send/Receive group (Tools > Options > Mail Setup > Send/Receive), and then when you're sending mail, an "Accounts" button appears on the toolbar to switch between which account is sending the mail.
If you are trying to solve the more general problem, most (at least the ones I work with) ISPs allow you to authenticate and submit mail to the mail submission port (587).
If you're using Outlook, just set up two separate POP3 accounts in one profile.
It would help greatly to know what application you're using to send mail.
If you really don't want to do that, setup some sort of smart script that wakes up every n minutes, checks to see where it is, and reconfigures /etc/hosts or /etc/mail/mailertable to redirect the mail appropriately.
