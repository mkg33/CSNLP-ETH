Do you have any recommendations/warnings about these products?
There appears to be several commercial offerings (MAPILab, POPcon, Exchange Connector)
If you want my fetchmail "distribution" you can grab it at: http://opensource.wellbury.com/projects/minimal_cygwin_fetchmail/
Rather than doing a full install of Cygwin onto my server computer, I opted to pull apart a working install and figure out what .DLL files were needed to make fetchmail work.
I had it running as a "Scheduled Task" every 5 minutes for the better part of 2 years with no problems.
This isn't the most current verison of Cygwin or fetchmail, and there may well be security vulnerabilities.
I am upgrading to Exchange Server 2007, and realise that Microsoft does not ship a POP3 connector with 2007.
It speaks plain ol' SMTP, so although I was using it with Exchange 2003 it should work fine w/ Exchange 2007.
Like Sam says, you really should use SMTP to receive your mail if you can, but sometimes you have to do what you have to...
If you're up for trying a free / open-source offering, I've used the Cygwin distribution of fetchmail with success before.
I've been using Exchange Connector for some time now, and it works great.
This all worked for me, but you might want to download the most current versions of all the files in the ZIP, replace them, and verify it works properly.
I also wrote a little script to call fetchmail as a Scheduled Task (because fetchmail needs the HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH environment variables set).
