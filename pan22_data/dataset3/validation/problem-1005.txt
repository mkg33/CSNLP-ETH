Many of them are also using PON and are often capped at a lower rate so that no one user can hog the channel and/or to protect revenues from more expensive buisness fiber products.
As for wireless systems the headline bandwidth figures can be high but real world performance is usually much worse.
I worked on new plant that had to be re-worked to allow QAM256 to work efficiently, so for DOCSIS 3.1 to work, the plant would have to be insanely clean.
Meanwhile a dedicated run of single mode fiber can easilly support 10 gigabit and with the right hardware (which is currently prohibitively expensive) can support far more.
Most current FTTH deployments are using gigabit level techology.
Worse to significantly increase datarates requires replacing that active hardware with another load even closer to the customer.
There are products on the horizon (others have linked some) that can potentially achive those kind of datarates over copper phone wiring and/or cable TV wiring.
This has a theoretical capacity of up to 10 Gbps over existing hardline coax plant.
There are a lot of questions to be answered on deployment though, as far as how much the existing cable plant would have to be conditioned to run at QAM 4096.
It would also be possible to re-splice high bandwidth customers from PON to a dedicated fiber.
That means lots of active hardware spread across meany locations in the field.
Therefore to use them the fiber to copper transition point needs to be moved ever closer to the customer.
In the U.S., and I assume world-wide, CableLabs is working on the DOCSIS 3.1 standard.
Wireless solutions may well be cheaper for low-density deployments (rural, or "back country"), and perhaps under ideal circumstances faster (throughput- rather than latency-wise) than 100 Mbps legacy speeds over access fiber.
There are a lot of questions to be answered but many of the cable companies are banking on it to compete with the coming Google Fiber/ATT onslaught.
On the PON side there is a standard for 10 gigabit PON in development.
