Due to longest prefix length matching, the router will forward traffic destined to hosts 207.45.222.1 to .126 towards the 207.45.222.0/25 network.
So even if you have a host 207.45.222.17 behind eth1, the router will never send it anything.
then you will have in the routing table two entries
(One implication would be a single number 207.45.222.0 being used in many subnets /24, /25, /26, /27, ...)
However, if the router receives a packet with a destination address of 207.45.222.200, the router will select 205.45.222.0/24 as the longest prefix match.
In this example, if the router receives a packet with a destination address of 207.45.222.100, the router will select 207.45.222.0/25 as the longest prefix match.
The router will examine the destination IP address in the IP header and run an algorithm to determine the longest prefix match against the possible routes in its routing table.
From a theoretical standpoint, a number like 207.45.222.0/24 and 207.45.222.0/25 are distinguishable--the first network has an address 24 bits long and the second, 25 bits.
What would be the result of pinging one such address previously assigned to a host (ex: 207.45.222.1/24)?
The easiest way to answer the question of "So what is wrong with the above reasoning?"
However some routers will allow it, so what happens in this case?
part of your question is that you're talking about IP addresses as if they themselves include their prefix length (ex: 207.45.222.1/24), but when another endpoint communicates with you, they're just using your IP, meaning they would have no way of contacting two different "types" of 207.45.222.1.
The /24 network will be unreachable from outside world.
If I subnet to create 207.45.222.0/25 and 207.45.222.128/25, have I effectively given up all those /24 addresses?
You can't use both a full /24 network and in the same time some subnets of this network.
Once the longest prefix match is determined, the router will use the route information to forward the packet.
In the /24 subnet, I would have 256 addresses at my disposal, while in the two /25 subnets, I would have 128 addresses each.
Each route has a different prefix length, written in decimal notation /xx, and represents the number of contiguous binary 1's in the subnet mask.
A router can hold many routes that match the destination IP address of a received packet.
If you configured two networks of 207.45.222.0/24 and 207.45.222.0/25, traffic destined to hosts in the bottom half of 207.45.222.0/24 (.1 to .126) will find they are unable to receive traffic from outside of their subnet (this is quite a common problem when hosts have an incorrectly configured subnet mask).
In answer to your comment on JFL's answer, the specific/closest match is known as the 'longest prefix match' and can be explained as follows.
Below is the binary representation for each prefix.
Therefore, it appears that a router should be able to distinguish between these two subnets and I should be able to use my old /24 addresses alongside my new /25 addresses.
In this case the closest match is 207.45.222.0/25 via eth2 so the router will send the packet out of eth2 (after arp resolution, etc...)
when the router receive a packet for 207.45.222.17 for example, it looks in its routing table for the more specific match (this is a very important point and a fundamental basic of how IP routing works).
What happens to the /24 designation in terms of routing?
First, most router will not allow to configure overlapping network, be it on different interfaces or on the same interface.
