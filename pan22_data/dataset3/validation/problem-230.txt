I'm more familiar with using Ubuntu/Debian servers, are there any significant reasons why I should run another server distro that outweigh being familiar with an OS?
Every time I mention running an Ubuntu server, everyone says I should run Red Hat instead, but I have yet to hear any reasons not to run Ubuntu servers.
If you're using a particularly odd package, or on an odd architecture, it is worth looking into how well supported it is by them however.
We used to run Dapper on a Sun_4v machine, and we would find that vunerabilities would often take large amounts of time to get fixed, and important bugs in areas like NSS would not get fixed at all.
The nice thing about Ubuntu Server is the community support ... seems that more people know Ubuntu than the other flavors, and are usually willing to help if you have trouble.
I'm going to be setting up a network for a small office soon.
RedHat derivatives tend to be much better supported by both software and hardware vendors.
The network will consist of about 5 workstations (soon to be more) and 2-3 servers (one "real" server and a couple workstations-turned-servers to take some load off the main machine).
This has not however, been a problem on ia32/amd64
I've been asking around to see what server Linux distros people prefer, and it seems like everyone is biased towards using traditional RedHat-like server distros.
