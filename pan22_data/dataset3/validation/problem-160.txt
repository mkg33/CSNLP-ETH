Applications that you run while logged in are far more likely to have an impact than GNOME itself.
Why use a Gui on the server box at all, when you can use webmin or ispconfig.
I also cannot imagine Webadmin or any other web app causing a significant performance loss on a server.
But memory is very cheap these days, so this is a small issue.
These are two of the popular web gui interfaces for a linux server.
I can't imagine that the GNOME desktop would slow things down in any appreciable way, except perhaps by using memory that you might want to allocate to other processes.
At the moment that you log in, a number of applications will load, and that will have a momentary impact on CPU performance of other applications due to the disk being heavily used for a few tens of seconds, max.
Not unless you are aggressively using it or unless it is somehow under web attack, causing a large and unusual number of requests going to that web app -- far more than a human being could enter in the same time period.
I see no reason today to run any server without a GUI.
You can do everything server related from a remote desktop with a gui feel to interface.
