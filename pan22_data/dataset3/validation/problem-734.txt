It is a bit about messing around with zypper inquiries.
3) Identify packages from list1, which are not represented in list2:
1) Find installed packages, which come from non-opensuse-distribution-repositories:
Often, I only added them to get a new version of a particular tool, but that newer version is included by default in the updated distribution.
lists all the installed packages and their available versions and repositories.
This should kind of solve the case (tested on openSUSE 11.3).
In a system using Zypper for package management (openSuse, in my case) how can one get a list of all installed packages that are not associated with a currently enabled repository?
When upgrading distributions (e.g., from openSuse 12.1 to 12.2), I disable all non-standard repositories that I've enabled.
from there on you can use the strategies proposed by @ernestopheles to find the ones matching your needs.
You can choose to list only the packages belonging to a certain repository with the -r flag:
The system works, but those packages will never be updated since I removed the providing repository after the upgrade.
Sometimes though, additional packages were installed from the repository, but I don't know how to detect those.
2) Find packages, which are available from opensuse repositories (no matter whether they are installed or not):
