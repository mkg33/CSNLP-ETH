Does ZFS provide a means to implement what I am after, or should I use a different method?
I am currently in the process of setting up a decent home NAS.
The question is what I should put on the removable drives.
I am aware that this poses a risk to new data, but I'm planning to back this up in an alternate way.
Ideally all three removable drives would be in a mirror configuration up to two drive swaps ago, which will allow ZFS to use all of them to fix problems in the old data when restoring the backup.
The others would remain off-site and they'll be rotated every now and then.
The drives will however never be connected at the same time, so this might not be possible.
Initially I thought of putting a zpool on each and using zpool send and zpool recv to update them, like here.
I do however think that it is quite possible that the drives are "damaged" once I need to put back the backup and I would like ZFS to take care of that.
The main concern is integrity of the data and I therefore decided on using ZFS as a filesystem.
Unfortunately this does put some requirements (or recommendations to be more precise) on the hardware that make it a rather expensive solution.
This prohibits me from implementing an off-site backup on a similar system and I am therefore looking for an alternative solution.
Ideally, I would have three removable hard drives of which one would sit near the server and be connected weekly or so.
