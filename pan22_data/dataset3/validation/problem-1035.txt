So this is a really silly answer however I'm not going to delete this question because around the web I have seen this question in a view places and all the answer's didn't work for me so.
Basically I have a Sprite (2D and UI) file in Assets/Resources/Images/BuffIcons, in my code I have this line
(Just had this issue, and opening / closing did not help - Resources.LoadAll() failed to load anything until Reimport All was used.
So I'm 100% sure this problem is something to do with the Unity solution
Checked textures after first close/reopen and they were in an unreadable state in Project tab).
This better than re-opening unity, since that does not always reimport your assets fully when the project is in a funny state.
Going to Unity's menu system, selecting Assets and then Reimport All will do the trick.
as you can see the line of code I provided hasn't changed.
Basically all I had to do was simply close Unity and re-open it, it seems if you create the sprite asset which contains multiple sprites you need to close and reopen Unity, I think this is something to do with the solution file which is constantly updated when stuff changing in your Unity file.
