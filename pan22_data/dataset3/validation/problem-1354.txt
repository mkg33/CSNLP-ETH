It will remove all recipients that were not resolved automatically.
not of the format myemail@example.com but using the person's real name), separated by semi colons, that I would like to put into the To: field in Outlook.
Is there a setting that could delete an email address if the auto resolver doesn't resolve if it's not in the address book?
After installing it, create a new message, paste your recipient list, click the "Check Names" button on Outlook ribbon and after that run the "Sort Message Recipients" tool also on the ribbon.
The problem is, some of these email accounts have been deactivated and I would like to know if there's a way to automatically ignore them if the auto resolver can't resolve them?
Please note that I recommend this tool because I'm one of the developers.
Actually, there is a free Sort Message Recipients utility you can use for that.
If there is no setting, would it be possible to write a program that does this, does Outlook offer APIs with such a capability?
For a list with 100 email addresses and 10 duds, it's tedious task to go through each manually to remove.
