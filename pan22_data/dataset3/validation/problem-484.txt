In "Registry" are stored all the settings for your hardware and software which are crucial for proper operation of Windows and all installed programs.
If you don't mind about your data you can go the easy way and simply reinstall Windows...
Please note: Always create a full image of your Windows installation on external media so you can recover after 10-15 minutes in case of problems.

Hint: Use diskpart.exe to map EFI System partition to Z:
However, i found a solution that i thought should work.
So i went ahead of myself, i changed Windows Boot Loader path from windows\system32\winload.efi to windows\system32\winload.exe.
