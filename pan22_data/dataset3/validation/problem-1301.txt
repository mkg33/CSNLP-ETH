In particular, the motherboard is responsible for figuring out which DIMM to talk to, when the CPU asks for a certain address.
When DDR2 was popular, 1GB sticks were the biggest you cold find.
Did some research unless you gonna buy a sever board using older ram like DDR3 your most likey limited to 16gb which sucks cause i got 24 total.
A little overkill but I use my computer to run video on like 4 monitors to entertain my family, plus one monitor to do high graphics gaming so it adds up.
(More modern CPU's work somewhat differently and need less help from the motherboard)
Next upgrade I plan on using a server board those seem to want more ram, and i found one with 2 processors.
According to Apple's specs, that computer can only take 8GB of RAM, but I have 16GB in it and it works fine.
It's possible it might work with more, but there's no way to know for sure.
They eventually made 4GB sticks but those probably weren't available when the specs for that motherboard were written.
In most cases, the max RAM listed by the vendor is simply the highest amount of RAM they've validated it with.
If the CPU gives an address past 4 GB, and the motherboard doesn't understand that address, it can't find the right DIMM.
