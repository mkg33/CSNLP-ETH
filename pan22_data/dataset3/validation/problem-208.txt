I'm just looking for the least cumbersome method, in case I ever want to do a full Linux re-install.
I have never looked into the nuts and bolts but the drive is on when you boot up so shows up for everyone and we use it for any data that is appropriate to share between users.
My suggestion would be to create a new partition, mount it within /media, e.g.
You'll find new folders mysteriously springing up within your share when you plug in some media e.g an external USB drive.
As far as I know, there is no "Shared Folder" in Ubuntu, like in Windows.
You do not want to lose your photos and home videos due to an accidental click or a command that didn't go as planned.
You could instead place your files within a folder in /media, e.g /media/Lamcro-Media.
If not, it'd be just a location, albeit one tied to a user account.
You should find an existing folder in that location.
Going by your question, I'd say the key is to create a new partition to keep all your media.
I'd like to place all my family's media in one shared folder for everyone to use from any computer.
Failing that, I'd opt for /media/Lamcro-Media as a normal folder, but that's just personal choice.
Chances of accidental deletion of a folder are high when they are in your home directory.
You could then mount it at /media and, if dissatisfied, remount it elsewhere.
/home/media: You could do this, if the new user 'media' will own all the files.
Same basic idea as the new partition without repartitioning.
/media/Lamcro-Media and then place your files there.
If you ever had to reinstall linux, you would be able to leave this partition untouched, and mount it again on the newly installed system.
I'd avoid this, just  because I don't get the logic behind a userid for my media.
I use the same naming convention on each client to keep things simple.
I would recommend creating and using a /srv mount point for "services provided by your system".
I then mount these directories using NFS on all other family computers on the network.
This is where Ubuntu auto-mounts any external media.
