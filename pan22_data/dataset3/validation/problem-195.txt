Do I need to share sessions between the two servers?
Server 2 does not share sessions with server 1, and the user is kicked out.
In addition to reconfiguring your load balancer you may want to consider sharing sessions across the two servers.
This means that you have to install the SSL certificate into load balancer.
[If you can tell us what kind of load balancer you're using helpful information on configuring it may go here :-)]
You said that the load balancer was set up to tend to keep sending the user to the same server as their first request -- sounds like that is not working on SSL, but was working before SSL.
Your load balancer is likely using HTTP header data to determine which box it's sending your users to (instead of judging by IP address).
For .NET see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317604  For PHP see: http://kevin.vanzonneveld.net/techblog/article/enhance_php_session_management/
I traced the issue to the fact that while initial authentication is performed by server 1, clicking on internal links leads to having the request sent to server 2.
This worked fine for our web apps until we added SSL to the setup.
If you want to have session stickiness in your load balancer, then you have to terminate the SSL on the load balancer.
(The advantage of sharing sessions is that your servers provide seamless redundancy: If server 1 is down for maintenance server 2 can pick up all of its sessions without forcing users to log in again)
Sounds like a config issue with the load balancer; are you able to provide info on what it is and how it's configured?
I have two physical Apache servers behind a load balancer.
A 3rd solution would be to keep the sessions in a common database (e.g.
Now the user can successfully login, see the home page, but clicking on any other internal links logs the user right out.
Another solution is to configure the load balancer to use source IP stickiness for SSL (HTTPS).
It sounds like (hard to say for sure without more information) that persistence is not fully implemented in your Apache configuration for the load balancer.
If so, could you point me to a good guide for doing this?
The load balancer was supposed to be set up so that a user would always be sent to the same physical server after the first request, to preserve sessions.
Take a look at the Load Balancer Stickyness section on the Apache documentation for mod_proxy_balancer.
