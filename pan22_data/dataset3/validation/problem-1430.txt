Here are two that I found helpful but there are others.
Once you get the boxes online with an administrative user, you should be able to do all your administration remotely with a little scripting.
Any system that assumes I'm perfect is, itself, not.
For some sets of systems I have a config script which tests against a "default install" and systematically sets up everything the way I want it modified, removing some packages, installing others, setting permissions, synchronizing user files, etc.
Cobbler is just used to manage the network pxeboot deployment of the install media and preseed/kickstart files.
I suggest you remaster a CD with the preseed option as explained on the linked guide, and automatically configure the rest using puppet.
I know that Linux Mint (an Ubuntu derivative) has an OEM mode that allows you to save a package set and any other customization to use on multiple installs.
This is used in addition to preseed which is still required to automate the install process.

You will find the world a little more fragmented than MDT, but it can all be done.

Then puppet can take over from there for configuration and change management.
Some desktop environments like Gnome also have their own config deployment system where you can control permissions and things like the contents of menus across a mass deployment.
If you have a puppet recipe of any complexity you'll want to test your work.
d-i preseed/late_command string sed -i 's/START=no/START=yes/' /target/etc/default/puppet
You can use a preseed schema to do the initial install.
Puppet will re-order the configuration steps on each run.
When you do and it succeeds you'll assume that it works on all of your other hosts.
EDIT: I forgot to mention FAI, Fully Automatic Installation.
There are a few blog posts out there that outline using Cobbler with Ubuntu.
Proponents will tell you that you can setup your requires appropriately so that it works well.
I would recommend any other configuration management system over puppet.
