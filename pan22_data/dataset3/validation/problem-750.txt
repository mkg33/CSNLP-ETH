By default this is set to run every 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
As a personal project I've been working on a home NAS system using FreeNAS.
It's possible for a disk to fail a SMART test and still seem to work fine for weeks or even months.
So my question is: How frequently should a SMART check be run on a drive?
I'm a software engineer, not a system admin, so if this question seems a little green you know why!
The outputs are parsed, filtered and emailed back to me in a daily report.
SMART helps to detect indicates that suggest the disk is likely to fail.
(at least you can check its source code to see how often smartd reads the status)
I run a short SMART test every morning that takes about 5 minutes on all of my 1.5 to 2TB drives.
In this case, it is more important WHAT will be done with such reading.
After all, it makes little sense to read the status every minute if you, the admin, will only look at this once in a month.
I'm under the impression that these tests do not stress the drives in any way and the only confirmation I have of this is that their temperature remains at baseline (about 37C) during the long tests.
One of the features of FreeNAS is the ability setup a SMART check to run ever X number of seconds.
Then once a week I run a long SMART test that takes about 7 hours.
If you need help, maybe the smartmontools project might be useful.
This seemed high to me though, is this really a reasonable value?
Supposing you are asking for checking the SMART status, then every 60, 30, 15, 10 or 5 minutes, or whatever is good enough.
Will it be checked for failure and e-mailed when a failure is detected?
I would think checking once every 6 hours or something would be reasonable enough...
