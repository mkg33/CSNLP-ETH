The script never detects that you've corrected the problem.
If you build your Zimbra server in a private range behind some NAT router it could be handy to install a tool like DNSMASQ on that server.
In all of your examples you are showing an IP of 127.x.x.x.
The script pulls only the first line that contains:
Ubuntu places the IPv6 loopback as the first line, so even if you have the suggested line:
Just Reboot Your Server after reconfiguring /etc/hosts file.
Do not install zimbra-dnscache, because you're running your own version now.
It did not worked, until I set my own hostname to match whatever it is in /etc/hosts.
There is a bug in their detection script for this.
That way your hostname and dns resolver are always in sync on that server and Zimbra should be happy whatever NAT, proxy, VPN or other real connection you have to the internet.
Solution: Make sure you specify the 127.0.0.1 line ABOVE any IPv6 configuration and the script will succeed.
I've also encountered this issue when installing on Ubuntu 14.04.
