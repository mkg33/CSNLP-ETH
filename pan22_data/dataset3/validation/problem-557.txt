I had originally gone into the local user users, and under groups, the 'user' I had removed 'domain users', NT Authority\Authenticated Users, and NT Authority\Interactive.
Whenever anyone other than the main system administrator (domain\administrator) logs in, I get a solid black screen with mouse.
I 'believe' I did it in the Group Policy of that machine, but I don't recall how.
All other users were not supposed to be able to log in.
I locked it down to 2 users (but I do not recall HOW I locked it down) on the domain.
But my documentation doesn't include HOW I did it.
I have an issue that I caused months ago, but do not remember how I caused it so that I can now undo it.
I can log into the system as the main administrator on the domain.
The initial request was to lock down the Windows 8 computer to a single user.
Once I realized what I had done I was able to go back in, remove the individual users, add in the 3 I had initially removed, and boom, working correctly.
In their place I had put the individual users I wanted to allow.
