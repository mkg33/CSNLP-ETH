Your best bet is to either use the new Windows Virtual PC or VirtualBox and the like.
You'd need to run the server version of Windows 7, AKA Server 2008 R2 or whatever it ends up being called.
but there a couple features of Hyper-V that I would like to take advantage of.
I know that I can do this with some of the other virtualization pacakges (Windows Virtual PC, VirtualBox, etc.)
I would say it isn't possible to use Hyper-V on Windows 7.
Is it possible to install Hyper-V on Windows 7 x64?
Windows 7 is a client OS and thus does not support the bare metal (level 1) Hyper Visor technology that Win2k8 server does.
Finally an important note (since you already have VM) is that Hyper-V machines do not natively run on the new virtual PC due to HAL issues (I have yet to try uninstalling the Hyper-V components first, but I suspect it won't work because the HAL is a driver update).
I would like to set up a couple of virtual servers running on the same box as my desktop OS.
So it is much faster than the old one, but not as fast as native Hyper-V.
You could put Server 2008 with Hyper-V as the host and use Windows 7 as a guest machine.
The trade off is that with this you get more hardware support (USB devices are fully supported) and some of nicer features like drag/drop support.
However Windows 7 does have a new Virtual PC client - which is NOT the same as the old one (which used emulation), this basically uses a level 2 hyper visor.
