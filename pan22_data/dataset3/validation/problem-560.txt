I'm trying to create a log of an inventory that runs daily
For example, I use "cron" for all my job scheduling outside of PostgreSQL, so I use it for PostgreSQL as well, using something like psql -f job.sql as the command to run.
For the query itself, you can't expect the job to run at exactly midnight down to the nanosecond.
is there a way to fill up my log table without having to do it manually every day?
How to make this insert to be done daily in an automated form rather than manually?
If you already have a generic job scheduler in use in your IT environment, I'd recommend making use of that, rather than installing and configuring and learning a new one just for PostgreSQL.
My log table is id serial, date date, count_of_status1 integer, count_of_status2 integer
Basically on my log table i want to sum how many units have status1, how many units have status2, etc for every day
PostgreSQL does not have a built in job scheduler.
You will have to arrange for the job to be able to connect to the database without a password--there are several ways to do that depending on your security environment.
So run the job several minutes after midnight (to make sure clock skew doesn't cause it to accidentally run before midnight), and put WHERE clauses in the query that uses a timestamp in the table to pull out the data exactly aligned to date boundaries.
