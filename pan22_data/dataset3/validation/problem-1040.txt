I have a GlusterFS volume hosted on a remote fileserver.
You must provide the VOLUME NAME in the mount command, not the PATH.
In my case I had not set the secure-access option on the client (making it use the glusterfs.ca file in /etc/ssl/)
If you are not using RPM packages it is possible you are experiencing this bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1191176
I can mount the volume from my webservers in the same DC as well as other servers in other DCs however when I try to mount the volume on my local dev server the mount fails with the following log entry:
I've verified that the firewall is not blocking the packets, all machines are running the same version of GlusterFS from the same repo and I can telnet to the gluster ports from the local server but I'm still unable to mount the volume on any machines within my local network.
I ran in to this issue today, I have ssl enabled for clients and servers.
gluster volume sync <HOSTNAME> [all|<VOLNAME>] - sync the volume information from a peer
