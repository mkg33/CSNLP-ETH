I've used Jira in teams as well, and it sucks by comparison -- way too heavy IMO.
You get revision control on docs, and easy sharing.
It's very flexible, does time-tracking, has revision control on documents and so on.
But if not, I definitely agree with KRB that google docs is the cheapest, most effective option for a solo or a 2-4 person team even.
It ties in with various bug tracking solutions and with source control (Subversion, not sure which others but almost certainly Git as well at this stage), and the solution as a whole for project management ties together really well and intuitively.
I also really like their to-do approach, and the use of Textile for quick formatting when typing up docs and messages to teammates.
Just give them accounts with bug tracker permissions and wait for the feedback =]
BaseCamp is nice, if you're willing to pay the money after the 30-day trial (about $12 / mo.
For programming specific task on the personal schedule we use Google Calendar, for project hosting we use Google Code, and for exchange big files and other stuff the best option is Dropbox.
More friendly when working in teams, than google docs is.
to extend it but just the basic bug tracker, time tracker, calendar, wiki and SVN integration makes it a no brainier for me.
For the project management we use Rally: http://www.rallydev.com/ that it's oriented to agile methodologies like Scrum, you can track tasks, milestones, defects of all the members of your project, calendar activities, backlog, etc..., and it's on web so it's very easy to update.
And the interface is just so clean, a lot of plugins etc.
Especially great when you start working with multiple people, expanded team or beta testers.
Bitbucket is a free alternative to the paid private repositories found on Github.
So simple, free to install if you have a server to put it on.
Recently I started with a team a game project and during the design phase of the game we decide use some tools that may help you on the long run.
I personally use an 8$/month plan for a serious game project I'm working on and it's really great (includes tickets, SVN, milestones, wiki).
My friends and I also use assembla for our common open source projects and class assignments as it makes managing a software development team a real breeze.
The only downside is that unless you choose one of their community/open source packages (which prevent you from making your "space", as they call it, private) that come with a subset of the available tools, you need to pay a monthly fee depending on the options you want.
I've used Assembla for a while and it's very powerful, especially if you're going to be working with a team (small or large) at some point.
It provides many tools (SVN/Git/CVS, milestones, tickets, wiki, a file archive and many more).
It is a bit harder to use, but you won't pay a penny.
It's up to you to decide if the community/open source packages fit your needs or if you can/want to afford one of their monthly plans.
I understand it also integrates a sort of chat solution when you pay for the add-on called CampFire(?).
