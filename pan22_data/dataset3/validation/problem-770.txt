having seen many similar exploit attempts in logs for over a decade, I long ago bailed out on attempting to add referrer IPs to deny lists -- because with literally millions of Windows clients pwned by bot-herders large and small, you end up creating lookup overhead for every request, thus increasing server latency more than you can ever gain from filtering out the ever-changing attack sources.
there isn't a reference to /home/FTPUSER/public_html/category anywhere in the code, any suggestions?
It appears to me that you are seeing the results of some sort of automated/deliberate attack on your web server.
I am trying to work out why we are getting alot of error coming into our apache error log that state 'File does not exist:' e.g.
Someone or some program is looking for an application possibly that was installed with no password or a default password or an application with a known vulnerability.
you could then grep this file for the time from the apache error log and see if that shows up anything?
please also note that /category/epson-stylus-c40sx/497/0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0/1 is a mod rewrite rule for cat.php?id=497 etc...
I'm with k3ri & ericmayo -- it's an automated exploit attempt.
We get these all the time on the web sites we host and for anything like this, we can't respond too, we have either a custom 404 page or we issue a custom 301 to the home page of the site in question.
you could try looking at the access log for that domain to see if there is any correlation between a specific request and the generation of that error.
File does not exist: /home/FTPUSER/public_html/category, referer: http://www.DOMAIN.co.uk/category/epson-stylus-c40sx/497/0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0/1
