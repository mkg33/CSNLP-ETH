IF the driver supports it you can open a command prompt cmd with admin rights to set up an ad-hoc wireless network using the netsh command.
But it works with Android devices that are compatible.
Your understanding is basically correct, but the Windows implementation is lacking.
Being unable to do this leads me to believe that it would be similarly hard to set it up with an iPhone, as IOS uses its own implementation which also does not play nice with Windows or Linux (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28448274/wi-fi-direct-and-ios-support).
You shouldn't try connecting that wifi instead you should go to Wi-Fi Direct option on your mobile phone and there you will find your Laptop/PC listed there.
You can use netsh wlan set hostednetwork to get some more information.
A Wi-Fi Direct connection would not need to create an access point and would not need to define a pre-shared key.
The Windows Wi-Fi Direct implementation is however (in my experience) not compatible with *nix devices.
Use the netsh wlan start hostednetwork command to start the network with the settings you defined.
As you correctly mention the PIN option is one method for Wi-Fi Direct to be set up.
I have successfully set up a Wi-Fi Direct connection between two Linux devices, but have not been able to set up a connection between a linux device and a windows device.
Set up the desired network ssid using netsh wlan set hostednetwork ssid="<SSID>" key="<passphrase>".
Settings up a network with a pre-shared key is considered a fallback/legacy solution which is what you're seeing here (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.devices.wifidirect.wifidirectlegacysettings)
