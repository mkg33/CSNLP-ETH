You may need to clear the Windows Events log if it is full.
Almost every time I restart the machine hosting a SQL Server 2008 R2 express server, the database goes through the restore process.
Most of the time, the database will become stuck in the restore process.
I do not know the cause of the memory consumption, however it answers the problem I was having here.
2011-12-09 10:13:18.86 spid13s     Service Broker manager has shut down.
It turns out the problem was that the database was out of internal memory due to issues with the Service Broker.
2011-12-09 10:13:18.86 spid13s     Error: 17054, Severity: 16, State: 1.
The database simply ran out of allowed memory in express edition.
Any obvious reason as to why I cannot restart the system without the database needing to go through a restore.
2011-12-09 10:12:51.16 Server      SQL Server is terminating because of a system shutdown.
2011-12-09 10:13:18.86 spid13s     The current event was not reported to the Windows Events log.
After restarting the service, all of the memory that was consumed by the broker is still being reloaded and maxing out the available memory.
This error was found in the windows event log: The SQL Server (__NAMEHERE__) service terminated unexpectedly.
