Many systems are somewhere in between, so find a happy medium that allows the occasional large workload to get enough CPU to complete quickly, without strangling your OLTP workloads.
I also have stumbled about the article http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2806535 and cannot find the correlation to the scripts above.
If hyperthreading is enabled, this column seems to reflect the number of logical processors exposed.
That way schedules aren't trying to access memory across numa nodes.
During installation of SQL Server 2019 CTP 3.0 there is a new tab MaxDOP.
Generally speaking, you don't want DOP to be higher than the number of physical cores.
The documentation claims I should be seeing a different figure entirely.
This version gives you a nice single result set with the existing MAXDOP setting and should hold up on versions SQL 2008-2017 without the need to use xp_cmdshell.
Also I'm wondering, why there exists a differentiation for "@logicalCPUs >= 8 and @HTEnabled = 1 and @NoofNUMA = 1" and "@logicalCPUs >= 8 and @HTEnabled = 1 and @NoofNUMA > 1" as the result becomes the same.
As a general rule, use higher DOP for an OLAP system, and lower (or no) DOP for an OLTP system.

Also, be careful about using the cpu_count column to get a core count.
The number I see on our system suggests it could either be the number of physical cores in the entire system, or the number of logical processors per chip.
There's also a hyperthread_ratio column, but I'm not certain what it represents.
Spreading a heavy parallel workload across logical processors will just increase overhead with no real benefit.
The actual value is predefined(in previous versions the default was 0).
When setting MAXDOP you typically want to limit it to the number of cores in a NUMA node.
After all I ended up writing my own piece of code matching the article from above, though even there I would have loved a more precise definition and/or differentiation about "processors" "CPU" and "physical processors".
