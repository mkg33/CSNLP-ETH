There is only one major different between LM and ubuntu .
My question is, if LM is based on Ubuntu, does that mean I get to use any or all of the ubuntu packages on LMint also?
Please also guide me to get the key difference, from a packages point of view, between these two distros.
LM comes with some pre-installed applications otherwise LM & Ubuntu are same they are using same repo's.
I like gnome and its intuitiveness, so was looking for another linux distro when linux Mint came to my mind.
Linux Mint also uses apt for packages and since it's based on ubuntu the repositories should be compatible.
When you are not sure about switching distributions you can always try them in a virtual machine (tutorial for ubuntu host) without doing harm to your old system.
So since they use the same basic package manager and you find many tutorials about using each other repositories when you google "ubuntu mint repositories" I would say most ubuntu packages should work on mint (without trying).
Or are there any restrictions imposed by LM on the packages?
i have been using ubuntu 12.04 for quite sometime and was happy until i decided to upgrade to 12.10 which IMO does not match even upto 12.04..
I see they have a different software center, which to me looks like a form of Synaptic Package Manager.
Linux mint is based on ubuntu so most of the packages in ubuntu are also available in mint, But they use different repositories , So you can't say every package in ubuntu is available in mint repository and vice versa
You can easily install mint interface(cinnamon) in ubuntu
I have been reading on it and came to know that LM is based on Ubuntu.
Also, would I be able to use the Ubuntu Software Center on Linux Mint?
I use Ubuntu for programming so LAMP, sublime text, etc.. are required, then i use Lightread for RSS, etc.
The packages available in the official repositories depend on the distribution for Linux Mint you find a list here.
