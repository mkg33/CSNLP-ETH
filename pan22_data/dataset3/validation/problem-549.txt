But otherwise you'll need to look elsewhere to debug this - the NAS or Windows logs.
Could anybody help me please to find any solution for that?
(to get my client connects successfully with AES).
You may ask why I want AES.. that is because MICROSOFT windows does NOT have TKIP algorithm for enterprise WPA2 connections.
(may be just to annoy us and make the matter harder).
I used EAP-TTLS PAP because I have hashed passwords in my OpenLDAP directory.
I tried all the open source free third party software to be able to use the not supported protocols, but they where all very old and they didn't work, and I am trying to do everything natively without any thrid party software.
In case I used TKIP algorithm in my router for that WPA2 access point, everything goes very well and the clients can connect from my android phone just normally.
BUT when I use AES, the clients cannot connect any more, and I don't know why, the log seems very good, and I tried and searched a lot with unfortunatelly no success.
However, as it was working with TKIP and the only thing you have changed is this to AES, that points to FreeRADIUS likely not being the problem and you should look elsewhere.
I setup successfully an enterprise wifi connection with LDAP authentication by the mediation of Freeradius.
Given that FreeRADIUS returns an Access-Accept, there are limited things that could have caused this.
Here is my Freeradius log: http://pastebin.com/gF1tBGkM
