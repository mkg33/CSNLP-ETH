That allows you to format cells based on their values or attributes, and can make the cells either look, or behave a specific way based on their current value.
Conditional Formatting has literally endless options and cell attribute commands, I am sure if you google this function there are non visible tags you enter in.
Then you just traverse the cells in the range in a loop, and read the values.
But the formula for coding this into a C# program would be similar.
You should read up on conditional rule formatting.
When searching a sheet or workbook, you can search comments as an option button.
The cells that belong to a range, can be any combination of cells from a worksheet.
I thought it would quite efficient if I could implement a mechanism that searches an entire excel file and only reads from the cells that have a certain "tag" to it.
Is it possible to actually create some sort of tag for excel cells that I can later on reference with C#?
So I'm trying to build a C# program that reads data from excel cells.
Searching for a tag in all cells of an Excel file is very inefficient.
Perhaps that might be a way to tag cells manually, then have your C# program query any cells with comments.
Another option is right clicking the cell, you can "Add Comment".
a Range that consists of the cells you want to read.
