Im currently writing a terrain editor for my game (for the record: no commercial intentions) and after having implemented the terrain morphing to my liking im now working on the texturing of said terrain.
I hope my question is clear enough, please leave a comment if there has to be more information.
This doesnt work all too bad but it creates a lot of artifacts or sharp lines between chunks.
One chunk of terrain can consist of up to 4 different layers of textures which are blended together using a 4-byte rgba texture with alpha values.
In a first approach ive been doing very simple modification of that blending (pseudocode):
Inside the inner radius no interpolation depending on the distance to the center happens, between inner and outer radius linear interpolation between the pressure on the inside and 0 is created.
The brush currently consists of an inner and an outer radius (as seen in the image).
The alpha values are 0-255 and together add up to 255, so the blending on the gpu happens like this:
