My previous PC had a similar issue, even at Idle it would report a system temperature of 61C.
3:  The northbridge is always working, even when you think the computer is idle, all the disk IO, graphics, Wifi etc, run through there, so it's always doing something.
It would be fairly trivial to add a fan or reposition an existing fan to make sure the Northbridge is getting enough airflow.
Even if the reported "System Temperature" is correct, it's unlikely this is high enough to damage your hardware even if sustained over time.
Both were ~500 watt, so I think it was an efficiency issue, not a power issue.
This is frequently the Northbridge temperature and since your specific motherboard doesnt have a fan on the northbridge it makes sense the temps would be a little higher than normal.
The reported temperature is probably the motherboard ACPI temperature.
I would recommend adding a small fan that blows over the northbridge, but it's probably okay without it also.
After replacing the PSU (after the old one was seen sparking) this was reduced to 45C.
To put the temperature into perspective the i7-4770k processor that you have is stable well into the 80 degree Celsius range (but not recommended).
1:  51 degrees C is a bit warm but nothing to get too riled up about.
Some motherboards may report a temperature that is some 10-20 degrees higher than it really is, resulting in this unexpectedly high value.
