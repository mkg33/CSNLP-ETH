What I did was to give a normal mail account Full Access and Send As permissions to the shared mailboxes.
What I did was to set up one shared mailbox for each client (for me this was 7 shared mailboxes total).
- Finally, I have also used this setup to include a couple programs we use that require a SMTP server.
Hopefully this helps someone else with their problem.
- This solution works well for us since Shared Mailboxes don't require an active 365 license, so there is no extra cost.
The program was then set to email directly to our ticket system and shows up as coming from the shared mailbox.
One possible solution for those using Exchange Online (365):
- This does leave the message have the "FW: " appended to the email subject line as well as the typical message forward text saying the original sender, recipient, and time at the top of the email body text.
where I created a rule to forward any mail from our vendor to our ticket system.
Then I could enter the 365 SMTP settings with the login being our maintenance account and the "send as" was the client specific mailbox.
I used our maintenance email because all of our normal user emails require password changes ever 90 days, which would require us to constantly update the password on our programs as well, but our maintenance email is a static password.)
The final step was to change the notification email from our vendor to send mail to the shared mailbox associated with each of our clients.
"Settings -> Mail -> Automatic Processing -> Inbox and sweep rules"
Our email is hosted through Exchange Online (365), so that limited our options.
(NOTE: The normal mail account will require an active license since it has to log into the mail server.
Then I logged into the web mailbox for a given client and went to
- I imagine the same thing could be done using the desktop version of Outlook, but then Outlook would have to remain open to forward the messages.
We did not have any SMTP filters that could be configured to help us.
(We had a maintenance account so that is what I used.)
The only option that I could change on our vendor's end was the email where notices were sent.
- I also set up a rule that would automatically delete the automatic replies from our ticketing system and other junk mail just to keep the mailbox clean.
I had essentially the same problem (as Ben) where I had a vendor sending status emails to our ticketing system that I wanted to automatically assign to one of our clients.
This really did not make a difference for our techs, but may be a deal breaker for someone.
Then I added that shared mailbox address to our ticket system's contact list as a contact under the correct client.
