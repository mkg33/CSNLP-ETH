And yes, I get a new one if there was a bunch of sugar in the coffee.
The best way to clean your keyboard on bit-tech.net
I still follow the same from above, just remove the keyboard first.
Or, take the affect key(s) off and then use some warm water to 'clean' the coffee off of it.
It will probably never really go back to it's old self.
This only works for really basic keyboards though.
I've put countless keyboards in the dishwasher, and they've all come out like new.
If it's a keyboard and the coffee was plain coffee (no cream, no sugar, no caramel, etc) unplug, dunk it under running water, let it dry and away you go.
As soon as you add sugar, or it's a crappa, latta just toss it.
If you have fancy extra media keys, or it's a bluetooth/wireless keyboard, forget it.
I have successfully recovered a broken laptop keyboard in this way.
Not that I'm speaking from a personal experience or anything eye roll
Unplug the keyboard, disassemble it as much as is feasible and submerge in Isopropyl.
You should be able to take the keyboard apart (screws on the bottom side) then clean it.
Generally Isopropyl Alcohol (Rubbing Alcohol) is a good choice for cleaning electronics.
It's just not worth my time to spend 4 hours cleaning a keyboard, when I can get a new one for about $75.
Make sure to allow the keyboard time to dry after you are finished, test, and repeat if necessary.
