Print off a configuration page and make sure you've got (at least) the following versions:
Existing entries can be edited from the Folder tab.
Section 4.7 shows how to do the same from the printer's front panel.
See what options you have for SSL in the File Transfer menu.

If you're scanning to Windows 8/Mac OS X 10.7/Windows Server 2012 or later, you'll need to make sure you've got up-to-date firmware for your machine.
Also, the scan to folder used to work, but it no longer does.

User Tools > Printer Features > Configuration Page

Are both of these issues connected, and how can I work around the LDAP.
Have a look at the paper starting at Section 4.3 (pg 10) in that manual.
: I have fed in all the other network/admin settings for the scan to email function.
