The idea is that the certificate will protect the VPN from anyone else, and the FreeRADIUS login from the user itself (should the user's login need to be revoked).
I've just managed to setup OpenVPN properly on my server and test it to be properly working with client computers and I came to wonder how OpenVPN keys can be generated as clients come and go.
You can also tie the CN (that houses the user login name) of the user cert to a login that you can administer, for example, with FreeRADIUS.
Is it neccessary to rebuild the diffie helman .dh file and recreate all previous client keys as I just need to add or remove a client?
I have got my own Certificate Authority and anytime I need new client I just create another certificate.
It is simple and I am pretty sure you can do same thing even with easyRSA delivered with openVPN.
It is also more universal, because you can easily manage certificates for another services such as apache, etc.
This way you can simply block user access by removing them from FreeRADIUS user list.
You can find the script and additional detail here.
I wrote a small integration script couple of years ago.
