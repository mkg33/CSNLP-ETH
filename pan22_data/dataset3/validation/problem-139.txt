You would execute this command on ALL Slaves which will have them stop at exact same position.
You can use Percona Monitoring Tools's pmp-check-mysql-replication-delay / pmp-check-mysql-replication-running.
If you miss the position of a binlog to purge you could affect all your slaves.
If you cannot afford more space, another option is to use : START SLAVE .... UNTIL
But few of them are keep disconnecting due to network issue.
If  you are to avoid disconnects due to transient network issues, depending on which MySQL you're on you may want to set combination of master-retry-count / slave-net-timeout / master-connect-retry.
I would also set up pt-heartbeat to monitor Mysql slave delay.
If you are running out of space, because your binlog are too large, I would check if you can use SQL Statement binlog format or mixed.
Btw, 7 days worth binary logs (with backups) are sufficient but again depends on policies!
The first thing I would do is fix the network issue.
You may simply write a shell script to look at io_thread and sql_thread values and alert if they're NO.
1) You could just stop purging if any of the slaves are unreachable(ssh or mysql) from the server where you are running this purging script
You would then check all slave to make sure they all stopped at same position.
You should rather monitor your slaves for replication lag or if it's actually catching-up / connected with master or not!
2) If the connectivity issue is only with MySQL and not SSH, you could get the positions from master.info files of the slaves
PURGE BINARY LOGS BEFORE '2015-08-27 00:00:00';  (easier to use, don't need to find out position)
You may google for setup instructions to setup with Nagios or setup with Zabbix or this.
Master is the driver of all your transactions, you want to make sure it is healthy and have room to grow.
There are already many scripts available for reference.
Is there any way that i can make sure before setting up the bin log purging script on master that all the slave have read upto certain bin logs which we can purge?
