Many of these types of IP addresses appear on RBLs and are likely increasing the likelihood of your email being treated as spam.
The reverse DNS lookup for your VPS's IP address should match the hostname that your mailserver says HELO with.
You have to get your VPS host to add the record for you.
Of course the IP could be an old IP address of theirs that they sold back to their host, and you just happened to get it.
5) X-Get-Message-Sender-Via: dom.domainbrokerage.co.uk: authenticated_id: grantw/from_h
The problem here is that the authenticated_id is not an email address.
Note that you cant do this via your domain name zone file.
If there's a possibility to remove that header, do so.
3) If you're proficient with tcpdump or wireshark, you could try to packet capture the email as it goes out and get the response from the gmail server.
There are still traces of what I must assume is your IP address/hostname in the question, which if I'm correct, looks very much like you are sending email from an ISPs pool of addresses.
I'd say to try using a different gmail email address to test that theory.
I'd check with their support if you haven't already.
By masking hostnames and IP addresses from your question, I think you are also masking the problem itself.
1) Make sure your mail server PTR record is set to reflect the same as your MX record, not the same as your server hostname.
6) X-PHP-Script: www.domainbrokerage.co.uk/admin.php for 95.172.231.27
With a VPS, my guess would be a missing reverse DNS record (PTR).
I've had to raise a support ticket with the VPS provider in the past to get this done.
In cpanel, setup an dedicated email address that is not the master email account for the cpanel account.
2) Your IP address appears to be a WebsiteWelcome/HostGator IP address.
Gmail may see this and block based on that but its just a hunch.
4) Bear in mind that Gmail also treats email for every person differently because their spam filters know that what some people consider spam, others don't -- so it could very likely be that you've flagged something similar to what is coming from your server as spam (even though the content is the same as what you're sending through the mail client), and so gmail is picking up on that.
