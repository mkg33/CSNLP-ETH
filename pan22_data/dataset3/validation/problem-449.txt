Has anyone had a similar issue which with they may be able to shed any light on?
You need to get better information from an affected device - to find out exactly what is redirecting and where.
They can access the site via a US proxy, and also (which i don't understand) via a Japanese Web Proxy.
Also, check how many redirects you get when accessing the site locally - and start investigating where and why they are happenning.
If the site is not using TLS, then start using it.
It reduces (but does not eliminate) the ability of third parties to interfere with your traffic.
The clients client is able to access other sites on the same server, but the particular website in question.
I'm having an issue with a clients domain, which for some reason cannot be accessed by their clients in Japan.
There doesn't seem to be any issue accessing the site from other countries, and the client in Japan has tried on several devices and varying networks with no success.
The error reported by the clients client is ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS.
Normally redirects should only arise on the origin server - but in this day there are a lot of people who think that they know better than the people who designed HTTP and sell products labelled as "Security".
