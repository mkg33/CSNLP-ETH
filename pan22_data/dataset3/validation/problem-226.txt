But no, there is not much more than the geographical location (and only if properly registered) than you can get from the IP.
From the header info of a user's browser there's a fair bit more info, such as the browser used, and which page the user has come from.
This is why you can log into a website and see local business ads popup.
what exactly is the info you can gather that would be useful based sole on the IP address and how can i get this info?
When you say "site" I'm assuming you mean website.
It really depends on the purpose of your collection of IPs.
You could get the name of the registrar of the IP address range.
I have to say though, if a site were scanning my ports when I visited, I wouldn't go to that site anymore.
If the access was from a company, then it could have a fixed address you can trace, but it doesn't have to.
If the access was from a home computer, then it probably has a dynamic IP address, and you would only find out to which provider the address belongs.
However, without actively scanning ports there isn't much beyond that IP would tell you.
I am trying to figure of this benefit is justified.
For example, from an IP address you can identify the geographical location of the visitor and use that to target certain banner advertisements.
IP would also be necessary if the site were hacked and you were attempting to identify the offender.
I put up a site and saving all the IP addresses of users is adding some overhead.
I know the IP information can be used to audit and trace things back to the user of that IP.
I never used an IP address for anything other than correlating user activity for trending and site usage metrics.
Only bigger companies have fixed addresses today, or ones that really need it because they offer some services to the internet.
