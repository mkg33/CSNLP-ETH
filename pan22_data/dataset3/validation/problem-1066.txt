Right now, I removed the password, even though I haven't yet tried rebooting to see if the following problem has been avoided.
I have a feeling this is a setting in Local Security Policies, but I'm not sure.
My question is, how can I disable the welcome screen and automatically log into an account?
I haven't found anything special I've done to bypass the Welcome Screen on my own box (which has bypassed it by default since I installed it), so removing your password should do the trick.
Uncheck [Use the Welcome Screen] and [Use Fast User Switching]
Click [Start] [Run] and type control userpasswords2
On [Users] tab, clear the [Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer] check box.
Currently, when I boot up the computer, I have to go to the welcome screen, enter the user's password, and log in.
Enter a user name and password that should be used to logon automatically in the dialog box that appears.
I would suggest going ahead and restarting--you've likely already solved the problem.
Go to [Control Panel] [User Accounts] [Change the Way Users Log On and Off].
