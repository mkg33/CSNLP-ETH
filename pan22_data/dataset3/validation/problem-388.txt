To turn it off, the b:browsefilter variable needs to be cleared.
Since I work on files having many different extensions, I find myself having to change the selected option almost every time I open a file.
That said, the file filter is set by some filetype plugins.
My question relates to the Edit File dialog box that appears when File->Open is selected from the gvim menu bar.
Use :edit, write your own mappings for custom locations, or use one of the various file finder plugins (FuzzyFinder, CtrlP, ...) found on vim.org.
I wish to change the default selected option of the file types selector to be 'All Files (*.
For example, if I have a '.xml' file open when I attempt to open another file, the default selected option is 'XML Files (*.xml)', so unless I change the selected option, I may only browse for XML files.
The default selected option is the extension matching the file in the current buffer.
To have this done automatically, put the following into your ~/.vimrc:
At the bottom right of the Edit File dialog box is a file types selector that allows filtering of the displayed files based on their extension.
