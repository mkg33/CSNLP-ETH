Either the PC PSU has failed and the case it no longer earthed, but connected to live (possibly through a shorted capacitor) or the PSU in the monitor has failed and it's ground is floating high.
The only thing that remains connected is the monitor cable and when I disconnect it the shocks are gone.
Now, with everything disconnected, when I connect the component video cable from the graphic card to the TV i get a "Wiring Problem" warning and a garbage image.
PS: All the readings from the power supply (+12v, 5v, etc) are ok, tested them with a multimeter instead of software.
The screen of the graphics cable connects the computer case to the monitor's ground.
You should also check the groundign on the sockets the PC = monitor are plugged into
I think it's the graphic card, if so, what it could be?
The scenario is the following, I've a Radeon x1650 Pro (AGP) which has not given me any problems so far, until a month or so.
It's not the graphics card, it's the power supply in either the computer or monitor.
When I touch my case (sitting on a wood table) it gives me shocks, even if I disconnect the power cable.
