As Wesley, Chopper3, and Willy pointed out modern convention uses the first address (all zeroes host number) for the subnet and the last address (all ones host number) as the broadcast address.
I wonder if you could get away with using .0 as a host address on an all-Windows network.
Windows doesn't let you ping the first address by default but you might be able to enable it using the SetIPUseZeroBroadcast WMI method.
The first number in a subnet is the network's address itself.
The ipcalc tool I frequently use follows the same practice:
I remember that there were options on SunOS to configure the broadcast either as .0 or .255 during that period.
192.168.0.0/24 has a broadcast of 192.168.0.255 and thus 253 addressable addresses.
(Chop and Willy beat me to it -- but I'm grumpy and don't feel like deleting my post.
Because the first address in a subnet refers to the subnet itself and is used for routing purposes.
But why is that HostMin is not simply 64 in this case?
Early in the internet days, x.x.x.0 was used as the broadcast address for a network.
And whatever the answer, does the same apply to IPv6?
For historical reasons many OSes treat the first address as a broadcast.
For example, pinging x.x.x.0 from OS X, Linux, and Solaris on my local (/24) network gets responses.
It appears to be common practice to not use the first address in a subnet, that is the IP 192.168.0.0/24, or a more exotic example would be 172.20.20.64/29.
So I guess for safety, .0 and .255 have been always a reserved numbers.
In IP networking, you always remove 2 from the broadcast address to find the total amount of addressable IP addresses.
Of course, the last address is the broadcast address where broadcasts are sent to and then pushed down to all clients on that subnet.
192.168.0.0/26 has a broadcast of 192.168.0.64 and thus 62 addressable addresses.
Perhaps slightly related: it also appears possible to use a TCP port 0 and an UDP port 0.
so 192.168.0.0/24 is the number that is used to refer to that subnet.
