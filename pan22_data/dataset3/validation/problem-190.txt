The time taken to try to solve any other issues will not be worth it.
Basically it allows you to bypass the operating system and then you can perform a scan of the harddrive.
Download it, burn it, boot it from the slow computer.
There's a series of tools there, to check for errors including Hard Drive, CPU, Memory, etc.
You can then check the disk, run anti-virus/malware checks, defrag, etc.
But make sure to scan the backup harddrive on another (protected) machine before copying it back to the old machine.
Try taking the offending hard drive out and plugging it in to an external caddy, then plug this in to a working PC.
However, if there is data on the device you cannot afford to lose, then you might want to try out Microsoft Defender Offline.
Obviously, make sure that the host PC has got good protection before doing this.
If after placing the hard-drive back and it still runs poorly then I'd consider reinstalling Windows.
Also, salvage what you can of the files you need (taking care not to copy anything that could potentially infect another PC.
Make sure to download a fresh copy so that you have recent antivirus definitions.
It also has some security programs there to allow you to do an AV/Malware scan.
If the PC is still slow after that, you can try booting with a Linux CD/USB to copy your data and then reinstalling Windows.
You could have a look at Windows Defender Offline, it scans for malware and give you the option to fix.
