There is a huge semantic difference between whether you are the recipient of a message or whether you are receiving a copy of it.
But if you want to pay attention to details, then they're not identical.
Typically, if I am carbon copied on something, the email is not directing to me, but is information that I need to read.
If you set some mail ID as To field means you have some information to share with that particular person.
If a message comes to me that says "you need to do such-and-such" then I take that to mean I have to do it.
For example, if an email says, "You must contact me by midnight or action will be taken", that applies to you if you're the person the letter was sent to.
There are always those who think the whole company needs to know everything they're doing.
This affects what "you" means within the context of the message.
You asked about the effects your choice of field will have on the e-mail client, but the biggest effect is the one it will have on the user.
By putting a user's address in To:, you're communicating that the content of the message is directed to them, while by putting it in Cc: you're communicating that it's just an FYI.
I mention it, however, because now matter how trivial, it is a difference in how one particular e-mail client handles the presentation of the mail.
Differences based on mail rules will obviously vary from user to user, and again: you may not care about them.
You didn't ask about the difference in meaning between To: and Cc:, but that difference in meaning is the underlying reason for any differences in the way an e-mail client handles the message, as subtle or negligible as those differences may be.
But if you want a thorough understanding of possible effects of putting an e-mail address in the To: or Cc: field, this is something you may want to consider.
To give just one example, Lotus Notes will display a different icon in your Inbox depending on whether the message is addressed to you or you are receiving a carbon copy of it.
This is a pretty trivial difference, which you may  not care about.
Other people also have the privilege to read that mail.
From the most general point of view, there is little difference in that the user receives the message either way (assuming everything is working the way it is supposed to, but if it's not working it would fail in either case the same way).
It depends on the e-mail client, and any post-processing rules the user has set up.
Only if the recipient has told the mail program to handle them differently.
But I want any e-mail from them that comes directly to me, especially if they're in management.
For instance, I've often created rules to divert messages from certain addresses to a folder I can ignore, unless I'm listed in the To: field.
If it's addressed to someone else and I'm Cc:ed on the message, then I take that to mean the other person has to do it.
This is useful for junk mail that comes from within one's company.
But if you were only sent a copy of a letter sent to someone else, then you are simply being notified by the sender that the recipient must contact them.
They may choose to prioritize emails sent directly to them over ones they have been CCed on.
CC (Carbon Copy) means that persons are related to your group.
Eg : In an org team leader send a mail to a particular person means he/she mention  his/her id in TO field and other people who r working in the org as put in CC field.
The differences, or whether there are any differences, will vary from e-mail client to e-mail client.
The email does not necessarily require my response, but rather the response of those who were in the TO field.
More significant are differences based on e-mail rules that a user has set up.
