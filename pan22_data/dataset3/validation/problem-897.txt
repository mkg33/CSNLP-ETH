When you connect to the internet, your ISP gives you a public IP address so you can communicate with the internet.
Websites use HTTP traffic, which defaults to port 80, so you would need to create a rule in the router to tell that port 80 needs to be forwarded to the Internal IP address.
If you setup port forwarding, most routers will not understand that your public ip address is that of your own, so you most likely still cannot access your website from your own public ip address.
However, when I enter my public IP address, I get a network timeout, which I would guess means I can't access my web server from outside the local network (unless the connection is just really slow).
I noticed that when I enter my private IP address into a web browser (not the loopback address but the actual DHCP-assigned address), I can access web pages hosted by my server, which I think means I can access it from outside my computer.
I set up an Apache HTTP server on my Macbook, just so I could have access to the full functionality of PHP while I learn the language.
When someone on the internet wants to access your webserver, and they enter the public IP address, the router then needs to know where in the network the request is heading to.
Is there a layer of security set up that prevents people from accessing computers inside a LAN from outside?
I don't have a registered domain name or consistent network access, so the idea of hosting an actual website on this server is not feasible; I'm just doing this for learning purposes.
Once this is done, and that someone from outside enters your public IP address in their browser, your router now knows that it has to forward the request to your macbook.
Your macbook sends the request to the router, which sends it to the ISP, the ISP sends it back and the router is not expecting it, so it ignores the request, resulting in a time out because it can't connect to itself.
There may be three blocking hops in the line, starting from your computer:
The reason this happens is due to NAT Translations.
