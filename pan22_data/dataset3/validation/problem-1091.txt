If you want to limit table size, I'd suggest to split single large tables into a few distinct separate tables.
If only the current season is what is relevant, create 2 tables:  currentSeasonMatches and oldMatches.
mysqldump the old data and put it in a cloud somewhere.
I am by no means a qualified database admin, and have simply found the above to work well for my needs based on experience.
Top 100 lists have worked for me in the past, although nowadays I just do Top 10 of specific categories.
Web site has around 200-600 users in different times and exists almost 8 years.
Keeps everything in tiptop shape, and also makes it really easy to edit the database structure between seasons, as there is no data in there to worry about conflicts.
The central game element is a soccer match, each team plays around 40-50 matches per season, there are roughly a thousand of teams.
Question: what is good practices for keeping/archiving data in general and for online games in particular?
As for past users wanting to view data, simply make a few 'top 100' static lists for previous years.
Only concern is the code changes that might be necessary.
of course, it all matters how accessible you need that older data to be.
From one side, I don't really want to delete aged data (that is more than 5 years old) as potentially users could be interested in looking into them.
from another side, 5 years old and older data are not really concerning and COULD be deleted.
My problem is that tables size is growing constantly.
Or, you could break the data by year: matches2011, matches2012, matches2013.
Assuming it's not, put it in a directory that is part of your regular file backups.
It is not the problem on its own, but when I do some data maintenance (add new fields into existing tables, change field type, etc.)
It is split into 'seasons' each of them takes around a half of a real year.
For example, say you have a Matches table that records all matches that ever took place.
Each match has a lot of match related data: game moments description, amount of experience earned by each team player during each match, etc...
I do this after every 'season' and purge the previous seasons data from the database.
After you do the backup, I also recommend you load that backup back into mysql and verify it isn't corrupt.
Or selectively copy only the data in tables that are required to start another 'season'.
When a season is over, move all the old matches to oldMatches and clear currentSeasonMatches.
After that, simply delete the data from the database you don't need.
This is from my personal experience with my browser rpg's.
If database server size is an issue, render all the data to an HTML tabular format that viewers can view, and save that on a static HTML page on your website.
