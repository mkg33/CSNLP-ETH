Practically these are roughly equivalent services: 6.6KW (which is a LOT of power - I start seeing heat problems above 3.5KW in my racks), which is why the price is the same.
You are getting the same amount of 'power' either way (120V x 60A = 240V x 30A), so from an electrical "power" standpoint it is a wash--either one will support the same amount of equipment in the rack...
You should do some research to be certain, but most modern computer equipment is equiped with switching power supplies that accommodate a wide range of voltages (manufacurers don't need to stock a separate power supply for each country; instead, they simply ship the appropriate power cord for the destination country).
maximum 16A continuous load on a 20A circuit; no more than 24A continuous load on a 30A circuit).
they produce less heat, which is wasted energy) which can save a bit on both power air conditioning load.
As a co-lo customer this is all you really care about and the rest of this is all "datacenter management" stuff.
Remember, too, that a 30A circuit should not be loaded up with 30A of equipment--you need to leave some "head room" to ensure that the circuit is not overloaded (I believe the rule is to stay below 80% of the maximum rated capacity (e.g.
30 amp cable is a lot cheaper than 60 amp cable for the same length, so all else being equal it's more economical to go for the 220V.
Given that, your equipment most likely will not care whether they have a 120V or 208V or 240V input--so long as you have the appropriate power cord to connect the system to the power distribution module.
The wire gague required to carry the same power at 240V is smaller and more flexible than the heavier wire required at 120V, which may be a convenience when routing cables within the rack.
My Bottom line recommendation: Go with 220V unless you have a bunch of 110V-only equipment.
Larger, heavier gauge wiring as well, should be better suited to the needs of a large, full rack.
Make your life easier and go with whichever one your equipment supports!
Each machine is going to be needing 120V still though, so you'll need a converter - the UPS would handle that.
My understanding from engineers at colocation facilities I've worked with is that most switching power supplies are a bit more efficient with a high voltage input (e.g.
In Australia we run almost exclusively on 240v 10 or 15 amps, and (on most of my equipment anyway) the power supplies are not easily exchanged for different voltages.
Certain larger devices will require the 220V circuit - AC, UPSes, etc.
I would confirm that all of your equipment is capable of accepting high-voltage power; if so, obtain the appropriate power distribution module and cordage to connect your equipment to the 240V 30A circuit.
