I was thinking whats the best approach to do this, comparing the position of all objects(not tile stuff) on the grid against the current tile being draw seems stupid, would it be better to add an id ON the grid(map)?
What Im doing now, as one can imagine, is traversing my grid(map) and drawing the tiles in a order so alpha blending works correctly.
You can also add a Z value to your screen objects and have an ordered list based on that Z, so the drawer can just draw from the first to the last in that list and they will be in the right position in the screen.
There's no need for the drawer to know about tiles, it should know only about sprites and their position on the screen.
So, anything I draw in this map must be drawed at the same time the map is being drawn, with sucks a lot, screws your very modular map drawer, because now everything on the game (but the HUD) must be included on the drawer..
this also seems terrible, because objects can move freely, not per tile steps (it can occupies 2 tiles if its between them, etc.)
Dont know if matters, but my grid is 3D, so its not a plane with objects poping out, its a bunch of pilled cubes.
So I got my isometric renderer working, it can draw diamond or jagged maps...Then I want to move on...How do I draw characters/objects on it in a optimal way?
Instead of having the map drawer traverse the grid, make it traverse every drawable object and make no distinction between tiles or whatever else you have on the screen.
