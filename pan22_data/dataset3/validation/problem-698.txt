I had the same issue; and the only workaround I could figure out (from earlier experiences) was this:
On my Windows 10 machine, I get the same view, but when I press "Show Options" button, it gives me the textbox to enter username.
Also, in the username textbox, you can provide credentials as "Servername\username"
You can try to fix this by going to start, Type "Control Panel", Hit enter
The solution I found is to edit the Default.rdp or the rdp file in notepad for the connection in question and add the following option:
Choose the one that has to do with the server you are trying to connect to (usually has the server name or IP listed) click the down arrow and click "remove" then click yes and try to connect again.
If that doesn't work you can edit your RDP shortcut and remove or add Credentials if you click the "Show Options" button in the picture you provided
Once the server was back online, things worked as expected.
I was trying to connect to a machine that was in the process of shutting down/rebooting.
in Control Panel go to the upper right hand corner of the window and click the drop down and choose large or small icons then click the Credential Manager icon.
In Credential Manager choose Windows Credentials bellow that there should be a list of Cached windows credentials.
