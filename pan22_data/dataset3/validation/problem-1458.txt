I installed it on everyone's computer once I had the chance :)
Ctrl+C), and you can only use this with at most two layouts.
It supports global layout and it switches between layouts miles quicker!
If you go to Control Panel / Regional and Language Options / Languages / Details / Key Settings", you can define hotkeys for language changes.
However changing the default input language involves a gazillion steps -
One of my workmates has a custom layout created with the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Editor which has different caps lock/shift behaviour: if caps lock is on, it's a Dvorak layout, and if caps lock is off, it's QWERTY.
By no means "quick" :) But the only way I can think of.
This is a horrible hack, it means you can't use your caps lock key normally, some programs use only the caps lock-off button for modified commands (e.g.
I have wondered about how to do this myself and it appears that one way to do this is by changing the default input language.
Since caps lock is a global setting, hitting caps lock toggles between the layouts globally.
That has its own set of disadvantages, though, namely having multiple keyboards on your desk and being at the whims of the (usually fairly limited) hardware rewiring.
Another option is to get a hardware converter/hardwired keyboard in the other layouts you want, and have multiple keyboards on your desktop, one for each language.
I guess remembering layouts per window is a "feature".
But, for all those disadvantages, it is a method of quickly changing globally between two different keyboard layouts.
Start -> control panel -> regional and language settions -> second tab -> Details -> change default -> Ok -> Ok -> Close windows
You may couple this with a macro language like AutoHotkey, to define a macro that changes the language / keyboard layout for all windows.
