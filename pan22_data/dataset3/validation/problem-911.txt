I can't click on any character past the 220th column.
I'm able to more easily test the problem by just opening vim in a max size terminal and creating a ~250 character line.
For the most part, I'll have my terminal (terminator) maximized on one of my monitors and I'll generally have vim open with 2 or 3 windows split vertically on it.
I did mention that I'm using terminator as my terminal.
I'm not super familiar with how mouse integration works with programs inside the terminal, but I imagine something about the terminal capabilities is different between terminator and gnome-terminal.
The problem comes up when I click on the right-most window; it will instead move the cursor to the left-most window.
Let me start off with saying that I do try to use the mouse in vim as little as possible, but there are times that I will end up using it to click around or highlight something.
After searching around, I found that many people suggested setting "ttymouse=sgr" in .vimrc.
Because I rarely click, it really throws me off when it's not the expected behavior and I can never get used to it.
I'm not seeing this behavior in gnome-terminal, but I would really prefer to stick with terminator.
I searched around for what the problem could be and found that there was a problem with xterm and mouse clicks past the 220th column in the terminal.
