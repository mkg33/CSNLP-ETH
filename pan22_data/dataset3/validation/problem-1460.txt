In the end, most of them run (sometimes more, sometimes less heavily) modified versions of Linux under the hood.

The setup and user interfaces of these products tend to be very user friendly.
You might want look into what is called NAS - Network-attached storage.
Is there a way to connect an external driver to my lan network (direct connection, without having any PC opened) and then access it from any device from lan?
Some hard-drive cases have a LAN plug and a minimal operating system allowing file sharing.
Ready-made products come in all shapes and sizes, depending on what exactly your needs are (redundancy, computational and I/O power, etc.).
Some manufacturers might be Synology, Qnap and Buffalo.
You would install your hard drive, hook it up to the network and you'd pretty much be good to go.
There are plenty of single-drive NAS that will do that.
So you'll need a case or an adapter to share your files on the network.
I am asking this so all my development files will be easily accessed by all my lan devices.
If you don't, you can just buy a little NAS like the WD ones.)
As others have pointed out, a NAS with a single bay might already be enough for your purposes.
