10GBASE-T SFP+ transcievers are starting to appear albiet with a 30m distance limitation.
You can choose 10GbE fiber connectivity or 10G SFP+ DAC for connectivity.
This has left an awkward situation with regards to 10 gigabit interoperability.
I have a Cisco Nexus 3548 switch and a bunch of machine that I want to connect to it via 10GbE RJ45 connectivity.
Sorry to tell you that few fiber optic manufacturers and suppliers update 10G copper transceiver modules.
I know what I want looks like this: http://www.amazon.com/10Gtek%C2%AE-Compatible-Gigabit-Transceiver-Mini-GBIC/dp/B00U77IJ2M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1449775858&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=cisco+sfp%2B+rj45&psc=1

I am a bit overwhelmed with all the acronyms and sheer volume of technical info on this.
Prolabs claim to have a cisco compatible 10GBASE-T SFP+ but their website gives no indication of price.
Unfortunately 10GBASE-T was more power hungry than 1000BASE-T. As a result of this SFP+ manufacturers were not initially able to offer a 10GBASE-T option.
