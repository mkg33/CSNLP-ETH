I did some tests for HW-issues, but didn't find any issues:
The problem still in analysis: I still didn't get the stable/predictable sequence to reproduce the issue.
(After I realized there is a problem, I'm periodically restoring files from backup, and then comparing them against backup with WinMerge/BeyondCompare)
No HW-failures detected by various test-utilities.
Same question I raised on Microsoft Community, but got no solution.
But not always - also met files with random data in the beginning/middle of file.
On my new PC (with windows 8.1 x64) some files on local SATA-HDD are getting corrupted without visible reason (after some IDLE).
But I'm still not sure if this linux distribution was using same HW-access modes (like memory-usage, or some SATA-connection, etc.
RAM and motherboard manufacturers don't have any information on known issues.
While another sample copy, stored in the compressed folder, was corrupted/restored many times.
Seems they are always same files who are getting corrupted: with my last tests on set of >33000 jpeg files I'm getting list of same 30 files which are always getting corrupted.
In the beginning I thought that's something with windows drivers/cache configuration.
The problem has been solved by disabling NTFS compression.
Taking into account all above, could anybody advice or confirm my assumptions:
might be windows does some transparent reallocations of compressed NTFS content during some internal files-indexing procedure... don't know).
(did test with AVG antivirus installed, also with clean brand-new 8.1 with no any third-party software/drivers)
The corruption pattern is pretty same: in most cases some last bytes (about 10-20 last bytes) are filled with random data.
I noticed that some files in my archives are getting corrupted after some IDLE time.
One test gave positive results (probably): used PartedMagic Linux booted from USB stick.
Probably it happens if I try to use computer while it's comparing - not sure.
Currently I'm using more or less quasi-stable reproduce sequence (which still takes several days to reproduce issue):
I've got no corruptions after several weeks of linux usage.
It might be there is a bug in the implementation of the compression algorithm used in Windows 8.1.
My current theory: it might be related to RAM (even though corrupted files never accessed on write mode.
Step 3. takes several hours (4-6), also corruptions may be detected after several iterations.
It looks like these 30 files contain some specific bytes-sequence, which under certain conditions 'activates' corruption.
Contacted to manufacturers support with questions on known hardware issues.
The root cause is still unknown: I believe it can be caused either by HDD, memory, or motherboard.
I've also tested with Windows 10 release - compressed files get corrupted during one day of IDLE.
Anyhow, after I disabled compression, the issue wasn't reproduced after almost 2 months of normal computer usage.
