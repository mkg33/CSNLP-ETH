You should restrict the bandwidth it uses though (with --bwlimit), or it will drive the performance of the rest of your system into the ground.
However, if they emulate even closely what rsync does on *nix, then yes, you can rsync between folders on a single host.
I am using Windows 7, I would like to be able to sync files/folder to other Disks on 1 computer, sometimes, just keep 2 folders or more in sync on the same drive even, and sometimes onto seperate drives.
For Windows, Microsoft has a free utility (SyncToy) that provides similar functionality with a graphical interface.
While there are certainly other, and some may argue better, methods to achieve this task, rsync is indeed a good tool to use.

rsync can be used between two locations on the same computer.
You will want to look at something else though (Unison?
Or can it be used to sync files on the same computer?
Is RSYNC is not what I am looking for, please suggest the best alternative for Windows 7.
I'm aware there are rsync clients for Windows, however not having used them, I cannot comment on their specific functionality.
I am wanting to use something like rsync (i think).
Is RSYNC only used for when there is a client computer and a server computer?
), since it does not handle two-way synchronization well on its own.
rsync works very well on a single computer in *nix systems.
I use it daily in a Linux environment and in fact the vast majority of the time I do so syncing files between disks on a single host (computer).
