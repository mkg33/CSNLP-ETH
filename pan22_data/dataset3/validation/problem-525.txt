If the editor crashes, its left behind and becomes a "stale lock".
If your regular file, filename, without the fore and aft hashtags is up-to-date, then you can delete the #filename# file.
Those files are "lock"-files, usually created by an editor.
and './' are the current directory in which you are working (use pwd to know where you are).
means that there is a hidden file ".#netMHC3.2.py" under current directory(./)
I've seen it on "backup" files generated by text editors.
You can delete the file manually at this point, but most editors give you that option automatically when editing the file next time.
Hidden files in your home directory are typically used to store configuration data for your applications.
Hidden means that by using the ls command, the hidden file won't be part of the output.
Well, a very old question, but the correct answer is not here so...
Lock files come in many different shapes, but both emacs and joe creates symlinks named like in your example - as .#[original-filename].
you can view this file from command line (while with in the same directory as the file)
I don't know of a standard to use the '#' on certain kind of files.
By default most graphical file managers won't display hidden files unless you tell them to.
To display the contents of a file use the "cat" command:
Lock files are used to prevent multiple instances from editing the same file, simultaneous (eg.
~/.bashrc would contain any configuration data for your Bash shell, and it would only apply to your account.
I think this is created when a cvs update fails and cvs backs up original file.
Old question, but first hit on Google and no correct answer.
