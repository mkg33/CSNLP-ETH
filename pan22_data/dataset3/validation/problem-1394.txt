Finding dupes isn't hard -- just md5 hash every file on your system and anything with the same hash is a candidate for duplicate detection (still need to compare the actual file contents to make sure it's not a hash collision).
It has a selection tools to help you choose which files you want to keep from the dups.
20 lines of shell script or Powershell should do it.
Far better to have the backup program deal with it for you.
I know BackupPC purports to solve this problem by storing everything under the hash of it's contents and indexing from there, but whether that's compatible with your OS is unknown.
It's available for 32-bit or 64-bit (x64) Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 2003, and Windows Vista
But what are you going to do once you've found them?
The product is not free, but it has really nice methods for comparing files, it can use a byte-by-byte, checksum, ID3 tag information, or a few others.
Deletion would work, if you only need one copy, but otherwise if you exclude them from the backup then the backup won't be complete.
This is best handled in your backup software, if it's really that much of a problem (do you honestly have that many big duplicate files on your machine?)
