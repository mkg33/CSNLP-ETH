I don't have the exact specs of the modem, but it's a low-end Huawei modem.
One of my friends has asked me to help him with his small office network.
I am currently wondering as to how to remedy the situation.
Adding an AP that connects to the switch will solve your Wi-Fi problem for all but the Wi-Fi devices.
It's a small accounting firm that has about 5 PC (desktops and laptops).
Here is a rough outline of the current office network setup:
I assume they share a single VLAN based on your description of the low-end router.
If everything is on the same VLAN, the traffic from a PC doing a backup will not impede any other PC trying to send traffic through the router since the traffic destined for the NAS will not flow through the router unless they are on different VLANs.
They also have a 4TB NAS drive hooked up to the ISP router that they were provided.
Their current problem comes from the fact that all traffic is handled by the small modem and when two or more devices attempt to backup data to the NAS drive, the modem overloads and restarts itself thus interrupting all backups in progress.
