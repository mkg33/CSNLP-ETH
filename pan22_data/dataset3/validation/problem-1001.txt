Would I need some kind of version control system/distributed filesystem?
The files on my laptop are all owned by 'jo90' on my laptop regardless of wether they are owned by 'joe90' or 'www-data' on my server.
Now files from my 'joe90' (my username) and 'www-data' are synchronised.
Anyone with experience in these matters got any suggestions?
I've been using Dropbox on Ubuntu 10.04 and while initially it was working very well for synchronizing a local copy of my website with the remote site, it didn't do so well when it came to preserving file ownerships and file permissions (this is particularly important for my shell scripts and java applications that need www-data file ownership)
Also, is it possible to get the synchronization to run automatically every time a file is changed on either end?
Also, it would be really nice to be able to go "back in time" a la Dropbox.
On my laptop, I've added the user 'www-data' to /etc/init.d/dropbox and restarted dropbox.
running on a non-standard port, disabling password authentication and only allowing keypair auth, using port-knocking, fail2ban etc.
The process which is writing the files, needs to run as root if its going to create/update the filse as a different user.
Its good practice to disable root logins via ssh - so that implies pulling the files as root rather than pushing them to a root login however that pre-supposes that replication is one-way for 2 way replication across the internet you probably want a more esoteric configuration of your ssh server, e.g.
I've tried Unison, but again, this seems to just download all the files and give them my username's ownership and 755 permissions.
