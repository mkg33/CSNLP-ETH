Example: CPU usage can be low, but CPU load high - in this case it can be symptom for "slow" IO disk operations (you will need to check metrics CPU iowait usage, disk queue length, ...).
I recommend article about utilization/saturation from Senior Performance Architect at Netflix: http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html
Often a burst of activity that clears after 5 or 10 minutes isn't really much of a problem, might be perfectly normal depending on what you are doing there.
Your new combined trigger expression doesn't catch this case.
Tweak that threshold 1.8 up or down a bit depending on what your typical workload would look like.
Finally, yes you can use boolean expressions, and there's a documentation page to help you.
I would not recommend using the max() function in this context because it will be sensitive to even a momentary burst of high activity... unless that's what you really want, but then don't complain about getting many alerts.

Why is "Processor load is too high" false alarm in your case?
The purpose being that you want a slower response time on your alarms rather than raising to a higher threshold.
However, if the heavy load persists for a significant length of time that's when you want to know about it.
but threshold depends on your server - what and how is it doing.
