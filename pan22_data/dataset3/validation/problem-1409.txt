When I attempt to re-partition it warns that all data will be lost.)
Before trying this (or even using any of the commercial software), you should make sure you have a full backup (that way you can just destructively redo the partition with Disk Utility and restore from your backup—plus get a ‘free’ defrag for your troubles).
The 119690149888 bytes value was listed as the maximum size in the output of the command diskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 limits.
Some time ago I shrank my main hard disk partition in order to dual-boot with Linux, but now I am running out of space on the Macintosh partition, and I would like to remove the Linux partition and restore the Macintosh partition to its original size.
I found other instructions for what I want to do at http://wiki.onmac.net/index.php/Triple_Boot_via_BootCamp#Restoring_your_Mac_to_its_original_state, but this requires Boot Camp, which is no longer available for OS X 10.4.
If so you might then be able to use diskutil to enlarge the HFS+ filesystem to fit the bounds of the newly grown partition.
Can GParted rewrite the partition map (delete the linux partition and then resize the remaining HFS+ partition) without trying to enlarge the HFS+ filesystem?
I have been able to remove the Linux partition, but I cannot seem to merge the free space back into the Macintosh partition.
Originally I used GParted to shrink the partition, but I cannot use GParted to restore the partition because GParted is unable to enlarge HFS+ partitions.
If I attempt to use diskutil to resize the partition (while booted from the OS X installation DVD), I get the following:
Does anyone know how I can restore my HFS+ partition to its original size without losing my data or spending money on a commercial product?
(This is almost the same problem as question 50317 "Resize HFS Partition", but on Mac OS X 10.4 the Disk Utility application cannot resize partitions non-destructively.
