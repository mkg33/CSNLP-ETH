Any insight or possible solutions will be greatly appreciated!
I can see things getting rather expensive if opting to buy a new copy of ISA 2006 and a second server
Hypothetically, is it smart to even attempt to run ISA on the edge of the network with the advent of Forefront Threat Management Gateway 2010?
Here is an article, perhaps it can help you in deciding your SBS 2008 Topology.
Note: once my old Windows Small Business Server has been demoted from the domain controller, I plan on reusing the old hardware by installing a new operating system.
I'm currently running a Windows SBS 2003 with ISA 2000 and will be migrating to a new server containing Windows SBS 2008, Standard Edition.
Imagine that all of your devices are on 192.168.1.X
I still haven't decided which though, I had gotten so used to ISA 2000, with all it's quirks but also AD integration.
Save 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.0 for your DHCP settings on SBS 2008.
You can use a watchguard / sonicwall / linksys  firewall device.
Put in your router IP address 192.168.2.2 when prompted.
What hardware or software (or combination of) solutions should I be looking at?
I've used it for almost 6 years and have been relatively well protected, especially with Dynamic port features, caching, filtering, SMTP publishing etc, not to mention application filtering.
Currently I'm considering running Untangle on a spare server I happen to have.
Unfortunately if you had the premium edition, it'd come with an extra server license to take care of this exact problem, to install ISA server 2006 on if you wish.

As for Forefront, I am not sure I am bought into the technology, if I personally had to choose, I think I'd prefer ISA server.
If you had software assurance, it sure would have helped you as many of us dealing with the same issue.
Since SBS 2008's internal firewall should not be seen as any substitute for an external firewall, I'm looking for feedback as to how to go about and implement a separate firewall to protect my network, given my current hardware and software configuration.
However, I am actually making this exact move, and I am currently looking to use a hardware firewall/router appliance.
