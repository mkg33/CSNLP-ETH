(1) I use sp_helpdb command and find that the database files and the transaction files are stored in these logical devices:
• Tried drop-db/add-new-db/restore-db-from-backup.
Seem like they are something that only Sybase knows (someone suggested to me that they are "raw partitions").
Still, I cannot tell me which drive(s) those devices are on.
I was told that this problem is related to Sybase (something to do with our likely use of raw partitions).
(6) When I use the cat /etc/vfstab command, I see these:
The df command complains that the first three devices are “not a block device, directory or mounted resource”.
• Tried Analyze-option-in-format-command-to-repair-all-disks, and then add-new-db and restore-db-from-backup.
Moreover, I also want to see if those files are stored in the same hard drive as the operating system or not; if they are, I will need to re-install the operating system as well as restoring the database to the new hard drive.
The 4th device is something that Unix knows, and it is in "/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s0".
On the other hand, the df command shows the following info for the last device:
At this point, I assume the database-files and transaction-files are all stored inside the Sybase server.
(4) I want to know more about those physical devices.
(7) When I use the format command, I see these two hard drives:
By the way, what I have tried so far to repair the database are:
Having said this, there is a backup Sybase server, and the backup Sybase server has an external device attached to it (through a SCSI cable).
I have an old Sybase server whose database is acting up.
But after one week or so, I found a table has I/O error.
I want to determine exactly which hard drive it is because I am not familiar with Unix.
By the way, the Sybase server uses this Unix operating system:
Obviously this will be better if the database-files and the transaction-files are not in the same hard drive as the operating system.
(3) When I use sp_helpdevice to show all the physical devices, I see this:
It could not complete and complained about “MAGIC NUMBER WRONG”.
(2) I use sp_helpdevice command to look into those 4 logical devices shown above, and find that those logical devices are in these physical devices:
Seem like Unix doesn't know anything about those first 3 physical devices.
I have posted the following question in another forum.
I have tried rebuilding the file-system and the database file.
(8) I don’t see any external device attached to the Sybase server.
I want to replace the hard drive that the database-files and transaction-files are stored.
Unfortunately, this command could not fix and could not complete.
I cannot figure out the connection between the mounted devices above to the physical devices for the database-files and the transaction-files.
I also cannot link the mounted devices above to the hard drives shown in the next section.
Please help me to determine which hard drive those database-files and transaction-files are stored, and whether they are in the same hard drive as the Unix operating system.
