When I copy the exact same files and directories to my publish server, it works fine.
Since it works on my publish servers, I'd rather fix this by correcting my Apache and PHP configuration (if possible) than by changing the file permissions.
These errors only cropped up after I began using OS 10.7's native PHP instead of MAMP.
It also worked fine on my development machine when I used MAMP.
For years I used MAMP on my Macintosh computer to run a development environment with Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
Since then, I’ve only had one problem that I never experienced with MAMP: My CMS doesn’t recognize that certain files and images directories are writable, even though their permissions are set to drwxr-xr-x, and the same directories are writable when I deploy them on the Web.
On my local machine, my CMS gives me this error message:
When I upgraded my machine to OS 10.7, I decided to use OS 10's native Apache and PHP in lieu of downloading MAMP again, mostly following the instructions I found here.
