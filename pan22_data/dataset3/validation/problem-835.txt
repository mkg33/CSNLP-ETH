I find that this works quite well for the combination of cable modem and ADSL modem.
Helpfully, pfSense has automatic failover and load balancing.
Once 2.1 is released, pfSense will have good IPv6 support and will include multihoming.
Obviously if you really use 8.8.8.8 choose another IP because otherwise you won't have reachability to it if ISP1 goes down.
I wouldn't advice it as a corporate solution, but it's ok for SOHO and home setups.
That said, pfSense does not have a fully-supported release that properly handles IPv6.
See http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-troan-homenet-sadr-01
The advantage is that you can use the entire bandwidth provided by both the providers while still having a fail over option for reliability.
But it can also be implemented reasonably well on any router supporting policy based routing.
If it is a Cisco device you could use IP SLA to ping a destination like 8.8.8.8 over the primary ISP.
You may have to put a static route for 8.8.8.8 over ISP1 to make it always exit out that path.
An application should be smart enough to change connection (pick another SA/DA pair) when the current connection fails.
There is no reason why multihoming wouldn't work in IPv6 as well as IPv4.
For some reason, web app programmers sometimes think it is OK to test security on the basis of IP address.
For users who need this access, you can reserve an IP address for their computer, and create a "LAN rule" in pfSense to always use a certain gateway and not the other for that IP address.
What I have found is that a small number of web apps do not work when you are multihomed.
In IPv6 multi-homing with provider aggregated addresses, each host in the network will get one address prefix from each of the providers.
You can install a router/firewall that supports multihoming.
(Otherwise BCP38 (ingress filtering) would have dropped a packet sent with ISP B's source address to ISP A).
What kind of equipment do you have connecting to the providers?
I.e the host/application's choice of source address picks which exit link is used.
I've used OpenWRT with Multiwan (http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/multiwan) for some time at home to multihome between my DSL and Cable ISP.
You could setup a remote server/VPS in a reliable data center and then you could setup VPN tunnels from your router to the remote server over each ISP.
The web apps are usually financial sites, like banks.
The host stack/application's source address selection (RFC6724) and choice of SA/DA pair (RFC6555) determines which exit is used.
As soon as you don't get a reply failover to the other static route.
In the mean time our recommendation is to set the lifetime of the failing link's address prefix to 0, meaning that new connections will not use that address.
Various implementations do this in various ways, and none do it very well at the moment.
The network uses source address dependent routing to forward the traffic on to the correct exit.
The disadvantage is that you'll incur additional cpu, storage and bandwidth costs for the remote server.
Now your router at home could route packets over these tunnels based on a bandwidth ratio, and then the remote server can route the traffic between the rest of the internet.
