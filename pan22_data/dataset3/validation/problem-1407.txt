Now you just have to go run outside and come back to write your times in cells C1 to C50.
=(B2-A2)*1440 Total minutes between two times (295)
Although convenient when keying in your data, we will need to take that into account when doing our formula.
=INT((B2-A2)*24) Total hours between two times (4)
=(B2-A2)*86400 Total seconds between two times (17700)
Then set your A3 cell custom format to this: [Red]-0;[Blue]0.
In this case, January 1st, 1900, 2:47 AM, but we don't care about that.
Type in 2:47, which is your objective jogging time.
Say you want to record your jogging times and set yourself an objective of 2h47 hours of jogging per month (you are a precise person).
This is a total of all your jogging times that you are going to enter during your month in the column C. There's no problem in adding positive datetimes, since they will never get below zero.
I've picked minutes, as timing jogging seconds might be a bit excessive.
The cell is going to take a custom format of h:mm, for hours:minutes, but in reality excel stores any "time" as a date and time value.
The excel help under the article "Present the result based on a single time unit" suggests:
