The profiles are local profiles, nothing is on a domain.
Our company is fairly small and consists of about 5 users with Windows XP workstations.
Start the Local Group Policy Editor by going to Start -> Run... and type gpedit.msc.
It defaults to "user" and places the cursor in the password field automatically, so every time a user wants to log in they have to clear out the username field, type their name, then go down to password.
This is all fine and good, but XP doesn't remember the last username, which makes it a pain on systems where only one user is on the system (in other words, all of them).
This is a very simplistic question, but nonetheless it is annoying several of my users.
Then go to Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies -> Security Options -> Interactive logon: Do not display last user name
The workstations are configured for the "classic" login style with a username and password text box rather than the welcome screen.
To open and edit your Local Policy, then perform the steps listed previously.
I was under the impression that this was the default behavior, but apparently not.
