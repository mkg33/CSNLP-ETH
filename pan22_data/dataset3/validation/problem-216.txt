And DDR3 may be faster than DDR2 but SPECIFICS matter.
As Ignacio said, it depends on what application you're doing?
It struck me it might be worthwhile to consolidate them).
installing large pieces of software), it doesn't matter how fast your RAM and CPU are if you have a 5400RPM drive.
You can't compare in terms of raw clock cycle the performance of a AMD processor to an Intel processor or even a Core 2 Duo to a new Core i7.
I don't know why it is that people in general cannot grasp that computer performance can never be quantified by focusing on just one or two components.
The only way to answer it is to do as the previous responders have done and assume a larger context.
If you're doing any heavy write-intensive operations (i.e.
However, in general more most people, I would think 4 GB of ram with 3.7 Ghz is better than 2.7 Ghz with 8 GB of RAM for pure speed.
Also, the specific processor models make a difference.
Here are some of my thoughts as I read your question.
Computer performance always depends on the performance of the system as a whole.
 Your question as asked unfortunately has no proper answer.
Are you doing video editing and processing or working with spreadsheets or playing games.
(Many have been previously mentioned and I apologize for the repetition.
