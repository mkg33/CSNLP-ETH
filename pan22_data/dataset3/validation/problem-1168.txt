Until I added default.crt and default.key, I was getting a connection refused error.
For some reason I'm getting a 503, but I don't know why and I've gone over the nginx-proxy docs in detail.
I switched to serving http over 80 with 10443 exposed on the host.
I'm setting up nginx-proxy as a reverse proxy in front of Docker container running an app server.
This is the only thing that shows up in the nginx-proxy log when I curl:
I can curl from the app server directly, but curling through nginx-proxy throws up an error
I made a copy named foo.example.com in case nginx-proxy couldn't find it.
I'm using network_mode: bridge which is supposed to work even with version: 2.
The certs are less relevant since I switched to port 80 to debug.
(I've also opened this as a github issue for nginx-proxy.)
I initially had nginx-proxy on 443, but I switched it to 80 for now.
Nothing shows up in app server log, meaning it does not see the request.
They're defined in separate Docker compose definitions.
The app server originally served https over 443 with 10443 exposed on the host.
