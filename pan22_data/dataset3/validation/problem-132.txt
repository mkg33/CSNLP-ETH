), application performance requirements (database/application/virtualization?
), transport (fibre/SAS/iSCSI), and array composition (RAID level, # of disks).
When people are concerned about that latency difference, it almost makes more sense to pursue SSDs (which are supported in the 2040 unit).
For example I am now regularly coping files with 600mb - 900mb / second.
Caching - especially when some larger SSD buffer is insovled - can factually kill those differences.
Latencies are regularly in low single digit despite heavy random and write heavy workloads.
With all storage, this comes down to your anticipated access patterns (read-biased/write-biased/mixed?
You generally won't notice the difference between modern 2.5" 10k and 15k enterprise SAS disks on something like an HP MSA 2040 storage array... You'll run into other platform limitations before that becomes an issue.
That is totally true if that is not a low end SAN.
So, on a "proper" san with some heavy buffering you may not see that many differences.
Can you provide more detail on what you plan on doing with the array?
