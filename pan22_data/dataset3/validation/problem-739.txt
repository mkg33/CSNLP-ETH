Contrary to popular belief this has nothing to do with incoming email.
mailnull - 958  - /usr/sbin/sendmail -FCronDaemon -i -odi -oem -oi -t
Email can/will still be sent originating from the server by calling the sendmail binary.
Most likely you have a cron script running that generates tons of output and sendmail is trying to mail it.
your servers might also be putted as sender, so undelivered mail-notices are sended to you.
My server crashed today, and was offline for about 1 hour when I noticed it...
So yes, this will mean you will stop receiving messages from your server.
Will I stop receiving emails from my server if I stop it?
More than likely the real problem is that some spammer is using your system to send mail.
Disabling the sendmail daemon means the server no longer acts as an MTA.
Disabling the sendmail daemon will NOT break getting mail off the server.
Disabling sendmail SMTP listener will not fix your problem.
I dont have any website on my server that sends a lot of emails, so I dont know what caused this.
I would also recordmend you to check you are not blacklisted example mxtoolbox.com.
The process that generates the high CPU load is sending mail and it's done by the Cron Daemon.
This also assumes that the 958 is actual CPU load, which seems rather high and is more likely to be the numeric user id, but that's another story.
This makes me think that what cause the server crash was sendmail that created a high server load...
Well, disabling Sendmail and not replacing it with another mail package like Exim or Postfix will mean that you won't be able to send mail from your server.
There are several other methods to prevent this from happening, and I recommend looking into them.
