The problem is that sometimes 2 "identical" sd cards may not have exactly the same capacity in reality, hence causing Win32DiskImager to fail.
Given that you are in possession of an external memory card reader, it's very straightforward to clone your sd card in whole.
For example, Win32DiskImager requires that the sd card your are copying into has to be at least the same size if not greater than the one you are copying from.
I've used, and am still using piclone to clone and setup new raspberry pis as part of a data collection and display system, and helped me a lot when having to setup multiple rpi for new applciations etc.
Have a look at this article https://liudr.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/back-up-and-clone-raspberry-pi/ for a bit more details on these issues.
I like this method because it allows to entirely clone everything in your pi, and will not cause you some of the issues that Win32DiskImager would.
While the use of Win32DiskImager can be a solution as others suggested, i would suggest to take a look at piclone.
