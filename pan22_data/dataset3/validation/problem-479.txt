I go through the Windows Update process once, reboot, then find there's more.
This is on XP x64, but I'm pretty sure even on Windows 7 there are at least 2 "rounds" of updates, each as big as the original installer.
After the third time it seems to be done, but it's a huge waste of time, because it downloads about 3x the size of the original installer and has to ngen everything for every update as well.
Install them, reboot again - but wait, there's still more!
Maybe you also add a /match ".NET" but to only get .NET updates
Where could I download the complete installer that would install the latest version of .NET framework with all critical updates released at that time without any further downloads?
It should install all needed updates cumulative and reboot and the install again, until no more reboots are needed.
Install every update again, reboot - oh wait, there's still more .NET framework updates.
Whenever I install the .NET framework in a new Windows installation there is a huge number of updates to download from Windows Update.
You can install the initial version of .NET and then try installing .NET via Microsoft Update with the command line tool WuInstall and its rebootcycle option:
