The trick is to get to drivers directly from Intel because in my experience the all the drivers on the Dell site are terribly, terribly old.
I had a D830 that had an issue with the Nvidia drive, after coming out of standby the system would go very slow!
Usually when my laptop gets into that state (I've had a Lattitude D600 and have a D830 now) I end up doing a reinstall of the OS and applications, since this is usually just one of a number of annoying little problems.
Just because the interface is disabled doesn't mean that the driver isn't still active.
That is usually what causes this problem but there are other reasons as well.
I have found that when a laptop refuses to standby like that it is caused by a process which refuses to shutdown.
Uncommitted writes to disk and memory writes in the pipeline can also do this.
If your laptop is telling your drivers at fault you may as well give it the benefit of the doubt and update the drivers and see if that solves the problem.
It was a known issue and the resolution was to use the current DELL specific Nvidia driver from the Dell Website.
