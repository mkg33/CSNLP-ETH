Looking for some guidance on how to setup active directory correctly using a server that isn't on my local network.
Say I own example.com and I create a subdomain in my DNS settings on my domain's hosting provider ad.example.com.
As to how, precisely, you set up an Active Directory forest... that's too broad a topic for our Q&A format.
The difference will be in how you join to and connect to the remote Active Directory domain - this is usually done via VPN, as it's a bad practice (for security reasons) to expose your domain controllers to access from the internet.
Please let me know what information you need to know.
I'm new to the Active Directory world (I know how to use it, not set it up :) ).
Is it possible to use that subdomain on my Windows server as the active directory name?
I just bought a server from Leaseweb running Windows Server 2012 R2 and plan to use it for Active Directory.
My question is though, I obviously can't bind computers to it's domain using a .local network, so how would I set up an active directory using a domain I own?
Setting up an Active Directory Domain is the same, whether the computer you're doing it on is local or remote.
