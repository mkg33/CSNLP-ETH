Take a look at https://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianMirrors/ for a mirror local to you, update the repo URL in /etc/apt/sources.list, comment out the existing one that fails, and then retry the update.
As you can see from above, i was asked to uncomment and i did it.
I had an issue with the error you have on the last line of your error log "E: Some index files failed ..."
This is the second time I've faced this issue, last time it happened I tried couple of different things updating source list file or apt-get clean but was of no utter use.
I gave up and woke up next morning it worked effortlessly.
Basically, I opened this file and noticed that the WiFi static IP address setup was incorrect ...
I'm from India, so is this possible some server might be down or could be ISP's issue?
Please, pay attention for https and then everything went smooth.
For me, this was caused by an entry in the  /etc/dhcpcd.conf file.
If it still fails, try a couple more mirrors just in case there has been a bad sync.
I have been facing this issue for a while and finally I figured out.
I resolved it by modifying my /etc/apt/sources.list to use a different mirror.
I used a local mirror instead of the main raspberrypi.org repo.
I used the command "sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf" (without the quoted) to enable me to edit this file.
Please find the attached snip, for the complete error message.
I suspect there are probably cleaner ways of making this change, but for me, this did the job!
The only difference being that I am on stretch while you are on jessie.
Here I just want to post my approach even if the question is old.
I simply removed the full stop and saved the file, restarted the Pi and all worked good.
