Besides, SPDIF passthrough was working fine in Vista before I upgraded to Windows 7.
It's a shame how Creative has dropped the ball so badly on the sound card front, and since embedded sound chips are now pretty good, there's almost no reason to ever use PCI sound cards any more.
Also, the receiver does not show the Dolby Digital or DTS symbol, but stays at Dolby Prologic, so it seems it doesn't identify the sound encoding properly.
Sound works fine when listening to non-surround audio sources, such as windows sounds or MP3.
Sounds suspiciously like a driver issue, unfortunately!
I use the built in optical-out on my HTPC, which is a Realtek ALC889A chipset, without incident, using all default Windows 7 drivers and Windows 7 Media Center -- it correctly passes the Dolby Digital to the receiver via optical out.
However, when I view a DVD in Media Center and the SPDIF passthrough kicks in, I can only hear an awful noise instead of the movie soundtrack.
Had same problem installed Realtek AC97 software for windows 7, fixed my problem
That was after a default Windows 7 install with a Creative Labs Soundblaster Live!
Also, I have ensured that the receiver's Dolby Digital decoder is not broken by successfully connecting it to my PS3 to view a Dolby Digital DVD.
Have you tested the SPDIF connection in the Sound Settings?
I've tried both the default Audigy drivers that come with Windows 7 and the latest drivers from the Soundblaster website, but the problem remains unchanged.
I could switch off SPDIF passthrough and use the sound card's decoder instead, but that's not an option for me since it would create more problems with regular MP3 playback via additional Stereo Receiver which is also connected to the same sound card.
After installing the beta drivers from Creative the device suddenly showed up in my Windows 7 speakersettings as a possible playback device.

I'm running Windows 7 on a computer with an Audigy Platinum eX sound card connected to a surround receiver via optical cabling.
I had to revert to the turkish Creative site at http://tr.creative.com/support/downloads/
