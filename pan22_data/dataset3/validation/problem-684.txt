The only way around this is the method you've mentioned, or alternatively to disable UAC.
UAC protects the Program Files folders in both 32Bit and 64Bit.
What you're already doing is also perfectly reasonable: extract archives as a standard user and move the extracted files into Program Files, taking advantage of Explorer's UAC prompts.
I'm trying to get all my useful programs up to date, and I've recently had a problem extracting files into the 32-bit program files directory (Program Files (x86)).
Another answer would be to run 7-Zip without themes enabled (ala win2k).
If you put it in any other folder, (except c:\windows) UAC won't be an issue.
Explorer in Windows Vista handles permission failures by attempting to elevate to Administrator privileges, hence the UAC prompt when you drag a folder into C:\Program Files (x86).
The access control list for C:\Program Files (x86) does not grant any write permissions to standard users.
To see this for yourself, right-click on the folder in Explorer, select "Properties" from the context menu, and select the "Security" tab.
I just got 64 bit Vista system after being on Windows XP.
7-Zip does not handle permission failures by attempting to elevate to Administrator privileges.
I've been able to extract it to C:\ and then move it, I'm assuming there's some protection on the Program Files directory that is causing some problems.
However when dragging the files into an Explorer window from the main WinRar window a prompt appears that you canauthorize this action to have the files extracted in that location.
Unfortunately, every time I've tried to do this, 7Zip reports
If you want to run 7-Zip as an Administrator account in order to install software into the Program Files directories, find the icon for "7-Zip File Manager" in the Start Menu, right-click on it, and select "Run as administrator".
I'm using 7zip to extract the eclipse-SDK-3.5-win32.zip directory into C:\Program Files (x86)
If you do that, then you might just wind up with Eclipse in your own user folder even though you think you're putting it in the program files folder.
Do you need to have eclipse in your program files?
