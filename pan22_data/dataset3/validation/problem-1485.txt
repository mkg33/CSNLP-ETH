There are some other useful suggestions in the following articles:
Open up the trace in Process Monitor after it boots and see what exactly is happening during the periods of slow performance.
It lets you save snapshots of your settings changes, do a Diff between them, etc.
I used to have this problem with machines that were attempting to get a DHCP lease.
If you can't find the answer through exploring the host directly, try using a packet sniffer (wireshark, for example) to see what the client is trying to do over the wire.
Find & fix the network problem and everything speeds up.

Often systems will slow down massively if they're trying to resolve a hostname and struggle to find the DNS server or the host itself.
Click on the Services Tab and disable everything that is not by Microsoft, and disable everything under the Startup tab.
If you want to dive very deeply into the problem, download Sysinternals Process Monitor (the successor to regmon and filemon).
Microsoft's Process Monitor tool allows you to "capture" the boot process in a log file that can be later analyzed to reveal the exact points where your boot process isn't as fast as you want it to be.
It'll sit there until each attempt to make contact times out.
Much safer to disable stuff with this "undo" sort of capability.
Then you can remove/play with the problematic processes or pinpoint-search the web for a specific solution.
If it boots fast in Safe Mode (from F8, as mentioned above) try using Autorun Administrator (another great utility from SysInternals) .
You can enable boot logging, and it will captures a trace of all file and registry activity that takes place during boot.
In unix systems, DNS & NFS are two common culprits to slow booting.
If it still boots quickly, enable a few items under MSCONFIG, reboot, and repeat until you find the culprit.
You'll probably find that it is an out of date driver or antivirus program that is causing problems, and updating to the latest version will fix things for you.
Is the booting slow if you hit F8 and choose safe mode?
