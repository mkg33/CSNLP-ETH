I'm not saying definitively, but sending to my username "+test@" work (E2k3) email did not come through.
A similar feature (nicknamed "disposable e-mail addresses") was proposed for Exchange 2010, but it didn't make the cut.
Luckily there's (at least) one guy that already did the basics for you.
Sendmail supports a feature called 'plussed users'.
Note that I don't want answers about other means of filtering, e.g.
spam/junk filtering, server-side or client-side rules, email aliases/addresses that are configured explicitly and so on.
The user can just use them and set up client-side filtering rules on his own.
are automatically delivered just like mails to myname@example.com.
I'm not willing yet to say that it doesn't work at all, but it doesn't work in my environment.
Also a cursory search of the web does not come up with any references.
It may be possible to enable this behavior, but I don't know how.
Since Exchange 2007 / 2010 doesn't support it, the only way would be to create your own MTA (Mail Transport Agent).
There is no need to register or set up these 'plus suffixes'.
