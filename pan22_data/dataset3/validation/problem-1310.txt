Given this structure, in addition to using search in recipes to find other nodes, it's possible to use knife search --local 'role:web-server AND chef_environment:production' to list matched nodes as well as knife ssh --local 'role:web-server AND chef_environment: production' 'ssh_command' to execute commands across all servers.
I understand not wanting to host your own chef server to gain this functionality!
There are a lot of moving parts to provide it, erlang and rabbitmq and...
It can read from json node/environment/role files in the right directory structure and act as the API endpoint until the chef run completes.
Luckily chef zero, or chef-client's --local mode as it's now known as, supports search and acts like a mini server of its own, only temporary.
The key thing that chef server provides over chef solo is the search ability, which can find servers/nodes based on a given query.
So, whilst this isn't exactly an ansible style dynamic inventory system, you can do a lot of things with it.
