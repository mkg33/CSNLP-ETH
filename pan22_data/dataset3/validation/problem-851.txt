Try the GPU upgrade before breaking the bank though.
However I can play 1080p videos out via HDMI on a big TV just fine at natural resolution.
Do Hulu videos play in higher resolution or do they just stretch when you view fullscreen?
That being said, I have had people on 128MB graphics cards being able to run WCF applications quite well.
128 bit will play anything well, but 256 bit will play most things great.
256-512 megabytes of video RAM is pretty much the norm.
I have been having a few problems with flash based video sites stalling and flickering slightly on a 512MB Geforce 8600 GT.
-- Also, Nvidia and ATI made some serious rubbish cards a few generations ago that ate a huge chunk of your system ram and had hardly any performance increase.
I think that there are some problems in flash itself.
In fact, I would go so far to say that memory bus size is one of the most important factors.
However, I think this was achieved via a function of PCI Express, so it may not effect you.
I would not look at the memory but the generation.
the "bit" rating specifies the Memory bus size, and bigger is always better.
Look at your CPU usage while playing the content from Hulu.
If so, it may be your processor and not your display card.
If the resolution changes, it may be your network connection struggling to keep up.
256-bit is a big factor as essentially it is double the memory bandwidth (assuming both cards specifications are similar otherwise).
Just get the newest card that has the support for the newest Direct X / Open GL.
(I forget the name, I will edit if I can remember or find it).
If it is a choice between 256 or 128, go for the biggest!
