Yeah, IBM just announced an initiative to do that:
I'm specifically looking for Virtual Desktop solutions like ACE that place the image on the local computer to be able to work off-line if needed.
Or perhaps a vendor that provides a virtual desktop solution and hosts it on its own infrastructure?
Or, IBM Managed Services is available for organizations that are interested in having IBM not only design and implement a Smart Business Desktop Cloud solution for them, but also to manage the centralized data - including updates and information security.
Is there any software that itself works on a cloud computing provider?
The IBM Smart Desktop Cloud allows users to connect to a virtual machine operating system on a central server, using a thin-client or PC, running Javaâ„¢ and an Internet browser.
Security-rich and scalable, the Smart Desktop Cloud delivers a resilient, standards-based desktop environment and system image (Windows or Linux).
IBM Smart Business Desktop Cloud is available with IBM Project Based Services, if you'd like help designing and implementing a solution, and can manage the cloud once it's up and running.
For example, VMWare ACE running on an Amazon EC2 platform?
