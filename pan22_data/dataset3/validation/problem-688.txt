Some distros also have header/footer files that get prepended or appended to the /etc/resolv.conf file that allows you to suppliment whatever data NetworkManager tries to put in there.
It seems that you are using NetworkManager to manage your connections.
Since yours says it was generated by NetworkManager, perhaps you should look into either setting these options in NetworkManager (by right clicking on the little network connectivity icon on your toolbar) or turning it off and managing the link yourself.
On most linux systems you can just modify /etc/resolv.conf directly.
The DNS server is being set via dhcp in your configuration.
You'll have to tell Network Manager NOT to use the server suggested by DHCP, but to use a different one instead.
Set "DHCP for address only", then put your custom settings there for DNS and search domains there.
I do not have Gnome in english, please apologize if the menu are a bit different.
I would try the following in /etc/network/interfaces
Look in NetworkManager  configuration: Right click on its icon, "Modify Connections", select "auto eth0" connection -> modify -> IPv4.
