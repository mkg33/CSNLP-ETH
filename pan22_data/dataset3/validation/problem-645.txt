You can't use soft links in Samba, you have a lot of broadcasts too.
In your case I suggest NFS but if you have in mind to expand his functionality in the future then go SMB.
SMB is more secure but it need more configuration ( nothing impossible ) and it can be accessed by almost all operating systems, it's a must if u need to access it via WAN network.
Five arguments, why NFS might be better in this situation:
NFS is very performant in closed network and it's simpler than SMB to setup, SMB share has more configuration about access and permissions and it can be accessed by windows OS.
If you need a simple share that can be accessed only by known machines, I'd recommend NFS especially in LAN network has very good performance.
If you are the only one sharing, use whichever you find easier to setup.
So, if you care about having nice and neat permissions for shares accessed by multiple users, Samba may be a little easier to use, once it's setup.
Samba allows user mappings for clients and shares as well as the ability to force umasks for files.
Only know that NFS can be confused when you are exporting a folder which is a bind mount.
One argument against NFS is that clients (users) have more control over file permissions since they are accessing the file share directly as a user on the server system.
