I've had the problem from 1 happen while deploying images before.
Re #1 - I don't know about V11, but on older versions you could fix it by typing Ctrl+C to exit the ghostcast session and then type:
I've then deleted the ghost partition and marked the Windows partition as the active partition.
I believe the problem is to do with the MBR - You can fix the MBR on the target laptop after imaging, but it's easier just to image the partition.
Ghost creates a partition for its use and then doesn't delete it.
I am using Symantec Ghost Corporate Edition (centralised server et al) version 11 to ease deployment of new desktops, and I am having a couple of issues.
We then use GhostConsole to deploy that image other (identical hardware) computers, and this in general works fine.
At the moment we have a very very basic use of Ghost in place - we use GhostConsole to deploy a client to a prepared computer, then to sysprep it and grab the image.
I've had trouble in the past w/ IBMs and Ghost (something about the IBM software, if we wanted to image an IBM, we had to just reformat the things and start over from scratch).
That means an image might get corrupted on the way to the imaged host, and all you can do is reimage.
However, if my first answer fixes 1, then you can just retake your image.
Although we know Ghost can do much much more, we have yet to actually tap into this and have been using the above process for about a year.
For 2, as far as I know, once an image is taken, that's it for that image.
I now image just the OS partition rather than the whole disk.
It has the added benefit of using less disk space on your ghost server too.
From my experience using gjostcast deploying 400+ workstations back in the win98 days, about 10-15% had to be reimaged again because of this corruption
I've been able to create a boot disk and put like fdisk or something similar on there.
I'm no expert on ghost, but ghostcast uses UDP, which is uncontrolled.
