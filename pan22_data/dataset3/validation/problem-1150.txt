You don't say what operating system you are using, but I would recommend IIS if you're running Windows.
Can't remember if it has commandline capabilities though.
The dead simple server: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
will set up a webserver on http://127.0.0.1:8000 serving content in the CWD
It does have a conf file for mime types if I recall.
it wouldn't be hard to write a script that uses http://docs.python.org/library/mimetypes.html and mimetypes.init() or mimetypes.read_mime_types() to get the mimetype mappings you need.
You can get an example 'web server script' from http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-really-simple-http-server-python and use that framework to add your mimetype loads someplace in the script.
It is free, it runs on Windows and Linux, it will run all of the mimi types you require and there is a TON of documentation out on the web for it.
I have run (am running) Apache on a Windows / Linux environment that hosts a web mail client for my IMAP mail server.
as far as mimetypes, i think it sets something up from http://docs.python.org/library/mimetypes.html
