"My Fix:  Simply uninstall the Link-Layer Topology (Mapper I/O Driver and Responder) protocols, as well as the QoS Packet Scheduler service (you can add them back again afterwards) in the Local Area Connection of the client machine (not the server/target).
The only solution I found was to connect from a different machine -- I suspect it was an issue with my Intel I217-V chipset (but the drivers are up to date).
This occurs if the Windows 7 clients are connected via WiFi, then use a VPN connection to get inside the firewall (this issue is on both PPTP VPN run by the Microsoft Routing and Remote Access and the IPSEC VPN run by the Cisco ASA 5510), this happens on every Win 7 client connecting (providing they are connected via WiFi), if they are connected to the internal WiFi this issue does not occur.
I had a similar issue connecting as a client to a server.
In my case, I had to uninstall (not uncheck, but uninstall) the component "Citrix DNE LightWeight Filter Driver" - also got rid of the following TightVNC error message: "pseudo encoding is not supported"
Connected to the target machine fine from another desktop on our network.
You must uninstall, not simply remove the checkmark next to the protocol or service."
Windows 7 clients connecting to the RDS running on Win server 2008 R2 very frequently get the error message "Because of an error in the data encryption, this session will end...".
What is odd is that an XP client connecting exactly the same way (WiFi -> VPN -> RDC) does not experience this issue and connects fine every time.

The server is an HP Proliant ML350 G6 (which uses the broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Server Card), firewall is an ASA 5510.
