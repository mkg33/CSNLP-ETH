These generally work better than the hacks that the Linux community provides.
You can find out the type of card you have by running sudo lshw -C network.
If you can't find anything, then post the wireless product you have.
The Ubuntu forums refuse to admit that there is anything wrong with Ubuntu - it's perfect in every way.
The easiest cure I have found is just to use the Windows Wireless Drivers application to install the Windows XP drivers for the wireless card.
Could it be that ubuntu's wireless connectivity is crappy or runnning ubuntu on macbookpro is not fully supported (I follow the guide completely on ubuntu's official pages).
If you search for your specific card on Google (include keyword ubuntu), then there will generally be a post already in the Ubuntu forums about that particular card.
Wireless is always finicky in Ubuntu because many hardware manufacturers don't write drivers for Linux, but they do for Mac OS and Windows.
So lately I have been travelling around San Francisco.
Another thing to try is hook into the internet via Ethernet and run Administration->Additional Drivers to check if there are any proprietary (manufacturer supplied) drivers.
Additionally, I've noticed problems connecting at my university, but hardly ever do I have problems at home.
