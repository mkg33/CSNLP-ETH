Any help is much appreciated and excuses for the wall of text :)
(svn up) This is prone to errors and will provide even more overhead if we decide to add another webserver to the rotation.
Or you could have a post-commit hook in subversion trigger the deployment to the two clients... .
So in short: I have to find a way to automate keeping the 2 local checkouts in sync so i only have to update on 1 server and everything gets synced.
I have a website that is in SVN and checked out on 2 different servers for load balancing.
What about a crontab entry on each host which runs a script each five minutes?
Now on an update i have to update the two local checkouts manually.
In case you're running on linux OSes you may use DRBD to sync the datas between the two SVN servers at the block level without worrying about Subversion.
It's a drupal site and everything besides the assets and files directory is checked out locally on the servers.
The script could update the svn repository and do whatever post-processing is deemed necessary... .
