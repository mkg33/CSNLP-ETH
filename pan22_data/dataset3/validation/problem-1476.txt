To accomplish this, before any changes are made they are entered in the .ldf.
SQL is designed so if the power goes out during a change (no matter how small) it will be able to recover.
If ldf space is an issue read Why Does the Transaction Log Keep Growing or Run Out of Space?
You should not delete LDF files until you successfully raised up the DB on the side without LDF (and sql server surely recreates them).
In the event of a power outage, everything in the .ldf that has not committed will be rolled back.
SQL needs the ldf (log file) to support fault tolerance answer by StanleyJohns.
No matter how controlled your environment, there will be changes inside of your SQL database; failed logins, restarts from patching, plan updates with queries, many things create changes that you may not be aware of.
TL:DR the ldf file is required, because SQL documents everything (including allowing you to query) before it actually does anything.
You're probably working off the default settings, which create all databases in Full Recovery mode, meaning, the logs are going to grow.
Logs are an essential part of how SQL Server works.
If you drop the ldf's for just not to transfer them to the other server - copy data files, try to attach them and only if you succeed - delete old files, even with data files together.
For the needs of your application maybe all you need is a flat file storage mechanism.
If the system is in FULL recover, all off those entries are saved, if the system is in SIMPLE recovery, those entries are deleted when the change is completed or COMMITTED.
To maintain ACID transactions in SQL server, the SQL server architecture relies on the use of data files and log files.
