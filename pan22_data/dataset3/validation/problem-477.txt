It's entirely possible that a faulty power strip which was making marginal contact of the live pins could have either broken contact for the briefest of moments, which would cause a momentary low voltage, or the marginal contact could have cause arcs of electricity, which could cause a momentary high voltage.
So, it is plausible that at rated speed it might matter as well, especially if the computer is running too warm.
I can think of intermittent contact, or insufficient/burned-out noise filtering and surge protection.
Set for 220 input but feeding it 110 worked just fine under ideal circumstances, but not when (presumably) something happened like under-voltage or excessive line noise.
As for power to the power supply: in a well-made psu it should not care.
Replacing the faulty power strip would fix any of these problems.
Something else plugged in to it might supply surges or line noise.
Upon close inspection, they all, had the mains voltage switch set wrong except for the good one.
When testing my previous rig for overclocking, I found the mosfets on the motherboard needed better cooling to run stably at speed.
However, some of the stuff missing from the cheap ones are exactly the parts to smooth out fluxuations and buffer against rapid changing of the inout voltage.
Voltage fluxuations make that worse and overclocking literature reports that it does make a difference as to running stably.
It is also possible for your power supply to compensate for the high-voltage arc as well, but it could cause a momentary high (or low as the voltage got clamped) which in turn could affect the components similar to a momentary disconnect.
What I read concerned longevity and reliability of the motherboard regarding nice stable supply voltages.
It is entirely possible for momentary low-voltage event to be compensated by your power supply, but it is also entirely possible for it to cause one of the various power regulators to put out a glitch voltage which could cause any one of the various chips on the motherboard to reset or otherwise crash.
In an extreme case, a low voltage can crash the cpu by browning out.
Here is an anectode I heard a number of years ago: all the computers in the room would crashnat the same time except for 1.
A marginal earth contact could also easily cause damage or crashes in a similar fashion as the electrical potential between earth and the live pins would fluctuate causing the motherboard ground and power connections to vary.
So what could be wrong with a power strip that would induce such problems, while a different strip was fine?
Various guides point out that the frequency changing when the cpu idles, and the anti-interference clock jitter can cause crashes because two clock ticks may happen to close together.
Some years ago I read an article on Toms Hardware (can't find it now) testing power supplies.
Any of these events would also place a lot of stress on the PSU components and cause capacitors, inductors or regulators to degrade or otherwise sooner than they would.
It was a eye-opener, such as how the manufacturers made "creative use" of the specifications or outright lied.
