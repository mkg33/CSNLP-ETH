The students do their work and save it on the D-drive in a particular folder such as a folder with the same name as the computer's name (e.g.
I have a computer lab with about 35 PC's all running Windows 7.
Unison shares a number of features with tools such as configuration management packages (CVS, PRCS, Subversion, BitKeeper, etc.
Unlike a distributed filesystem, Unison is a user-level program: there is no need to modify the kernel or to have superuser privileges on either host.
What about configuring standard windows share out the D: drive on each of the student machines and easily pull it down to the teacher machine.
Unison runs on both Windows and many flavors of Unix (Solaris, Linux, OS X, etc.)
However, there are several points where it differs:
Updates that do not conflict are propagated automatically.
Suggestions for free, or almost free, best ways to set this up?
It is careful to leave the replicas and its own private structures in a sensible state at all times, even in case of abnormal termination or communication failures.
I'd like a centralized way to pull all these folders in to the teacher's computer in the lab to check the assignments.
It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.
I've seen software applications that do this but they cost about US$1000 which is far beyond our means.
Unison is free; full source code is available under the GNU Public License.
), and other synchronizers (Intellisync, Reconcile, etc).
It would be best if this didn't involve using an external website (e.g.
Transfers of small updates to large files are optimized using a compression protocol similar to rsync.
Unison works between any pair of machines connected to the internet, communicating over either a direct socket link or tunneling over an encrypted ssh connection.
), uni-directional mirroring utilities (rsync, etc.
It is careful with network bandwidth, and runs well over slow links such as PPP connections.
Moreover, Unison works across platforms, allowing you to synchronize a Windows laptop with a Unix server, for example.
I would also like to be able to distribute (send) files to the students in these same folders.
Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows.
Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal with updates to both replicas of a distributed directory structure.
