Fortunately, you can buy an ADC (analog to digital converter) in order to add analog inputs to the Raspberry Pi.
The sensor you linked states that it takes a power supply of 12-24V.
It seems like the sensor puts out an analog output (a voltage that varies between 0 and 5) depending on distance observed.
However, the Raspberry Pi GPIO operate on 3.3V only.
You can buy 12V or 24V power bricks pretty easily - you'll just need to solder one up to the leads of the sensor.
The Raspberry Pi can only provide 5V, so you'll need to find another way to power the sensor.
This is probably a rookie question but I was interested in hooking up my RPi 3 B+ to the following ultrasonic sensor to measure water level in a humid environment (for arguments sake, the Pi will not be in the humid environment).
You can find a tutorial on how to use an ADC with the Raspberry Pi here, as well as a link to buy one.
You'll need a way to turn the 5V signal into a 3.3V signal.
Any tips for making this happen, or am I just dreaming?
Unfortunately, the Raspberry Pi has no analog inputs.
This issue I seem to be having is that the sensor requires a supply voltage of 24V and the output would be an analog output of 0-5V.
You can find a tutorial about it on Hackaday here - note that while the article talks mostly about digital signals, using a resistive divider will work just fine with the analog signal produced by the sensor.
