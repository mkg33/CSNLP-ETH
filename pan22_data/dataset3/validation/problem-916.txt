One of these clients is prompted every 5-10 minutes for credentials.
Ticking the checkbox to remember credentials does not fix the situation.
The majority of my Exchange users are all on Windows 7 and have no issues (at least using Outlook...) but a subset of the executives are ardent Mac users running Outlook 2011 for OS X.
Solved the problem by clicking Outlook during the few seconds after I had clicked "No" when the message was off the screen.
Beware that all the operations had to be performed very quickly between clicking "No" which removed the message box for about 5 seconds, before it re-appeared again!
I decided to purge my system of 7 old entries, leaving only the most recent entry.
I have already removed and rebuilt the EWS virtual directory on my Client Access server.
I've tried all other suggestions I could find but no success with any of them.
Anyone else notice in the keychain a number of old Exchange password entries?
I had problem with Outlook for Mac - a box kept appearing saying "Authentication Failed - Invalid Credentials" and asking if I wanted to try entering password.
I work remotely 99% of the time and never had this problem until I came into the corporate office and hopped on their internal WiFi.
If "No" was clicked or if my password was entered, the message would just appear again after a few seconds.
I had this problem of prompting every 5 sec and error of logon failure, tried to reset the keychain but it would not work.
None of the Microsoft clients are experiencing this issue.
So out of despair I simply entered for the login field: login@domain name.com instead of the classic email address or domain\login or login and tadaaa it stopped.
So visibly there's a problem for the login field with exchange servers
The password box was empty so I filled it in and the fault message never appeared again and I could open Outlook.
Whilst this message was on the screen I could not open Outlook on my MacBook.
Keeping my fingers crossed that fixes the problem.
