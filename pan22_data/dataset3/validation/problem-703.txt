Windows 7 also has an automated boot repair function.
The BSOD probably says STOP 0x0000007B: INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE, which usually indicates that your hard disk controller needs a different driver than the one that was used to install Windows.
Before attempting an in-place upgrade, try running the startup repair.
Check with the manufacturer for Windows 7 support.
Usually, the easiest way to resolve this is by performing an in-place upgrade (which is a Windows re-installation that attempts to preserve your files and settings).
This is a common problem when switching hard disk controllers.
Because Windows doesn't have the driver for the new controller already installed, it can't boot.
Your controller probably requires different drivers for RAID versus non-RAID mode.
It's very possible that you don't have compatible drivers installed for your RAID controller.
If possible, you may be able to switch the BIOS back to the non-RAID mode, find the appropriate driver for the RAID-mode controller, and install it manually.
The recovery options on the Windows 7 DVD might help as well.
Thereafter, you may be able to switch it to RAID mode and boot successfully.
Another option might be to switch to the old controller (non-RAID mode), use Sysprep to reseal the image, and then switch to the new controller (RAID mode), but I haven't used this approach.
