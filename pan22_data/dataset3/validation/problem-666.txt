Click OK, it should disappear very briefly then reappear with the correct (new) name for you.
that brings up the proper printer properties dialog box
then a load of buttons/icons appear one of which is called "customize your printer".
Easiest way - right click on the device, open "Printer Properties" and then type in the name you prefer in the top section of the dialog box.
selecting the printer properties gave me a read-only dialog box.
There the text box for the "printer name" is not read only and you can change it.
Then clicked on the printer drop-down menu and clicked on properties.
When you right-click a printer (in Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Devices and Printers), there are two similar options: 'Printer properties' (in the middle of the right-click options) and 'Properties' (at the bottom).
I couldn't find any way to rename a samsung ml-1630w
Took a few minutes to figure out why I couldn't set the printer name.
instead I had to double click the printer to "open" it.
Yes, When you right-click the text box is read only.
