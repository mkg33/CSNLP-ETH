I've never hit exactly this situation, however, I think this will work.
There are other alternatives that may fit your need better, including the venerable Unix dd command.
If that happens, Clonezilla has always worked but can take a bit longer.

Use Clonezilla, a clone of Norton Ghost which is used in most corporate environments to clone OS installs across the corporate network.
Just make sure that the replacement HD is the same size as the original, or closely matches the original HD in terms of specs and size.
The tools that I used were either Ghost or  (which comes on the awesome-and-free Hiren's Boot CD) or Clonezilla.
Get a new drive the exact size as the old drive, then using a linux live CD you can make an exact copy of the drives using a command like 'dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb'  (be really careful you get the devices right).
It's been my experience that some recovery partitions get corrupted when using Ghost.
There may very well be a better way ... but that's what I'd try ...
Clonezilla can be run from a LiveCD, or any bootable media like a USB drive or USB hard disk.
