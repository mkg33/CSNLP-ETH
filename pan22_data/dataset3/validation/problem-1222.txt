I agree with user48838 - by definition the magic packet is sent only over the local subnet.
(I am asking this on server fault as it is as much about VPN servers as about the end user PCs sleeping)
Is it true that we canâ€™t allow any machine to sleep that may need to be accessed var a VPN connection?
I found a tool on the internet that sends the WOL packet as uni-cast to the intended host, by which avoid passing the broadcast packet through the router issue.
However, I previously used a script written by jpo that worked from a different subnet via a normal router.
Yes you can, instead of sending the WoL packet to broadcast address in target network, just send it to the IP address of the machine you want to wake up.
Typically no since the "MagicPacket" is actually at layer 2.
It's not even routable without the assistance of forwarders (e.g.
One point you need to watch out with this solution, you need to put Static arp entry on the router since the host will be off and will not respond to the router ARP request.
