It is, however, very easy to install, even if you haven't tried water cooling before.
I can't seem to find any useful link right now, but the fluid dynamics of the thing makes moving the the volume of air quieter that way.
Look closer into using larger fans that run slower.
There are a  lot of things that do that poorly, if at all.

Be aware that building a water cooled computer is more work then one that uses fans, and requires a bit of planning.
If your looking to buy a watercooled solution i would use the zalman cabinet that has it all built in.
I am not sure if their cheapest line is any good however.
Build your PC with a passive-cooled or very quiet air-cooled power supply.
I find this bit to be quite creepy since I know I'll need to experiment to find a solution.
Totally worth it for the silence it provides though.
For a powersupply you need to find out how much power you need and search for your quite one.
With care, you can make fan-based solutions very quiet.
You know, surprisingly enough Dells are very quiet.
But i dont recommend that, i would rather buy one that has water cooling block already installed.
Be aware that you will need to buy water cooling system for you video card your self, i myself bought a video card and then a water cooling block for it.
Be aware that the zalman does not come with a water cooler block for a the I7 but the Core intel series so you will need to buy a I7 block.
The problem here is that the computer will be a lot less mobile since you'd need to disconnect the Reserator and transport it separately every time you'd move your computer.
Screwing a harddrive into the case lets it carry the vibrations.
I'm thinking of getting some of that asphalt stuff.
So if you find all this overwhelming, then check it out.
This will give extremely good performance and overclocking potential, an almost completely silent PC and a water temperature of around 30C (on the lowest radiator fan setting) when running at full capacity even with a high performance graphics card and CPU.
You most likely have to PAY to make your machine quiet by paying for better engineering and higher quality components.
Buy a Zalman Reserator v2 and appropriate waterblocks for your graphics card and CPU and fit these.
If your not willing to go all the way with water cooling, i would build a computer that fits my specs and buy a new fane for the CPU and replace the oem one.
This is the system I run at home and the only problem I've found is that when you upgrade you also need to buy new waterblocks and a little more hose.
