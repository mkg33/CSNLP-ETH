I can access the server fine as LINK1 (see below) from the internet.
I tried different combinations and googling and I just can't figure it out.
Works fine if accessed as http host dot domain dot com.
I was able to find a solution (partial) using two virtual hosts.
The problem is that if port 8000 is blocked on the listeners computer, they can't hear the stream.
So, I tried to use mod_proxy and mod_rewrite but with no avail.
If I use the below config, I can bypass the port 8000 and it streams fine on port 80, but http host dot domain dot com shows only the audio player, not the whole HTML page.

But in the HTML page for the first virtual host, I've added a link to open a new window that points to the 2nd virtual hosts where I use ProxyReverse.
Probably I can use a 1 pixel frame and point the link there, but I am fine with this solution as well.
Having Apache on 80 and icecast 8000 proxying thru the same port?
For listeners that can access port 8000, the configuration stays the same as above minus Proxy directives.
And then the config for that 2nd virtual host actually does the proxy reverse.
In addition, I created a small HTML page with some info that also embeds the HTML5 audio player.
