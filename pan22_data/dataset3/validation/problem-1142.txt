Starting the shell in the guest image  /opt/exagear/images/debian-8
But you should know that the files to download are about 15 gigabyte (after installing in fact 22 GB).
This is why I recommend the first option, if you only want to install it quickly.
Simply because things will run smoother in midori/every other lightweight browser that with chrome/-ium.
As far as I know Google does not (yet) distribute Chrome binaries for Linux/ARM.
Download ExaGear Desktop archive with installation packages and license key.
If you dont use the new Pi2, I really recommend you using a different browser, like midori.
Unpack the downloaded archive by entering the following command in Terminal:
Make sure that your micro SD card (32GB or more) has enough empty disk space.
Depending on your internet speed this step can take a while.
Now you can check out the needed files (about 15 GB).
Then, you can install it also by using the packet manager:
It is recommended to update apt-get repositories on the first launch of the guest system:
(The only ARM binaries are for Android and these will not be compatible.)
If you haven’t already installed git, you have to install it first:
If you want to compile the Raspberry Pi Chrome (Chromium) Browser yourself, visit their Google Source repository where you can also check the code.
Also keep in mind that if you were able to install it, you may be disappointed with its performance as it is designed for somewhat more powerful machines.
For example, you can't watch video with Netflix or Amazon prime with Chromium because it lack a couple of libraries.
Note: Exagear, which is needed is not free it does cost a few bucks for a license!
Install and activate ExaGear on your RPi by running install-exagear.sh script in a directory with deb packages and one license key:
Install Chromium on your Raspberry Pi with apt-get
If you are connected through SSH or not using the graphical user interface, you should start (startx).
Otherwise you can also establish a remote desktop connection.
Open Source Chromium is really good alternative for Google Chrome.
Alternatively you can install the package chromium-browser instead of chromium.
Press F3 key to save changes and F2 to close the file.
Because the question is already answered, I will tell you something else.
After finished downloading all files, you can compile the project.
Now click the start button and navigate to “Internet” where you will find the Chromium shortcut.
The code is not available on GitHub, but that makes no difference for cloning and compiling the repository.
You might be able to cross-compile Chromium for Linux/armel (I have not tried but I am willing to bet that the RasPi itself is not powerful enough to compile it.)
You should change it to 2000MB in the configuration file.
Now you are in the x86 environment that can be checked by running the arch command:
You can install original x86 Google Chrome with help of ExaGear Desktop.
If the installation above failed (for any reason) or you want to inspect / change the code, this is how you can do it (you must have a Raspberry Pi Model 2B / 3, because the models before have not 4 kernels):
Enter the guest x86 system by using the following command:
Next, we clone the whole repository to a specific folder, which we create and then go into this directory.
