It took me quite some time to track it down, mainly found the problem after starting to bisect my entire home directory (move half of the directories to a temporary directory and log in again etc.)
In case someone else finds this page when searching, like me, for a possible cause, it is perhaps: Desktop magnification.
After weeks of searching and trying to fix this problem, I finally got it sorted through this page: http://carlocapocasa.com/crushing-the-kworker-uprising-or-how-to-fix-your-linux-lenovo-ideapad-y560p/
I have experienced heavy mouse lag on cinnamon suddenly.
It would be curious to see if any errors are recorded in /var/log/Xorg.0.log.
@reboot echo "disable" > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpeXX
I tried anything ... different kernels, updating drivers - nothing worked.
(the gpe with the clear high number is the problem)
until I could locate ~/.config/dconf/user and then finally the zoom level factor that was set to 1.0:
I just checked that Linux Mint 14 is based on Ubuntu 12.10 and uses kernel 3.5.
This setting seems to cause heavy problems randomly.
Judging by the relatively high %sy value in top and based on your statement that the same hardware used to work correctly before the upgrade, I think the lag is caused by a driver.
It is unusual for a healthy, almost idle system to spend so much time in kernel mode.
You can check if this is the case on your Cinnamon with
Anyway the surprisingly magic solution was to unklick the option "Disable touchpad while typing" in the mouse settings.
Note that on newer kernels the drm_kms_helper module may not be loaded by default.
However I had the same issue with the mouse lag in Linux Mint 14 x64 Cinnamon.
Make sure it is turned off with Alt+Super+8, even when the screen is not magnified.
There is a chance it will "break" something else and probably you would need to compile it.
If it is that terrible, you may want to get 2.6.x family kernel installed.
