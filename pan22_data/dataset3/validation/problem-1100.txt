Not sure what it means really in your warranty card.
(but the front ports are also attached to the motherboard using wires.)
The length of this cable and the fact that it’s a pin header connection make it more susceptible to (EM) interference.
and the front one are for easily and quickly removable peripherals.As the back ports are soldered to MB it is better to use them less frequently.
Many of my devices such as netbooks and laptops have ports on the sides, neither back nor front, actually.
Some devices (like 2.5″ hard disks) that can barely run on a single USB may fail in this environemnt.
Actually by "Always use USB ports on the back of the case" they probably mean: don't use extension cables or hubs but use a "real" usb port.
Oversimplification is a common teaching tool, and one of the reasons that technical fields must re-teach certain subject at the college level to correct these errors or over-specifications in high school level classes.
tl;dr: Front ports are more susceptible to power and signal quality issues.
the front ports are part of the cabinet and the back ports are part of motherboard.
I have had motherboards in the past that provided usb 1 on the headers (which connected to the front of the case), and provided usb 2 to the ones mounted/attached to the back of the board itself (aka the back ports).
This additional cable also means there’s additional resistance, reducing maximum voltage and thus power.
For the less technical, if they follow what is written, they are more likely to not have problems with the device.
Their on-board connection to the actual USB controller is designed to resist (EM) interference, as required by the FCC.
More technically minded individuals will probably know that the generalization made int he manual is too narrow.
The back ports are (usually) directly connected to your motherboard.
With respect to your flash-memory stick, the manufacturer of that device is gambling on the idea that the ports on the back are going to be the highest supported standard at the time of the board's manufacture.
The front ports are not directly connected to your motherboard.
They need to make a statement for the people most likely to need the statement made.
There is a difference in power level only, as some device needs high power (500 mA instead of 100) to charge or function.
This is purely a design choice made by the board designer(s).
Instead, there is a cable inside the computer case that is connected to a regular pin header on your motherboard.
Since they did not design your motherboard, they have no way of knowing for sure.
The main difference is the way the signal travels inside your computer.
Back ports are used to provide more sockets for connecting peripherals on back.
