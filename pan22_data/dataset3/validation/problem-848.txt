Unfortunately (as I am just finding out this week) the 64 bit version of any program (in this case Windows Explorer) cannot use 32 bit dll's (the MatroskaProp shell extension).
The best solution would be to compile a 64 bit version of MatroskaProp and use that, but I'm not entirely sure of all the dependencies and what code changes need to be made to get that to work.
"%windir%\syswow64\explorer.exe /seperate,::{20d04fe0-3aea-1069-a2d8-08002b30309d}"
If you want to make a shortcut that will open up a 32 bit Explorer window, I would use
The bit at the end after "/seperate" basically just says that you want it to open at "My Computer" instead of the defailt "My Documents"
Without the "/seperate" argument it will just open up a regular 64 bit Explorer window, so make sure you type that.
A work around is to open a 32 bit Explorer window and use that instead of a normal 64 bit Explorer window.
This is easily done by typing this in the "Run" dialogue box (or the search box in the Start Menu):
