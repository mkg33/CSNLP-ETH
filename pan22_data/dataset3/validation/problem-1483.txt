Now, I dont know if Yahoo lets you tune all those TTLs.
Have a secondary DNS from ZoneEdit and have high TTLs for MX records.
Worst case, you can use editdns.net or some other third party service during the transition.
The general idea to have DNS transfers going smoothly is to lower the TTL before doing the changes.
In most cases, by the time the transfer propogates to the registry, requests should have been already been handled by Google Apps.
Of course this is all "should" not "definitely will" and things could sometimes go wrong, so plan for a little downtime anyway (at least warn you users it might happen).
The registry will take some time to update, but you can expect that Yahoo will continue to handle the requests properly passing them on to Google apps until GoDaddy's transfer propogates to the registry.
A good registrar setup will allow you to configure you DNS entries as soon as the transfer is agreed (possible as soon as it is initiated) and the other should serve requests for a short time after the transfer is complete so downtime is going to be minimal - as soon as the new delegation to GoDaddy is seen by DNS lookups all your entries pointing to Google will be there ready and Yahoo should still be serving the right values long enough to account for their normal TTL values.
For example, if you lower the TTL of all your records to 5 minutes, than changes will propagate in 5 minutes max.
The important TTL that you should not forget, is the delegation from your parent zone (.com, .org, .ch, ...).
I have no idea how you can manage .com delegations, as I only use .ch names ...
