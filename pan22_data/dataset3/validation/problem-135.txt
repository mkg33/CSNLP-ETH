Your efforts aren't pointless, but you will have to fight an arms race that, by definition, no one can possibly win, if you want to stop everybody.
While if you redirect it, they will be getting online without calling in customer support, or the IT admin.
If your users want to get around that they'll just run a VPN tunnel to an off-site box and get DNS from there.

It will reduce support time, and if that costs money, it will save money.
If you want you computers on your LAN to only permitted to use a specific DNS server you need to block UDP port 53 outgoing on your firewall to all IP addresses along with adding rules to explicitly permit the IPs of the "allowed" DNS servers.
You can try and block that, too, but they'll just fight you another way.
If there is already a DHCP server out there, just make sure you answer quicker, or do some ARP poisoning/spoofing.
(After all, you can tunnel IP over DNS if you really want to!
If you are looking to prevent users on your network from some other dns server you will need to block access at the firewall.
It wont stop everyone but it will allow you better control.
Within your LAN you could put up a DHCP serving the DNS you want.
If you block port 53, the end user with a custom dns will not be getting domain name resolution, and could cause a poor user experience.
The best user experience would be to hijack anysourceip:53 to go to your :53 with a firewall rule to forward requests.
If you do that you will need to provide a dns server that you allow to have outside access.
