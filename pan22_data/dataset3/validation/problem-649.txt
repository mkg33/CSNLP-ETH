I tried to mount as a nonroot user but I got a permission issue, even after the user was added to the fuse group.
I'm not sure if that's related to my problem but I would love to dig into that once I get this working.
and now as a nonroot user I am able to see the contents of animal.txt but I can't touch the file or create a new file in that directory.
I know the docs say not to mount the bucket as root but I didnt see anything that explained why it's bad.
Is gcsfuse the right way to go about this or is there a better solution for mounting a google cloud storage bucket available on a systemwide level?
I am currently able to mount my test bucket as the root user (with the allow_other option set) but nonroot users only have read access.
Here is the console output - Catting and touching animal.txt to update the time stamp.
We are trying to use google cloud storage but are having problems mounting the buckets using gcsfuse.
We are currently trying to demo the google cloud platform for some workloads that require lots of storage.
