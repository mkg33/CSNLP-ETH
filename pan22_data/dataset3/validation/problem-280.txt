However, I still want to mount the storage array and be able to get onto nodes on the HPC server so I thought I would also connect that computer to MyMainServer through the p5p1 interface (those are 10 GB/s cards).
You need to check route table on your new server and make sure that your default route goes through em interface.
That is, it only works if I first ssh into MyMainServer, then ssh MyServer.
MyServer is using Centos7, MyMainServer is using Ubuntu 14.04 Server.
I now added a new server with it's own static IP using the interface em1.
Is there anyway to be able to still connect to the Storage Arrays through the 10 GB/s p5p1 interface and be able to have my primary IP be through em1?
It is still registering the correct IP address, but for some reason it wants to go through MyMainServer.
For instance you have to ssh into that server, before you can ssh into anything on the HPC cluster.
I have drawn a pretty crude diagram so it may be easier to explain.
Usually, all the new servers we add just go into the HPC cluster and we assign an IP address through our main DNS server.
