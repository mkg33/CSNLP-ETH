If you don't have an initial investment, your rate of return isn't a real number.
As stated above, be sure the first cell in the range has a negative number representing the amount of the investment:
Internal Rate of Return calculates the discount rate for an original investment to equal zero NPV over the term.
Each number is $116,000.00  Do I need to change the numbers to General instead of Currency or do I need some negative numbers.
Clearly then the series of cash flows must have both at least one positive and at leas one negative value in order for an IRR to exist and be calculable.
I have to use the IRR formula for 4 cells in a row but for some reason I keep getting an error(NUM!
If there is no negative number as the initial investment, no combination of positive cash flows will be able to equal zero.
For the =irr function to work properly, there must be at least one positive value and one negative.
Think of it this way; you cannot get a return on an investment unless you have both made an investment (a negative value) and received a return (a positive value).
