This server is also used as a terminal services server..
Yes, someone is trying to brute their way into your server.
I think that our terminal server was left open to the outside and someone was attempting a dictionary attack.
Logon type 10 is a Remote Interactive logon attempt.
It seems the source port on the event changes as well.
Now if you notice the user, for each event like this one.. the user name changes and they seem to be all alphabetical attempts if I would sort by date..
This is what the event looks like, under Security logs.
Either they have a way to tell if the login is failed for a nonexistent user or a wrong password, or they are trying an attack with random usernames and random passwords.
If you are confident that all your users have strong passwords, you could ignore this.
Thanks any advice / help would be greatly appreciated.
I'll shut off access from the outside in - as this should have been closed long ago.
You could also block the source addresses if there are only a handful of them, or change your network architecture so that you can only remote into that server from your LAN or VPN.
The IP here is internal on this one, but for most it is an outside IP such as 213.88.247.2 ..

So yes, these are attempts from outside entities to logon to the DC via Terminal Services.
