You could probably su to different accounts prior to starting different admin activities so that you had a record of start / stop times on activities.
Lately I've been using an iPhone app on my iPod, HoursTracker, but previously I used such software as Notepad and Pieces of Paper with Writing on Them(tm).
If you just want to see how much time you spend logged-on why not look at the output of "last"?
I work time-and-materials for all my Customers and have to keep fairly detailed logs of my activities and times.
If you use Emacs Org mode is used by a lot of people for this.

If you want to get good per-task times you're going to have to have the discipline to log when you start and stop working on a given task.
That almost sounds like you're looking for some kind of automatic method of identifying what you're working on and logging the time.
Some kind of brain-computer--GPS-telephone interface would be awesome, but it just doesn't exist that I've been able to find.
If there's a shortcut out there I'd certainly love to find it, but my methodology is, I expect, the only one that makes realistic sense:
If you want to get a good handle on your Samba-related admin time, you'll have to be sure to log yourself off of that task when you're doing Apache work, playing Server Fault, etc.
Whatever you do, the usage methodology is a lot more important than the tool you use to gather data.
I don't see any reason why you couldn't use a simple shell script to append times and log details to a database,  flat file, etc.
How does that tool know why you're tailing "/var/log/messages" today?
I'd hypothesize that the amount of time you'd spend building and maintaining some kind of "AI" to analyze your commands and track time would dwarf the amount of time you actually spend on sysadmin duties.
Hmm theres a few ways from creating a file on login and logout to fully featured tracking software take a look here:
Your statement "...ways of tracking time spent in shell for Linux system administration."
