I was not able to select the partition with the asterisk.
Since all I wanted to do was delete the partition, I was able to use the clean command within diskpart, so something like this:
What do you get when you select the Flash Drive and then LIST PARTITION?
Here's a transcript of a diskpart session, for reference:
Do you get the list disk process as Geoff Duke said ?
and it listed the partition with asterisk like before and then I just made it active, without selecting it again and it worked
( I got that buy doing 14(GB) *1024=14366 MB) and then I listed the partition
If you then run detail disk you will see that the status has changed to "unusable".
Also if still nothing happens go to explorer and format directly from there and come back again and try with cmd.
I had the same problem with the partition being listed with asterisc (selected) but could not select it and I had the no partition selected problem  and after reading the solutions here and in other places I removed the partition with clean and then re created it and made it active and then formatted the drive again in Disk Management.
I was then able to run my dd command from an image to this sd card.
If you select an object for a second time, diskpart still emits a message indicating that the object is selected.
This was necessary so that I could then use the windows version of dd.
If you don't than I think there might be some problem with your hardware , And then again if you do then try selecting again and check for typing mistakes this happens a lot with me .
I still do not know yet how to  put system on it to make it bootable
then I formatted the partition in the disk management in windows 7 (but I did not get the option of making the partition bootable) and then on checking the status again I got Healthy (Active Primary Partition)
I was trying to do something similar so this may help you:
I wanted to select the partition so that I could then delete it.
I tried selecting another disk and another partition, but as soon as I selected the target disk again the partition 1 was auto-selected with the aterisk.
