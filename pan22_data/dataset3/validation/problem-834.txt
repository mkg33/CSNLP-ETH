But there's a lot of file types that will not work, such as zip, pdf, doc etc, Usually we get a location box open up asking where we would like to drop the attachments, but it does nothing, You click Save All Attachments and nothing happens.
But on the other hand Microsoft released a KB (278188) which was depressing if that, but that article was published in 2007, as stated by the time stamp, and Exchange 2010 has only come out recently.
When the email has a single attachment it works perfectly normal, and depending on the file type it allows you to save multiple attachments.
It will be rolled into Outlook 2007 SP3 (whenever that's released).
After hours of research I have come across mixed results, a lot of people on forums have been explaining that they have recently crossed over to Exchange 2010 and there issues started there.
About 3 weeks back our company upgraded our mail system to Exchange 2010, all went smooth, few issues but nothing major.
Microsoft has issued a hotfix, available here, for this issue.
Im looking to see if you guys have any clues what could be causing this, anything server side that I can take a look at (AD, Exchange, ...).
A few days ago we had a call from a college where he was unable to save all attachments, From File > Save As > Save All Attachments.
