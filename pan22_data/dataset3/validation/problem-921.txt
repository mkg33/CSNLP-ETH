Once in a while our Internet connection is down or the personnel have to wait a long time to upload their emails (with considerable size of attachments) to the mail server.
Then acting as a relay, this local mail server should relay emails to the one on the Internet (emails are always relayed to the same remote mail server).
I would like to setup a local mail server and ask everyone to use this one instead.
We run a local relaying email server (exim4) in our LAN, and it works fine.
This way if our Internet connection is down, users can still send their emails to local mail server regardless and it's local mail server's responsibility to relay them once the connection is back up.
Spam traps can use whatever algorithm they want, but email commonly passes through multiple hops on the way to its destination.
We send our emails through company's mail server which is located (along with company's website) on a shared web host.
If yes I'll be really grateful if someone could direct me to the right path, what to read and how to do it.
And since it's a local mail server, it will take much less time for users to upload their attachments to it.
Maybe you heard that spam filters will flag messages coming through known open relays, but your server won't be that.
I don't know any reason why this should cause outgoing messages to be flagged as spam.
