But also, my daughter got a LeapPad for Christmas, and that has the same symptoms.
Are these USB ports connected directly to the motherboard, or are they on the case connected to headers on the motherboard?
So I'm beginning to think the USB ports maybe aren't quite right.
The Apple Mobile Device USB Driver does not show up in Device Manager.
In any case you can connect any simpler devices to it - like flash drive.
I have a Sabertooth P67-B3 motherboard, and I think my USB ports might not be working correctly, but I'm not 100% sure.
The problem comes from not being able to connect my I-Phone 3.
When I go to Device Manager, everything looks fine.
I believe that USB ports are working correctly as PC is trying to get a driver.
How can I test that the USB ports are working correctly?
Since you have a specific motherboard (instead of a specific computer), may I assume that this was a home-build?
When I connect the LeapPad, it dings, tries to connect, then fails and says to install the software on the PC (which is already installed).
Especially if the later, it sounds like the 2 power pins are correctly connected, but that the data pins are either reversed - or one of them is disconnected.
Apple support says to keep uninstalling I-Tunes and reinstalling it, but that hasn't worked for me.
The charge light on the phone comes on when it connects, so it recharges, but I-Tunes won't recognize the phone being attached.
