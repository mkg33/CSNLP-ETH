When you are ready to make the big jump, go ahead, remembering that Windows will overwrite your Linux boot record if you re-install it.
  - Boot from it and install Ubuntu on another USB disk / SD card
For myself ( and I have an older less powerful netbook - the 900), I run the regular Ubuntu with a small number of other applications installed on it.
Ubuntu Netbook Remix (UNR) is supposedly optimized and setup to do a faster startup.
Yes, you can install it along side your Windows setup, provided you partition your hard drive during the installation.
Ubuntu has several advantages, the main points being it's free and easily installed.
As information about how compatible UNR is with the Asus Eee 1001P hasn't been updated on the official Ubuntu site, I can't tell whether you'll face any problems or not with your UNR installation.
I've seen one other user with an Asus Eee 1001HE have the same problem in connecting to wireless as I did (his problem went away automatically), and I spent a bit of blood, sweat and tears trying to get wireless up on mine.
If you want to have a taste of ubuntu before taking the big decision, you can try the following:
I installed ubuntu on our laptop which had vista on it very easily and since my wife has never asked about windows to point where the partition where windows was installed has been scrubbed.
I have to warn you though, if you're considering the Asus Eee PC.
Some of the newer models have issues with their wireless working properly, so there exists this possibility that you'll need to work on patching the system with the required drivers.
  - Transfer your ISO into a bootable USB disk or SD card
As for the version of Ubuntu, it depends on the power of your netbook.
There are ways to recover from such situation, but they are not the easiest ones.
If you change your mind, the computer should come with a restore or reinstall disc that can be used to replace your Ubuntu installation.
  - Play with an installed linux (not Live version) and see for yourself
