Create your own CA, then create your own cross-signing issuer for Dept-Intermediate-1 (or Dept-Root-CA) by signing their cert with your CA, possibly adding domain restrictions.
I want to trust the Server-Certificate, but do not want to trust Dept-Root-CA because then it could sign any certificate and my servers would trust it.
The other part is the identifying information; server which owns the key, identity of the issuer, CA policies enforced, key storage information, etc.
Is it possible to get windows to trust a certificate, without getting it to trust the root CA as a trusted root CA?
If the "real" Dep-Intermediate-1 is deactivated (preferably) or unknown, windows will use your trust chain instead.
Since you want to assert the cert and key belongs to the server, you sign it yourself, under your authority, and then tell the system to trust you.
There's still a lot of utility in a certificate without a CA hierarchy, above what SSH keys provide; part of that is the restrictions on them.
Key usage, validity dates, revocation information, domain restrictions, etc..
This is how certificates are supposed to work, using digital signatures to represent an assertion of key ownership.
Just because I am willing to trust the certificate on Server-Certificate for a specific operation, doesn't mean I'm willing to trust that Dept-Root-CA has been properly secured.
See my other answer here: Restrict a root certificate to a domain
Well.... You could capture that trust information in another way.
