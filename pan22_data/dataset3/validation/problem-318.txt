Shall I have to restart the production server compulsorily during off-peak hours ?
If I can directly apply the hot fix to production server then what are the precautionary steps that I have to take.
To do this of course you need to have a test environment and the problem you're trying to fix needs to be one you can work around on the live system while you carry out the tests.
We are currently using Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 (SP1) - 10.50.2500.0 (X64) Enterprise Edition (64-bit) on Windows NT 6.1  (Build 7601: Service Pack 1) as our production data warehouse database.
I need to apply hotfix / security patch version 10.50.2550.0 to our production data warehouse.
You can apply a hotfix directly to a production server - it's your choice.
As to whether or not that means you need to do schedule this for out of hours depends on your companies attitude to downtime on that db server.
Microsoft say themselves that the hotfixes aren't as  well tested as service packs, etc, and even if they were, there's only one way to make sure the dbs you're running are not relying on something which will have its behaviour changed by the fix.
I'd strongly suggest testing it first, myself, and taking a full backup of the system prior to applying it.
The hotfix should hopefully say whether or not it requires a restart of the SQL services or anything else.
Can anybody please tell me can I directly apply this hotfix to my production server ?
