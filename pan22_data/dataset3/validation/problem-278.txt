Without LastPass, you'd probably be using the same lame password as every other site, which would mean you'd be less secure overall without it.
Likewise, when you get your password from their server, it's in its encrypted state, and only your master password can decrypt it.
That reduces the time it takes to crack another master password (remember that they may not have the login yet) from the age of the universe squared down to several million years, assuming that the encryption key is generated only from the master password and the salt, which for LastPass I don't believe is the case, I'm fairly certain it's tougher.
In addition to their servers, your passwords are stored on your local machine in an encrypted state, and when you send your password to their server, it's encrypted with 256-bit AES (i.e.
HTTPS), then that particular password is vulnerable, but your master password will be safe.
really good) encryption before it leaves your machine.
In addition, when logged into their site, you'll be in a secure session, meaning any information passed between you and LastPass is (theoretically) safe.
To summarize, you only have to be worried if you're logging into a site that's already insecure, and still, your master password is safe.
Since LastPass doesn't store any passwords in the clear (especially your master password, which I don't think they store at all), the only vulnerability would be if someone managed to get a hold of their encryption salt and at least one master password.
You did use a different password for your master password, right?
