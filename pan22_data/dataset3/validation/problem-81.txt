Contrary to some other answers here, there is no correct order of precedence.
Multiplication and Division have higher priority, than addition and subtraction.
9 + 3 :Why =9 because a negative number x a negative number gives a positive result.
There are merely different conventions adopted by different applications.
Which means, it is best if a system assumes the first one.
This can be verified using any calculator, slide rule, or any computer mathematics program
As was said in the comments to the question, Powers have higher priority than minus signs in any sane environment.
Even multiplications of negative numbers, would output a positive result:
The first one says first do the exponentiation with operands A1 and 2, and then do the negation on that.
For your reference, the order of precedence used by excel is:
The lesson is, if you are unsure whether your environments is sane or not, include the parenthesis to be on the safe side.
It is in fact a skill you can maintain and stay on top of a large portion of the world, only by knowing basic maths.
The expression - A1^2 contains two operators, namely the unary negation operator - and the binary exponentiation operator ^.
The expression = - A1^2 + A1 is specific to Excel so must follow Excels rules.
-x^2+x where x =3 This is an example of a quadratic equation
My advice to you is to spend some time every year and keep refreshing the fundamental rules of mathematics.
And if you have two operators, then the same thing will happen.
:Multiplication takes precedence over addition so result will be written as follows:
This is due to the fact, that minuses cancel each other in pairs.
With the absence of any parenthesis, there could be two interpretations.
With a zero at the start it is instead treated as normal subtraction.
The power of every number identifies that this number will be multiplied by itself a number of times.
The second one says first do the negation on operand A1, and then use exponentiation on the result of that and 2.
