I recall some tasks not getting executed at all, or some others only running intermittently.
I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this is terrible design, but there's not much I can do about it for the moment (at least until I have time to figure out what exactly it's doing and replace it with a cron-able perl script).
This might be a safer method, if it's practical (same thing applies for running a cron job).
In the past, my only dealings with the Windows task scheduler wizard were for miscellaneous home tasks several years ago.
To prevent the account lockout problem, I would recommend either creating a special account for the task or a little trick I have found, if the task does not need network access, you can schedule it to run as System with a blank password.
The only problems I have ever seen would be; run times missed when the machine is off (it's not a job queue), tasks that fail simply because they were setup improperly, the executable or script itself failing every time task manager calls it and, the biggest problem of all has been, the user account set for the particular task getting locked out for any number of reasons.
I ask because the software my company is about to start using requires a single (windows) workstation to run a small automation program each night to increment several fields in the database.
If you're doing database level tasks, most RDBMS's will allow you to schedule a query/task to run at the DBMS level to remove reliance on third party tasks.
Assuming the task is configured correctly, can I trust the Windows XP task scheduler to ALWAYS run this job or is it unreliable?
I've never had issues with the task scheduler, however if the workstation is turned off, the application won't run (obviously).
It's hard to say anything "ALWAYS" about a computer, but I've had generally good luck w/ the XP Task Scheduler (and the Windows Server equivalents).
If so, you will want to look into using SQL Server Agent.
XP, being one of the NT-dervied OS's, has generally been pretty stable for me.
We have several "critical" systems where our vendors have chosen to depend on Windows Task Manager.
Finally, we monitor either automatically or manually all critical tasks.
