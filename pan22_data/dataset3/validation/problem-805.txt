Here is a short batch script to facilitate copying multiple files:
This doesn't apply here because the Windows command shell passes wildcards directly through to programs and it's up to them to do expansion.
Anyone coming from a *nix background would find it particularly confusing that while works while explicit lists don't, because in Unix-like shells they're indistinguishable to a program â€“ the shell expands any wildcards, so the program ends up with an explicit file list either way.
(Also COPY is a built in command in the shell rather than an external program like cp on Linux, so in principle it could potentially disobey the usual rules about command line arguments, but that actually doesn't apply here.)
With the advent of Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, you can now use the native Linux syntax:
Windows includes robocopy built in, which copies multiple files from a single command:
It's worth noting that if you have a wildcard expression rather than an explicit list of files then COPY does copy all the files to the target directory:
You can use this in either a batch file or directly from the command line.
