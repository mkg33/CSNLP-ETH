How many sessions does your company do each month?
Over the last couple of years this server has accumulated 10+ TB of data, and we are increasing the amount of photoshoots exponentially.
He purchased eight 3TB Seagate Barracuda from NewEgg a few weeks ago for $89 each.
I think the best solution for this is what we do with our payroll data, which should take a minimal effort for you to implement.
We have a NAS server at the company I work for that is being used for storing photography sessions.
You could rsync mirror from the production NAS to this new NAS over GigaBit.
Just for example, storing those 20TB using an online service like Amazon Glacier would cost a bit more than $200/month.
I estimate that by the end of next year we will have 20+ TB stored on this NAS.
Since you are only transferring the differences, the transfer will take a shorter time.
This allows us to have easy, online access to that unchanging data (so we don't have to call in a tape anytime an accountant wants to look at something), while maintaining indefinite off-site archives of data we may need to keep forever, and without crushing our backup system.
Then you can use the backup NAS to perform full or incrementals.
Since you're mostly storing old sessions that won't be used frequently, etc, and probably don't need to recover that information that frequently, I would suggest you to use the services from some company to take care of that task for you.
I'm just in doubt about the size of each shooting session, is it really 100gb / session?
Cost to you would be under $2000 out the door for a backup NAS.
If you just store those things "to be sure they are stored", perhaps using a third-part could make your life easier (and even cheaper than buying another NAS, tapes, etc)
Sounds like the same type of setup could work for you, though you might want to adjust the amount of data you keep online, depending on your needs to access this data in a timely fashion - 20TB of enterprise-grade storage is a lot more expensive than archiving it to two or three sets of LTO5 tapes that you store in off-site vaults.
If you need to retrieve those archives frequently, or even recover then in full, it would hit some time / cost constraint.
Since the size of this server has grown, full backups of this server are not completing overnight.
Does anyone have any suggestion on how to backup this amount of data?
We are currently backing this server up to tape using LTO-5 tapes with Symantec BackupExec.
