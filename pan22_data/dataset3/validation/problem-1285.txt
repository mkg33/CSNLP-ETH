DHCP & DNS was provided by a windows server 2003 box.
Comparing the traffic logged should provide a lot of insight into what's going on.
I'll start off warning you that I have no experience with these devices at all.
Anyway I'd give a local static ip a shot and see what happens.
Does anyone have any experience resolving a similar situation?
For what it's worth I believe they were Verifone Omni terminals and they were connecting to a Juniper Netscreen Router.
Once I setup the ip manually I never had another problem with it.
Presumably that device, being embedded, will act in a very similar manner each time it's powered-on and the differences between the two configurations ought to be at least somewhat apparent.
I am about to deploy another nameserver in this workgroup environment of ~16 total clients (mostly XP & Windows 7) in the hopes that I just got something wrong there.
The next terminal we got had the same problem until I gave it a static ip address so it seemed to be with all of the units and not just with one of them.
Some other thoughts I had were that I was too hasty in configuring a local instance of BIND or that I have misconfigured pfsense (DHCP Server possibly).
This should be a non-issue in 7-10 days when we go to a different processing system, but until then the retail area is without a card reader and that makes small business owners very sad.
The key to fixing it for me (and maybe for you) was to give it a local static ip.
I am pretty new to pfsense and credit card terminals.
I am pretty desperate for fresh insight into this issue.
I had a similar experience with a CC terminal (not the same model) that would not work even tho DHCP seemed to be handing it a valid address.
I'd start by sniffing the traffic between the device and the LAN on a "working" setup (the consumer router you talked about) and then again in the non-working setup.
