I just wanted to point out that if you can't install another card, you can hook up your third monitor to another computer and use software to "join" the computers.
Jeff Atwood recently detailed this in his coding horror blog and listed gfx cards with 3 outputs.
These can be SLI linked in a one/two-monitor configuration or can just be used separately (don't count on switching between those modes often, though - when I've done so, driver crashes have frequently resulted).
My system is running with two PCI Express cards from ATI.
Just another option if you want to relay video over USB.
You have two options: a Matrox Parhelia (though this can only do three screens if you're using analog rather than DVI), or two graphics cards.
They weren't set up for a world of multiple graphics cards and they become very confused by it.
If you're not using the 3rd screen to play video games, you can give one of DisplayLink's USB to video adaptors a try.
I use Multiplicity from Stardock at work and it works great.
You can probably use the port on the mainboard as an alternative.
One thing that (almost certainly) won't work: digging out that ancient PCI VGA card that you have lying in a box somewhere.
