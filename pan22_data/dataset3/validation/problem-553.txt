It doesn't sound like you're doing any network shortcuts or profile roaming, so I doubt this is your problem, but these things are simple enough to check.
I've decided to live with the problem - as I'd rather have some antivirus protection and AVG is otherwise quite reasonable for the price.
Turning off "Show shadows under menus" solved the slow start menu problem for me:
I believe that this is part of the behavior that Raymond Chen is describing here.
This is AVG's resident shield - If you put task manager on your screen and order it by "CPU Load" you'll noticed that when you get the problem - AVG will go up in CPU use.
This is going from memory; it's been a while since I've dealt with this behavior.)
Disable AVG's resident scanner and it will go away.
(For example, a shortcut pointing to c:\MyComputerSpecificApp.exe will be updated to point to \MySpecificComputer\c$\MyComputerSpecificApp.exe.
One culprit that I've seen is shortcuts that point to network drives; these can cause Explorer to pause or lock up for a few seconds while it tries to resolve those network drives so that it can load icons for the shortcuts.
On a related note, if you've copied shortcuts from another computer (such as via a roaming profile), and the shortcuts' destinations don't exist on your computer, then Windows may automatically try to access the original computer over the network to update the shortcuts to point to that original computer's hard drive.
