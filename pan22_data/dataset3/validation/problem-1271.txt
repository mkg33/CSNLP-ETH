I don't need anything shiny and new - I've got a bunch of old boxes, at least one complete replacement for every model in use, and that's fine for me (and easy on the wallet).
Does anyone have recommendations for used, older "servers" (really anything in a rack-mount form factor, I'm not too worried about things like iLO/iLOM for the test nodes) that support VT-x/AMD-V?
Have you looked at ex-lease equipment, rather than ebay auctions?
I have first-generation Proliants still in use (I got them as corporate surplus in 05, they've been running since then, and probably were running since 01 or 02 prior to being sold).
Virtualization is one of the areas where I could really use some experience.
As for what to look out for, the Dell 1850/1950 range should meet your requirments (just double check VT compatibility on the processor before you buy) and are great pieces of kit.
My plan is to setup a SAN box (simple iSCSI target, relatively inexpensive gigE switch), get a pair (for starters) of new servers, and start building some new stuff with Xen, specifically planning on playing with live migration and full virtualization.
Since most of my hardware is getting a bit old (I'm running on stuff that was surplused years ago...) I decided that it's about time I start renewing some things, and also play around with virtualization a bit more.
I'm looking in the sub-$300 range (or less, if possible), used, probably Ebay.
Eventually, I scored an amazing deal on a Dell Poweredge T110 for under $350, and moved off of the commodity hardware to server class--And I have never looked back!
I'm biased to HP, but it looks like they didn't make Proliants with VT-x/Vanderpool processors until G6 (for the DL360) or so, which is way out of my price range.
Edit:And, to catch this before the comments start coming - these are personal systems.
That's the sort of "sandbox" I use at home and at work for testing stuff.
I also run quite a few services (web, mail, dns, etc.)
Grab a cheap somewhat recent Dell PC, put 4 or 8GB of RAM in it, and you can run 25 VMs on that box if all you're doing is personal testing.
You will often see servers, storage, network and backup devices that are ~2/3 years old and include a 3 month warranty from manufacture.
In Australia alot of manufactures (Dell, HP, IBM) sell off their ex-lease equipment via sites like www.graysonline.com.au (not very helpful for you).
I can't help with old/cheap servers but really, you don't need server-class hardware to do this stuff.
Here are my first, second, and third blog posts on running XenServer on commodity hardware.
