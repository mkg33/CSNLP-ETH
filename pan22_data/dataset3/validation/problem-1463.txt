Failing that, you could try using "kill -STOP" and "kill -CONT", which should stop and continue the process respectively.
I don't know a way to suspend an application to disk, like hibernation (although it is probably possible), but if you have a swap file sending your application a SIGSTOP signal will probably do just what you need.
Maybe you set up your perfect development environment with VirtualBox.
Is it not possible to set up a script to configure your tools for you when you start them up, instead of having to spend 10 minutes doing so every time?
This way you can freeze your current state reliably.
But some kind of virtualization seems the better approach for you.
The only other half-way-solution would be something like the preload-package/daemon.
Take a look at http://cryopid.berlios.de/ It can save running programs to disk, and restore them later.
You can use DMTCP to snapshot/restore a bundle of X server (for example, Xvfb) and your application.
You're in the same network environment and can access shared folders on the same machines.
But it's not right tool for "save up resources/speed up loading" job.
