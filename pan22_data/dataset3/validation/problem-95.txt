Combined with the Lotus Notes client it is just about impossible to break.
Not to mention an army of administrators and developers to program and maintain the systems.
Therefore you would have a large constituency to defend the new bureaucracy.
I have been asked to provide an assessment of why it may be prudent to migrate to a different web application platform.
Well, one of the reasons not to move to something else is because the existing web developers like it.
In other words, an application or database in production in 1989 will still work with today's technology so you aren't always having to rewrite and convert so my guess is the ROI over a long time is extremely high.
Biggest negatives are that the programming of the system is so easy bad developers can get away with putting systems into production that should have never been put in production.
A reason to move would be because the company wants to be able to use other developers.
So when you look at it in that light, maybe there is much more "wrong" with all the technologies it takes to replace it than the three biggest negatives I know of with Lotus Notes/ Domino.
One reason to keep Domino is the security is significantly better than any technologies I have ever known  or heard of.
I have a client who is using Lotus Domino for their web application/server platform.
To completely replace Lotus Notes/Domino with say Microsoft products would take Windows Servers, MS Sharepoint, IIS, SQL Server, Exchange, Outlook and Internet Explorer and all of this would need to be redundant since Lotus Notes / Domino is already fault tolerant.
The client has two "web developers" who are more comfortable with Lotus Domino than more mainstream tools and technologies and are not enthusiastic about making a switch.
In addition to the fact that Apache has over 70% of web server market, IIS over 21%, and Lotus almost 0%, what other reasons would you give for moving away from this platform?
I would be particularly interested in understanding deficiencies related to the platform as I have very little knowledge of Domino but am very familiar with other platforms.
Second biggest negative is that since it is a workflow enabled document based paradigm most programmers don't understand it.
Most of the technology being dreamed up now to address web growing pains have been in Lotus Notes since 1993.
FYI:  Lotus Notes / Domino data storage and programs have been forward compatible since 1989.
Third biggest negative is since it has such broad functionality it takes better quality of administrator and developer to do a good job with it.
