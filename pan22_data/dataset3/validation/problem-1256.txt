You can do this by trying the drive in another computer, and another SATA device in the same computer.
the only consistent way I've found of making it boot up is to run it from the diagnostic menu, after a nearly successful diagnostic (cutting it part way through the extended part) i exit and reboot and it will reboot correctly some of the time.
After reading this thread I believe the problem might have been caused by my bad habit of rarely turning my computer off....
If that doesn't do it, you want to isolate whether it is the computer or the hard drive.
We found in our systems that's running 24 hours 7 days a week is that the CPU itself is causing the issue.
I often leave it on for a week at a time before it update reboots.
It will attempt to boot and then tell me that the boot device is missing.
the noises usually continue even through the attempted reboot after a failure.
So My laptop (inspiron 15 with an i3 core and recently updated windows 10) is having a very similar issue.
If not - it could be like what the other poster said - faulty SATA controller (very rare).
If it is, then you might need to get a better PSU or cut down on your computer's power overall power draw somehow.
I also often leave it rendering a 3d scene over multiple nights.
I see this a lot at work and faulty SATA cable or controller never been the issue.
CPU is not bad or getting old but sometimes things don't work properly that you need to remove and clean the CPU then apply new Thermal paste.
I'm unsure of whether it is a mechanical issue (wiring) or a technical issue, but i hope this helps somebody get one last boot up to get files off the hard drive.
It's most probably the power - for some reason the drive is at times not powering up fast enough before the BIOS detection is over.
I'd first try another SATA port on the motherboard/controller, as well as a different cable.
It (being the hard drive) sometimes makes really loud vibrating/ whirling sounds on an attempted and overall failed boot.
