What I forgot to mention however, was that during the 2nd installation (and subsequent boots) I had an external USB HDD connected.
- the text "Windows starting"  --  about a second before the dots appear
As I wanted my Windows to be in English, the web shop where I bought the DVD recomended me to download an ISO file with the same Windows version (but in English), burn it on a DVD and install it.
Perhaps the cause is not what you suspect but since the system is as responsive as before once the OS is loaded, it is indeed bizarre.
The 15 second splash screen tells me it is a hardware issue, then when the bios hands off hardware to windows, windows has the same problem with the hardware.

As I mentioned, I never opened the case and everything was connected to the same port.
- motherboard splash screen  --  shows for a second or two
I installed Windows 7 Prof 64 bits OEM (Spanish) on my new machine.
The second time I let the Windows installation program format the drive first to get rid of the old installation.
When you re-installed the English version, you should have delete d both partitions, even the reserved one, but I don;t see how leaving it would affect the system so much.
I disconnected it and startup is super fast again.

It is however the only thing you said that gave me pause.
And that I should be able to use my registration code.
Any drive that it could not connect to also caused an issue.
Thankfully I don't need to reinstall Windows again.

Has Windows not recognized my SSD as an SSD but as a normal HDD.
AFAIK, the OS cannot affect the CPU splash screen time.
I suspect that Windows has not done the neccesary automatic configuration settings that it should do for SSD's (but that's just a hunch).
Ones it's up and running it seems to be as responsive as before, although it's possible that I'm not noticing the difference.
- four collored dots form the Windows logo  --  now it moves on to the login screen about equally fast as before.
I guess there will be a way to deal with this in the BIOS settings, but anyway this is a problem of a different order.
If the system is new, you might just want to re-install and get rid of every partition on the system disk.
I noticed that there were two partitions on my SSD: partition 1, 100 Mb, "reserved for the system" and partition 2, 111.7 Gb.
I did have a similar issue a few weeks ago and I found that the issue was that my Wireless network adapter had to make it's connection to my network before it would finish starting.
How do I get my SSD back into its virgin state, as if it came right from the box, so I can go for a 3rd attempt to install windows.
- four collored dots form the Windows logo  --  a few seconds after the logo is fully formed it moves on to the login screen.
I only formated the big partition, and I left the system partition untouched.
- the text "Windows starting"  --  shows for 40 seconds before the dots appear
I've done this and everything works (I have not activated my Windows yet but I expect no problem there).
I did the first install on the virgin SSD drive straight from the box.
Between the two installs, I didn't open the computer so everything is connected to the same port.
And when I connect it (even without switching it on), startup is slow again.
Also, during the OS install, if you redo it, unplug the HDD, just in case it sees it as drive 0 and tries to do stuff to it.
