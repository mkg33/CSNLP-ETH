IPSec on IPv4 does have difficulties with NAT in its native form, however there are many standard additions to the protocol that allow it to traverse NAT.
So yes, superuser.com is not running an IPSec VPN endpoint and so you cannot connect an IPSec VPN client to it.
i want my http traffic to superuser.com (or my UDP torrent traffic) to be encrypted.
The best you can do if IPSec is your preferred method is to identify a VPN service provider that is "near" to the site you want to communicate securely with.
IPSec is built on top of IPv4, and built into IPv6.
However this doesn't mean that if every site you were talking to was over IPv6 you would be able to just "turn on" IPSec.
You can read endless amounts of technical details about IPsec:
Near in terms of a short amount of hops from the VPN gateway you connect to and the site you want to access.
This means that the unencrypted traffic will traverse a shorter distance on the internet.
Until that happens you have no way to encrypt your data end to end in an IPSec VPN when communicating with superuser.com or any other website.
The most common, and almost universally implemented, is NAT-D, using UDP/4500 as its transport rather than ESP directly.
In this example it wouldn't work because superuser.com isn't running a vpn server listening on port 1723.
In order to encrypt traffic between two points, both endpoints must participate in the encryption.
For over a decade Windows has supported IPsec, but i don't think all my internet traffic (i.e.
But IPsec doesn't require a "server"; IPsec is built into IP, and is completely transparent.
You have to find a VPN Client, and use it to connect to a VPN Server:
The more i read about "Internet Protocol security" (IPsec), the more it seems that you cannot use it over the "Internet" - only over local area networks.
but still not find any information on how to use it.
Websites that provide encrypted sessions generally do so with SSL.
If it were running IPv6, you would still need to perform a key exchange to verify the authenticity of the two parties and to establish the encryption key and methods.
