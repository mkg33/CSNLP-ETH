When I open records on RODC inside _tcp.Default-First-Site-Name._sites.dc._msdcs.domainname I see this list:
So it should not matter that the client how to choose.
Notice the _ldap recors order      - s-dc00, s-dc01, s-rodc
If all records have the same priority and weight - how client choses which DC to use?
So my question is - Why records is in different order on each DNS server, what is the cause and does it matter in a process of client chosing DC while quering DNS records?
And according to my understanding, the order of DNS records does not seem to have any effect.
Also notice that each record has the same priority and weight.
Finally, the client should firstly choose the DNS in the TCP/IP setting, we can see by ipconfig /all in cmd.exe.
Notice the _ldap recors order      - s-dc00, s-dc01, s-rodc
Notice the _kerberos records order - s-rodc, s-dc00, s-dc01
I'm trying to learn DNS srv records behaviour inside Windows Server DNS currently and struggling to understand a couple of things:
I am not sure why the different DNS has different order of the records, I think it could be related to when the DNS replicate the DNS records from other DNS.
Then the DNS will random select one of records to rely to the clients.
When I open records on RWDC2 inside _tcp.Default-First-Site-Name._sites.dc._msdcs.domainname I see this list:
When I open records on RWDC1 inside _tcp.Default-First-Site-Name._sites.dc._msdcs.domainname I see this list:
Notice the _kerberos records order - s-dc00, s-dc01, s-rodc
Notice the _ldap recors order      - s-rodc, s-dc00, s-dc01
Notice the _kerberos records order - s-dc01, s-rodc, s-dc00
