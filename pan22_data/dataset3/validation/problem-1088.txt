It's built into Leopard - so you don't require a login hook to do this anymore.
Are you redirecting the cache folders (and others)?
There's more setup, but is a decent way of removing users who consume quite a bit of AppleFileServer's time.
ApplePasswordServer.Server.log (people are authenticating properly).
I'm not certain that the two are directly related, but I do thank everyone who submitted an answer.
Tried a simple power-cycle of the switch, clients, and server to no avail.
I'd recommend looking into making a portable home directory to see if that alleviates issues.
Lastly, are most of your users using Mail.app or have a large amount of Mail?
They were all really detailed yet clearly written.
Symptom: Clients slow to logon to network home folders, slow behavior throughout the workday.
Are there any specific users that seem to be "hogging the bandwidth" in terms of the amount of files transferred?
A mix between moving to Leopard on the clients and telling Mail.app not to cache anything (mail server is local) fixed this.
Checked so far: physical networking, dns resolution for server (forwards and backwards).
Xserve with 10.4.11 connected to Xserve RAID via FC.
A brief packet analysis showed no extraneous network traffic.
I made some more space available on the RAID, and the issue cleared up.
I had issues with a couple users (only one had to do have it happening for the symptom to arise) that would bring the server to a near halt for everyone because Spotlight would be opening and closing very small files as fast as it could.
Clients (mac mini - intel core solo 1.5GHz running 10.4.11)
