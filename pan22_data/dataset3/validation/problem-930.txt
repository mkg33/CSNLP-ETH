In your website's config file, you will have to use AllowOverride All.
If you want to ask for a login password to access to the folder from web uou need to create an .htaccess in the folder you want to protect, and a password file for the user that will be able to log in, but have to change from your apache config to Allow from All and something at your .htacces like this
This will override earlier configuration directives with whatever you have mentioned in .htaccess file.
and use a site like this to create your encrypted password, same format that your apache uses
I do not want anyone to be able to simply access these pictures directly from the web, so I made a .htaccess file in that sub_folder and just put the following line in it:
Instead, find (or create) the  block that refers to the directory where you're actually planning to place a .htaccess file.
I have a Joomla site running on it, but I have also added some custom content.
At your apache configuration deny the entry for the directory, something like this:

In the main web directly I have added a folder /images/sub_folder and in this sub_folder I have put a bunch of pictures.
Note: For security reasons, do not set AllowOverride to anything other than None in your  block.
I am running Apache 2.2.20 on a Ubuntu 11.04 web server.
There doesn't seem to be any effect, I can still access the images directly from a web browser.

And thats it, now that when you need to enter to the folder a promp will show and ask you for the user and password.
