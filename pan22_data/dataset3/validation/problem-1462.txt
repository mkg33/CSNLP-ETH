There also used to be a NetBSD that would run on Mac hardware.
The userspace and UI stuff is custom to MacOS X of course, but all the rest is still there.
I think playing with FreeBSD is a waste of your time, it pretty much is FreeBSD.
OS X is a good attempt, but there's still a lot of annoying rough edges, etc.
Linux is fun but you'll never use 100% of your video capacity.
Linux is fun, but not sure what you gain by going to it.
I've had good success with YellowDogLinux on older Macs.
Not sure what the current state of hardware support is though.
MacOSX is a modified version of the BSD's under the hood, a mix of FreeBSD, NetBSD, and some microkernel stuff to spice it up a bit.
It's hard enough to get to run on standard consumer level PCs.
Usually graphics acceleration (as others have noted).

If it's some Linux apps, there are various ways to get it.
I put a lot of time into it myself before deciding it really didn't fit my workstyle.
Not sure what all issues arise because of the switch to PC hardware but with EFI BIOS.
