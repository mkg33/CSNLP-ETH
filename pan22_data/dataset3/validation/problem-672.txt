The upper right adds a resistor and protects you in case the GPIO pin is erroneously configured as output.
It doesn't offer any protection and creates stress current via the capacitor.
There is no "best" design, there are designs which are optimal in some cases (and perhaps bad in others) and designs which are suboptimal in all cases.
This circuit can be used when connecting GPIO pins to mechanical contacts, to avoid multiple HIGH-LOW-HIGH transitions when the contact is closed:
The upper left on your picture is the simplest one, so it's optimal as long as you can guarantee the signal stays between 0 and 3.3V in all cases, and your GPIO pin is configured as input.
The lower right provides overcurrent protection and guarantees you'll read it as LOW when nothing is connected to the input.
Useless unless you're designing something that can be hot-plugged.
But, you'll need an extra component compared to previous one.
The resistor will limit the current, preventing overheat damage.
