The product you're using comes with built-in firewalling: that's something that should be taken into account when running it on server systems, and configured accordingly (or turned off at all).
I know people will tell me best practices and all are to run AV.
While that would be nice it often leads to performance problems.
Even then only infections were files left on the drive and not actual OS infections.
I have always had AV software with on-access scanning enabled on all Windows servers and have been grateful for it more than once.
One thing to be aware of is that there's probably no AV product that has decent default settings.
Most these days go for scanning both read and write.
Bad enough at ay time but very bad when your DC has problems because a file it needs to access has been locked while the AV scanner is checking it.
Select what you need for protection and then choose each component separately for best protection and performance.
Some years ago, anti-virus software was (in)famous for randomly deleting Exchange databases if by chance it came across a viral signature inside some e-mail message stored in the physical data file; every anti-virus vendor warned about this in the product manual, but some people still failed to grasp it and got their stores nuked.
There's no software you can "just install and run" without thinking twice about what you're doing.
I have spent hours trying to figure out what changed only to find an AV update caused the issue.
"All in one" type packages are rarely as effective as well chosen individual components (as in, I've never seen a decent example yet).
The malware we see most that even effects shares is cryptolocker and that does not actually infect servers.
Most scanners also scan a very large number of file types that can't even be infected because they cannot contain active code.
On the other side of the coin in 20 years with dozens of clients I have never seen a domain controller that did not have shared drives infected.
While I know there are a few who will disagree I have to tell you that Symantec is about as bad a choice as you could make.
Up until just a year ago or so we never saw a cryptolocker and now we variants pretty often (all which fail to be stopped by several different brands of AV properly installed on the workstation by the way.)
It should run on servers too, for two reasons: 1) they're the most critical computers in your environment, much more than client systems, and 2) they're no less at risk only because nobody actively uses (or at least should not being actively using) them for surfing the web: there's plenty of malware which can automatically spread across your network if it can get hold even of a single host.
That said, your problem is more related to properly configuring your anti-virus software.
Anti-virus software should definitely be running on all machines in a properly-managed network, even if other threat prevention measures are in place.
You need software that is both effective and well behaved.
We run Vexira's server product on our servers, but it may be more a function of discounted pricing than effectiveness.
We've had several workstations using their desktop product that will refuse to update unless we uninstall and reinstall with the latest version.
Maybe some day there will be another worm type virus that infects servers but until that time I am happy to not have to deal with AV issues on my SQL, print, and DC servers.
I know someone will point out that someday this will bite me for not having AV on every server.
If the workstation is properly secured then the server will not get encrypted.
What I do see is the AV software causing problems.
