But then the problem with backing up the secondary AD is that there may be changes on primary which have not been replicated to secondary.
At my place of work, we have a small domain just for our development team (6 members).
The immediate answer would be no, but I feel there is more to this than I can see.
The primary AD is syncd to secondary so I assume that shouldn't need to be backed up.
The AD is syncd with a secondary AD on an ESX Virtual Machine.
In production environments, AD backups are usually just used to protect against accidental changes or catastrophic schema updates.
Despite this level of fault tolerance, does one still need to backup the secondary AD?
There's no need to spend a lot of money on a backup solution.
We need this because some products we use in our job require a complete environment which requires AD, ESX/HyperV, etc (no two ways about that).
Bottom line: Redundancy is not the same thing as a backup.
This is a small AD environment, which would probably influence the level of fault tolerance.
If you wanted to be cautious, then I would just schedule weekly system state backups with Windows Backup on one of your DCs and store the BKF file on a different server.
Would backups of AD still need to be executed even with replication?
Just as RAID does not obviate the need for disk backups, replication does not obviate the need for database backups (or Active Directory backups).
For a small development environment like that, backing up AD would not be required.
It's not for production, but for development (though development directly effects when/how projects reach production).
