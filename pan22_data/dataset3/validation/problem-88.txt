Each VirtualHost may have a unique "SSLCertificateFile" directive.

Apache ignores the file names, you have to define the IP addresses in the Virtual Host definitions.
I am hosting several domains on my VPS which only has 1 IP address (is this called name based virtual hosting?
So I hope someone here can explain what's happening and if I'm doing things correctly.
I'm following this guide to install SSL certificates:
Presumably you would want to toss either a DocumentRoot, mod_proxy, or mod_rewrite rule into there.
I'm setting up my own LAMP server on a VPS for the first time.
I have one file pupeno.com.conf which includes the definition for non-ssl and ssl pupeno.com virtual hosts.
In creating a /etc/apache2/sites-available/bikestore-ssl and /etc/apache2/sites-available/toystore-ssl,  will Apache know that https://bikestore.com should reference IP address 1.1.1.1 with ssl certificate bikestore.crt and that http://toystore.com should reference IP address 2.2.2.2 with ssl certificate toystore.crt?
Essentially, Apache chooses which VirtualHost to serve according to the IP address, ServerName, and ServerAlias entries.
I consider http://pupeno.com and https://pupeno.com the same thing thus it's on pupeno.com.conf.
For SSL sans-TLS, it is sufficient to simply concern yourself with the IP address, since you're assigning each VirtualHost a unique IP.
Think about what you want to enable and disable in one go with a2ensite and a2dissite.
Two of the sites on my VPS, bikestore.com and toystore.com, will eventually become ecommerce websites that accept credit card information.
I'm in the process of enabling an https version for both sites, so I purchased 1 new IP address for each.
When inspecting the contents of bikestore-ssl and toystore-ssl, it's not clear to me how apache will know which *-ssl file to assign to which https:// domain.
