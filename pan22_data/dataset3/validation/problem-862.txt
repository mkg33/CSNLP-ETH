In any case you will need contact dell service I think.
If its not under warranty....Pull the HD out and slave it on another machine.
My guess is that the PSU's are only just delivering enough power to the system when new ... over time their output is drooping a bit and its enough to cause the motherboard to look like its failing during periods of higher demand, like installation when the board, HDD and CDROM are all running.
I've had three Vostro 220S machines go down in the last little bit - all out of warranty, so 2-3 year old and a bit more.

Dell: the following series: XPS 8300, Vostro 460, Alienware M17x R.3, Alienware Aurora R.3, and XPS 17 (3D version), may have defective SATA ports that degrade with time.
The HDD could be damage, or even motherboard... you should try insert other disk to your desktop and then check bios if there could not find any sata then its motherboard problem... and you can check if your disk work on another PC...
Although the machines all power up, and can see the HDD's in the BIOS during Win7 install, they don't write or boot correctly.
If.BIOS recognizes and there are no partitions try a high level data recovery tool like GetBackNTFS or RStudio.
All looked like HDD failures however, I thought I'd post here because I've been able to recover all three with new PSU's
On Dell Vostro 460, the blue and white (6GB SATA) should work, while two black (3GB SATA) may fail.

If it recognizes and the partitions load there is hope.
On one machine the telltale sign was wavy lines coming through the VGA to the monitor, very odd problem not often seen on LCD monitors.
