Whilst I agree that you shouldn't do it because you are trying to solve an issue such as resource leaks, we randomly destroy machines during office hours.
The idea being that we ensure our automatic disaster recovery plan works and if it doesn't it fails during the day when we have most of our staff in.
Should I be looking into the functionality in the app pool to restart itself instead?
In the past 2 weeks, our nightly IISReset has not come back up successfully and caused us an outage.
If you don't do one regularly and all of a sudden you have to do a system restart for what ever reason it can be a very stressful and nervous time as who knows what's going to happen.
We always have a few servers that are not affected by this to ensure that we keep a minimal service however we are safe in the knowledge that if we do have to do a reboot on a server we feel safe to do so.
We have a Windows Task that runs every night that executes an IISReset, and I'm wondering if this is even necessary anymore?
I would like to offer an alternative view on this.
