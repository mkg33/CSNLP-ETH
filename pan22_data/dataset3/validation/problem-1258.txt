Also, so that they accidentally don't leave one that needs a sticker without.
My best guess, and it's only a guess, is that they just stick them onto all the cases anyway, and then decide whether to put a  LED backlight or a fluorescent one, or just stick them on because of inertia.
in this picture below you will see the most dangerous part of the laptop,  the filament light tube, this contains a high pressured vacuum of mercury.
Most laptops contain mercury in their display screens, it isn't a guess, it's fact,  the asus have stickers placed inside to deter any tampering by the user where you shouldn't be venturing, nobody is servicable to these areas, and if you are a recycling mob you shouldn't be manually opening these display screens, a laptop however 26''inch will not harm you unless you wipe your face in the stuff, you will get symptoms of an uneasy itch with the oily substance on your skin,
"you should not partake in this trend with an old LCD screen" the glass is under pressure and can shatter into very fine glass airborne particals if broken" and lodge in your throat and eyes.

I belive LCD (liquid-crystal display) could not generate light on their own, so a LED was placed behind it,  then the LCD just filtered the light into different paterns, see picture here: http://byteshopstyle.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/lcd-cross-section.jpg?w=510
A larger LCD Screen 32" inch Tv Display can be a worry, especially with the amount of mercury, and Oily Liquid Crystals, be aware this is not water, best to wear gloves,breather mask, and  tape up the cracked screen with gap tape, cover the Set in a large waste bin bag, and tape it up, and dispose of it quickly at your Authorized E-waste recycler...there is a fee for accepting this kind of e-waste.
There is much more worrying parts of the laptop, such as the circuit boards  which contain in some cases Barilyum,Lead,and Arsenic, magnesium and polymer epoxy film contact that is heat shrunk over the circuits soldering points , some are greem, blue, and red....avoid handling these boards with your bare hands, and always wash when handling....Red (Cheap Asian Made) Circuit boards are banned in New Zealand and Australia, as they do not meet the Countries safety standards.
The LED backlight did not contain mercury, but the LCD did.
the grimy oily filing between laptop screen in between the clear plastic and the white backdrop is a conductant of the Liquid Crystal iteself, it won't harm you but can cause skin irritation, do not get this under your finger nails, and when wiping it use an expendable towelette,  some people make mirrors out of old laptops WARNING !!!
