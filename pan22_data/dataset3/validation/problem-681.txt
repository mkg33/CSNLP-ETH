Also, look at reviews online for the model you're considering, they often have benchmarks that will help you gauge the general performance compared to other models.
If you're content doing your work on a three year-old laptop, a new netbook would likely be fast enough for your needs.
My MSI Wind (1.6GHz Atom) runs Excel 2007 just fine, and even better if plugged into a normal size monitor.
The primary issue will be screen size, followed closely by keyboard size and layout.
Simple documents and spreadsheets, or enormous spreadsheets?
I've got one picked out but the boss has heard that netbooks don't run office type software well at all.
Your boss might be dismissing it because of something he's heard from someone dissatisfied.
Most people do not have 200+ page documents, excel spreadsheets with 100's of line of code for calculations, etc.
PPT did lag for me while using a lot of sound but that was it.
I have a laptop with 1.6 GHz processor and have no problems for over 3 years.
It will be a lot easier to convince him if you can tell him you've played around with the one you'd like.
For what most people do with office, they work great.
He's heard from other people that "kids love em, adults hate em."
Both my mom and I have an Asus netbook, 1.66 dual core, she has 1 gig of ram, i have 2, and it runs office 07 very nicely, nice startup time, and no major issues.
Also, what type of office work would you do on it?
If possible, go to a store that has the model you'd like on demo and open up MS Office and play around, see how quickly it responds, how comfortable you are with the screen size/keyboard size, etc...
I'm looking at getting a netbook for the company I work for.
Have any of you ever noticed that netbooks aren't up to speed.
Really large sheets, or large PowerPoint presentations might suffer from the less optimized audio and video handling on these small beasts, but for straight writing tasks at a customer site or other non-office location, they are pretty close to ideal.
By their nature, netbooks are compact which limits the physical sizes of the keyboard and display.
It all depends on the type of work, but they work for most people because most people do not use half of office suite features.
