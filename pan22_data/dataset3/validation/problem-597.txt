This doesn't make much sense to me -- I thought you would just need to know the mail server addresses from ISP1.
Her email is from an ISP (say ISP1) whose dial up service she no longer uses (she retains the account for email and web space only).
The outgoing server for ISP2 will be named something like smtp.isp2domainname.com or mail.isp2dmainname.com where isp2domainname.com is the domain name that ISP2 use (comcast.net, o2.com, tiscali.co.uk, whatever).
ISP1 are advising her on how to reconfigure Outlook Express and they say she needs to know the "outgoing server name" from ISP2.
ISPs jealously guard their outgoing email servers and only ever allow outgoing email to be sent from their own customers.
This is to help to reduce the amount of spam on the internet and is to be applauded.
Outgoing mail requires a connection to a SMTP server on port 25, and some ISPs (notably DSL and cable providers) block port 25 to anywhere but their SMTP servers.
She uses another ISP (ISP2) to connect to the internet.
As a result your mother will not be able to send email out through ISP1 but will have to use ISP2 to send email.
My mother is trying to reconfigure her email client (Outlook Express) to send and receive emails because it has stopped working.
ISP2's technical support do not know what this term means :(.
Is there anything difficult about setting up email in this way where you are using a different ISP to connect to the internet from the one who runs the email service?
This means that email must be sent out via ISP2 even if the account in the From header is hosted by ISP1.
I don't have much confidence in ISP2's support though, if they can't connect "outgoing" with "SMTP"...
Incoming email is another matter, however, and you can use either ISP1 or ISP2 for incoming email (ISP1 for her 'old' email address, and ISP2 for her 'new' one provided by ISP2).
