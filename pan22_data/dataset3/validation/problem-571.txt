This could be caused by a failure of the motherboard which caused the bios to be damaged or destroyed.
I did remove them and insert them firmly into the slots the first time.
Either way, it sounds very much like the bios has been damaged.
I have done the obvious like re-seated all components, disconnected all peripherals and hard drives.
For me the issue was the my hard drive had been corrupted.
I still can't get past the single underscore character.
Since you already seem to have tried all the other components, this seems like it may be something you haven't tried.
When I turn it on, I immediately get a single underscore (non-blinking) character on the screen, where it freezes.
Many motherboards include a button or jumper which when set will refresh the bios to the factory state.
Removing it an reformatting it on another pc via a usb bridge fixed the issue - but not great if you have data there....
I have repaired countless PCs, and have never not seen any BIOS info before.
On a hunch, I rearranged the memory sticks into the opposite ports, and then back where they started, and now it boots fine!
This could also be caused by a virus which targets the bios.
