Copy data to a GCE PD: Spin up a VM then either transfer your data from your local machine to the VM or create the filesystem and prep the files required directly from the VM instead of your local machine.
Instead, we want to make sure the PV is created first and targets the GCE-PD explicitely.
Mount the PVC in your pod: First of all note that GCE disks don't support read/write many, so this PVC can only be used by a single pod.
This sounds like your container needs a pre-populated volume to start up.
Create a PV to consume the disk: It is important to follow the documentation for this step carefully.
If the files and filesystem the container needs only has to be read only, then you have two other options to make it easier:
Create the PVC to target the PV: As I mentioned, the default behavior will be to create a brand new disk dynamically which will be a blank new disk.
If you need to have more than a single pod, you'll need create multiple PVCs using the above steps.
If any of the fields are set incorrectly, a different PV will be created.
Instead, you'll transfer your data to a GCE PD, make sure your PV uses that pre-existing disk and then mount that to your pod.
Prep a GCE disk for PV use: Either detach the GCE disk from your VM or take a snapshot of the disk and create a new GCE PD from the snapshot.
You could use hostPath like you mentioned but this is not recommended for a couple reasons.
The default behavior of PVC in GKE is to be provisioned dynamically using a StorageClass.
