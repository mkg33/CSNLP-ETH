I don't see a specific mention of Interface CRC errors, so it's possible that they screened out faulty connector cables before adding them to the study.
BackBlaze did an analysis of their hard drives, including correlating various SMART errors with full failures of the disk.
Again, I don't see a specific mention of Interface CRC errors.
Some devices have problems that passed initial QA, leading to high failure rates in the first few months, then there are several years of normal operations with low failure rates, then a rising rate of failure as the parts wear out.
A used hard drive is somewhere in the middle, and also has suffered the rigors of transport multiple times.
Google did a white paper on hard drive failure modes and rates about a decade ago.

In general, a used hard drive will have higher chance of failure and sooner time of failure than a new hard drive, due to the bathtub curve.
