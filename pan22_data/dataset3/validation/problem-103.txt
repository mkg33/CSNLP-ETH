We've tried this in many configurations and can't get it to function how we believe it is intended.
We got it to work but only if we add the user to the policy's security filter in addition to the AD group.
Because Folder Redirection (and the Proxy Disabled) settings are User policies we can't get them to apply to the PC.
We're implementing Group Policy for the first time at our organization and have some questions about best practices and capabilities.
It would basically be above, except link all the GPs and PCs to Workstations and remove the two inner OUs.
Our understanding is that we should be able to have User settings linked to Workstations along with Computer settings.
We've already done some work and want to see if there is a better way.
Identify these 10 PCs and add them to an AD group called "Folder Redirection PCs".
Workstations OU has 100 PCs 10 of which should have Folder Redirection enabled.
Have one OU for all end-user PCs that has a default policy, then be able to have exception policies that override some of the default policies by adding PCs to a AD group elsewhere.
Any users who log on to these 10 workstations would have Folder Redirection enabled.
We tried adding all the PCs to the Workstations OU and structured the groups as described in the Our Goal section.
If Loopback Policy Processing is enabled then it should run through all the computer policies, all the user policies, then all the user policies that are assigned to those computers either in Replace or Merge mode.
Since we want any user who logs into these PCs to be folder redirected we would have to assign it to "Authenticated Users", which would then apply it to all PCs in this OU.
