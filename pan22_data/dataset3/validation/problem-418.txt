Some older software will specifically search out the domain controller holding the PDC role and authenticate against that.
If you're actually talking about an Active Directory domain, the architecture is designed so that all Domain Controllers in the same AD Site are considered to be equivalent workers.
This is usually (unless some hand tampering has been done) a round-robin of the DCs in the site.
Password and account-status (disable/lockout) events are replicated as immediately as the synch policy allows.
First and foremost, if you're still using Windows NT (the only Windows domain with a PDC/BDC environment) you're several years past end-of-life of the product.
All DCs in the same site should get notified of a password change in very short order, generally less than a minute; the same goes for account lockouts and disable/enable events.
Stations tend to glomb onto a single DC and stick with it until it hasn't needed auth long enough for the DNS entries to expire or the DC goes away for some reason.
All authentication is handled by the PDC anyway, so load spreading doesn't really exist.
When traffic is crossing an AD Site, the replication policy governs how fast such events will propagate.
When an AD system needs authentication services is queries DNS for the SRV entries of the authentication servers in its AD Site.
This is a result of how the SRV DNS entries are created.
