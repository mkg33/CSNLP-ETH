We don't have enough free hard drive space and, although it allows us to select another disk for installation, it wont install and will insist on doing it on the System drive.
At this point we have no more ideas to proceed with.
I know P2V under W2000 can be more painful than other, newer Windows releases as I have performed this, but that it can be done.
My main concern is the RAID driver, but I suppose that if I find any Linux distro that works on this hardware, there will be any procedure (like dd and ssh) to achieve this.
By the way, I will also love if someone can provide me with some alternatives (software, procedures, linux ways to do this, etc..) to achieve this.
We have tried everything we know so far with no luck.
This machine is also configured with SCSI drives attached to a RAID card.
We are trying to move it to a virtual environment (KVM under Linux) to decommission this old, costly hardware.
-Clonezilla: Fails to load as it seems to lack some drivers (I think it is the RAID card one).
-Citrix Converter: Again, no way to install it for the same reasons.
I have a legacy machine from IBM (A Netfinity 7100) running a Windows 2000 SP4 server OS.
