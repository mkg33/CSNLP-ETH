The SQL like syntax is very flexible in extracting the relevant information.
I was wondering is there something I can use to audit/log what happens?

Directory Monitor doesn't show users (which is important)
You can enable auditing on Windows Server and use Logparser to parse the logs to suit your needs.
Check the following link for a an explanation of how to enable auditing and track what is happening.
It allows you to parse *.evt logs to any format you like (fixed column length, csv, txt, graphs etc.).

It is orders of magnitude easier to read and use than the default auditing built into Windows Server.
This software lets you create custom reports showing any activity in any folder, by any user, and any type of event.
If you are open to spending a little bit of money to get reports that are easily generated and easy to read, I highly recommend File System Auditor by Scriptlogic.
Obviously something with low overhead would be awesome too.
I am currently setting up a file server with win2k8 server r2 (storage server)
Overhead should not be an issue if properly set up, ; ex add only certain users in the audit versus everyone.
I use it on my file server which is running Server 2003 but I am sure it will run great on 2008 as well.
