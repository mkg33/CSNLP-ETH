That is possible but also a potential risk when switching primary server (starting and stopping of Kannel could take some time sometimes).
Therefore I need to create a up-/down-script which (un)mount partitions, (re)starts Kannel etc to make kannel work in case of a switch.
So I'm investigating other options to achieve the same in order to make a stable and sustain decision.
One machine is the primary one, when that one dies/goes down, it switches to the secondary.
In order to don't loose tracking data when the primary server goes down, the data is being synced by DRBD.
Because once I've setup the installation described above, the system is handling a lot of SMS traffic and load, and its hard to change afterwards.
Im about to setup a failover-setup for our Kannel service using hardbeat and DRBD.
I know its possible for Kannel to save that tracking/dlr data in a database, but we're not able to use that because we're also using other kannel boxes/processes which don't have that database feature.
Kannel is using a spool directory for temporary (track/DLR) files.
But with DRBD it's not possible to mount the synced partition on both servers at the same time.
