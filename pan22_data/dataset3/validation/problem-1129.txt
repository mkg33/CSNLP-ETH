Will I have better results formatting from the command line?
I am attempting to format a USB stick in Windows 10 using the standard format command (right click on drive => select 'format').
Just delete all the partitions on your USB and then format.
To restore back your 8GB you might want to use Ease Partition master.
If this is the case, would I maybe be better formatting the stick in Linux (I have a working VM of openSUSE Leap 4.21, I just want a proper dual boot)?
I don't want to make things more difficult for myself with a command line format if it's likely to get stuck at 3.69MB capacity afterwards, or to run a command line format with the wrong arguments for the situation.
Also, I'm formatting the USB drive ready to try installing openSUSE Leap 4.21 as a dual boot; is there any specific manner in which I should format the drive before I do this?
I had a similar issue when trying to restore microSD card with Windows 10 IoT image on it.
However, the format dialogue shows 3.69MB as the maximum capacity.
It has a way better functionallity than the default one in Windows.
I remember reading something about openSUSE using a different file system and not playing well with FAT32 or NTFS?
