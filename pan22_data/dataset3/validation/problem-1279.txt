rsnapshot, mentioned by Alastair, is a very nice tool, based on rsync, that creates and keeps a configurable number of versioned mirrors (or "snapshots") of your sources on a configurable schedule.
You can tell rsnapshot how many hourly, daily, weekly, and/or monthly snapshots to keep, and it will automatically take care of deleting the oldest snapshots when your chosen maximum number of snapshots to retain is reached.
If you keep only one mirror of your live system, then, should the files on your live system become corrupted, your backup process will dutifully mirror the corrupted files, and your backup will become useless.
A good strategy is to keep a number of timestamped (or at least datestamped) backups available, so that if you find that files in your latest backups are copies of corrupted files, you can refer back to older versions that are known to be good.
As also mentioned, rsnapshot is quite efficient with disk space, since it uses hard links to represent files that don't change between snapshots.
You definitely need to have a backup strategy that includes keeping a number of older backups.
