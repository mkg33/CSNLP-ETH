Q1:Please validate if my above understanding is correct.
Suppose, Sw2 sends broadcast traffic.This broadcast traffic (after hashing) will choose any of the links while going upstream to NxOS1.
So, NxOS2 knows that SW1 might have received traffic from NxOS1 via Port 10 of NxOS1.
Q2:Here, CFSoE is playing a great role(for mac address synchronisation).What would happen if CFSoE stops working(assume peer link goes down)?
There is a vPC domain, with vPC 20 for Sw2 and vPC 10 for Sw1.
NxOS1 sends broadcast traffic to all ports except port20.
Now, the NxOS2 receives the traffic, it knows what was the status of port 10 and port 20 of NxOS1 (via CFS protocol).
NxOS2 also knows that (via CFS protocol) the broadcast traffic would have come to NxOS1(on port 20) from SW2.
Hence, NxOS2 DOES NOT further send broadcast traffic(in egress direction downstream) on port 20 and port 10 of NxOS2.
Hence, NxOS1 will send the traffic egress via Port 10 and the Peer link.
(I believe when the port channel is established, the system-mac of Sw2 is known to both NxOS1 and NxOS2).
