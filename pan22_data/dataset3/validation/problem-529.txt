The intersting thing is that when I reinstall the OS ( Windows 10 ) the laptop is working fine untill I unplug it , after I unplug it the hibernate thing starts happening.
I have an Asus ROG G751JT laptop, and a few days ago my battery has died.
There you can change the thresholds and actions which are performed when those thresholds are reached (hibernation / shutdown etc.
And your battery is probably so worn out, that it's constantly under that threshold.
You can try to open the Power Options control panel applet, click on Change plan setting on the plan you're using, then Change advanced power settings and locate the Battery node in the list tree.
It hibernates (or shutdowns in the case hibernation is disabled) simply because it's set to hibernate / shutdown when the battery level is under some threshold.
The problem that I am encountering is that my laptop randomly goes to sleep after a few minutes of use even when plugged in.
I will replace the battery but in the meantime is there anything that I can do so I don't have to install the OS a few times a day?
I have formated both my SSD (that I have my OS on ) and my other HDD and the problem persists.
I have tried turning hibernate completely off but if I do that the laptop just shuts down instead of hibernating.
