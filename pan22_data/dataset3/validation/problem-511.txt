Cover the inside of the box with foil, seal all edges and corners and then create a filtration port to attach your HEPA filter to.
The other thing is to visit Western Digital and to download the Data Life Guard tools for your drive and run this to see if that can suggest anything.
Do you have the skills or an "IT Expert" friend who can try to place the drive into your computer?
The one time a virus did that to me, it rendered the cd drive useless.
One tip: you tend to have better chance of recovery if you remove the bare drive from its USB enclosure and plug it in directly to a spare IDE/SATA port on your PC.
Spin rite probably won't work on this drive as it needs to be available at boot time.
This is a detail intensive process so you need to be ready for this.
I've used GetDataBack, with great results in the past: it's free to try an see if it will recover anything, and relatively cheap ($79) if it looks like it will recover what you need.
I have always used a large box as my improvised clean room.
The poor man's option to data recovery is to buy an identical drive and swap the guts out yourself.
This is just to check that its the drive that has become corrupt and not your external unit controller card.
One thing I will mention here is there are some viruses that intentionally break external drive connections because you might find those very useful in removing the virus/malware.
Once you have the drive in a computer, you could also get your "IT Expert" to use a GNU/Linux LiveCD to create an image of the harddrive so that you could try to do repair options on this.
DiskDigger is a data recovery program that is small, portable, easy to use and above all free, unlike 99% of these kinds of applications out there, try it.
You will need some decent assembly/electronic skills, a soldering iron (if needed) and a home built HEPA enclosure to function as your clean room.
Hopefully you can fix the image enough to mount and extract your data.
This is rare but at least you can verify that the external unit is not the cause of the issue
Cut a window for your viewing portal, cut round holes and insert/tape dish-washing rubber gloves in the holes so that you can place your hands in the box without compromising the "clean room".
It does indeed sound like the file system has become corrupt.
