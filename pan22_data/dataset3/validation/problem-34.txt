A few computers had DOS in ROM and would start that (e.g.
When non-IBM companies cloned the PC (Compaq was the first to do that, I believe), rather than include a clone of BASIC ROM, their BIOS would merely display the message "Missing Operating System" - which is what you will see if you power on your system and no bootable device is found.
Also, SSDs are technically not hard disks, and you can certainly boot from one, as well.
As with booting via USB you may need to bring up the BIOS boot menu to select the drive instead of what it tries to boot off of from default.
No reason why you can't use an external drive in place of it during the install process.
The very first IBM PCs would start a BASIC interpreter in ROM if no hard drives, floppies, or other boot media was present.
If you had a hard drive in your system, seeing this would scare you, as it could mean your hard drive failed.
"Also I want to ask can I start a computer with an external hard drive that works like LiveCD?"
When you install a live distro to a USB drive you are doing just that.
Besides an internal SCSI/IDE/SATA hard drive, you can start a computer from a live CD, a bootable USB stick, a bootable memory card in a USB memory card reader or IDE/SATA adapter, a bootable USB hard drive, a bootable floppy disk in a IDE/USB floppy drive, or netboot.
To this day, if no hard drives are connected and nothing like a USB drive is connected, and there isn't a bootable CD in the CD drive, you'll see the typical manufacturer logo, and then a "Missing Operating System" or "No Bootable Device Found, Press {something} to enter setup", etc.
Live CD would also still work despite having been around a while they are still used.
you can install to a usb device and even assign persistent storage on some distributions of linux.
