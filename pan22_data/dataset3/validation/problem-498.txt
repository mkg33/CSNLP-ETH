Intellisense began long before Microsoft added it to the powershell ISE.
There are ways to modify the Intellisense library for the PowerShell ISE.
The point I'm trying to get across is that most widely used languages already have intellisense built into some editor, some where.
I google "intellisense editor $language" and usually find something cool.
You might also want to look into something called PowerGUI.
Netbeans (used primarily for Java dev) also includes intellisense and can be used for Javascript.
SciTE is a customizable text editor for which many have created intellisense libraries.
Now to be clear, Javascript is not Java despite the name sharing, but the IDE (netbeans) has javascript ability.
Intellisense has been integrated into many coding environments.
What I usually do when looking for an editor for a language is google it.
While the idea of multiple IDE/ISE's might seem like a distraction at first, each one is built for a purpose (netbeans for java, ISE for powershell).
Microsoft copied a lot of design elements from PowerGUI and a lot of sysadmins prefer PowerGUI over the current ISE.
