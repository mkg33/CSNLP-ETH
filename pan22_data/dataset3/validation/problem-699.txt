Not to mention, of course, the ethical implications of discriminating against users on the basis of nationality.
You could deny access to a range of IP addresses known to originate from that country, while using a white list to enable access to those specific IP addresses which you want to allow.
This is going to be pretty tough as a user could still use a proxy to bypass any checks you have that look at IP/location.
I'd write some iptables (or use another type of firewall) and say :
You could use some data like this: http://www.ipinfodb.com/
Of course, nothing you do will stop people from using a proxy if they really want to.
Also, you might want to verify that you are legally permitted to deny access on a country-wide basis.
allow all, block this range EXCEPT if the IP can be found in my whitelist
When you have that in place, you check to see if your guest matches a banned location, and if they do, only allow them if they are on a white list of ips.
However, this could easily be subverted by, for example, using a proxy from a different country, or simply by going to a different country and then viewing the website from there.
