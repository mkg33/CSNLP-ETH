The command above will print all the messages to your screen.
Didn't you try to run the plugin/script or other munin command under different user than munin?!?
Can you see at least the initial page without HTTP errors?
If the above is set properly you can try to debug it further:
For all I know, the load plugin seems to be working:
Do the default web servers users apache/apache2 have access to these files?
The rrd databases are stored in /var/lib/munin while the html in /var/www/munin.
Check all these directories and their ownership, groups and permissions.
This command is scheduled to be run via cron to  fetch data from configured munin nodes (munin-node process) and to store it to the rrd database(s).
I just did a fresh install of Munin 2.0.6-4 on a Debian 7.1 server from the debian repositories.
If so, the rrd database for this plugin is updated correctly and the problem may be with your web server.
Did you restart munin-node after adding "load" plugin ?
It could have happened that required files (rrd, html, graphs) are not owned by munin user or that they don't have correct permissions set and so they can't be processed under munin user or accessed by web server process.
