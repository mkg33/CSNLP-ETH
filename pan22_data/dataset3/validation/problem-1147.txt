NOTE: I know that sounds redundant but that's literally the only way I could get it to work
Go to the Raspberry Pi site & download the latest version of Noobs
I would suggest using Etcher to write the image to the sd card.
You don't need to format the sd card nor unzip the image.
This might be a bad explanation as I don't fully understand it, but you have to write a filesystem to the entirety of the card first, before later partitions can be expanded to fit.
I deleted the partitions, created by the raspbian image, using fdisk and created one big partition across the card.
Copy and paste the contents of the unzipped NOOBS folder onto the formatted drive, place it into the Raspberry Pi, then power it up.
The format itself persists even if the partitions are deleted.
Just wanted to let people know what really helped me flawlessly:
The image was successfully written, but could not be expanded.
Did you download the latest Raspbian Stretch with Desktop ?
Using the Disk Utility Tool (default on mac), format the your sd card to "(DOS) FAT", and then download the SD Formatter tool from https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/ and erase the drive
Unzip the file on your desktop (or the directory location you prefer) using the archive utility tool (right click->open with->archive utility)
I replicated the issue on Linux by taking a fresh SD card and doing:
Then I wrote the same image using the same command to /dev/sdX (NOT /dev/sdX1 !)
Etcher will unzip the image and overwrite everything on the sd card (hence no formatting required).
I recently ran into an issue upgrading my pi's sdcard while trying to recover my old data.
In the midst of it I decided to just start over with Noobs, and was having issues, did a search, and it ironically lead me back to my own thread.
For some reason etcher didn't work at all for me, but the copy & paste worked great.
