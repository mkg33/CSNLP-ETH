This needs to be given some permissions over the wordpress files itself.
Mysql does not have permission to read and write unless you add it to the www-data group.
PHP on the other hand is given a username, so if you select your own username, this will have to be added to the group as well.
When mysql is installed, it is given the username mysql.
Alright so this has driven me mad for weeks, but I've finally figured it out.
When I tested this, I just made an html file called index.html and pointed apache to it, which worked fine, but once i used wordpress (or joomla), it died, so the problem had to be either in php or Mysql.
Personally I changed mine to have the owner as my username on the machine, and www-data as the group.
You need to add both mysql and www-data (the username) to www-data (the group).
Now, assuming you gave permissions to the folders earlier, you should now be able to access this site externally.
When you set permissions on your wordpress folder, you give ownership and group permissions to www-data.
Please try using 127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress instead and it should work.
I've tried it here on my machine and I can access LAMP websites using the URL 127.0.0.1
