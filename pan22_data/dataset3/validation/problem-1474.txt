If you want to monitor only one port, and you have access to that switch, use port mirroring.
Cisco switches use SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer) in which you can use commands as such:
If you don't have a simple port to port connection this becomes more difficult.
Port Mirroring was a much implemented feature and many lower cost switches still implement monitoring that way.
There are often limitations as to how many ports can be "monitored" simultaneously.
Either way, you will need some software/hardware to view the traffic.
If you can, like suggested above, configure your switch to mirror all traffic to a monitor port then you can monitor all traffic on the switch that way.
However, it will need to sit between the switch and the router.
You may be better off throwing a HUB like you mentioned, but you might as well get smart and learn a better way to do it
However, I believe there will be some data loss if the traffic becomes too much for the switch to handle (check your switch specifications for specifics).
I work for a company that develops NetScope, which works like a tap interface and sits in-line on your network.
A network tap will sit in-line and monitors all traffic passing in/out of your switch.
There are some free programs out there that will do it.
On the monitor station use something like wireshark.

If you want to monitor all trafic that is going through the switch, I guess you can use a network tap >> https://greatscottgadgets.com/throwingstar/.
If your switch supports OpenFlow you can create flows to get you the data you want.
