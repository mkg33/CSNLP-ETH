I have bought excellent tower systems and awful rackmount kit; component and build quality is harder to assess than simply "what shape is the case?
If you don't mind even longer downtimes and the delay of the search for replacement parts, you don't need to use branded supplier kit, and can go with a build-your-own generic solution.
The insoluble problem only arises when the business insists it wants X, but will only pay the cost of 0.85X.
Then you're working for one of those companies that believes that management decisions can trump reality, and the best fix for those is an up-to-date, well-circulated CV.
Even if it's your own server room, you have finite space, and simply buying big (to save money in the short-term) isn't always a win in the long term, unless you have some business agreement that the server room can always be extended at no cost.
Rackmount-format kit is immediately worthwhile if you're planning on putting it in a colo facility or server room that charges by vertical rack footprint.
If you do mind that downtime, use redundant PSUs and/or a fast-response-time maintenance contract.
As with all these decisions, it's a tradeoff between functionality and expenditure.
I don't think that rackmount systems are automatically more reliable or otherwise of higher quality than tower systems.
The decision-making process in all these cases is: what are your business requirements?
If you don't mind these systems being down for 48 hours while a new PSU is ordered and fitted, don't bother with redundant PSUs.
Redundant PSUs will depend on the cost of downtime.
I'm not sure I'd subscribe to Michael's view, as expressed in his comment above.
From that, you'll know what hardware decisions need to be made, and from that, you'll get a price.
If the business doesn't want to pay the price, it can decide which of its requirements it will relax or remove, to enable you to choose a cheaper solution.
