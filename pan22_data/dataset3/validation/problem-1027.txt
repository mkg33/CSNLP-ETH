So it ended up being okay with just the time to replace things being wasted.
Seagate has a policy where you either return the drive and they mail one out to you after or you pay a fee and they mail you a drive first.

I've used multiple brands over the years although I tend to pick Seagate for my personal machines.
Handling returns is where the vendor becomes important.
HOWEVER, I did have one machine where I had to replace the drive 3 times.
Funny, but no Ha Ha funny, drive are sold advertising MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) of like 150,000 hours.
Had them installed in over 50 "servers" for POS system and we were replacing drives at least a few times a month.
Now I don't know if the manufacturers have found a way to travel forward in time, but this criteria is clearly bogus.
I used to love Maxtor, but nowadays they don't seem to be very reliable.
I also typically steer clear of Hitachi, Toshiba, and Fujitsu... although these are pretty standard brands to find in all sorts of laptops.
Seagate ended up shipping me a replacement drive first gratis so that I could pull the data off.
Currently my go-to brand is Seagate... although their recent firmware fiasco has me wondering.
Everyone seems to have there own preferred hard drive choice.
After the second crash, I was fairly unhappy as it was within a short period of time.
My order of purchasing drives are Seagate, Hitachi, then Western Digital.
I have had so many Maxtor drives burn out in less then a year.
