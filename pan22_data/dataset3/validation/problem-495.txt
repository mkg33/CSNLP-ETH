I have one server under Windows Server 2008 with domain controller role and another server under Windows Server 2003 with IIS 6.0
The reason: IIS_IUSRS is a local user of the win2k3 server and I see not much chance of it working well with the other - win2k8 SQL.
Are you using a SQL account in your connection string?
Before, SQL Server was on the same server that IIS thus we did not have problems but now SQL Server is on another server.
Okay, you have a built-in IIS_IUSRS account, but if you want custom, just customize.
SQL Server allows you to use userids stored in the SQL Server or userids from a Windows domain.
Why not create a domain user, let's say ABLA\dubli.doo on the win2k8, allow access to the servers for this dubli.doo user, and run the IIS6 thingy with this one instead of IIS_IUSRS?
Do you know which kind of userids your database is configured to use?
I have a problem to connect to a SQL Server database with a web application that use ADO.
Could you post it here replacing the server name and username/password with dummy info?
