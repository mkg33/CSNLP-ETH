The router is running a dhcp server, and I would like that wifi clients get their ip directly from the router without any "routing" in the ubuntu box.
The box will not route traffic from WiFi to LAN and back all by itself.
So, you basically want your Ubuntu box to act as a repeater or media converter, otherwise known as a bridge.
You can bridge the ethernet interface and wi-fi interface, and all the traffic will pass unmodified.
What are the possible ways to setup the server as a wifi access point?
Or you can look for tricks that will leave the bridged interface usable by the machine as a normal ethernet interface.
I have an ubnutu server connected to internet by an ethernet cable to a router.
Read http://www.linux.com/archive/articles/55617 for a fine introduction to wireless access point configuration under Linux, including securing and bridging.
You will need to run your WiFi interface in Ad-Hoc or AP mode.
I would like to share the Internet connection by a Wifi usb dongle connected to the server.
I am quite sure it is not possible for clients to get IPs from router without "any" routing in ububtu box.
Your router will see DHCP requests from wireless clients and answer them.
Try adding something like this to /etc/network/interfaces:
Note that not every chipset can run in AP mode, so your mileage may vary.
You will need an extra interface for the machine itself tough.
Note: you'll need to have the bridge-utils package installed.
