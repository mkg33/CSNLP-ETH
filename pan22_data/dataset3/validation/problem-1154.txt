So write the document and store it in some folder and put the shortcut link on Startup folder(Start->All Programs).
Interesting - but why not just an email, so he can review it again if he likes?
In the end of the document ask him to to remove the shortcut link.
So I prefer instead of showing one time you may request him to save that document for his future reference.
Considering your question , you wants to give some useful information and guides for him.
C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
C:\Users\Default\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup (<-- may have to create directory)
Assuming you leave one note for each problem you fix...
Open the Registry Editor, and add the filename as string to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce when you are logged in as that specific user, or to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\... which opens that file for Ã¡ny user.
Assuming you have your reasons, the method Luke mentions is a good one.
