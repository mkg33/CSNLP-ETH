), it could be the firewall again, or it could be a hundred other things.
First, I try to ping the local ip address on the interface of the host I am using.
If it's a local ping (you can't ping your GW), take a look at the arp tables.
If it won't respond to PING on a local network (ethernet, usually), then it could be a Firewall setting.
To check the IP address of the server, go to Start > Run > CMD > ipconfig, and scroll through the IP addresses presented there and try each one, one by one.
if all the normal steps like checking the icmp ports on source and destination,checking the firewall and checking the iptables etc is Done then next is checking the icmp_echo_ignore_all file.if it is 1 ping won't work.so make it to 0 by either going to the file directly (/proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all)
I assume you mean that the server is not RESPONDING to ping?
In Windows XP, you can disable/enable ICMP packets.
You could spend an awful lot of time troubleshooting something that isn't even part of the problem if you don't know that.
I will try to establish a TCP connection to ports I expect to be able to access.
or by the command sysctl -w net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=0
It could be a firewall at the edge of your network (a consumer grade router maybe?
If you are using the Windows firewall, it depends on the version of Windows you are running.
If you are trying to ping it over the internet, then that's a much more complicated issue.
There's quite a few things that can cause the system not to ping.
After trying to ping, run "arp -na" to see if you got a MAC address for the IP you tried to ping.
At some point, I examine the network traffic with wireshark or tcpdump.
When you PING it sends an ICMP packet, which some some firewalls will filter.
Sometimes ping (ICMP) is blocked (by incompetent network admins), try surfing or using hping2 to gateway and beyond.
Also, if I can, I will try to use an alternate host to see if it works.
When diagnosing network connectivity issues, I start local and then move global.
"Pings" are not limited to ICMP Echo/Request traffic.
Tracert (or traceroute) would seem to be the next reasonable step; find out where the traffic is being stopped.
The other obvious thing is to check to see if the server is plugged in, and that it has an IP address, you are pinging the correct IP address and that there are no communication breakdowns between the server you are pinging, and yourself.
But you'll get the same information by pinging your gateway and then checking the arp tables.
If you are running a 3rd party firewall, you will need to check its settings.
