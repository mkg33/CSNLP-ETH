Is there function which can be called in the elasticsearch output, to lower-case the field in question?
However, ES is rejecting some of the indices as the field contains uppercase characters - identifier has acceptable values like myfoo but also could be MyBar:
This way you can create an index pattern with a lowercase identifier, but avoid having the lowercase field appear in the documents themselves.
You will end up with an lc_identifier field in your indices, but that shouldn't matter much.
As part of my FileBeats config, some standard fields are always generated as part of every message (and are location-specific), which I want to use as the basis for my my ES index:
You can use the @metadata field to prevent the lc_identifier field from appearing in your documents while indexed.
The casing isn't essential and I can add a mutate filter to forcibly lowercase the fields in question, but I would prefer to store the identifier field with proper casing, yet use the lower-cased version for the index name.
I have a standard ELK stack currently storing numerous log outputs.
I'm trying to separate my indices to be source-specific.
