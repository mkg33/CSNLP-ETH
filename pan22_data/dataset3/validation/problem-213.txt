There is no way to "map" a sphere with squares (or rectangles) and have them all join up at "common" vertices.
The challenge of representing the surface of a sphere on/with a flat 2D plane has been something people have been thinking about for a long long time.
) gives slightly less distortion, but is more complicated.
Then, when one walks off of the grid, a new one is generated on demand.

This may or may not work for the OP, but for some it might be useful.
As other answers have said, the answer is to either use a different shape (hexes or triangles for example), or dynamically generate your map on the fly for the user's current viewpoint.
Here is an older article from GameDev.net you might find useful.
The origin of the grid would be wherever your local center was, and the normal at that point matches the normal of the surface of the planet.

Googling "tiling hex map" will give you a lot of hits, some useful some not.
The problem space isn't really stated in the question, but if I were working on something where I wanted a city view but wanted to be able to spin the world, I might temporarily just map a grid onto a "flat enough" section of the world.
It's about doing isometric and hexagonal tiles on a grid.
Square tiles are pretty easy to manage no question, but I don't think creating a tiling hex map is that hard.
Most definitely go read up on Map Projectsions to get some insights and ideas that might help.
That's why when you look at maps of the world, some parts are distorted and some parts aren't.
Usually it's the poles because most maps are about non-polar areas.
Carlos A. Furuti has lots of maps of earth that fold up into a cube
Most modeling apps allow you to create a sphere primitive using a geodesic design.
If you create a sphere using a geodesic base, the polar area is treated no different than any other region in terms of vertex spacing which facilitates uniform uv mapping.
You're asking a question that people who make maps have been asking for a long time :)
However, would it be feasible to generate the "local view" on demand?
