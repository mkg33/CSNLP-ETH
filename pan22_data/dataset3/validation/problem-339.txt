mosh was built for the common, but less apocalyptic scenario of remote a session connecting through a cellular data link, before 3G was even a thing.
I still use it to ssh, er... mosh from my Android device using termux even though the links on 4G don't have this issue anymore.
It uses ssh to authenticate, but the rest of the session is handled by the mosh tunnel, which was specifically designed for session resilience on flaky links.
Another frequent use case was ssh connections through flaky modem links over POTS, that would drop the session if your sister decided that she wanted to call her boyfriend and picked up the other FIXED phone in the house, even though you warned her that you'd be downloading U2's new album in MP3 format from a shady WaReZ site.
So if you would like to use this, install mosh using your distro's package manager on both server and client (no root needed on either, it will do a userland install if it can't get root, handy for Android devices) and then do:
From a user's perspective, nowdays it's imperceptible.
Back in those days, if you used your laptop to log in to your ssh server, for example in a commuter train, using a CDMA "pc-card" modem on your blindingly fast compaq armada (omg pentium!
That would be an equivalent scenario to the old Soviet Union raining down plutonium along the train's track, from the connection's point of view...
), or using a serial cable to hook up that palm VII thingy that had some sort of data service; you would have your session disconnected every time you switched from one radio cell to the next, which in a commuter train could be every 3 to 5 minutes.
