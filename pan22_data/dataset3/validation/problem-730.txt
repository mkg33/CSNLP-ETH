All you have to learn is to use a good game engine properly like Unity.
that makes sense for your platform, and start creating things.
you can be a good game programmer without touching OpenGL nor DX.
As programmable pipeline programming opposed to fixed function pipeline is becoming the standard, the part where you interact with the graphics API is small part of all the work.
It is called OpenGL ES and it is on a lot of levels exactly the same as OpenGL 4.1/4.0/3.3/3.2.
The other thing is, OpenGL is really big on mobile phones.
Find a higher-level library that makes things easy for you, and start doing rather than staring at the mountains of things that you think you need to learn first.
So, pick a library, such as Ogre3D, Unity, Panda3D, etc.
so my advice is learn to use a game engine coz that probably what will u do in you career (pro or indie) and also learn a graphics library like OpenGL for learning purposes only.
You need to be comfortable with higher level concepts such as vector math, texture mapping, etc.
Once you are doing and not staring, then you can see what's the next thing to learn that would make sense.
If you start with graphics programming the technology matters, but if you become familiar with it only concepts start to matter and they are the same on Direct3D or OpenGL.
you won't gain much out of it in terms of 'quality' so it will be for learning purposes.
I bet OpenGL or Direct3D will pop up very late in that list of things to learn.
It seems you are at the "twiddling your thumb" stage and not in the "what should we use to code our next engine on" stage, I would suggest neither learning OpenGL nor learning Direct3D.
However, if you want to to go more low level and understand how game engine works you should learn OpenGL.
