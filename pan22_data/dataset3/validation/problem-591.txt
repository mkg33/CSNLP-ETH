I would like to replace the cable modem, but I'm afraid if I do I'll totally mess up everything I have in place.
It is connected to my 5-year old TWC digital phone/cable modem.
The built-in wireless says it is pre-set to 192.168.0.1.
If I could ignore the wireless feature of the new cable modem or turn it off that would be fine too.
I don't know if there is any IP address (on my network) for this.
I have a home network with a Trendnet TW100-S4W1CA wired router with a base address of 192.168.2.1, DHCP turned on with a range of 192.168.2.1 - 192.168.2.100, subnet 255.255.255.0.
I am at a loss as to how this can be integrated with my "2" net (192.168.2.x).
I have a wireless access point with DHCP turned on with a range of 192.168.2.101 - 192.168.2.255, subnet 255.255.255.0.
Has anyone been in this situation, and/or can offer advice?
I see this new modem has a built-in wireless router as well as being a wired router.
I was at the TWC store recently and they gave me a newer modem to increase bandwidth (ARRIS Touchstone DOCSIS 3.0 Gateways).
