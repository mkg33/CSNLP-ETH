I don't quite understand what you're asking but I'll take a shot at it:
So I am trying to create a isolated network for punch of Linux VMs, one of the VMs will be the router to connect the internal network to the internet, it should be multi-homed with two vNICs, I have created a second standard vSwitch with "Virtual Machine" port group, and I bind the new switch to no Physical NIC, intend to use this switch for internal network.
I have installed VMWare ESXi 5.1 on a Whitebox recently to use it as a home lab, even though I have a very little knowledge about VMware ESXi and vSphere, but I found that it is most suitable virtualization platform for my lab.
I'm not including any information on how to assign ip addresses, default gateways or router/proxy settings because that's going to be specific to the platform you choose and your particular network design scenario.
I cant find any option or configuration enable me to accomplish this, also I tried to google it too much, but with no success.
Assumption: You want to isolate your VM's to an "internal only" network.
You would like them to access the internet through a multihomed VM that will act as a router/proxy.
I appreciate if any one can help me for this to be done.
My problem is, how to choose witch switch the VM will connect, and how to make the Muti-Homed VM to connect to both vSwitches, how to do this?
