You can try configuring Windows Firewall via Group Policy, if Kapersky AV reconfigured the Windows firewall.
You can use an ILO/DRAC if it's a physical server.
then you can connect to localhost:3399 on your remote dektop client to access the remote RDP machine.
I can't connect to the server at all to change the settings.
So, if you have a firewall or a linux machine for example, that you can ssh into and just forward a port over a local machine, it could work.
If instead Kapersky AV implemented its own firewall, then... well you get in your car and you drive out there to where the machine is, or call the datacenter and pay for remote-hands, and learn your lesson.
Some AV products simply flip on the Windows firewall, which blocks RDP by default.
You can use the hypervisor console if it's a virtual machine.
I installed Kaspersky Endpoint security, but as soon as the installer finished, my remote desktop connection broke and I wasn't able to login anymore.
Seems that Kaspersky firewall blocks RDC ports and that prevents me from logging in.
Kaspersky prevents RDP connections from other networks, but it may allow RDP from the same subnet.
If you have access to a machine that is able to forward a specific port to the RDP host, then you might be lucky.
Are there any alternatives of logging into the server?
