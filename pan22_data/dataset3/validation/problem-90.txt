I can then have a rule in our monitoring system bosun that alerts if there have been failed resources consistently for a failed period of time:
I had the same issue, and rather than going through the effort of installing Foreman, I ended up writing a quick and dirty shell/cron script to curl and grep puppet dashboard, and email the results.
This method of getting the stats from last_run_summary.yaml should be applicable to any monitoring system really.
I can view "Currently failing" nodes in the puppet dashboard web GUI, and even drill into it to see what policy has gone awry.
I'm looking to get the Log>Level>err message, which as well can create an err message on a successful run.

What we currently do at Stack Exchange (Saw some upvotes on this question so figured I would add a updated answer):

When converted to a struct the relevant porition of that file looks as follows:
