Set it to restricted via notes.ini Server_Restricted=4, so that users don't start to work with the old data before a full replication has occurred.
To arrange alternate hardware it may take few days, my question is what should be the roadmap to restore the primary server again?
Depending on performance of server and network replication will not need long and after that you can allow access to the server again via set config Server_Restricted=.
Today we encountered disk failure in our primary MAIL1 server .
After I re install domino on new server and restore 14-nov-2018 users mail nsf files to the new server after few days , will it replicate from mail2 server auto?
As long as the downtime is no longer than the deletion stub purge time (usually 90 days), there will be no problem at all: Just reinstall the server on any new hardware and copy the mailfiles from that date to the new server.
I have only following files (today dated) from primary mail1 server
All Users MAIL NSF files (14-Nov-2018 dated files)
names.nsf admin4.nsf server.id admin.id cert.id iwaredir.nsf
If i install same Domino level on new hardware using old primary mail1 server name / ip , and restore above files to original location , will it work ?
All users by default connects to primary MAIL1 via lotus notes.
all users lotus notes shifted to Secondary MAIL2 server auto.
Unfortunately multiple disk failure occurred and the server goes faulty.
If you don't wanna wait, just type repl MAIL2 on the MAIL1 console.
Then let your scheduled replication (I hope you have one) do its job and replicate all missing data from MAIL2 to MAIL1.
We have 2 lotus domino servers (8.5.3 FP6 on W2008).
