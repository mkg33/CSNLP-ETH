Chances are, your PC is unable to read the 'automatic plug-n-play' drivers from your DVR.
First, find the drivers for the DVR online and install them on your PC.
Can you be more specific regarding the type of VM you used?
Second, try plugging into several different USB ports.
Does the DVR have external power or is it powered via USB?
Some PCs display this problem and the solution is to install the drivers on these manually.
Did you say you were running a virtual machine within the problem PC and that the virtual machine worked while the PC didn't?
If this is the case, then that means you have a pass through set up for USB in order for the virtual machine to use the device.
Try the BIOS settings for the USB ports too, make sure they are not set to "1.1" or "Compatible" and if you have the option, check the interrupts and I/O for the USB ports.
Some USB ports on your PC may be faulty while others may be working perfectly.
Legacy of IBM PC sometimes rears its ugly head even today.
(Manufacturers always list their drivers online for situations like these.)
