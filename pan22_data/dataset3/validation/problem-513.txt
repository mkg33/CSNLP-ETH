A hundred applications I have no knowledge about share the server space.
Your dev environment should be separate anyway, but I think this is worth repeating.
I need to change this, I need to make serious fixes, but it's like playing kaltoh while being shot full of mind-altering drugs.
I have about 3 servers that are probably almost 10 years old, all using code what one might consider worst-practices for programming's sake.
I'm terrified of making changes to the thing (production servers have always been the development platform before I got here, and I really want to change this), but we have no real way to emulate the server perfectly other than use the thing.
The developers will have access exclusively to Dev VMs.
For restoring and working, of course, be REALLY SURE to work as far as you can from your production LAN.
Servers are windows2000 server, database is MSSQL 2008, servers run IIS with PHP and ASP.
Antivirus server is on there... in all honesty, I just want to replicate the website.
Make an image of the server (Clonezilla, ghost4unix).
Also - if one of these servers is a DC, DO NOT virtualize a copy of it into an environment that has any ability to talk back to the production machine (or even the network) that it was cloned from.
If possible you could do this overnight in a very dead moment.
I've had good success using Acronis TrueImage on a Windows 2000 Server and then converting the image with VmWare Converter.
If there's a DHCP server providing leases to some of these production machines, make sure it's cloned as well.
If it is not working, try to use Clonezilla image to restore to a VM.
vCenter Converter will do the trick, especially with the cold cloning as entens and Christopher mentioned.
Following my advice and all the other users' you should be able to set up the system that will allow you to "play" as much as you want and clean up the code.
Acronis boot cd can save the image over the network so you'll be sure of not touching anything on your original server.
Some "log me in" software that nobody knows about exists on there.
This way you will test that you are in control of the new servers.
To give you an idea of what I mean by worst-practices... we have 14 copies of the "main" block of code, a 14,000 line monster of "please, repeat yourself" code worked on by seven developers over ten years, all sitting in the root directory of the production web server.
Take the code for migration to QA and deployments to Prod only from source control.
Double check every single passage, be calm and accurate and none'll get hurt :)
So we have to change the website it's running, and I really don't want to go "Oops."
The main problem is to be able to clone the machine you're using.
Schedule downtime, clone all the machines, then start them back up as VM's in an entirely separate network.
Advice on how to do something like migrate these 3 beasts into VMs on my desktop or something where I can safely do some development work without feeling like I'm the star of Mission Imposable, hanging from a thread over laser beams and sweat dripping off my face as I carefully do my work?
Just put a lonely pc with vmware and the server you're converted and if you need to try different client connections just hook a single switch where to connect both server and clients and be sure that NONE mess with it ever.
