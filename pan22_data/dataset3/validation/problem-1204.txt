Can I setup a routing in the present adsl modem to route all web requests to that specific pc hooked up with 3g modem, while all other local lan requests works as they do now?
That specific pc is able to connect through 3g, but they want to share it across the network.
They already have a usb 3g modem, which emulated as a modem in local pc.
They have around 10 pcs and 10 servers, all hooked up to an unmanaged switch.
As far as I can tell, they theorically can do this, but I don't have enough experience to setup the rules.
Switch is hooked up to a tilgin ADSL modem, which also acts as a router and dhcp server (a pretty common setup actually).
I was going to tell him to set up the default gateway for all pc's as the pc with the 3g modem, but it requires the ip's to be assigned staticly.
I have a friend who works in a small office with ~10 computers + 4 servers.
This will render routing by pc name useless, and thats an important functionality for them since they all require to access the routers and other pc's by their network names.
Local service provider told him that there will be a planned maintenance and they will have ~2-3 days of internet downtime.
