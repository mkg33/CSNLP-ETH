I'd be seriously concerned about the kind of apps you're running on your server if you're generating a lot of UAC prompts.
If this is just your personal machine then turn UAC off.
On the other hand, if it's something like Lotus Domino that might just be the way things have got to be (we don't all have nice clean servers that only require the MS admin tools to manage...)
It's a business machine, leave UAC on and stop using the server's desktop.
It's not an ideal world, and UAC exists for a reason - to warn you that an application you're using is about to make some potentially serious changes or do some deep-down OS-level stuff that might make your system unhappy IF the app is in any way malicious or plain-old-fashioned badly-written.
We've just upgraded to Windows 2008 server, and I'm already getting really sick of approving dozens of UAC messages.
It sounds painful, but it's the best strategy for keeping server computers secure from unwanted malicious software or accidental damage.
You should not disable it on your personal machines or your servers.
our monitoring software need WMI to run the types of windows reports we want instead of SNMP...but of course UAC is not allowing it access.
It shouldn't be bothering you too much because you shouldn't be working directly on the server computer's desktop all that much for it to be an issue.
Is there any particular reason I should leave it on?
It's a minor inconvienience with a sizeable payoff.
In an ideal world you could just turn UAC off and everything would hum along fine with no isues.
I normally disable UAC on my personal Vista machines, but I'm reluctant to do this on our server.
tools with "Run As" and an administrative account.
tools on a client computer, logging-on with a non-administrative account on that client computer for day-to-day work, and running the admin.
The UAC on the server should be annoying as a reminder that everythig you are doing should and could be done without being logged onto the servers desktop.
