This semester is almost over and I might say I have some knowledge of C. Since I went to this school just for the purpose to become a game programmer I would like to start programming a game asap.
I did my homework and went trough similar questions but I didn't get the answer.
Runescape and if you ever wanted to migrate over to the android mobile device it would be simple, because android apps are written in java.
Javascript seems to have a lot of potential and is capable well enough for simple arcade games.
It is not very appropriate for graphically rich or long-drawn out games like the adventure/story games you mentioned you wanted to do.
It frees you from having to handle OpenGL directly.
I am currently studying at University of technology in Brno (Czech Republic).
I would recommend to try C++ for the following reasons:
I would start with java because it is a multi-platform language that can run on any Operating System and it is very similar to c++.
Also you might want to try DevianArt for the concept art of your games.
Since you have no wish to bring your game to mobile distribution, I suggest that you stay away from Javascript for the time being.
Since you seem to know a bit of C, you could always try to use C++ with SFML, or C with SDL for 2D games.
My school project are almost done so I have been thinking about writing something already (story driven game running in terminal ^^).
I don't want my game to run on a mobile device yet and I want to make games for PC and Mac, not for consoles obviously.
It is also widely used in 2d and 3d games over the internet usually as browser based games, e.g.
You can find an artist who will draw sprites,portraits,start screens and pretty much everything else, for reasonable prices or maybe even free.But to really get started just go to you tube and look up some game development tutorials i recommend TheNewBoston because he teaches free tutorials on Game Development in many different languages.
It's also cross-platform on the PC, Mac and Linux.
People are usually mentioning C++, C#, OpenGL and others and I simply don't know which one to choose.
I am currently interested only in 2D games and that won't change for some time.
However, if you just want to create some basic games for experience, then of course, go for Javascript!
