I booted the disk, but windows did not detect it: nothing was shown.
Ultimately I found that the original (untouched) HD was detected by the install disk, hence I concluded the error was not related to missing chipset or HD controller drivers.
It can be found on the gigabyte website under Sata Raid>AHCI > preinstall driver.
I would set bios to ahci, then load the AHCI driver during setup using the "load driver" button.
Which I stopped using ctrl+C after 32GB was copied (way more than the recovery partitions sizes, and they were all the the start of the disk).
Since I'm not familiar with windows at all, and I was only doing this swap for friends, I decided not to look in to it too much, and bought a non-OEM windows 7 disk.
Nevertheless, although the recovery tools started correctly from the SSD, there was no "fresh install" options.
Concluding: Windows installation may not detect your HD if the partition table is broken.
Now that you've cleaned the drive & created a primary, active partition, it should show up during Windows Installation.
I had a the same problem when swapping a SSD with an HD.
Loading all the drivers I found on the manufacturers website did nothing but wasting time.
If that does not work try another hard drive, if it fails also then it is some sort of bios or motherboard bug.
Before installing windows 7 from a non-OEM DVD, I tried to copy the first two partitions of the HD in linux using
Hence I recreated the partition table on the SSD using gparted on linux, which needs to be MBR (msdos in gparted) for some reason, since GPT also does not work.
