As Mark already suggested, you could disable the service to stop this happening.
Windows Update tried to install some updates and now it wants to reboot.
Those notifications aren't coming from the service itself, they're coming from the client.
But I'm doing some work that I'd rather not interrupt for the time being.
To shut up the nagging reminders about rebooting, I went into Services and Stopped the Windows Update service.
A simpler solution is to drag the reminder window off the edge of the display so that it's out of your way.
I went in to Services again, and Windows Update was running again!
I will reboot when I'm ready to, and until that happens, I want this service to go down and stay down.
The "remind me later" option just minimizes the client to the notification area, it doesn't make the client exit.
What could be restarting it without my knowledge, and how do I make it stop?
Start gpedit.msc, go to Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Update and set the policy No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled automatic updates installations to Enabled.
If you stop the service and then kill the instance of wuauclt.exe that's running in your user context the notifications might go away, provided that no other software starts the service up again - for example, Microsoft Security Essentials uses the Windows Update service in order to check for definition updates, and will probably restart it periodically if it is not running.
