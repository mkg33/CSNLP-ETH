The short answer is YES they can detect unauthorized access.
I am a university student, and my university's network administrator uses MAC addresses (1 MAC address / student) to authorise access to the internet.
I routinely revoked access for network violations (file sharing, illegal software, viruses, porn in the computer labs, etc).
As others have said, it's possible for the admins to detect rogue wireless hotspots.
You can read about it at https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/47819/how-can-phone-companies-detect-tethering-incl-wifi-hotspot.
Of all the ways to lock down a system, I really can't think of a worse way of doing it.
But it's also possible to detect unauthorized devices through deep packet inspection.
My network utilizes a system that has detectors spaced throughout the buildings, and if a rogue SSID shows up it will actually triangulate the location of the device.
to get additional wireless access for "your other devices" that don't NEED to be on the school's network and/or in common areas (like the free wifi in most coffee shops).
On the other hand, deep packet inspection is expensive, and the admins might not have the budget to implement it.
Work with the network administrator, student government, administration, etc.
), or maybe using the existing router to detect then, traffic patterns can also be a giveaway - your hotspot has a different signature than your device.
What if someone's unauthorized device passed a virus that wiped your doctoral research and thesis?
Mobile phone companies can use deep packet inspection to detect unauthorized tethering.
With available technology these days, you don't even need a good network admin to catch you.
As others have said, work with the admins, don't try to beat them.
This prevents load on the "actual" school network, and still gives you the internet access you want.
Or they might simply be unwilling to go to that level of effort to catch cheaters.
My query is, is it at all possible for the administrator to know that a device is using virtual routing to connect to other unauthorised devices?
If you think it's a joke now, try it at a job and see what happens.
Instead of working against your sysadmin (which is a PITA for both sides), talk to him.
I have a strong feeling that he is just plain bluffing.
Try to change policies, see if exceptions are allowed, etc.
Many of those students had to leave school, because college is quite difficult without computer access.
It's probably best to talk to the admins and see if you can work out something.
Recently, the administrator redirected all the students to refrain from using hotspots, otherwise he will punish those who don't comply (by removing the student's MAC address from the authorised MACs database, I suppose).
Probably every student has more devices than the policy allows.
Yes, this is slower than just setting up a hotspot, but also more effective.
The system isn't cheap, but good Lord, it's probably more cost effective in the long run if you add up time spent manually managing MAC addresses; that has to be an administrative nightmare.
Note: I tried searching for resources online, for example, how do exactly the virtual routers network, but I couldn't find any substantial information.
It sounds like a generational difference issue or the school's network can't handle more than 1 device for each student, staff member, etc.
The students regularly use virtual routing softwares to create a hotspot to connect to their other devices (MAC spooofing is one possible workaround, but spoofing on a handheld device, for example, an android device, requires root access, which itself is a pain to gain).
I don't know why they have the "one MAC per student rule", maybe they can relax it a bit?
Besides physically running around and detecting hotspots via WLAN traffic ("warwalking"?
I don't know how the political side of the student representation works at your uni, but often students can voice their interests in some way.
If Windows-generated packets and Linux-generated packets are both coming from your MAC address at the same time, it's likely you have more than one device attached.
I used to work as a network administrator's assistant for a college.
I would appreciate even if someone could point me to some resources which would be of use to me.
