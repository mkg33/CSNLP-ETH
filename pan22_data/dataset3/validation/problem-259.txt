It looks like mono was not yet backported to 8.04, looking at thepackages list http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy-backports/allpackages
the same applies for ubuntu too, although with the 6-monthly ubuntu releases you don't need to wait as long to upgrade to the next supported release as you do in debian.
For ubuntu, many more up to date packages are available using the Personal Package Archives on launchpad.net.
while it's possible - indeed, quite easy - to have a mostly-"stable" system with only a handful of packages from testing or unstable, IMO if you want to keep up with the bleeding-edge of software then you're better off just upgrading to debian unstable than sticking with stable, and getting into the habit of running 'apt-get dist-upgrade' semi-regularly.
you could add lines to your sources.list for either testing or unstable distribution (or both), and set apt's priority rules to use only stable unless you explicitly ask for a package from testing or unstable (e.g.
I myself have not managed to get the latest Mono installed from packages yet, but I do have a good tutorial for building the latest Mono from source on Ubuntu: Install Mono 2.4 From Source on Ubuntu
To install packages from a PPA, and get updates for them, follow these instructions.
"apt-get -t unstable install mono-2.0-devel" - this will install mono-2.0-devel from unstable along with all versioned dependancies)
mono 2.4.2.3 is in debian sid (unstable dist) at the moment, and mono 2.4 is in debian squeeze (testing).
long term support version) of Ubuntu you can add the official backports repositories to /etc/apt/sources.list and simply install with apt-get.
If you are using ubuntu 8.04 (hardy) then the most relevant one would appear to be https://launchpad.net/~mono-edge/+archive/ppa
If you want the really bleeding edge mono, then there is a mono-testing PPA with mono 2.4 at https://launchpad.net/~mono-testing/+archive/ppa
it'll be less hassle and there'll be less weird incompatibilities and other oddities (that's been my experience using debian for the last 15 years, anyway)
If you want to use the latest version of mono on an older (e.g.
Follow the instructions here to set up backports and access debian repository.
There is a good chance that it will be added for you.
