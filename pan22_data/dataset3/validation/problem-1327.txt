I have a server at a remote site, the sites are connected to each other a site-to-site VPN connection using Cisco ASA 5510 firewalls.
One end is managed by me, the other managed by the remote location's IT, between the 2 of us is another party who manage and route the connections.
Remote Desktop works fine to the remote server within the remote location but not over the VPN.
If that works then the issue would likely exists on the server 2008 system.
Is there a setting to allow you to remote connect to older remote desktop connection systems?
So the initiating server was able to connect at one point and now all of the sudden it cannot?
All the routes seem fine and I can still ping the remote server and even download files from an FTP site on the remote server.... so the VPN seems fine.
And the only thing you know that has changed is the initiating server has file services installed?
I know that on server 2008 systems there is some setting to allow remote desktop connections for older remote desktop connection applications from older systems.
For instance do you have an XP client or another server 2003 system you could attempt to initiate the connection from?
I don't understand why it's stopped working, I originally thought it was a rule in place by the other party but they stress it's not them.
The source server (remote location) may or may not have had updates applied.
If not, then it is either an issue with the server 2003 system on the other side of the tunnel or a network issue.
The only thing that has changed on the server initiating the RDP connection is that it now runs file services sharing a folder.
Remote desktop has been working fine with no problems then recently I noticed it was working for ONE server over the VPN which it previously had done.
