If running launching VSCode like this fixes your issue.
Thanks in advance for any help to fix this problem.
I am having a problem with monokai theme which I always used.
This sounds like you are having an issue with one of your installed extensions.
you should open it again normally, and one by one, disable all of your extensions until you find the one that is causing the issue.
For instance, with light(vs), dark(vs) and dark+ I don't have this issue whereas monokai, quiet light and red has this problem.
EDIT: And one more thing to mention, there is the 1-2 seconds lag of loading this reddy and annoying stuff while opening a new window with a new script.
I am facing a problem where most of my keywords and brackets are turned into red and become impossible to highlight.
This issue does not appear with some other themes.
You could try to run VSCode from cmd/terminal using this command: code --disable-extensions [path_to_file] and see if you are still having these issues.
If this issue is caused by the monokai theme only I suggest you raise it as an issue with the developers of the theme.
The program also got very slow(freezes while scrolling through the code) and crashed while I was writing this post.
I think this thing, whatever it is, is loading after the theme is loaded.
