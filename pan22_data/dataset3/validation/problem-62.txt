Is there a way to have Server 2012 lookup this address automatically?
So for example the DNS record on the DC would be set to 192.168.1.2 mx.foo.com and the one on godaddy would be 173.12.58.1 mx.foo.com.
I have DNS records setup on the DC for a few sites that we want to have the internal IP different than the external IP.
This works fine but the problem I am having is if I make a new DNS record on godaddy the Domain Controller won't resolve the address until it is manually added.
So if I add new.foo.com pointing to 173.25.24.2 on godaddy the users on the Domain Controller won't be able to resolve new.foo.com unitl I add it to the Domain Controller.
I have added godaddy's nameservers as the SOA and as the NS in the DC but it still doesn't resolve records from the godaddy.
I have a windows server 2012 R2 box running as my domain controller and I am having some trouble with DNS.
Right now if I add a DNS record in godaddy anyone that is using the Domain Controller as their DNS server will not be able to resolve the url until I add it to the Domain Controller.
I am sure this is an easy answer but I can't find anything on google for it.
