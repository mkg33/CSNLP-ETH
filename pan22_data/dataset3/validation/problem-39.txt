Your servers second NIC will need an IP of 192.168.1.2 with a mask of 255.255.255.0.
Then do the following as detailed in the instuctions on page 13.
In case you are interested to know about the PDU I'm talking about, here is the spec - http://www.apcmedia.com/salestools/ASTE-6Z6KAJ_R0_EN.pdf
If you're hooking it straight into the server, you'll need a cross over cable and you'll need to statically configure the IP address of that NIC to be on the same subnet as the PDU.
With that being said, the best way to do it, is plug your PDU into a switch.
I forgot to look it up, and the facility is pretty inaccessible).
I have poor knowledge about networking, so apart from answering to the point which would fix my problem, I would appreciate if you could please elaborate your suggestions.
So if the pdu's IP is 192.168.1.1 with a mask of 255.255.255.0.
I have a metered APC Power Distribution Unit (PDU) which is capable of spewing out the current load, power and such information through a LAN cable.
I'm connecting the cable from the PDU to a server node that I have access to.
My intention is to get the info that the PDU is sending via HTTP.
I assume that the device would take up any IP address within a range, so how do I ping the device without knowing the MAC address (would some kind of trial and error work?
