Also, you didn't specify your Oracle version and patch level.
There isn't any reason to use RELATIONAL in a query but there is also no reason for it to fail.
Googling for 'SELECT * FROM RELATIONAL' only returned questions related to ORA-01555.
We recently got some errors in our alert log of the form
I believe this was a deprecated alias to today's TABLE function for pipelined functions, but now I can't find my reference that says this.
The line below "ORA-01555 caused by SQL statement below " is the SQL Statement causing the UNDO to swap.
So, my question is: What is the meaning of the RELATIONAL keyword here?
How log does the offending query run before it fails?
I think this is just an issue of a long running query, which is being exposed by the ORA-01555 error while internally using a query hint, which is undocumented.
So RELATIONAL is not an Oracle thing, it is an object created by a user.
Most tables are RELATIONAL, and that's the default.
ORA-01555 usually means your UNDO segments are not sufficient to handle the rate of change in your database.
I know how to handle ORA-01555 errors, but I never encountered something like SELECT * FROM RELATIONAL.
However, Oracle also supports OBJECT tables (see the syntax on in Oracle's CREATE TABLE docs), which explains the reason for the internal syntax.
According to this blog article the specific hint RELATIONAL instructs the Query Optimizer to
I tested this on XE 11 and found that it does nothing.
A second article in the Oracle Community states that
Or is your real question, "How do I track down the SQL that caused this error?"
You should focus on the general fixes for ORA-01555.
I looked in DBA_OBJECTS, but there is no such function/operator/whatever.
