On the client-site, being logged-on as an user with restricted rights and having the user account control (UAC) activated on the highest level, you can run an application with administrative privileges by right-clicking onto it and choosing “Run as administrator”.
That also means that you don't have to manage local accounts on each PC.
On XP-machines you simply had to type in “Administrator” for the username.
or localhost doesn't work, but I'm sure there is one somewhere.
Is there a registry setting or a good workaround that lets you authenticate as administrator without having to enter the hostname for the machine, but not using tools like "RunAsSPC" or "Steel RunAs"?
When you want to authenticate to the local computer, you can use a dot instead of the hostname.
Since we run Windows 7-clients in our windows-server domain I have a specific use case that has become more inconvenient:
How about creating a domain account and/or group that has administrative access to the client PC's and login as that account.
Administrator) in order to authenticate as local administrator.
when your going to do this, you should use and administrator user.
This doesn't make the issue go away entirely, but at least it prevents you from having to look up hostnames since .
I guess it depends on exactly what your usage scenario is.
As a domain member you now have to enter your full hostname with a backslash following and the user name with administrative privileges (e.g.
Or if the point is to give your users admin access on their own PC's you could just add their domain account as an administrator to the client PC.
That makes administration more inconvenient if you run various Windows-7 clients in a company, because you always have to lookup the hostname for the machine on which you want to run something with administrative privileges.
After that, a popup window is shown and asks for the username and password.
Or depending on your access you can always login as a domain admin, who will have admin rights on client PC's.
You can also, look for the location folder of that application and add the user in the security  of the folder, to allow all access.
