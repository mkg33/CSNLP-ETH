Example: If you could plant everything in FarmVille the first minute.
However, there are plenty of options for making a peaceful game.
For some people that's not really that compelling, for others it's all that matters.
How to make a game successful is not something that can be answered.
Most games try to tell a story and violence is the easiest way to archive that.
You don't need to tell a story to make a game (a good story adds a lot the atmosphere though).
Mystery: Keeps the player curious to what comes next.
I think games are very much like movies in a sense.
You progress your game by the types of this you've created instead of how many kills you've scored.
People do tend to relate game playing to violent video games, but there are actually far more games that are not violent.
Getting rewarded in a game activates the brains reward mechanism, which can get physically addictive, just like a drug.
Your game should be fun with or without violence, so think about that first and then think about violence.
Now what you have to do is to decide what kind of a game you want to create, and based on that decide how you can implement all three of these mechanics to your game.
Scoreboard: In today's society where everyone is judged by everyone this seems to give players alot of satisfaction, even when the only benefit is to showoff/brag.
Also, collaboration (in conflict or not) is more rewarding to players on the long term.
The important point to understand is that it is good to have conflict in stories and games, but conflict does not mean fighting, war, killing or things like that.
For example a shooter could also be about a guy running through a parcour where he needs to hit all the targets once.
This could be counted in the reward part aswell, but I decided to put them separate.
But "necessary" mechanics of any game, violent or peaceful are:
The core component of a game still is the game-play.
Also gamer's in general tend to want challenge and sometimes competition in games, which is not the case for movies.
Other than being at the right place at the right time with the right game.
Your reward in these games is zooming way out on your digital creation and feeling pride about how cool it looks.
The big difference between a game and a movie is the interactive part (obviously).
Peaceful games typically value creation over competition.
I'll end the post there since it got very long, I hope this helps you to decide what kind of a game you want to create.
These are three very basic mechanics that can be implemented into pretty ANY game.
Reward: Once they've reached this goal they need satisfaction for the work.
Achievements: People need to chase something to stay interested, a (peaceful) game that hands you everything you can get from the start would get boring very fast.
And for a movie to be good it doesn't have to be violent.
Conflict is necessary to build up tension, tension is required to make a compelling story.
