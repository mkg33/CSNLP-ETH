If you are not running an actual mail SERVER on the VPS ( as in, you are RECEIVING mail that people or machines send to it), you need not and should not open port 25 inbound.
And you should better "PermitRootLogin without-password" (read the manpage, that option does the opposite of what it sounds like!
If you are knowledgeable about general linux operation, find -perm 4000 -o -perm 2000 and analyze why these programs need to be setuid/setgid, and especially if they need to be for your purposes (eg if the only person ever changing a user password on the system is root or a root equivalent, the password changer binary needs no setuid.).
The "Zen" way is "if you do not want,need or understand it, then you do not install or run it."
BTW, the proper way to change perms on package managed files in debian/ubuntu is dpkg-statoverride, do not chmod stuff or updates might change it back unexpectedly.
Some of the other measures (heap on every security tool available :) might not be BAD, and might even be the better thing to do in the beginning, but will actually make your project high maintenance.
Anything that does not need to be there (that often includes ipv6 binding of some server daemons) at all you disable, anything that can be bound to localhost only you bind to localhost only.
The mail service will the most interesting target for misuse.
