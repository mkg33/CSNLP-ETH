I just got a computer from a friend, saying that it wasn't turning on anymore.
I "restarted" it a couple times, (restart, not power down) and everything seemed to work.
I've had problems like this with motherboards that have bad(bulging) capacitors.
Most likely the CMOS becomes randomly corrupted or has incorrect/incompatible memory settings that cause the system to be unable to boot.
I kept getting intermittent boots, but most of the time it would just do nothing.
What can I do to make it work again like it did the first time?
a couple cryptic error messages in white, and a message telling me to press F2 to continue, but other than that, fine, i booted into xp and it worked.
Once you get it working, you may need to update the bios or change some settings that are causing this intermittent problem to occur.
Wouldn't be a bad idea to change the CMOS battery as well - this sounds like a 10-year old computer.
Figure out how to reset the CMOS for this motherboard (usually a jumper) and go on from there.
I can shut it down and turn it back on using the power button, but that yeilds the same results.
When I finally shut it down there were two options "shutdown" and "shutdown and power off".
I've done some google searches, but nothing seems to fix my problem.
I chose shutdown, and it shut down and all the fans went quiet.
Now whenever I plug it in, it will automatically turn on and the fans will run all at 100% but nothing displays on the monitor.
So if anyone has a similar problem, i guess the moral is: reseat everything.
