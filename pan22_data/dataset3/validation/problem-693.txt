There's definitely a language barrier issue here -- the rest of this post is going to assume you installed MySQL and Apache through yum, not from source, and then yum update broke on you.
For example I have installed mysql and httpd, but when I'm trying to 'yum update' then yum throws error that package is available but not installed.
So, how can I update database of installed software?
If a package is available but cannot be installed, that usually means that one of its dependencies is faulty, which happens often if you have both the i386 and x86_64 versions of a package installed and you somehow end up with different versions.
Make sure your repos are loaded that have the mysql package you want
It sounds like you did it through source, in which case you won't be able to update it using the repository.
This is pretty messy, though, and really when you're in this state, it's time to start planning a reinstallation from scratch.
If you've got a system with files from packages installed but an out-of-sync RPM database, you can use rpm -ivh --justdb somepackage.rpm to update the RPM database without actually installing anything.
Once you get your dependency chain cleaned up, yum update should work normally.
