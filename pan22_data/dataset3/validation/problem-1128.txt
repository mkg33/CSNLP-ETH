(1) For 0/1-polytopes, the Hirsch conjecture is true.
I proved 1/poly(n) seperation for "dual-to-neighborly" polytopes.
The number of vertices will be like $n^{[d/2]}$ and the spectrual gap will be roughly 1 over this.
There is a conjecture by Mihail and Vazirani that the edge expansion of the graph of a 0/1-polytope is at least one.
In general it is not true: Consider two dual- to cyclic d-polytopes with n facets each and merge them along a vertex.
More information is described in a paper by Volker Kaibel.
One vertex can correspond to a lot of bases, and so the walk can stay at the same vertex if we perform a random walk over the bases.
For 0/1-polytopes (all vertex coordinates are 0 or 1), this is not known to be true.
(You can use d edges to separete the graph into two parts.
(This is the dual operation of gluing two polutops).

If we want to perform a random walk over the vertices, we need to have a procedure that gives a random adjacent vertex.
(2) When performing a random walk on the vertices of a polytope, we need to take care of possible degeneracy.
(This was my first shot at the polynomial Hiresch conjecture".)
