If you aren't familiar with editing the registry, I suggest you back it up first before attempting anything.
In either case there will be a check box for Always use the selected program to open this kind of file
As shown above, you just edit the (Default) key and place the path to your application inside double quotes then a space and followed by %1 inside double quotes as well.
You can find the extension at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.yourextension
If not, hold down SHIFT while Right-Clicking on the file and you will see hidden option.
For that, I'd have to go to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.rar on the Registry Editor.
That is WinRAR and it should be located on HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT as well.
If you see Open With sub-menu then the last option will be Choose Program.. which will allow you to browse for the executable to use.
If you see Open With... then selecting this will allow you to browse for the executable to use.
You can always approach it by going to the Registry Editor.
I hope this somewhat lengthy explanation can serve as a template for you to be able to easily remap your file extension to your newly updated executable.
Now we will go to the registry key that actually contains the application information.
When ever i select the program, it wont select anything.
I am not able to select default program for a file that uses same program exe name as it used previously, but now in different folder and thus different version.
I deleted the older program exe and now when i select new program it thinks its deleted and wont allow me to select the new one.
How do i force Windows XP to open with the program exe path i selected, and not smart-guess which program i meant?
As you can see on the screenshot below, the (Default) REG_SZ key points to WinRAR.
Right-Click on the file and depending on the file type you may already have an Open With... option or an Open With sub-menu
As you can see on the image below, under the WinRAR key, you can jump directly to shell\open\command.
Once you get the hang of this, it should be pretty easy from here-on out.
So it will be located under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\WinRAR.
