What we do is to restart the service that listens on port 8333.
There is also command line API for VMWare server - try command 'vmrun'
Another thing that you might want to check is that I had an SSL handshake error under firefox after installing the console plugin, it seems far happier when you use IE.
Annoyingly the command line API doesn't work when the webservice is not running correctly.
I can browse to https://server:8333/ and if I view source I can see that the page has loaded, but the redirection and browsing directly to https://server:8333/ui/ never finishes loading - just continually tries to load the page.
The logs are usually in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\VMware\VMware Server and in the individual virtual machine folders.
I am having an issue with VMWare Server 2 running on a Windows SBS 2008 host.
I'm not sure what logs to check or where I should go from here, but I need to get more VMs running on this server - any ideas?
this will allow you to connect to it via non ssl and no certificate issues ir ssl 2.0 configs in firefox
I have found that a problem with vmware server or with an individual machine can stop the interface from working.
