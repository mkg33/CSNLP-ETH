It was not anything to do with the configuration on Ubuntu or VMWare but was in fact the router itself.
traceroute outputs from another server elsewhere are as follows:
Power cycling the router solved the problem, and has solved the problem every time it has occured since then.
There is no firewall issue because the firewall configuration has not been changed, and all ip's were publicly available on the old hardware that has been powered off.
Not sure what the problem was exactly, but after i changed all the interfaces into virtual interfaces on eth0, shutdown, removed the extra nic's from the esxi virtual machine settings and booted up again it was all working.
the address ending in 252 is one that does not work
before the router everything works just fine no problems, all services can be used just fine.
using esxi i have assigned it 10 virtual nic's which are all connected to the same virtual switch.
It's arp table seems to have an extremely long lifetime.
each virtual nic has its own ip address which no other device on the network is using.
I am trying to get several ip addresses to be attached to a virtual server running ubuntu 10.04 on vmware esxi.
Just posting this so that anyone else who might find this situation may find some help.
public internet only one ip on the machine provides any services.
