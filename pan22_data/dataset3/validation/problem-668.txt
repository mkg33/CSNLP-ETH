If you have a policy that says that certain data won't be poked but your boss is asking you to, check one rung above him.
This all goes back to your acceptable use policy, specifically the expectation of privacy.
In our policies, there are clear statements to the effect that if IT need to at something to track down or fix a problem, that's allowed.
And since we don't have tons of free time, we'd probably find better tools to do this than having someone randomly looking in people's directories.
As others have said, the exact approach you should take to this depends on exactly how your AUP is written.
And unless you have a very small number of My Docs directories to check, having one person poke around probably isn't a good way to do it.
If the data stored on the company computers, then it is company data unless the company policies specifically says that the employee can store data on the machines which the company won't be looking at.
It might make more sense for the IT group to do some sort of auditing - search for files with names that indicate they're work-related, see how many files there are in the first place, whatever.
If his boss doesn't agree with you then you have two choices:
If you organization is like most I've worked with even if private use is allowed it isn't guaranteed to remain private.
That would be my response, especially in light of the fact that you have a policy allowing users to do this.
Have a meeting with the requester, your boss, HR, and Legal (if you have it.)
This is probably going to end up being one of those things that you have to do, even if you don't like it.
No matter what, you have to be cautious of pissing your boss off.
It's a matter of how strongly your policies imply My Docs will be private.
"we do have a policy allowing personal use of computers, subject to a number of restrictions of course."
That said be sure to follow whatever established chain of command you have for these kind of requests and be sure to document what you have done and why.
However, one thing that hasn't been mentioned is that if the goal is to check that there's no company data in My Docs, silently giving someone else access isn't necessarily the best way to meet that goal.
It really depends on how clearly your written policy is and what it expressly allows and disallows.
You are bound to follow the ACU just as much as the next person.
