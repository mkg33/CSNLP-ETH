I did this send a photo via Message, then saved the photo back to my phone libary
Just hold your finger on the photo on shown as the contact
If you sync iPhone in PC with outlook, you can extract the contact photos from outlook.
Than you can paste it in a Whatsapp chat to the Person you want to send it to.
If you're syncing your iPhone with Address Book on a Mac then you can edit the contact in Address Book, click on the image to select it and then copy it to the clipboard.
Then get someone else to screen shot it (while you're holding it zoomed out) and then crop it.
This is going to sound ridiculous, but i found the best way to do this is using two people.
Go to edit the image (as if you're going in to change it) and use your fingers to zoom out.
When you go to your contacts and than the person you want the picture from, just hold the circle with the picture in it and click copy.
If you send the picture over Whatsapp you can go to Whatsapp on your Pc over the browser and download the picture from there to your Pc.
