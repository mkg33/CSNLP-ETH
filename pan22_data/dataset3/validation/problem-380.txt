Otherwise, your only other option is to reconfigure your application to use another port.
I get back "start port 1025, Number of Ports 64510" on the systems using low ports and "Start port 49152, Number of ports 16384" on regular systems.
Note that you will lose functionality such as UPnP if you do this.
You can change dynamic port range used by Windows application by command:
Is there a way to instruct lsass.exe not to use port 5000?
Our custom windows application listens on port 5000.
Your only chance is disabling the SSDP service on the server.
This is supported by running the suggested commands
see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929851/the-default-dynamic-port-range-for-tcp-ip-has-changed-in-windows-vista
After a regular reboot, our application could no longer listen on port 5000, since lsass.exe (Local Security Authentication Server) wich runs as a Windows Service already started listening on 5000.
More than likely the default port range for your system has been altered from the standard 49152-65535 to the larger 1025-65535.

My guess is that systems with some enterprise grade software (exchange, SQL, etc.
), the default port range gets increased from the standard 49152-65535 to a larger range (1025-60000?)
This is done sometimes when certain applications are installed such as Microsoft Exchange or SQL Server.
They give commands to change the ports, though I don't know if there are consequences to changing it back when one of the special applications are running:
