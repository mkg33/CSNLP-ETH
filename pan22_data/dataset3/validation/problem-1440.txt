I'm guessing there is not, but might there be a way to set up a simple macro I could bind to a key combination to set my cursor to a default location, such as the center of the primary display?
You can create a shortcut to this command line and assign any hotkey to it.
but on the issue of finding your mouse you CAN turn on "pointer sonar" so your pointer will be  honed into when you press the control key.
I guess its plausible...but I dont know of any app that has this already programed, or how to program this myself
So, a little trial and error (and basic math) ought to give you a script which, when run, centers the mouse pointer.
Is there any Windows shortcut to reset the mouse position?
Using WMIC and Powershell (both of which should already be installed under Windows 7) this should be doable.
I have a three monitor set up on Windows 7 and I sometimes lose track of where my cursor is.
Turning on "Show location of pointer when I press the CTRL key" is one option.
(currently on a mac but I will try and get screen shots in a moment and edit it in)
This is especially useful if it is currently changed to some custom mouse pointer by an application, like a paint brush, that is harder to see.
and Powershell can set the mouse position (replacing <X> and <Y> with the actual coordinates):
There are a lot of other options for mouse cursor as detailed in the nircmd.chm file.
Using WMIC, you can get the screen width and height:
