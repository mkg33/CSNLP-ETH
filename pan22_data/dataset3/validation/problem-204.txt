One of the promises of Time Machine is that, in the event that your boot drive fails, you can replace it with a new, empty disk, boot from the DVD that came with the Mac, and restore the boot volume contents from the Time Machine backup disk onto the empty disk.
What I'm looking for is a testimonial from someone who has actually done it at least once, using one of these techniques or another one, and seen it work.
Further Googling has revealed an actual testimonial with instructions.
(E.g., if you created a bootable DVD with PGP WDE installed, what software did you use to make it?)
For Macs running Mac OS X 10.5 or later that are using Time Machine, the (local) Time Machine backup disk must also be encrypted.
There are several obvious sloutions that I've read about on the web, including:
Our entire organization requires PGP Whole Disk Encryption (WDE) to be used on all laptop and desktop computers.
I will leave this question open (rather than accepting my own answer) for some corroboration.
Unfortunately, in our case, since the Time Machine backup disk is also encrypted using PGP WDE, the boot DVD cannot read it and therefore cannot recover data from it.
Please also provide as much detail as you can for the technique that you used.
