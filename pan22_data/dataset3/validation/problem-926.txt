This addon has correctly solved this issue for me.
Apparently the youtube plugin depends on libgdata being installed, so if it doesn't work out of the box check that you have it installed.
I haven't made a user script for Youtube yet, as their pop-out player works fine for my needs, but it looks like there are a few other people that have made scripts to resize the video player on youtube.

Another option would be to use Totem which comes with a youtube plugin (the program called "Movie Player").
Using a userscript called YousableTubeFix (works on Chrome, Firefox and Opera) you can select your default video size and quality.
Finally, you have the option of downloading the video using flashgot and then watching it with any video player.
To read more about what it does and the option you're looking for, see my personal page.
If you don't care about comments this is IMO a much nicer way to browse youtube.
I have had similar issues with other video sites and found that using greasemonkey user scripts to resize the video player is a good solution.
Remember that some retarded people upload videos with huge black borders.
Moreover, if you are sure it's a youtube problem, consider switching to HTML5 and see if that solves the issue.
