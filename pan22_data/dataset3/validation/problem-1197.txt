We allready tried to remove the Compatibility Pack and Office XP, reinstalled Office but there was no change.
Check to see what Office XP patches WSUS knows about:  Updates--> All Updates, Search--> enter "Office XP" in the "text" search box.
Check that Office XP updates are requested:  Options--> Products and Classifications, ensure "Office 2002/XP" is check-marked.
PS: The Office XP has been installed from a compressed ISO, so no administrative installation point.
we got a bunch of boxes, running Windows XP and Office XP.
If that all lines up, then perhaps as the next troubleshooting test go back to one of the client machines and manually hit www.microsoftupdate.com and see what it offers for Office, as that may give some hints as to why the updates are not making it to the client(s).
First thing to check is ensure WSUS is actually getting the updates.
Our WSUS provides Office 2007 patches for these computers but no Office XP, e.g.
Since we installed the Office 2007 Compatibility Pack, Office XP does not get updates anymore.
