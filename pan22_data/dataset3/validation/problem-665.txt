Have been using it on the internal network hitting it from multiple internal workstations and it works great.
We can now send email from the applications, BUT the from address is "support@domain.com on behalf of emaildude@internal.local".
We have a couple applications that need to send email...and (of course) they do not support TLS.
BTW --- we have this trouble with an internal app running on Win7 AND with an external app that is hosted on Win2003.
Unfortunately, these applications are also third-party so we can't just break em open to add support for TLS.
Also using it on our cloud network that handles our public facing web sites...works great there too.
To work around this, we configured the IIS 6 SMTP service to relay mail to the new service.
We created a local domain user emaildude@internal.local and used these credentials in the applications.
1) Is there a way to get the from address to be simply "support@domain.com"?
We developed our own SMTP Proxy and have contributed it to the Open Source community:
The previous service allowed us to make SMTP connections without TLS.
