If a computer supports only IP packets up to 800 bytes size, it may tell the other computer that TCP segments of up to 700 bytes are supported, so the resulting IP packet will be less than 800 bytes long.
This packet will be fragmented on IP layer (layer-3) so it can be transmitted in fragments of let's say 500 byte size..
This happens completely on IP layer; TCP layer does not know that the IP packet of 2000 bytes size is fragmented.
Case 1: Layer-2 does not allow a frames of such a length
In the first packet of a TCP connection both computers involved in a connection can tell the other computer the maximum size of a TCP segment the computer is able to receive.
In this case the TCP layer (layer-4) simply cannot send segments of such a long size.
In some cases the sizes of IP packets may be restricted.
In this case an IP packet of 2000 bytes size (or whatever size is required) is built and the TCP segment is inserted into that 2000 byte IP packet.
(As an example there are some CGNATs allowing IP packets of limited size only.
