I can still connect to computers on the network via \\computer_name, but I cannot browse them in 'network' or in 'my network places'.

The computer browser service is not started on the DC, but I tried starting that and it had no effect.

However, the computers are not listed in the network browser on any of our computers (Win XP, Win7, Linux, etc) which are connected to the domain.
Our network computers are all connected to a domain, and I can see them if I search the active directory (I can click 'search active directory' and then select 'computers' and then Find Now, and all of the computers will appear).
All of the IPs on our local network are static IPs, although I can't see how that would make a difference.
DC currently has the firewall configured as 'off' to try to debug this problem.
Afterwards, you should be able to see all clients from all clients.
DC is running Windows Server 2008 (Windows Server Standard) with a configured DNS and DHCP server.
