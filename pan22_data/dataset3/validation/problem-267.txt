Using Process Explorer, you should be able to identify which process is consuming your CPU cycles and kill it.
Make sure you show processes from all users (File menu), since it could be a process started by another user or service.
The reason why your CPU stays at 30-40% when nothing is running, is because there is stuff running, its just in the background.
If you dont want to go downloading more software, Windows has software for sufficiently monitoring what using the systems resources.
You could see the process path name by selecting to view extra columns by selecting View/Select columns/ Image Path name field.
If you see items that don’t have an image path name, that’s because they are running from the windows directory, or somewhere in the system path.
All the the icons next to the time are different programs running that use CPU cycles and memory space.
At a basic level, you can use Windows Task Manager (CTRL + SHIFT + ESC), and use the processes tab to see what resources are being used by the system.
By using the tools listed above you can find what programs are causing the CPU to work, and then remove them if not needed.
If you need more detail, you can use the Resource Monitor.
Process Explorer from SysInternals can help to give you more information about what is going on in your system.
You can also sort them by what you want to check, for example if you want to know what is using the most memory, click the memory coulmn and it will sort the list by memory usage.
This works in a similar way to WTM with the tabs along the top, and clicking coulmns to sort, but gives much more data and information.
