At this stage you may adjust the margins added to the content box.
Here's what I ended up doing: I added a thin Header/Footer to every page with Adobe Acrobat Pro 9.
After you change the margin you want adjusted, click on Appearance options and select "Shrink document to avoid overwriting the document's text and graphics."
The same dialog will open, but this time you have the old margins to compare before cropping.
Click on Tools > Pages > Header & Footer > Add Header & Footer.
Below is the content of its wiki page Page Layout:
Go to Tools > Pages > Crop, select random area on the file and double click it.
You can either move over any solid line, be it an inner or outer edge, or set the margins through numerical values.
There's an option in the Header/Footer dialog that compresses the contents of every page to make space for the header/footer, which is exactly what I wanted.
My workaround was to open the pdf in illustrator and do some artboard magic on a 160-page document.
This is one big page causing the soft margins in all the other pages, if only for not leveling them off.
Optional alignment is precisely defined, add a soft margin, and if you add, then with any of the parts.
These margins are automatically added to bring the page size to the same size of other pages.
Soft margin - is that between the solid and the dotted line.
You can use ScanTailor for a powerful tool for scanned books.
You can definitely increase the page size: Go to the Document menu -> Crop Pages and put a larger size in the Change Page Size section.
If you see a dotted line - this means that somewhere in the project there is a page with that width (usable area of Hard + margin), and (possibly others) with that height.
Super weird that Acrobat doesn't support negative margin numbers in the crop.
To increase margins in Acrobat Pro, first you have to ... crop it.
I needed to shift down the text on a 109-page pdf so it would print to labels.
In the Set Page Boxes dialog first you change the page size to a larger, then set all crop margin to zero (the Margin Controls might be shaded after step 1, just change the option to a random one).
