If you get no beeps or on-screen messages, The root cause is almost certainly a failed CPU (somewhat unlikely) or a failed mainboard (very likely).
He states explicitly "in order to get to the BIOS".
There are specialized OSes for embedded use that run entirely out of a ROM (read only memory.)
As for the original question about a memory test, if the computer will POST (i.e.
It tests the first 64KB of RAM, loads itself into that RAM, then test the rest of your system memory as thoroughly as you'd like.
If the laptop is so broken it won't even get into BIOS, everything else is pointless.
Only with a growing mountain of failures and intense negative feedback from users did the manufacturers begin to improve things.
make it past the Power On Self-Test and attempt to boot) then Memtest86 is designed specifically to test your RAM.
I have not seen a PC that will boot without RAM though.
You would need at least on chip cache for registers (essentially a very small amount of on-chip RAM) so that the CPU execution unit could function.
To do anything useful, though, you still usually need at least a small amount of RAM.
If I read the question correctly everybody here is barking up the wrong tree.
After all, the devices would test and burn in just fine, only to fail months or years later, after any warranty had likely expired.
Your assumption that the memory is bad is likely invalid.
"Flakey" memory (as opposed to just plain bad memory) is uncommon, but I have seen Memtest86 catch a intermittently bad bit that the computer's memory test missed (after all, the POST memory test is meant to complete in a reasonable length of time, while memtest86's fastest test runs 5-10 minutes, with more comprehensive tests taking hours.)
No Von-Neumann OS has been designed without the requirement of memory I believe.
On such a laptop, having the mainboard re-flowed to rectify the cold solder joints is almost certainly cost prohibitive.
You can't boot ANY OS on this regardless of the RAM situation.
Many component manufacturers weren't very willing to spend the money to upgrade their processes.
Manufacturing techniques had been optimized for using lead-based solder and the industry took a while to catch on and resolve the issues.
Mainboards fail with age all the time due to cold solder joints, which were a common occurrence in the early days of the ROHS movement and the requirement to use lead-free solder.
