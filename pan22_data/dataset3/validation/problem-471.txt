Otherwise, it seems as if you've gone through a lot of software already; I'm not sure if any other software would really do the trick.
Try recording the SWF file while it is playing with Screenr and download the video that is created.
I don't know how well it works, but you can give it a try.
Maybe another file format would work better with the software you tried.
Anyone know of a good, free tool for this task on Windows 7?
I've been searching on the web for tools (online and desktop) to convert SWF files to WMV.
They either crashed or couldn't handle SWF-to-WMV conversion.
Make sure you're not playing any other music/sound effects while recording it.
If the SWF contains video, FFMPEG can do this, as can DeskShare's Digital Media Converter Pro.
Some tools I've tried: MediaCoder, Format Factory, SWF Decompiler (kept freezing up), and File Wiggler (online tool).
If the SWF contains Flash animation, you'll need to use screen recording software as @skoshy suggested.
(Discolosure: I am a former DeskShare employee, but have no current financial relationship with them.)
The trial version converted .swf to .wmv, but only if it was 3 minutes or less in length.
Instead, you could try screen-recording the SWF files while they are playing.
Another option you could try is using Google's new lab, Swiffy.
We don't have the original FLA files anymore, and these SWF contain how-to software instructions.
