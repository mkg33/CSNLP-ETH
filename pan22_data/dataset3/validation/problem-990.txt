You are creating "In theory" a bridge between two main VLANs.
A: This is like haveing the same VLAN name on two different networks.
I am not sure but logically it would be confusing.
A: I cant think of a reason for doing so except for the 'P' port which you will need to do on at least one port/SVI.
I would like to know if it is possible to map the private VLAN to both our access and voice SVIs.
In our environment, we run our computers inline with Cisco IP phones to our switch.
On top of that, is it possible to have our access and voice "layer 2" VLAN statements associated with the same private VLAN?
Q: Is it possible to have our access and voice "layer 2" VLAN statements associated with the same private VLAN?
Check this link for a great explaination on private VLANs.
Q: Can I assign the physical ports to have multiple private VLAN associations?
The problem is that our phones are on a separate VLAN from our normal access traffic.
Q: It is possible to map the private VLAN to both our access and voice SVIs?
Even if these two queries are possible, is can I assign the physical ports to have multiple private VLAN associations?
Technically it would not make the private VLAN part of two main VLANs but it might be against the allowed configuration to have the same name for two private VLANs on the same switch.
