Start by checking that both certs actually are the same
You could subsequently use vimdiff to compare them, or any other diffing tool.
Just to be clear, I want to compare the attributes, I know the signatures won't match due to them being issued at different times.
The reason I want to do this is I have 2 certificates, seemingly with the same properties, but one works and the other one doesn't.
If these both came from the same csr, then the md5 will match.
One guess is that if you included the proper domain names, did you also include them as 'subject alternative name'?
You can check your csr also to ensure that it matches your private key and cert.
Your both certificates can be fully identical (without serial number and issue date), but one is working successfully and another doesn't.
Check the certs against the private key as follows to ensure the cert and private key match up:
What is the best way to compare two SSL certificates?
If one cert works and the other does not, then my first suspect is that both certs did not originate from the same private key.
It may be because the serial number of another certificate is listed in CRL(certificate revocation list).
