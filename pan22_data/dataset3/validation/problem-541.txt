Partition Magic, though you have to pay for it, sounds like it would be the ideal tool for this situation.
Lenovo may not like it if they need to make a repair.
I have never tried your specific situation, so I do not know if it will work as you want it, but it has worked with merging partitions that are next to each other before.
Move the Lenovo partition to the front or back of the free space.
If you don't want to pay for Partition Magic, I'd recommend GParted.
Not worth it, the partition has only 15 megabytes, not gigabytes.
Nuking them could wreak havoc on one of your Lenovo installed utils.
I feel it has gone downhill since Norton acquired it oh so many years ago.
I've used it successfully several times on both Linux & Windows boxes...
My preference these days is Acronis Disk Director [1].
Also, if your laptop is under warranty, be careful about making partition changes.
I'd highly recommend defragging your hard drive before shuffling partitions around though.

You also want to make sure the other partitions do not serve any other purpose.
