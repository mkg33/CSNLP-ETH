Unfortunately the provided content processor automatically renames file to give it a WMV extension - so you'd have to provide a replacement processor.
All that the XNB file contains is a filename that points to that WMV file (plus some metadata for the Video object).
If it's multiplayer, then maybe they'll be able to see something before they get there, but then, they could just ask a player who's already been there.
You could perhaps just give it a sneaky extension (eg: "myVideo.dat") to hide it from end users.
I think when it comes down to it, short of writing your own codec or something, if a user wants to view the videos, they'll do it.
If this is a single player game and they player chooses to ruin it for themselves by watching the video early, then so be it.
This will then only require "hiding" the video URL, although it won't work if your players are offline.
When you reach certain progress points, they pull a (YouTube) video off the web and stream it in-game, and life is good.
The XNA video player component is very much an opaque box that only plays loose WMV files.
I'm not 100% sure if you can pull this off in XNA and MonoGame though.
For the most part though, I don't think "regular" players will be mucking about in the game's install directory.
Again, players were pretty  much guaranteed to have internet connectivity at that time.
The content processor (VideoProcessor) is responsible for copying the WMV file along side the XNB file at build time.
Just make a great game that they'll want to keep playing to see the new videos.
