An alternative is to look at the possibility of using FreeBSD over Linux as
It's actively developed now that the OpenSolaris project's fate is unknown.
See: http://nexenta.org/projects/site/wiki/WhyNexenta
The Nexenta Community edition is a good appliance-like implementation which leverages ZFS features and provides an excellent GUI.
ZFS is the best think that SUN (Oracle) release, but I think that for next 5 years we will have no Solaris 11 and development will be brojken.
One negative to using the zfsonlinux port is that an ubuntu kernel update (which could happen) would mean recompiling and linking it back into the kernel again.
I'm not willing to use FUSE or a pre-beta kernel to get ZFS.
I originally went with ZFS because I heard so many awesome things about it:
Maybe Oracle will GPL ZFS since that was their reason for starting the btrfs project.
FreeBSD supports most of the usual open source software like Apache, PHP, MySQL etc.
Btrfs has potential feature parity, but it's still not stable even now (months after I first looked into it).
I know Fedora/CentOS and Debian/Ubuntu far better, and I'm used to the Linux way of doing stuff vs the Solaris/BSD version.
After poking at OpenSolaris for a while, it really bugs me.
I want to switch to Linux, but I don't know what to use for my FS.
I've been keeping a close eye on it, but I'm not expecting it to be production stable for a couple years considering the time it took for ZFS to get there.
It's hardware support may not be as wide although I've not had issues on that front before.
What do you recommend as an equivalent of ZFS (desired features noted above) for a Linux box?
I'm running OpenSolaris with ZFS for my main fileserver.
FreeBSD has supported ZFS since 2007 so is likely to be more mature than the Linux port.
The Nexenta core is a stripped-down variant that's essentially a more usable OpenSolaris.
And also I think that Solaris development team will be history for future.
I suspect the open source projects based on Open Solaris will be stable sooner.
As far as I know, btrfs is the only project that will provide ZFS equivalent features.
They run the same software and only differ on some minor sysadmin things like where configuration files are stored.
I consider the comment on the "Linux way of doing stuff" interesting because I consider all the Unix-style platforms essentially equivalent.
