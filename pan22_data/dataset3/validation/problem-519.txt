Unless your brother's work has special requirements, all you need to do is set up a VPN connection on his computer (Windows has a built-in VPN Network Connection - or you can use a 3rd party VPN client).
Now my brother needs to access his work network, so we've added a VPN router.
That will allow anything connected to the VPN router to be on the VPN while everything on the Gigabit router will remain on your home network.
If your brother merely needs to connect his own PC to his work network, you do not need the VPN router.
This will allow just his computer to be on the VPN while the rest of your network can remain on your ISP.
It's quite possible it's routing all of your traffic through his workplace connection.
My connection has slowed down a lot and constantly cuts out.
Before I had a modem connected to a wireless N gigabit router, wired to my PC.
Is the new router filtering my connection or what?
If you still want to utilize the VPN Router (so that your brother can automatically be on the VPN every time he hooks up to it), connect your Modem > Gigabit Router > VPN Router.
The modem is now connected to that, which is connected to the older router, which is wired to my PC.
The VPN router you got is for connecting an entire network to a VPN.
