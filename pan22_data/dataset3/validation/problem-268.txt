In the end, it's all a matter of style and what you're used to.
Ubuntu is a lot more popular with desktop users, while Redhat-based systems are significantly more common on servers.
Someone trying to claim that one is definitively better than the other is just trolling on their own bias.
Ubuntu uses the Debian system, while Fedora uses the Redhat system.
It'll probably be easier to find a lot more assistance with the day-to-day stuff on Ubuntu, while the RedHat connoisseurs tend to be fewer but have more in-depth knowledge (since they usually manage servers).
I also think that the software on Redhat-like systems is a bit more consistent, while the same software on Debian-like systems tends to more closely follow the philosophy and intentions of the original developer.
In general, Ubuntu and Fedora have more recent packages, but a faster release cycle, while Debian and Redhat (or Centos) have a slower rev cycle but consequently older software.
In other words, Redhat is more likely to modify the way things are arranged to try to make it easier on you.
I find the RPM/yum system (used by Redhat derivatives) to be simpler and easier to learn than the dpkg/apt/synaptic system (used by Debian derivatives), though the Debian system I think is more capable.
