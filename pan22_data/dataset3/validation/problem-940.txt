For example, root has full access to all files on the system, not matter what their permissions are.
You can use super user for your daily use, but this is highly discouraged.
For instance, if you try to copy a file you don't have read access to, the Finder will require you to authenticate before copying the file.
It is generally a bad idea to log in as root, so by default the account is disabled (and mostly hidden).
This is a security feature (Least Privilege) that is by design.

click a padlock icon and authenticate) to enable that access.
I have run across several installation guides which recommend using the sudo command.
Part of the confusion you're running into is the terminology.
On the mac, the user you use to log in is by default not the super user (root) account.
No you are not the only user, your are running as a normal user, for security reasons.
Along with that security model, sudo is a tool that is provided to allow regular (non-root) users to perform root tasks on a case by case basis.
I only have 1 user account on my mac, shouldn't I be the admin user by default?
In OS X, there are 3 main levels of account privilege you'll run into:
rm -rf /*, this will remove all the files on your HDD, even the system)
This prevents a whole host of issues, not the least of which is royally screwing up your machine by accident.
The sudo command is another example of this -- it allows administrators to promote themselves temporarily to root.
From what I can tell, the sudo command allows you to run a command as an administrator.
Administrator: this is the type of account you have; it's allowed to make system-wide changes, but usually has to do something special (i.e.
This roughly corresponds to what you're probably calling "Administrator".
There's also sort-of a fourth category: managed accounts are standard accounts that have "parental controls" applied to them.
Standard user: no special privileges, not allowed to mess with (most) system-wide settings or bypass access restrictions.
Imagine you downloaded a virused program and run it as administrator, all your system may be damaged.
But if you run it as normal user, only your  home directory may be infected, not the whole system.
It also prevent you from doing some dangerous tasks by fault(eg.
root (aka the superuser, System Administrator, or System): this is a specific account (not just a type of account), and is generally all-powerful.
