You should look there to troubleshoot your configuration (and maybe append the errors from the logs to your question to give us the possibility to help you).
I want to give remote access to my postresql db (8.2) to computers that are at the same lan, at the default config I have added this line to pg_hba.conf where xxx.xx.xx.xx is the ip of the machine that hosts postgresql.
You could also try connecting locally, by specifying the server's ip address.
Essentially I believe that means it allows the host to connect with any user versus password which takes a cleartext password.
If it's authentication, you may want to try the md5 method (s/password/md5/).
Error messages should be logged in your application eventlog.
pg_hba applies the first rule to match, so your second line is never used.
It looks like the only significant difference is instead of 'password' in the hba conf it is 'trust'.
The next thing I'd suggest is to try adding a single IP address for a specific host and try connecting.
There no firewall or such blocking the connection between and `listen_addresses = '*' for postgresql.conf .
I did it on a linux system, but the procedure sounds similar.
