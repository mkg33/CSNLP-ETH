So am learning the command line, and one utility (perhaps the only one) which seems to be absent is being able to write to a file.
emacs (or even vi for that matter) is often overkill for editing simple configuration files.
To be honest am quite surprised, I would of though that this would of been quite rudimentary.
Most *nix systems support a few CLI text editors, the most common of which is vi and vim.
See here (and google for about a thousand others) for a tutorial on vi.
Not a Mac expert but since MacOS is largely unix these days I imagine it will be the same.
Another really common one, especially for programmers is emacs.
This will append to the file: echo "some text" >> someFile.txt

Specifically mac, but for future reference for those that come across this post, this could be on any OS.
Personally, I prefer pico or nano because they don't use mode sequences, but I'm not certain that they are available on Macs by default.
This will overwrite to the file: echo "some text" > someFile.txt
I've done a search on google of course, as well as SU, though there doesn't even seem to be anything related to what am seeking, so now am here.
CLI Text editors are kind of strange when you are used to GUI tools, so take your time in learning them, and focus on when to use each one.
