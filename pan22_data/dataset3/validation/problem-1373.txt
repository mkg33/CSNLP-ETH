Then all the terminals I open in that workspace open in that directory.
Of course this only work if the folder you want to join is a folder where you often go.
It should work on most Unix-like OSes granted you tweak your logic for extracting CWD from PID.
Usually the command j is associated with autojump.
Every time you cd in a folder, it increase the associated likelihood.

You could use the X window id from withWindowSet and query xprop for PID, from which to extract CWD.
When I press that key a prompt pops up that allows you to set the directory (with working tab completion).
I've been using this approach for some time now (with success), on a Linux machine.
That doesn't really answers your question, but I have an alternative that can save your time and solve your problem: autojump
For example on my system it has now something like:
Then afterward, when you want to go in a folder, you can give only a part of the name and it will go to the most probable folder that corresponds.
