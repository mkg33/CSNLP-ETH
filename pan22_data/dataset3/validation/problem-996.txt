However, I decided to install telnet as it can be useful in testing.
Its too late but I also face this problem currently and I solved this by.
With HOST=LOCALHOST you are guaranteed consistency with regards the ip address settings between system reboots when it comes time that the listener service starts up.
reason being that if your on a wireless network you can get assigned different ip addresses after every reboot which invalidates your listener settings if using a fixed ip address in your listener.ora file.
Chased my tail so much yesterday that I never thought to review the iptables file - /slap head!
I had tried to login, from the remote computer, and that is where I got the TNS:no listener error.
While doing so, I noticed that a command I had executed at the command line to open a port to iptables was not there.
I had tried the telnet test before, but as I did not have telnet installed and running on the server, that test was not helpful.
I'm working on a Mac, and the instant client doesn't include the tnsping utility.
So I updated that file and now everything is working.
