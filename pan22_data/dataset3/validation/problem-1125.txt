This link to Cisco is a pretty good overview of NAT.
In some cases it can also involve layer 7 (application).
A one to many NAT needs at minum to modify the IP addresses (layer 3), IP checksums (layer 3), TCP/UDP ports (layer 4) and TCP/UDP checksums (layer 4).
Think about how this has to be consistent across packets from the same device... at least within sessions.
Lower layers might not know anything about higher layers, but higher layers can know and manipulate the lower.
You could argue, therefore, that you should place this at level 5 or even higher.
If you use PAT you could argue that it is working at layer 4 as well because it MIGHT change the source port of the packet in case it is not unique.
Most NATs will therefore go beyond the basics and also perform translation and tracking of at least some IP addresses in application data (layer 7).
Such a minimal NAT will break many things (for example active-mode ftp).
A one to one NAT needs at minimum to modify the IP addresses (layer 3), IP checksums (layer 3) and TCP/UDP checksums (layer 4).
NAT works at layer 3 because it is modifying the IP header.
Mapping between addresses, even if the addresses are at level 3 instead of level 7, seems a very presentation-layer thing to do.
Just because it reaches down to modify IP headers shouldn't disqualify it from consideration from the higher layers.
So the port will only be modified in case it is not unique.
It involves at least layers 3 (IP) and 4 (TCP, UDP, etc).
