Apache, Nginx, IIS should write the IP of the user who access to the web.
You can customize filebeat for Apache, with your filebeat.yml looking like:
Processing the logs of your server is the easiest way.

I'm fairly new to the Linux environment and my knowledge in Linux administration is limited.

Good day everyone, we have a web based POS PHP program hosted on a VPS.
Since you're looking to process your Apache access logs, filebeat is something you may want to look into to connect to Logstash (should you want to go with the ELK solution previously suggested), example of file here.

You can use ELK ( Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana ) log monitoring process to monitor your server logs.
Aside from updating our program to include a function that will record the IP of a user whenever he/she logs in, can you guys recommend any Linux software/tools that can monitor daily server activity, specifically one that can record IP address, date and time whenever a user accesses our server via http or our web program?
I already contacted the tech support of our VPS and they replied that it is the responsibility of the administrator to install software/tools to monitor server activity and logs.
In your logstash configuation, /etc/logstash/conf.d/12-apache.conf you can add the following filter:
Our program has a function that records date and time but not the IP used by the user to login to the program.
I have access to our Linux server which is running Centos 5 OS, is there a way to get the history of IP addresses that connected to our server through http or our web based program on the specific date and time the data was encoded through netstat command or any software/tools?
