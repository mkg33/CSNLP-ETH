It's taken from the Kernel-Mode Code Signing Walkthrough, v1.1c, page 24.
To use the BCDEdit tool to enable the boot configuration test-signing option
The test-signing boot configuration option must be manually enabled before the kernel can verify test-signed drivers.
Step 2: Enable the Kernel-Mode Test-Signing Boot Configuration Option
When the BCDEdit option for test-signing is enabled, Windows Vista does the following:
All I know is, that I need to switch Windows into test mode, but how do I do that?
The other alternative is to install a 3rd-party tool, to temporarily override the signature enforcement, but I don't really want that.
It refers to Windows Vista as Windows 7 hadn't been released at the time of writing.
Test-signed kernel-mode software cannot be loaded on a default Windows Vista system.
FreeOTFE comes with many drivers for various encryption algorithms, that need to be installed.
I'm trying to install FreeOTFE on 64bit Windows 7.
Windows gives me the error, that since those aren't signed drivers, they won't be installed.
How do I turn those signature checks off, and back on?
Note: BCDEdit is the new boot configuration editor and is included with Windows Vista and later versions of Windows.
