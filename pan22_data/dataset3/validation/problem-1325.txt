If the two networks really are not connected by other means, in order to expose the router from one to other, you'll need to expose it to the Internet.
Not trivial, but it can be done using VPNs (although I personally never managed to get a VPN working the way I wanted, maybe it's too hard, maybe I'm too stupid).
In TCP/IP context, that means one more opened port (what your printing protocol is using) on one public IP address (that of router B).
I want to share the printer on the other network and block the internet flowing to the other.
This means that to outside world, all computers in the LAN (including printer) share IP address of the router.
I would recommend, however, setting up a ZeroTier network and connecting the computers you want to it.
It will automatically create a LAN between them, and will allow you to set rules to limit the way traffic flows between these computers.
Have two LANs with separate routers with internet connections which are not connected together and have setup a wireless printer on one network.
I'll call the network without the printer A an the other one B.
Note that "block the internet flowing" is a different question, which IIUC can be achieved by setting up firewall on router A to talk only to router B.
Obviously this is a potential security risk, so the least you'll need to do is to set up firewall on router B to limit access to this port to certain single IP address: that of router A.
I assume you're using home routers with NAT, which is the most common case.
Regarding the exposing, you can either set up port forwarding in the NAT so that users from network A will connect to the printer directly using the router B's public IP address, or, if your it has that option, set up router B as a printing server, which could help with additional security.
Other, probably more secure solutions include using SSH tunnel (insttead of port forwarding) or a VPN to connect the whole networks tohether.
