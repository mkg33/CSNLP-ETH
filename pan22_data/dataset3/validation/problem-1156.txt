Meanwhile I had no problems with 32 bit 8.04 on another system.
Maybe this is all fixed, or was all fixed, or maybe there was an issue with my very early 64 bit hardware (socket 754), or maybe me.
Some folks said they fixed it, I tried all the fixes and never could get a Java app to launch from Firefox (64 or 32 bit firefox and/or Java).
It was enough that when I updated to 9.04 on that system I went back to 32 bit.
There were terrible problems with triangle of Web applications, Java and Firefox.
Make sure ia32-libs is installed and you should be all set.
I've been running 64 bit Linux Red Hat servers for 5 years now with no problems running 32 bit java apps under Firefox.
The much advertised advantes of 64bit software are mostly skin deep now, even years later.
Most of the issues that were plaguing 64 bit linux installs have been resolved for the most part, however if you are looking for a performance boost you will not find it by moving to a 64bit userland.
Unless there are specific applications you use which you think would benefit from more addressable ram, or 64bit copy operations / addressing, I would recommend sticking with 32bit.
Debian and Ubuntu have good compatibility solutions for 32-bit stuff these days, and since it's they provide free software in a huge repository of applications compiled for your 64-bit version, you're just about in the best place you can be to have optimised software for your 64-bit hardware.
Check graphic drivers compatibilities (especially if you are planning on using the ATI / NVidia closed source packages) or any other closed source drivers / software you may use.
Hopefully this issue has been fixed, and by fixed, I do not mean an elaborate work-around as published for 8.04 64bit, but fixed on install.
