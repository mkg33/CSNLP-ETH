(3) No - you're abstracting your hardware when you run the VM system.
I prefer VMware out of familiarity, but you can do some serious homework and read up on the performance differences here.
Use a VM for simple tasks that are just not compatible with OSX, or boot natively into Windows as necessary.
The basic rule is it'll be faster to run windows natively if you care.
Look up one on the difference between type 1 and type 2 hypervisor if you're really interested.
(1) like all competition, both sides have a great deal to offer.
I use rEFIt or else I often forgot to hold the button at boot up.
I think we've explained all you need to figure out in here - now it's time to implement and use it.
(5) If you define "this" clearly, there could be documentation out there for it.
So you'll have to reboot, hold Option and choose the OS you want to use.
(4) Make sure to install any OSX drivers in the Windows size of things to make it feel pretty.
(2) The only frustration is the fact you have to reboot to run either OS natively.
I prefer 95% of the time to live in OSX, but that 5% is pretty damn important.
Performance will not be as good, but convenience is there.
