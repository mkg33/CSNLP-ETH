But you can still start a program by specifying its full path.
Open the .profile again either by temporarily restoring paths (see section 2) or by specifying the full path.
It can be as simple as having a ; instead of an :.
This part of your problem was happening to me, so what I did was:
2) Editing bash_profile by typing /usr/bin/open ~/.bash_profile -a TextEdit
This is only temporaily for the open shell, but it will make recovery much easier.
Thirdly, lets try to find the error and permanently fix it.
3) When I opened my bash_profile file I realised the last line export looked really messy with some strange symbols, so I canged it entirely to export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
I just used the location where bash is on FreeBSD).
(adjust the path as needed, I have no idea where OS X stores bash by default.
Keep the known working (or known temporarily restored one) open and test in a second shell.
Secondly, you might not need to look up all the paths.
1) typing export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" into the terminal in order to make it temporarily working
Quoting your own post: export: /Users/Tom/ncbi-blast-2.6.0+/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/ncbi/blast/bin': not a valid identifier
Remove them (or uncomment by placing a # in front of them and then try to locate the error.
Other easy to miss things are spaces or non-printable characters.
/usr/local/bin/bash would still start bash, even if /usr/local/bin/ is not in your search path.
While editing this do not close your current shell.
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH
Which is good practice for any edits to your profile.
Three steps: First, you probably can run commands from the terminal.
I'm an absolutely beginner at this but I managed to get those steps by reading pieces of solutions from different questions on SE, so hope it could help someone else.
Setting a new path for your current shell should be as easy as typing export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" and pressing enter or return.
PS: The plus sign at the end of ncbi-blast-2.6.0+ in an unquoted string might be the case, but I got no OSX to test with.
