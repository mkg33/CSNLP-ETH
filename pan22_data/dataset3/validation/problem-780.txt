I have created two image files (.img) of my two Hard disks which were RAID0.
if you don't know the dev name of your disk, you can find out with fdisk -l.
I'd recommend you start with TestDisk, a partition recovery tool, which should be able to scan your media, identity the partitions, and write a new partition table for you.
2) Due to the RAID0 does it required MBR from both hard disks or just the first hard disk?
your MBR is stored on the first block of your disk, so you can grab it with dd (use a linux live CD if you are running windows).
The only correct MBR (List of partitions) are in my image files.
failing that, an Intel MBR is 512B long, with the bootstrap code occupying the first 446, and partition table info following.
Now I need to copy MBR bytes from my image files in order copy them to mentioned hard disks, because I have re-created the RAID0 in those hard disks and now their MBR has faild.
this is important if you want to restore it to a disk with an existing partition table that does not match the disk the MBR came from.
1) how can I Read and Copy MBR bytes from image files (.img)
Since you are using Raid0, be sure to check this howto for determining the physical order of the disks, and how to determine the location of your MBR.
My RAID0 had failed due a bluescreen crash and then I have created two images from my hard disks and then recreate the RAID0 but I has forgot to backup MBR before RAID0 recreation and its recreation caused the MBR changes.
the command will take the first 512B block ('bs=512 count=1').
where /dev/sda is the disk you wish to backup from, and /tmp/mbrsda.bak is the file you wish to store it in.
in that case you only want to restore the first  bytes.
