I've been working in Telecoms for 10 years and my experience says this would be too expensive to implement in the operator's systems.
However, if you are prepared to pay, you can utilise a load balancing solution to your problem.
You can also pay for shipping for your customers, allowing you to pay more for higher speeds.
If they are spending days, and not hours uploading data, shipping the data directly to your data center is probably the fastest.
Either with the use of additional LTE/WiMax modems or with a combination of multiple traditional ADSL connections.
No, not without becoming an ISP and hooking your own lines up to customer premises'.
If traffic levels get even higher, you could then look at then running connections directly to your client with weighting on their BGP compatible router so traffic destined for you goes over the direct link.
I used to work for a major UK educational SaaS provider and we were looking at a private peering solution with JANET (who is the "main" ISP serving UK schools and universities) so clients could access our service in a similar way to you, but the cost/benefit ratio came nowhere near reasonable for our several hundred TBs per month.
It's not worth expanding on why, but a lot of answers above have touched on the major technical problems.
If you think you'll have sufficient traffic (think at a minimum several PBs worth month reasonably sustained), you could look at a "private peering" solution with their ISP (so traffic would go from your client, to their ISP and then directly to your datacenter).
It'll cost a lot to setup (the cheapest option would be if you and the ISP both have facilities in the same internet exchange: most expensive would be fibre cables being routed between them and you), but they'll get savings as they wouldn't then have to pay to go out to the general internet before reaching you.
UPS shipping a box of TB SSD's is a much higher bandwidth then most internet connections.
I am sure this is not the type of response you expected, but it is quite common when uploading data into the cloud for new companies to mail disc drives in to be loaded.
