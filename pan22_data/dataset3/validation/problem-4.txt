In the advanced settings of openvpn i have chose tcp instead of udp
I'm not familiar with OpenWRT at that level of detail.
But, in your case, this isn't possible, because your uplink is ADSL or VDSL, which the Asus can't do.
Technically it is possible to set this up and because you are running an OpenWRT variant it, most likely can be done by manually changing the config-files in the router.
The only other way of making this work I see is physically swapping both routers and use the Asus as the WAN router.
From my router which have wan i have did a port forwarding  redirecting all traffic that comes on port 1194 to the openvpn server ip on port 1194  ( if you don't know your openvpn server ip you can find into the client.ovpn by open with notepad)
As far as I know in most router setups the buildin OpenVPN is hardcoded setup to make the outgoing connection on the WAN side.
This is the natural way of doing things for 99.999% of all customers that need a OpenVPN setup on their router so nobody bothers to implement anything else.
