(your string) may also be a regex if you ever see the need.
What you really want is to nul-separate the names to make the boundaries unambiguous:
The traditional UNIX answer would be the one that was accepted for this question:
You could also use a GUI program like TextWrangler to do a more intuitive search where the options are in the interface.
When filenames with spaces are passed through the pipeline above, xargs will interpret the individual words as different names.
This will probably work for Java files, but spaces in filenames are a lot more common on Mac than in the traditional UNIX world.
The alternative is to let find run grep for you, as Mark suggests, though that approach is slower if you are searching large numbers of files (as grep is invoked once per file rather than once with the whole list of files).
If you want to ignore case, replace -rl with -irl.
This will actually use a regex if you want, just stay away from the metacharacters, or escape them, and you can search for strings.
