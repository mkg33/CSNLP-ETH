It would seem you just need an ordinary SoHO router.
Or you could use DHCP and use the modems built in firewall to deny all outgoing and incoming requests to the NAS
Do I need to buy a router or switch (or neither or both) to get this working?
Computer 1 has two network cards, one connected to the modem (network 192.168.0.
I would buy a gigabit switch and then connect that to your router.
What would be the best way to set up this configuration?
For the NAS you could give it a static IP but leave the default gateway blank so it cannot reach the outside.
From what you write, all further considerations are not worth the time you need to think about it.
Now you do not require separate network cards and there should be no trouble with loopbacks or anything like that.
If you configure all machines by hand, just don't tell the NAS about the router.
If you chose to assign IP-Adresses with DHCP, don't worry that the NAS can potentially access the internet.
Additionally I do not want the NAS to be able to communicate with the internet (so it should not be visible from the internet and it should not be able to see the ADSL modem.).
in my current situation "Computer 2" does not yet exist.
And I wonder if having two computers on the same two networks is going to cause troubles, both electrically (as adding the second computer creates a loop), and as far as routing goes (how do I tell the computers to use the fast network if they want to talk to each other or to the NAS, and the slow network for internet access).
You connect the Model to the router (or you buy one with a builtin modem), the router establishes the internet connection and all other devices are connected to the router.
*) at 100 Mbits, and another to the NAS (network 192.168.222.
The ADSL modem only supports a network up to 100 Mbit, but I want the computers and the NAS to communicate via a 1Gbit network.
As long as there aren't any fancy services enabled on the router (such as UPNP) no machine is visible from the internet except the router.
I am about to buy Computer 2, but wonder if having two network cards in it is the best way of getting my intended set-up working.
I want to set up a home network that involves the following 4 devices:
Neither computer should rely on the other one to be "on", so they should not act as bridges.
You would then set the PC's ip addresses using DHCP or whatever you used before.
Are there any special things I need to be aware of?
Feel free to comment if you need me to clarify anything.
