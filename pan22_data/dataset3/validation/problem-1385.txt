Then add Port 443 below the HostName line in .ssh/config.
and put a single line containing user:pass in /path/to/corkscrew/authfile.
I'm going to venture a guess, which could of course be wrong.
If you have control over the server at home.com, you can get it to listen on port 443 as well: most likely you'll either want to add 443 to the Port line in the sshd_config file, or to redirect incoming connections on port 443 on your home router to port 22 on your sshd machine.
Since ssh uses the ssh protocol, and not the http or https protocol, it doesn't care about the http_proxy or https_proxy variable.
Use the following settings in your .ssh/config file:
The proxy can't distinguish ssh traffic from https traffic since they're both encrypted.
Some proxies won't allow you to connect to port 22 (the normal ssh port), only to port 443 (the normal https port).
Alternatively, if your firewall-piercing efforts fail, look into installing Ajaxterm on a web server outside the firewall.
There is a way to tunnel ssh traffic through an https proxy.
Your question is not clear because you don't explain what you're trying to achieve.
I'm going to give an example for corkscrew which I know is provided in Cygwin.
Three programs that can do this are netcat (the OpenBSD version), corkscrew and connect-proxy.
