I want to establish a connection to a remote server from my Mac using SSH.
At the moment if I SSH back to the local machine once I am logged in to the remote server, the terminal will just sit there whirring away, no errors even with -v.
So the above facts make me think that I am in the clear with regards to firewalls etc on the local and remote machines.
I'm trying to do something rather unusual (for me anyway) with SSH and I can't get it to work, hopefully you can help.
If I try and SSH into my mac from another machine on out LAN I can connect no problems.
Any help, links or general nudging in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!
I'm on a Mac(OS X 10.6.4) and I have Remote Login enabled in system preferences/sharing
Now the tricky bit, with the connection to the remote server established I want to then initiate a connection from the remote server BACK to the local machine.
Basically I need to jump through these hoops to be able to browse the remote server and then send file information back to my local machine so it can be dealt with by an application on the local machine.
I'm sure I must be missing something quite obvious here, but for the life of me I can't get a handle on it.
If I try and SSH into another server (not my local machine) from my remote server, I can get connected up with no problems.
I am trying to discover where I should be calling by looking at the output of the $SSH_CLIENT variable, but I'm on a standard vanilla internet connection (no static ip address) I think this might be what is causing the problem.
