Sorry to revive a clearly old question, but it seems no one suggested the obvious answer of forcing a fqdn.
(Note: it resolves to that IP because I use the opendns service and that is their suggestion page or whatever you want to call it)
This is using a static IP & (internal) DNS server.
Now I can fix the issue by removing the Primary DNS suffix, but it seems to me that the DNS suffix search list should be for short, invalid names (where dots=0 or something).
look to see if you have a domain name defined in your Router/Gateway.
For example I lookup "www.microsoft.com" but windows actually asks for "www.microsoft.com.eondream.com" (eondream.com is my primary domain).
If I am reading the nslookup output correctly then it is not a problem with my DNS server because windows is actually asking for the incorrect domain.
I'm sure I have a misconfiguration somewhere in windows but I don't know where.
Below is the output of ipconfig /all and nslookup (with debug & db2 enabled).
When doing DNS lookups (specifically using nslookup, for some reason most things are not effected) Windows XP Pro SP3 is using the DNS suffix search list for every single one.
Just use a trailing dot to force top level lookup.
