Given the cost of the replacement part from memory, it will probably be cheaper to buy a new laptop or just live with it.
To answer your question about the power supply size, look on the power brick label for "output".
A loose connection, cable or a faulty chip on the motherboard.
You can go into your BIOS (F2 during POST) and check the status of your AC adapter there too if you are curious.
If the Laptop does not get the signal, it does not allow the PSU to charge the battery, it will, however, allow it to power the laptop.
Batteries are not covered under warranty so great, but AC adapters definitely are.
This pin charges the battery(11 volts) and the outer part(shell) keeps the laptop running(19 volts) but does not charge the battery.
If your laptop is still under warranty with Dell, give them a call.
If the replacement AC adapter from your friend or from Dell also fails to work, it would indicate to me that there is a fault on the motherboard.
What it was for me was the centre pin in the charging cable was broken off.
It will most likely be under the Battery Info subheading, under System.
To clarify, the power board on some Inspiron models is a separate unit to the motherboard and has the power socket mounted directly on it.
So plug in your own adapter's numbers to figure out your maximum wattage.
If out of warranty, they should still at least be able to offer the part at a cost to you.
That means it provides 19.5 Volts with a maximum allowed Amperage draw of 4.62 Amps.
To reiterate the other answers, you'll need to contact Dell support for assistance with this.
The fault is a common one and happens because the plug sits so proud from the side of the laptop that it constantly gets knocked and causes the connector on the power board to fail, most commonly open circuiting the signal line.
Again, Dell should be able to replace this under warranty.
The power connector consists of 3 pins, 2 are power and earth, the 3rd is a signal line to identify the PSU as a compatible (Dell) unit.
You can generally use an adapter with a higher wattage than you need, but rarely can you use one that is lower.
without equipment to swap, you'll have to get Dell to fix it for you.
If you do not have a spare AC adapter that you can borrow from a friend or work colleague, I see no reason why they would not send a replacement out to you.
As the message is happening outside Windows, it something going wrong at the BIOS level.
Having just paid over Â£100 to have the the power board inside my daughter's Inspiron replaced and had the explanation confirmed by the Dell engineer, here is what happens:
Going back to basic electrical theory, we know that you multiply Amps by Volts to get Wattage.
