The "solution" here is to access the disk when it's not running an operating system.
Is there some way to change the permissions recursively on a series of directories without getting a dialog box that pops up and tells me it can't change the permissions on a particular file?
The problem you're running into is that you can't modify permissions on files in use by the operating system.
I keep getting this dialogs multiple times duing the process of changing permissions:
As advised in the comments, you really should be telling us what you're actually trying to do, because I can think of almost no reasons why you'd need or want to universally change the permissions on every file and folder on a Windows system drive, and doing so will cause you issues down the line.
Eventually I get so many of them that I start clicking the mouse or pressing the space bar so many times that I accidentally click the cancel button.
The other problem you will run into with this approach is that you can't change permissions on files you don't have access to, or will get a UAC prompt on in order to access.
You do this by mounting the disk as a secondary drive, or booting into another environment that lets you access it without booting into it (Linux LiveCD, WinPXE, etc).
Does it have to be done from the command prompt or from powershell?
After that's done, you'll need to take ownership of all files, folders and subfolders on the disk before you'll be able to achieve what you want to achieve, allowing Full Control of all files, folders and subfolders on the disk.
Also it would be great if I could keep a log of which files it can't change permissions on.
