We just use the EC2 cloud to host our corporate infrastructure, which doesn't have any critical performance requirements, but I've never noticed any slowness with EC2 servers compared to our old physical hosted servers; I think that Amazon for one are fairly honest with their server specs.
The performance hit will vary greatly based on the underlying storage architecture.
One cool thing about the Amazon cloud is that they have really good bandwidth, which you get for free rather than having to pay your hosting provider for the Mbps.
That said the servers used in a cloud may be more powerful than the server you might choose to host your app yourself, so the overhead may be negated by this more powerful hardware.
Yes, there is almost always going to be a performance trade off between running code on 'bare-metal' and any form of virtualisation.
If you're doing the equivalent of running SQL*Loader (a bulk loading utility for Oracle) and doing a big write to a DB hosted on a cloud (or any virtual machine) you will likely see a hit on write performance.
My advice would be to run many, many tests on any given cloud you're considering, including the same tests at different times of the day and month.
If you you have very specific I/O requirements, you probably don't want to go solely based on their cloud/VM specs as virtual disk performance can vary a great deal.
does your application put a significant load on your database, even if only sporadically?
I've seen much faster down / upload speeds to and from EC2 than we used to get with Rackspace.
AFAIK cloud servers are virtual, so the processor, disk, and (possibly) even the RAM are basically made up equivalent specs.
So I suppose that the question is how honest is your cloud provider?
Cloud-hosted servers are virtual, so its likely you'll notice slower disk performance.
