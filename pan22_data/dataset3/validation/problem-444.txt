COPY-PASTE the code below to this .htaccess file...
The web page is served once, and the locations of the fonts and scripts are specified in the response from the server.
In Adblock Plus, specify rules to block those external core files so that your browser will not try to load them.
You can disable access to the internet by allowing only localhost files via .htaccess file..
It is up to the browser to fetch the files specified in the response.
The external core files will be loaded by your browser, not by your apache server.
You can try to block access to specific urls of these external core files from being loaded by your browser.
If you cannot create the .htaccess file, then download it from here (winrar-format):
Just disable Adblock when you want those files loaded.
Blocking can be done in multiple ways, including by using proxy with custom rules like suggested by Vinayak in the comments.
If I understand your problem correctly, you have it all wrong.
Therefor blocking apache from accessing the internet is not a solution.
I personally suggest using Adblock Plus with your Chrome (Chrome Web Store link).
ublock is my current adblock of choice, and has this neat eyedropper option for elements
You cannot put your browser in work offline mode because your browser need an online access to the localhost url (which is served by your local apache server - but your browser does not know this).
Just be sure you're familiar enough with iptables; it's not difficult to completely lock yourself out of a server if you end up DENYing or REJECTing ssh, for example.
You mentioned firewalls -- I'd look into using iptables for this.
If you want something that will just affect the sites you work on, maybe use userside js scripts on whatever you host on localhost that will divert that elements - tampermonkey/greasemonkey might work.
Try using the domain option to only block urls loaded from your localhost page, e.g.
CREATE a new file named exactly .htaccess in the htdocs or the root directory of your project.
You could easily script an online/offline mode, but if you block the traffic at the OS layer, then you don't have to worry about whether something is an artifact of the browser, the web server, or any other layer above it.
clever use of adblock - create specific sets of rules to block out resources you don't want loading.
This may work outside the sites you're own but its something you can turn off and on at will.
There's a few options - run a real development environment on a VM - then you can run it nat only.
You have to change your cashing policy of the page.
