...If its on a laptop, it might get kinda hard but...
Not sure if it is possible, but how about setting your DNS servers to some incorrect IP address?
My advice is to seek professional psychological help.
Change your ways so that you don't mind your superuser reputation (or any Internet distraction) that much.
I don't want to sound offensive or off-topic, but it might be that you should work on your anxieties, your work habits and such, not on tools you use.
This way the network would still work, but you would still connect to other computers in the local network using their IP.
This does put the responsibility of adding them (and keeping them there) into your hands.
Result: no browser will run on your system for more than a 10th of a second!
Install an Internet Filter (not sure of any good ones) which should allow you to individually block access to the websites.
Being able to still connect to local servers is a necessity for me at least, since I have to connect to a source control server...
Following up on John T's idea, use this autohotkey script:
Now convert it to an EXE (to prevent uninstalling autohotkey), lock it in a deep dark corner of your system where you need a password to do anything to it.
Set the password to some random stuff you couldn't possibly remember.
Then put a shortcut in the Startup folder and lock that entire folder down.
I've learned to circumvent all the technological means of disconnecting the Internet I could think of (it doesn't help that I'm a programmer by trade).
