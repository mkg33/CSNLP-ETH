If, on the other hand, the router is doing NAT and/or blocking the relevant ports, then your options are very limited.
Since you have no access to the router, there's no way to make it publicly accessible via IPv4.
When you go to http://whatismyipaddress.com/ does it show the same address as your computer believes its IP address to be?
First, do you have a public IP address (i.e., not 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x)?
It's (probably) possible for the outside world to access your machine directly!
If this is not some corporate environment bus some simple setup (like a shared internet connection in an apartment building) then Universal Plug and Play might open up the ports you need.
And if you want to use common ports like 22, 80 and 443 then someone else might already be using those.)
You might be able to make it IPv6-accessible if you use a tunneling protocol that supports traversing NAT.
If that's the case, then it's basically just a matter of setting the desired services up and seeing whether the router allows you to access them from an outside machine.
In all cases it can be made accessible internally.
Depending on the details of what that router does and doesn't allow, you might be able to tunnel traffic in from an outside box, but, really, if you have access to a suitable machine to do the tunneling from, then you may as well just set your server(s) up there.
