The only RAID you can really enable after Windows is installed is software RAID.
I was able to get my working without reinstalling the OS.
You need to create the RAID first, then install Windows.
1) Sometimes the mobo's raid controller has two extra sata ports that are not part of the RAID controller, so move your OS drive there.
2) Enable the RAID controller, and this is where I went wrong, DONT CONFIGURE THE RAID JUST YET.
Your adapter has to be in AHCI/RAID mode to enable RAID on anything connected to it.
1 Guessing consumer motherboard as you are saying Windows 7 and not Windows Server.
When you switch this, it appears as a completely different device to Windows, thus Windows basically says, "Hey!
You really need to install Windows after configuring RAID, however, you can usually change the level and settings after it is installed as a good RAID card simply shows itself as a hard drive to Windows and the settings, RAID, backup and everything else is handled by the card - invisible to Windows.
5) You will have to format your drives when you turn it back on, since they have to system type
Hardware RAID, especially the ones built in to (consumer 1) motherboards typically uses a different hardware driver than using no RAID so Windows will no longer be able to see the hard drive.
I would bet that in the process of trying to enable RAID, you're switching your SATA adapter from "compatible" mode (where it operates similarly to an IDE controller) to AHCI mode.
You can't create a RAID 0 on a volume that already has Windows installed on it.
3) Let Windows Boot up, it will install the drivers for the raid controller.
If not you can just get the drivers from the MOBO's website.
