The effect is the same as a heavily fragmented disk.
Unfortunately, following a worst practice that was in vogue at the time, C: is only 8 GB, while D: is 128 GB.
Since the beginning parts of the hard drive are faster than the end sections, I just set up a partition at the beginning of my hard drive for the swap file; named it Swap and set it to drive B:...
I remember back when I had IDE hard drives, fat 32 was faster, so I set it for that also... don't know if that still makes a difference or not, these days.
Actually, there is one scenario where you may want to move the pagefile to another partition.
I have 8 gigs of memory, so set up an 8 gb partition at the beginning of the hd.
The space on the C: drive was close to being exhausted, and moving the pagefile was the only was to free up some much-needed space.
The reason for this is that by having the separate partitions on the same disk you will cause the head assembly to move more than would otherwise be the case.
should the partition be on the beginning or end of the HDD?
I guess I might lose a ~little~ bit of speed at boot time, but if the swap file is being used by the os it should improve speed generally during use.
Quite the contrary, you can expect a measurable drop in performance.
I'm thinking of this because Linux does it, actually it uses the raw partition as "swap space", which is more performant (has faster I/O) than the default journaled filesystem (I expect FAT16 to be faster than NTFS too).
PS - with 8 gb of ram you can get away with disabling the pagefile, but I noticed a little bit of speed loss without one; since the pagefile holds all the most recently used files ready to load into ram.
Considering there is only one hard drive, will the machine gain performance if I place the Windows pagefile on a separate partition, possibly FAT16 (instead of NTFS as the OS partition)?
If this does make sense, how should I go about it?
As others have already said, there is no performance gain.
A while back, I took over management of several older production servers that had a 3-disk RAID 5 container partitioned as C: and D:.
This of course applies to anything stored in multiple partitions on a physical drive (or array) but is worse for a swap file because it is read and written to constantly.
I am making a drive image that will be deployed to several computers, and I'm tweaking it for performance.
