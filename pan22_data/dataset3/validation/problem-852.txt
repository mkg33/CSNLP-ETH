Also note that the final release of Windows 8 will not support upgrading from any prior Windows 8 "Preview" release, though the migrate option will still be supported.
In any upgrade scenario, you can run the Disk Cleanup Wizard to remove the previous installation in order to free up disk space.
The download will also support boot from USB for a completely clean installation as well.
I don't think that MS will offer Windows 8 Final Version for Free on DreamSpark, its more likely that they will offer some other beta version to developers for testing and development.
The answer to this appears to be that the Dreamspark download is the RTM version, and no upgrade will be required on retail release day.
To answer my own initial question, yes you can upgrade from the Release Preview to the final version, at a cost of $40, as long as your Release Preview was installed on top of an existing Windows license (not a clean install).
So the question for me, as a Dreamspark user became: Is the version of Windows 8 that's currently on dreamspark the Release Preview, or is it the RTM, final version, requiring no $40 upgrade in the future.
