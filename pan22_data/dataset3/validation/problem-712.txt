But that was my understanding as of a couple years ago.

They then gave us a list of 15 domains from China to India that we should register through their company.

Unfortunately currently you needs to be registered as a company in mainland China to register a .cn domain, in order to meet with the ICP licensing requirements of the government.
Regarding the email you have received it is a scam you can safely ignore it.
We called 101domains and they said it would be $30 for the registration fee and $30 for the law firm in Shanghai.

Do you actually want a .cn domain or are you doing this purely because of the "Someone wants to register a domain name similar to your company name"?
What is the best (cost and safety) to register a .cn domain name?
For a *.CN must have a licence to have a website from the government plain and simple.
Now they are saying we need to register for a 5 year minimum at $100 per domain.
*.cn and *.ru are very very hard to register you MUST GET LEGAL advice on this matter DO NOT take any advice from the internet alone.
We recently received 2 emails from companies (px-vps.org and one other) in China saying that another company was trying to steal/register our .com domain name in china (.cn).
Who should I go through to avoid spending a lot of money and be sure we don't get ripped off in the process?
Lots of registrars will register .cn domain names these days.
