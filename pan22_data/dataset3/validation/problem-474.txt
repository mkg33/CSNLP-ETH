In VirtualBox 5.1 you can remap the host key to anything you want, even a combination of keys.
As far as I know it's only possible to modify the Host key from File -> Preferences -> Input.
Hostkey-Del or using the "Insert Ctrl+Alt+Delete" options under the Machines menu are the only ways to send Ctrl-Alt-Del to the virtual machine.
I think the short version is that the only way you can change the hotkey needed for Ctrl-Alt-Del is via changing the Hostkey and using Hostkey-Del (as said in the other response).
So I map the Host key to both Cmd keys simultaneously which gets it out of the way.
For more information, see the Typing Special Characters section of Keyboard and mouse support in virtual machines in the Virtualbox manual.

I'd like to type a replacement key combination for CTRL+Alt+Del.
Personally I don't use the Host keyboard shortcuts at all, I've hit Cmd + C so many times accidentally, thinking it'll copy but it takes the app out of full screen!
The only command that is "customizable" is the use of Alt-Tab and that is limited to be able to choose which machine (host or virtual) the Alt-Tab command affects.
Here's one (of many) references that can be hard to find through Google:
There is not much you can do outside of modifying the Hostkey to create/edit any of the command shortcuts such as Ctrl-Alt-Del or Ctrl-Alt-Backspace.
If there's a way to modify other shortcuts, I'm interested in that, too.
Outside of that, unless there is a Addon for Virtualbox to give this support, I think we will just have to wait for that sort of support to be included in future releases.
I'd like to know how to re-assign or disable the hotkeys for the virtualbox.
You can also map individual specific VirtualBox features to any keyboard combinations you like.
You'll find it under VirtualBox > Preferences > Input > Virtual Machine
0 will turn it off, other numbers correspond to key combinations like 65508 for the default right Ctrl key.
