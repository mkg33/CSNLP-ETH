But anyway you can't be sure, in the general case, that it will fall back to a single solution.
Those can be any pair of points, and the algorithm will already be converged with different solutions.
For instance, consider points equally distributed over a segment, in a 2 cluster problem.
It is quite clear (although a bit harder to explain) that any initialization will eventually converge to the same solution (this actually need sadditional assumptions, such as no point being on the edge of both clusters, at least).
For instance, consider the case where two centroids are initially located on each side of one of the circle's diameters.
However, there exist cases where the algorithm will necessarily converge to the same solution.
There are some problems which will likely give the same results every time, other that will yield different results.
In your example case, with a more complex structure, the problem is more difficult to analyze.
Consider observations equally distributed over a circle (radius = 1).
Depending on the initial centroids, the algorithm will converge on different solutions.
