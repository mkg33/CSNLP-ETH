Trying various innodb_force_recovery options in combination with lower_case_table_names options on copies of these data files does not solve the problem.
SHOW TABLES query shows the table, but any query on the table itself fails with error 1146.
Deleting the ib_logfiles and having Mysql recreate them on restart does not solve the problem.
You see, the table was created with uppercase characters on the Mac, and according to Mysql, Windows can't handle that.
After a Mac server crashed, I'm scrambling to recover records from an InnoDB table.
From what I can tell, the problem all seems to boil down to "error 1146 - Table 'db.my_table' doesn't exist" when I try to reference the table in any command or query.
I've copied ibdata1 and the two log files over to a new mysql server hosted on Windows for recovery, along with the single .frm file for the table I need.
Viewing the contents of the ibdata1 file, I see all record data in plain text, but there's no usable pattern to parse it.
Anyone know of a solution to extract these records?
When running a innodb_table_monitor, in the output I can clearly see the table definition (more or less) and the row count.
Even a normal start using copies of these files initially detects the crash and repairs it, and further startups give no errors.
Changing the .frm file name to all lower case and restarting does not solve the problem.
