From first wikipedia search result about the header:
Resart the SMTP service and check for connections to it, and if any exist, see where they're coming from and check the folders again for messages being relayed through it.
Inbound open ports aren't usually the attack vector these days but if there's a vulnerability in that version of IIS or whatever is listening on those smtp and http ports then that could easily be it.
Patch management problems and weaker internal security like easily compromised workstations with network access to the server seems like other likely causes.
Beside the obvious spam, it's impossible to tell what other things like root kits are installed or what communication is really going on from the server to the outside world buried miles deep in anything from dns requests to whatnot.
First stop the SMTP service, this will stop any further activity.
Hire a professional if it's important to find the cause as it could be anything.
Next, delete the messages in the badmail and queue folders.
Pull the network plug, wipe and reload the server as soon as possible - pull the plug instantly if a pristine state for investigation isn't absolutely needed.
Lastly, check the configuration of the SMTP service and make sure to close it to open relay.
