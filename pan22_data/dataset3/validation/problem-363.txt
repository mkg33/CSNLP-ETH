The ideal solution will "just work" in the background, requiring very little hands on time (beyond initial setup), however, any suggestions are welcome.
I would rather not have to put so much work into managing my video collection.
It works well enough in general but requires a decent amount of fiddling to be just right, especially with multi-disk/file movies (such as LotR Ext Ed).
Also, I have not tried My Movies with episodic content (TV shows), but I have a feeling it will fail spectacularly in this regard.
I'd simply install media browser - it looks after all your movies and TV shows and adds data/images to them automatically providing you keep a decent file structure (eg.
I am not concerned with whether or not the application has a WHS add-in, as I am more likely to connect via Remote Desktop than the Console.
I would prefer to have an application that will monitor a specified folder/sub-folders and download Windows Media Center friendly meta-data (synopsis, genres, cover art, etc).
For reference I have been using the My Movies Collection Management application, which really seems built more for full DVD ISO rips.
movies/movie name/movie.avi and tv shows/showname/season 1/e01.avi )
I've been ripping my DVDs (main movie or episodes to MP4) to my Windows Home Server for streaming to my HTPC, and now that I have a decent amount stored I need good a way to manage them.
I don't have a specific suggestion, but there are multiple apps there that sound like they'll fit your needs.
