I'm now looking at Terminal Services as a potential solution but I've not ever really done anything with it in the past so I need some resources to get me started.
However I bought it after we'd done a lot of work with TS, purely as a reference and because it was very cheap.
He is equipped with a 3G data stick which in the past has been fine for the access he occasionally required.
ISBN is 1-578-70276-3, published by Addison-Wesley and written by Todd W Mathers.
I have a director who for reasons unknown will be working 'from home' at least two days a week for the forseeable future.
I've looked at DSL in the past, but the reason he has the data stick is that his home DSL is with a cable provider, and we've really struggled to get VPN working properly with it.
Any help much appreciated, or alternatively if anyone has any better ideas I'd be happy to listen.
Going forward though he will need access to documents and spreadsheets on shared resources some of which are huge, and downloading or working with them over the data stick using VPN isn't really feasible.
I've got a book called "Windows Server 2003/2000 Terminal Server Solutions", which is reasonably good.
But it does seem to cover a lot of the stuff we went through.
