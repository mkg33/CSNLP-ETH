When you see CXPACKET waits you need to look at the other threads of the SPID and see what other waits are besides CXPACKET.
To your specific issue, the reason that the run times are so crazy is probably because the SQL Server is generating a different plan on some days because the statistics are out of date (making the job run long).
Just because you see a lot of CXPACKET waits doesn't mean there's a problem with the query, it means that there is a problem somewhere else.
Once you've solved the stats problem you can start looking at other reasons why the job is running slow.
What CXPACKET means when you see it is that that thread of a parallel query is waiting for another thread of that query to do something.
The fact that you only have a single disk is not helping any for sure.
There is a lot of misunderstanding about CXPACKET.
CXPACKET isn't the cause of your problems, it is a side effect.
I'm going to allocate a huge size for the tempdb, templog, and db/log and see if that works.
I think what is happening is when autogrow happens the process hangs with this error message.
I think it is related to the amount of size I allocate for the db and log.
Then you either manually update statistics (or via a job) or auto stats kicks in and then the plan gets better and the job runs quickly again.
