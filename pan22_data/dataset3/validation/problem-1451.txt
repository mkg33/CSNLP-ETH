It also reads from patient_discharged table in scenario as below:
patient_discharged table holds information of patient that got discharged from the hospital.
patient_admitted table holds information of patient admitted in hospital.
patient_personal_details view represents patient personal information from patient_admitted table such as name,age,gender etc.
medical_reports table holds medical report details of patient along with the personal information.
Is it possible to discard records(row) in patient_personal_details view that haven't been accessed from past 120 days using some access statistics.
If the patient is currently admitted then it reads the personal information from the patient_personal_details view.
A row in patient_admitted table is moved to patient_discharged table once the patient gets discharged, If medical_reports table consists such row  then the view retains that row information by reading it from patient_discharged table.
If there better way to design such scenario please suggest.
Over the time the view would read bulk records from patient_discharged table.
