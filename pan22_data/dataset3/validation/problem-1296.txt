And the switch in your Mikrotik already delivers traffic for the destination MAC to the correct switchport, so switch mirroring isn't going to help with anything anyway.
Both your consoles have different MAC addresses (and different IP addresses), so they'd just ignore each other's traffic (just like things used to work in hubbed shared-medium Ethernet).
I'd like to use 2 Xbox Ones on Xbox Live behind a single ISP (Comcast).
Would mirroring (which I see is usually used for monitoring traffic) be a solution to "forward" ports to two devices?
My rough understanding makes it seem like each Xbox's network traffic would effectively be spamming the other Xbox (but it would just drop the inappropriate traffic, and be fine).
That said, I haven't actually used an Xbox myself, but it seems that it should be enough to have UPnP enabled for automatic NAT port forwarding?
If that understanding is close to reality, what would problems would it encounter (would they each start blasting a bunch of NAKs and throttling each other) and is there a way to mitigate?
My networking gear is Mikrotik and supports Port Mirroring.
