Once I added Egyptian Arabic, the RTL / LTR buttons were now visible in the appropriate place and I could change the cursor and bullet orientation.
The solution was to add a LTR language under "options->language->editing languages".
I have an Office 2010 presentation template for my organization that puts some text as LTR even when the text language is "English UK".
Looks like there's no way to get some other buttons shown on the office ribbon.
Hope this solution works for all those faced with this vexing problem!
There are addable RTL buttons in the customize ribbon dialog, but they are grayed in ribbon cfg view, even though buttons that are actually there are also grayed in the same way.
In the "Home" tab, "Paragraph" section the RTL / LTR buttons did not appear, though when going to "configure the ribbon" they were already included under "Paragraph".
Bullets / numbering is on the right (as above) and the cursor goes backwards (right arrow sends it to the left, home sends the cursor to the end of the line of text ... all somehow logical for a LTR language).
I already found how to do it with VBA, but I find no way of doing it from UI and I spent much time searching and trying.
There seems to be no way to say the paragraph is not RTL.
