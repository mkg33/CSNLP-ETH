So remember to carefully consider the entire security environment as a whole.
It's not secure, and there's no reason in this day in age to use it.
As for security of the FTP conversation itself (ircmaxell's concern), just set up FTPS.
i don't know what distribution you use but Arch linux has a good wiki page on setting up vsftp:
when you created the admin_ftp user you did not specify that you want the home for this user to be anything other than /home/admin_ftp.
How about setting local home for those accounts accordingly and then use chroot with chroot_local_user or chroot_list_enable config options?
As far as how to do it, there are a fair number of them.
Now, it's worth pointing out that jailing people like this, in the absence of other safeguards, can be pointless; after all, since it's inside a DocRoot, they can just upload a PHP file, and then access that PHP file via Web browser, at which point they're no longer jailed.
It's pretty trivial to do so in vsftpd, and if you use FTPES, you can connect either way.
I'll link to a few google search results (Not vouching for any of these):
Instead, use SSH and/or SCP and/or SFTP (all similar and related protocols).
you should change the home directory for the admin_ftp to /var/www/ if you want that to be the directory you go into when you FTP using that user:
so the ftp server is trying to go into the /home/admin_ftp because that's what it sees in the passwd file.
