The lack of internet connectivity and a second PC made it even harder.
recently I had asked a question regarding windows 7 setip booting issues on a Toshiba windows 8 laptop.
I ended up wiping my installatioj of eight and its recovery partitions before being presented with the error so I lost all chances of backing up any files.
However, a little bit of research told me the error was because I did not boot in UEFI mode.
I was however able to boot into it with the boot mode set to CMS.
The issue I faces was that, in CMS boot mode windows 7 refuses to be Installed on a gpt styled NTFS format partition even though windows 7 supports gpt.
But I'd still like to know why this happened, for the sake of knowledge.
The problem is, Toshiba refuses to recognize any removable media in the UEFI mode.
Because most OEM UEFI Firmwares are buggy, and some features just don't work as advertised on the box.
If anyone could shed some light it would be much appreciated.
I have a clean and working installation of 7 that boots up fine in CMS mode.
