3) if option 1 or 2 are not possible you COULD use the console gui to manually change the "known" current IP for that connection prior to using ssh from the local machine.
Use the result to call the AWS CLI: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-ec2-sg.html
For most businesses there is probably no issue (and indeed my employer has a set IP range), but my home IP address is dynamic.
4) also possible from the home router set it up to only use a static for that machine so while the ISP may not give you a static IP you could use the lan static IP which would still be routable via the home connection.
There is also a convenient dropdown that says "My IP" so it will automatically fill the space with your info and locking you out that instance.
Whenever logged you can go to the security group bound to your EC2 instance, configure Inbound access and add or change the SSH rules.
2) allow it ONLY from your router's Stated IP Range as your are likely to only used a few from that router connection.
Most documentation clearly states to restrict SSH access to only one's IP address.
Currently I use NitrousIO, but an EC2 box is more attractive for a number of reasons.
Is there anyway to limit SSH access to an EC2 instance by IP address in such a situation?
I am concerned about being locked out at an inopportune time.
1) Ask your local ISP for a static IP whitelist that IP and use it from the local machine.
This will not be an issue if you have access to Security Groups settings for EC2 panel on the Amazon Web Services console.
You should create a script that adds/removes a security group rule, granting access to your current IP.
It will be a testing and development machine to allow me to put PHP, Python, etc scripts on a server without being tied down to a local machine.
