After a reboot though, it got more intense (instead of 2-5 mins between flickers, they were happening every minute).
After a recent windows update (If it were possible, I'd stop them from ever happening, ever) my screen started periodically flickering (one second of black, then back to normal).
I thought that maybe it's the integrated driver or something, so I stopped it from my bios settings, it's no longer visible in device manager, and I reinstalled the display driver once more.
At this point I'm shitting my pants that it's my GPU, which is brand new, but
EDIT: It's strange, sometimes (maybe alt tab out of game related) it increases frequency.
Towards the end of the install, I got a black screen and a message from my Sony TV about "Unsupported Signal" or something similar.
Decided to see if there's an Nvidia updated driver (have a GTX 1060) and I installed it.
Usually I try an hour or two of my google-fu before I go asking for help, but my case is a bit strange and it's starting to scare me a bit.
After the update and a fresh boot, everything looked ok, but the flash was still happening every 5-10 minutes.
I decided to completely remove the driver from control panel, reboot, install a fresh driver, but alas, still flashing every 5-10 minutes.
Thing is, the flickering during the install (this was a fresh boot, so maybe not the installer's fault) got to once every 2 seconds.
