Apply the changes with a sudo service dhcpcd restart.
or add it at the end of the file if it does not exist.
now when I have the rpi unplugged from the printer it connects just fine (I can ping it, ssh into it, etc) but the second I plug the ethernet cable in I no longer get any connectivity.
That way, the WLAN will be cheaper than the LAN, so it will be used by default.
As soon as LAN gets connected, the cost on the LAN is cheaper, so all the traffic goes out on LAN (as long as not explicitly told otherwise).
In the initial question, you don't provide too many details about the configuration, so this is a bit of a guess: the WLAN gets a higher metric than the LAN does.
You can configure the metric of interfaces in /etc/dhcpcd.conf.
or add it at the end of the file if it does not exist.
As long as only the WLAN is connected, it's the only way and you have to bear those higher cost.
I have a rpi 3 model b and am currently trying to set it up so that it connects to my wireless network and then connects through an ethernet cable to a copier in hopes of eventually being able to use cups and share this printer to the network.
And as always, you want it as cheap as possible ;-)
Is the rpi only allowed to use one interface at a time?
