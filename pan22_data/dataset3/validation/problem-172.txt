The default is it looks like the only files it installs, it installs to c:\windows specifying another directory seems to give an error.
for example the only exe I see it placing is copyfstq.exe and running that I don't even see it in process manager so it might just close immediately.
Monitoring the installation file, with Process Monitor, shows similar to saving it to another directory.
It's a tiny program, it looks like deleting its files might've been what got it out of the context menu cos I didn't do anything else to get it out.

I don't see Total Copy in add/remove programs, and I can't see its EXE, i'm not sure if it uses one.
I can't see what registry entries it wrote, but now when I right click drag one folder into another, it no longer says "total copy here".
i'd add, there's nothing in add/remove programs, nothing in the start menu, and there seems to be no exe that if run, starts the program.
i'm not sure that it manages to affect the context menu in windows 7. so it's perhaps no issue in windows 7.
When I right click dragging a folder into another folder, I get a context menu apppear offering me to copy with total copy.
