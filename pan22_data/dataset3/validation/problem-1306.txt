Maybe that is what happened and you just need to load BIOS setup defaults.
(In fact, we were getting very similar behavior with one of my coworkers, and that's exactly what it was.)
I've researched ntkrnlmp.exe bsods and other errors related to this file and there are four points which you need to check: incompatible or outdated graphics related drivers, problem with the latest Windows update (try System Restore), problem with the power adapter, problem with non-identical RAM sticks.
Typically the way to do so is to remove the battery or short the VBAT input power to GND.
I agree with the other answers that you should check your system's memory--just in case.
My first guess would be an issue either with memory or a corrupted app Vista was trying to access during startup.
So much so that I can't remember ever even attempting one myself.
That test will let you know if it's bad RAM, which is usually a fairly easy thing to fix.
You can also clear the CMOS using the BIOS programming utility.
(I have killed a machine before trying to 'fix' the BIOS), but that was a long time ago.
A great tool I've used for this in the past is MemTest86.
Try removing one at a time and see if you can duplicate the issue with just one memory module installed.
Naturally, YMMV, but in over 20 years working in this industry I have never had my BIOS just magically decide to fail with out me messing with it.
Unfortunately, I would suspect bad RAM long before I'd suspect bad BIOS, unless your BIOS settings had recently been changed.
("System restore" can help if one such previous update or change is causing the problem.)
I probably would have NOT touched my BIOS as the first thing to try to fix.
Sounds similar to the issue reported here and elsewhere on the web.
In any event, even if the BIOS gets upgraded cleanly, you'll still probably want to do the MemTest to be on the safe side.
If all of this works, there is an excellent chance you'll have to rebuild your hard drive.
If you computer is still under warranty, go that route.
While it may not be of immediate help to you anymore due to the "no battery" message, in this scenario, the first thing to do is perform a full-scale memory test.
Your computer has two user accessible memory modules.
Now that your BIOS is reporting no battery, my biggest question is: Are you sure you got the right BIOS upgrade?
It also wouldn't hurt, though, as recommended in the linked page to see if you've recently installed any system updates or applications.
