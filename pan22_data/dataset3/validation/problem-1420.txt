If you model some data for them, then present a problem for them to do in groups, they usually get the idea pretty well and can self-grade.
Students should first try to model some data that has 2-3 relations, then model data with a many-to-one relation, then more complex relationship models (relating through 3 or 4 tables).

I've taught a lot of people SQL in person (over 3000), and I've had to cobble together materials out of a bunch of resources to do it.
and a free app students can use to do daily practice with SQL here: https://enki.com/
You may want to break it down into a few class periods - basic querying and filters, followed by joins, and then more complex joins / functions.
Some really great things to model, either as a class or as individual projects:
For slides, you can use mine, just fork them and remove the branding (they are CC-licensed, the branding is just there to look nice): https://slides.com/lizh/sql-intro
Then, have them choose something to model individually.
Start by covering enough to get them through querying- have them start with one of the exercise sets above.
