Both of my Nokia phones were flawless in this regard, although depending on your technology it may not be very fast: 1xRTT connections are slow - about 10% faster than dial-up.
Note that you may not have reception in all places where there is voice reception (different technologies, different antennas...).
Using my newer LG phone, it doesn't work: the LG phone appears to work but then gives "NO CARRIER".
The idea is to use a bluetooth connection with PPP to dial out, and connect that way.
I would recommend investing in a bluetooth dongle.
Linux supports bluetooth quite well, and I always link my Samsung NP-Q45 to my phone via bluetooth even though it works with the cable (storage).
I used a Nokia 6165i in this way - as well as a Nokia 6265i.
Realize too, that you may have a strong signal that is too noisy to be useful, or you may have a weak signal - and none of this is reported.
It may have to do with the fact that it is a BREW phone instead of a phone that uses Java or Symbian (such as the Nokia phones) - either that or something related to it.
Then you can use the bluetooth tools such as the Obex setup and the various sync managers.
The general number seems to be #777 (four characters), and the username/password varies (if it matters).
