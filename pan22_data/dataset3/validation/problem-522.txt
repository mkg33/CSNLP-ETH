You can also look into ntop if you need a solution that doesn't involve logs.
While it should be easy to measure the current traffic levels, anticipating future growth will be a little trickier and some part of the answer falls on the customer.
Will the light bulb be turned on more or less frequently in the next month, 6 months, 12 months?
ratio like P/E value compared to similar companies.
You can give them an approximation based on the rated life of the bulb and it's current useage, but it's hard to predict what might happen in the future.
The key here is that you have to measure the current traffic (per session and/or user) and trend that based on the anticipated number of future sessions and/or users.
The log parser will produce several reports with number of hits, page view, traffic,

you can apache/IIS/lighthttpd/etc.. log parsing program to know the traffic.
How many sessions and/or users do they expect to use the site in the next month, 6 months, 12 months?
first probably serverside measures and latter surely most reliable always validate via external service, don't measure yourself, and compare relative others instead of absolute value.
technically you can profile os or just logfile analyzer or oldschool grep through logfiles are used.
The customer asking you to estimate what the future traffic level will be is analogous to them asking you when the lightbulb in the broom closet is going to burn out.
