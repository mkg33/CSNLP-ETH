You would then need to reconfigure your NIC when you want to connect to the internet.
The two cameras have the same IP addresses, so when you try to connect to the IP address in question, even if you get different IP addresses on the computer's two NICs, the endpoint IP is the same, and there's no way for the IP stack on your machine to differentiate between the two.
Additionally, if you configure the cameras to use completely different subnets, it is likely that ubuntu will figure out the routing table configuration on it's own.
Once you are able to change the IP addresses used by the cameras, you will be able to configure the routing table on your laptop to use the correct interface (wifi card) for the correct camera.
A second NIC is not required and is probably complicating the issue for you, remove it from the equation.
You need to find a way to change the IP address of the cameras.
Doing precisely what you want will not work, exactly for the reason you laid out.
You could then assign them different IP addresses within the range provided on that network.
Normally with devices like these you would configure them individually to connect to an existing network, this is usually provided by a wifi router or switch.
If a network is not available you can still configure the devices by editing the network settings for the internal NIC on the laptop to the ones provided by the camera manufacturer, you would have to do this one at a time.
You may have more success at this if you can use ssh or telnet to make the connection to the cameras.
