Implementing a checksum for data pages is a planned feature in PostgreSQL, but there are some very difficult problems with the implementation if concurrency is to be maintained.
In PostgreSQL, the WAL records are checksummed, but not the data pages, so you won't be able to detect if the OS or hardware has shredded your data.
That is, unless you have enough checksums to detect them, which at this point mandates app-level checking.
The fact is, only a fraction of popular filesystems carry checksums of actual file contents [wikipedia article].
Checksums are important, and useful, for all sorts of reasons.
Since most file systems don't keep checksums (notable exception is ZFS), a checksum in the database would still be useful.
As for hard drives, their durability metrics have never caught up with soaring capacities, so with enough data and/or throughput, you're guaranteed to get undetected errors once in a while [CERN research].
Search for "postgresql block level crc" or something like that to learn more (or become totally confused).
