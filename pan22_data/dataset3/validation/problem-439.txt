There are products you can buy to help with this issue.
Too bad they often only have 8 monochromatic colors and can take 1 second to refresh to another image, so reading a book or document is the main use for these kinds of screens at the moment, but they are starting to develop ones with more colors and that refresh faster.
E-ink screens work in the sun just as well as a normal book would.
I've hear that the cf-30 at maximum brightness is practically blinding indoors, and very readable outdoors.
When the backlight is competing with sunlight, sunlight wins.
There are some laptops that have very bright screens, made to be daylight viewable -the panasonic toughbook cf-30 is one.
Look for laptops with a screen having a high brightness (measured in Nits).

I have a cf-29 with 500 Nit screen and I can see the screen just okay in direct sunlight.
If you're a DIY type person I'm sure you could use a newspaper or some other material to reproduce one of these items.
Picture your screen as a transparent image with a light shining behind it (called a backlight) so you can see it.
Most LCDs have 200 to 300 Candela per square meter (also know as NITS).
They also use a lot of power so most have short battery life.
So if the screen doesn't use a backlight (like an ebook reader that have an e-ink screen) then they work fine in the sun.
