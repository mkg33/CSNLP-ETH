You can also use the following page to referance the flashing lights and beep codes - http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=bph07107&lc=en&cc=de&dlc=en&product=5116406
I had the same problem with a HP Pavilion G6 g1020
It the computer does the boot at this point then you will need to contact HP support.
To clarify, laptop beeped 15 times on pressing power button, fan turned on, hard drive spun up,  wifi light stayed orange, screen blank and caps lock flashing.
Seems one of my ram chips got knocked when I was messing in the innards and became unseated.
Are you sure there is no pause in between possible sets of beeps?
What you should also be aware of is that the hp dv6 series laptop are incredibly notorious for their graphics chips overheating, causing the solder to soften, resulting in a slight separation from the motherboard.
I would recommend removing the battery and power from the laptop.
In my case it was simply that the RAM was released and I simply have to re-seating it and it start working
This is caused in a design flaw by HP, the video chip is too close to the processor without enhanced cooling.
I open it to put thermal paste on the processor (I wasn't able to do it) and when I reassemble it, It beeps 15 times and the Caps Lock LED flashes continuously.
The most important thing you should do right now is nail down those beep codes.
The symptoms of this problem vary from laptop to laptop.
But like Dave M stated that does not match HP's beep codes.
Then reconnect the battery and power to the laptop and power it on.
Everything you need to know is in those beep codes.
But generally they begin with the wifi card having problems, the unit rapidly becomes very slow, then eventually they may result in the unit not POSTing, no video (although possible power to backlights), possible beep codes.
HP has beep codes which translate to video problems.
I had this problem after replacing the power button board on my hp g56 after water damage.
