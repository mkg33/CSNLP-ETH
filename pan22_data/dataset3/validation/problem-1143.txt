But no manufacturer is going to support this as there are effectively an infinite number of combinations and you can bet that some of them would introduce instability through odd timing issues.
Now my gut tells me that this is just one of "those things" they always say to minimize the chance of strange little glitches.
You are much less likely, I think, to get away with mixing registered RAM with unregistered or EEC with non-EEC on the same board though.
The following statement appears in the technical specs document for the board:
The memory I'll add will be from Crucial or some other well-known vendor and be specifically compatible with the board.
I've had nothing but hassles with mixed memory chips, everything from just not acknowledging the additional memory through to full on failure to boot, whilst using the memory separately is fine.
Biggest problems came when dealing with HP servers when even the slightest difference caused problems (not sure if it's changed but HP's memory model numbers differentiated Mhz size and form, not cas,ras etc.)
If this registered stuff was cheaper I'd just replace the existing DIMMs, but at $150+ for 2GB I'd rather just add more.
The main thing to be conscious of is which memory channels are paired together, and make sure each pairing is the same brand/speed and for the most part you should be good.
I've got an SE7501HG2 board in a server that currently has (unknown make) 4x1GB DDR266 ECC Registered DIMMs installed.
Generally speaking you can pretty much mix and match memory speeds these days and the memory controller will cope, running all at the speed of the slowest.
The board has three banks, so I'd like to install another 2x2GB.
I'm just reaching out to you guys in case somebody has actually had a problem doing this.
