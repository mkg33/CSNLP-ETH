If on each segment you have a different IP network they won't be able to communicate.
It means that a broadcast frame will pass through the bridge from one segment to the other and everyone can hear it, but a collsion happening on one segment won't be heard on the other.
It means that when an equipment send a broadcast frame everyone can hear it and when a collision happens everyone can hear it.
A Single LAN is a single broadcast domain and a single collision domain.
As more equipments you have in a single LAN, more collisions happen and it slows the LAN.
When you use a bridge to connect two segments you have a single broadcast domain and two collision domains.
A bridge is unaware of IP because it works at layer 2 (ethernet).
IP is a layer 3 protocol (remember that the bridge is unaware of it).
The ultimate bridge is a switch, because a switch is a multiport bridge where each port is a segment.
A bridge is a very good way to segment a crowded LAN to reduce the number of collsions.
You will need a router or a layer 3 switch to interconnect the two segments at IP level.
