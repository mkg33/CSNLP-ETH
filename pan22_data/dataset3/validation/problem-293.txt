I would imagine any host that does support this will want a reasonable fee for doing so.
The migration of VM's between providers is perfectly possible, technically.
First of all, both providers must use the same virtualization technology.
Second, you must be able to get the raw image of your VM which should roughly be the weight of all the data in your VM if it's a sparse image or the size of your partition if it's a full image.
Basically, I do a full rsync from the provider 1 to provider 2.
This goes double for database servers and email servers.
If that is not the case, forget it (or get lucky).
I know that there exists software that are capable of backing up an entire OS but I don't have any names in mind.
At this stage, the two systems shouldn't be too different.
Then, I re-run rsync, to bridge the gap a little more.
Again, if you have proper documentation and backups re-building a server shouldn't be a huge pain.
Migrating a linux guest can be quite easy (for guru's) even from within.
Do a final rsync; this shouldn't take long, given how similar provider 1 and provider 2's files should now be.
The approach below tries to minimise downtime, though there will still be some.
Obviously hosts want to do their up most to keep hold of customers, and physical inconveniences to moving providers is one of these ways.
Obviously, with daemons still running, this won't be a consistent image.
I've migrated Xen instances from one provider to another, by hand (i.e., with no coordination between the providers).
The problem your going to have is trying to find a host that will do it.
The biggest issue with migrating windows would probably be the licensing, even if you, not the VM host own the licence the activation "fun" would probably make it not worth the hassle.
This image is usually stored on a SAN or NAS at the provider's datacentre.
chances are that the hosts will be using different systems etc and having a clean install of the OS will ensure generally smoother running of the system in the long term.
it wont take too long to migrate the actual data you need to the new server and you will probably be more happy with it in the end.
Then, shut down all the daemons on provider 1, so that no files are going to get changed.
