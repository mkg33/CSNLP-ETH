I'm going to go against the general trend, at least partially.
On it's own, changing to a different port might gain you a couple of seconds while it's searched for, hence gaining you nothing in real terms.
Once upon a time it was a good idea in order to avoid network worms, since those tended to scan just one port.
However, the time of the rapidly multiplying worm is now past.
If you use the default port then it will be impossible to know if someone is attacking you or it's just random idiots doing random scans.
Here's the situation as it applies to my systems: Non-public services are run on non-standard ports.
If you do that, I think that you need to make it clear to every other admin or user that this should not be considered a security feature, and that the port number used is not even a secret, and that describing this as a security feature that brings real security is not considered acceptable behaviour.
Also, the average "script kiddie" will more likely be deterred when the simple tool or command script they're using doesn't find a SQL server instance on your machine (because the tool only checks the default port).
Remark: I am not saying that you should change the server port.
I am just describing reasonable reasons (IMO) to change the port number.
It's a slight level of obscurity, but not a significant speed-bump on the road to hackage.
Such as contacting the authorities, investigating who this person may be (by cross referencing with the IPs of your registered users or whatever), etc.
To beat this system would require either luck (hitting the right port before getting blocked) or a distributed scan, which triggers other measures, or a very long time, which would also be noticed and acted on.
However, if you combine the use of non-standard ports together with anti-portscan measures it can give a really worthwhile increase in security.
However, not using the default port for a particular application (say, SQL Server) will basically force your attacker to scan your ports; this behavior can then be detected by your firewall or other monitoring metrics, and the attacker's IP blocked.
If you see failed attempts with sshd running on port 33201 you can safely assume that the person is targeting you and you have the option of taking the appropriate action if you so desire..
You are correct that it will not bring much security (as the TCP server port range has only 16 bits of entropy), but you may do it for two other reasons:
Any connection attempt to more than two ports from a single source address, whther successful or not, within a specified amount of time results in all traffic from that source being dropped.
It's a harder config to support long-term since everything that talks to that particular service has to be told about the different port.
