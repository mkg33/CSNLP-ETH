If you exceed the limit a few things might happen - fuses might blow or voltages might collapse.
First of all, I would like to ask if there's a limit to wired sensors/devices because I'm using a few.
There are some logical limits, such as having enough chip selects for SPI, enough addresses for I2C and enough pins for GPIO, but this is not a problem here.
However, after 30-50minutes my pi stopped working and a green LED is dead.
When I connected the breadboard to pi and to power, everything was working, I could read data from sensors and looked fine.
I just want to know what happened, what I'm doing wrong before I'll try to run this on a new pi.
Given that your setup worked for so long before failing, it's possible the number of devices is not related - perhaps there was a momentary short, a supply surge or any of many freak incidents.
Unfortunately it's very hard to determine the root cause from the information you have given, but here's a good plan of attack:
Given that you're running everything off the 3.3V rail, and this rail is not particularly beefy, that would be the first place to look - calculate your total current draw and compare to the rail's capability.
There is no practical limit to the number of digital and analog connections you can make.
But all these scenarios are probably just as likely as a freak occurrence.
Neither of those scenarios are particularly destructive.
There is, however, a limit to the power you can draw from the supply voltage rails.
Both the 3.3V and 5V rails have current draw limits.
I'm doing a project for a school assignment and have some issue with my circuit.
One destructive scenario is that the voltage might become marginal - it's possible that a marginal or fluctuating supply voltage could cause damage, either to the microprocessor itself or to the SD card, both of which are susceptible to poor voltage regulation.
