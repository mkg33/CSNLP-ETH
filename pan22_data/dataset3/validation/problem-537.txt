I have a Lenovo Thinkpad P50 with the following OS installed:-
When I run ipconfig and ping my default gateway I get:-
I have tried all the steps on https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/10741 but to no avail.
Otherwise default gateways record would appear in the arp table immediately after the setting.
I'm not using WiFi, so I don't know if that would be the same issue.
Installing an updated driver from the manufacturer, in my case HP, solved the problem.
Question... are you running Adobe Creative Cloud software?
I've been having this issue for the last week, and have tracked the problem to Adobe CC, possibly AVG too.
It turned out that the Realtek network driver that came with Windows caused this issue (network but no Internet).
My colleagues have the same default gateway but they get a response when they ping it.
Check if your switch port is configured correctly for the network you need access to.
I had a similar issue when first using Windows 10.
I've tried everything to fix this issue, and everything is fine, I can connect to the internet, but as soon as I open any Adobe program, it kills my internet.
Your default gateway do not communicate with you on phisical or data link layer (or you has configured wrong ip, netmask or default gateway ip).
