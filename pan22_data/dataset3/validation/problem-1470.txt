This involved changing the file at '/etc/netwrok/interfaces' which now contains (password removed):
Despite this however, each time I reboot my RPi it gives me a new dynamic IP address still.
So I followed a number if instruction to go about configuring the RPi to keep a static IP address.
I am able to get a puTTy session going when I know the IP address that my router has given the Pi on each session but it keeps changing on each reboot as I would expect.
Also I'm not sure if this is relevant but it can't hurt!
I recently got given a Raspberry Pi and I would like to be able to remote into it using puTTy from my laptop so I don't have to sit next to my tv with a keyboard and mouse to use it.
I have tried everything I can think of and would really like to get this working this weekend so I can use it from work.
I also noticed that in the 'ifconfig' output below that the details of the eth0 doesn't contain IP details for inet addr, Bcast or Mask which have been present in all other examples I have seen online.
..I heard it might mean something on one of the pages I was looking at.
