You are going to encounter both as a sysadmin, so you'll want to know how to read/troubleshoot/debug both.
I still use Perl quite a lot, but it's now more for one-liners and "throwaway" scripts which will only run once.
So far from my experience learning perl has been easy.
Its regex syntax is really simple, and it lends itself quite well to extremely fast script development.
With things like Fabric in development it can really make things easier:
This is quite important when you have to get something working on-the-spot.
I know perl enough but am not an expert and my experience with python has been vastly superior.
I think it depends on your needs but if its simply for system automation I would go the python route and forget about perl (for the time being).
Lately I have been making an effort to use more Python for the following reasons:
As for writing scripts, I have used mostly Perl over the last 10 years for most of my sysadmin utility and "glue" scripts.
I have been using bash for most of my system administration tasks.
If I think I'm ever going to edit the script again, I consider Python instead.
Should I learn  Python or Perl is better for system automation.
They're equivalent; for a home machine, which you use depends on which one you feel more comfortable in, but when working with others you should adhere to any established standards (if everyone else uses Python you shouldn't use Perl without good reason, and vice versa).
