Unfortunately, more than likely it is a bunch of Malware causing problems on her machine.
If that's the case, try running a free online virus scan, like Trend Micro's.
She isn't downloading Torrents or anything is she?
If you have problems installing or running a scan, her machine might be quite badly infected.
I'm sure if she was you;d have spotted it by now but when I am my browsing goes down the drain.
In MSConfig, click on the Startup tab and unclick everything (these are a list of programs that get automatically loaded when Windows starts -- they can be started manually at any time, and so probably don't need to be loaded).
Everything will be as smooth as grease over butter.
looks like I'm a tad late but I think I got the answer: enter to your modem preferences (or router, I don't know the difference, sorry) and deactivate the IP overflooding option.
(Many Malware and viruses are programmed to recognize attempts to remove them or access anti-malware software.)
If this is what happens, then post back here and I'll try to give you some more help.
Reboot the machine and see if any of the above has helped.
I was wrong and it's more than likely just a lot of legitimate programs taking bandwidth.
You don't say which operating system you're both using, so I'm going to assume Windows.
To reduce the number of programs running, press Start/Windows Menu and click on Run.
As it's still slow then we can rule out wireless issues.
If you can't even load that site on her machine, then it's probably a really bad case, unfortunately.
If not, post back and I'll try to help you further.
Good job on plugging her computer directly into the router.
Download some anti-malware software (like AdAware Free), install it on her machine, and run a scan.
