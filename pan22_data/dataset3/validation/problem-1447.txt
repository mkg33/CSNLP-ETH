My question is: can I simply plug everything into the switch and make all the devices get along?
Devices should [but may not always] hang onto their last-known IP Address.
[Don't enable Remote Login or Management unless you are certain you need it - you will be unnecessarily exposing your machine if you do.]
It may be wise to disable WiFi on all the other devices so they will naturally use Ethernet.
You will, of course, need it to stay awake whenever any device needs the internet, but not for inter-device communications once DHCP has been set up.
The Mac logs into the hotel WiFi, then is in charge & providing routing, gateway, DHCP & firewalling for your subnet.
The NAS does not have Wi-fi, the others have both Wi-fi and Ethernet.
After that, the Mac will provide routing & DHCP to all the other devices.
I haven't actually enabled it in this pic, but you would share from Wifi to Ethernet...
You could set up one of the Macs as your gateway/router, using Internet Sharing [System Prefs > Sharing].
We have two MacBooks, a PC, a NetGear RN314 NAS, two Airport Time Capsules, and a Canon printer.
If they don't, you'll have to wake the Mac to refresh them.
The hotel has Wi-fi, the house will have a structured panel that I have no clue about except it goes to all the rooms, and supposedly the Internet provider connects to it, where it goes places.
Assuming you can get a vaguely useful signal from hotel WiFi - some of them you can barely get email over...
You can otherwise use the Mac as normal, the connection sharing shouldn't interfere with its own operation.
Connect the Mac to one port of your Ethernet switch & everything else to the other ports.
My wife and I are going to live in a hotel for a few months, and then move into a new house.
I run all the devices on the 192.168 network, some fixed IP, some not.
