Because that's how PCIe structure works: All devices are connected to a single root node.
In a similar way, your GPU is behind the bridge 01.0, and your LAN controller behind the bridge 1d.0, which may be an internal bridge.
The devices in the PCH southbridge itself show up as direct descendants of the PCIe root.
1b.0 is a slot and function number of the PCIe root hub.
(Though you can have several PCIe domains, but that complicates things).
The busses behind this bridge would be numbered 02 to 3a, even though there are currently no devices attached to them.
Typically they would show up behind different PCIe bridges.
Remember that the CPU and PCH are closely coupled through a proprietary high-speed bus, which is transparent to the PCIe protocol.
For Intel, all external PCIe lanes, no matter if they originate from the CPU or the PCH, are behind PCIe bridges (and therefore get new PCIe bus numbers).
That's why the PCIe layout doesn't match the physical layout.
No, I don't know what bridges that would be for your particular architecture, but possibly one can find out with Intel datasheets and/or by observing existing systems.
