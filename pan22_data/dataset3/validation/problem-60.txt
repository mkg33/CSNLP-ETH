The real problem here is that AD DC uses SQL Server already as his own internal database engine with some special customizations to ensure a good performance (the so called Windows Internal Database).
Especially if you experience any security or performance issues.
I hate to say it but if they need to run an application in SQL Server and it is going to be a mission critical application there is no reason for them not to invest in running that application.
Now with that said, Window Small Business server used to be the one stop shop for a situation like you describe.
However with Window Server 2012 they changed this to Window Server Essential Edition, and I am not sure what roles you get with this Edition.
The reasons you gave are the primary reasons for avoiding the combination of SQL Server and a domain controller.
If you must combine AD and SQL Server, be aware of the risks, and do what you can to mitigate them.
I setup one of these servers for a department one time.
That said, it's not necessarily uncommon to see SQL Server installed on a domain controller in a small business - you only have so many resources to go around, and you sometimes have to make do with what you have.
A feature you get with Standard is licensing to run two guest OS virtual machines via Hyper-V.
I have never seen a company put these two roles together out of choice.
One main reason you are going to have against doing this is Microsoft Support.
It is an AD, Exchange, and web server all on in one; and if I recall also had an installation of SQL Server but I can't remember.
There is also the issue of disk performance for services and applications other than AD-DS on the DC, however that can be fixed by installing SQL Server and placing the DBs and log files on a different disk than the one holding the NTDS.DIT AD database.
Although your performance is all on one server it provides a boundary separation and would be a fully supported setup by Microsoft.
Hardware is cheap these days and it does not take much for AD to run if your organization is that small.
If you size the hardware appropriately it will allow you to run your SQL Server instance in one VM and then your application in the second VM.
As it states in documentation you should not install it, they are not likely going to provide support.
[Disclaimer: I would never consider combining AD and SQL Server in anything other than a very small business.
It states on this KB article that the setup will fail, although the applies to only list up to 2012 version.
You could even go and get 2 or 3 year old hardware for that matter.
The points you have listed are shown in BOL here, and even though it quotes:
The bottom line: Avoid combining server roles if you can.
There are too many risks, and server loads are usually much heavier.]
Unless you fork over a good bit of money they are probably not going to do much for you.
If you install SQL Server on a DC, it will get in conflict with this implementation, so you will face not only problems promoting or de-promoting DCs, but also with database itself.
I would suggest though you simply spend the money to get Standard Edition.
