Sounds like the firewall on that XP machine is blocking the ability to use NetBIOS based computer browsing or the Computer Browser service is stopped.
That'll tell you which machines your PCs consider to be the master browser.
Check your router web interface for connected devices.
The other related pages contain a lot of information that might help diagnose the problem.
Something else you could try is the browstat.exe utility from Microsoft.
one of them out  of 10 or so was not mounting the CIFS (windows share).
Please up vote so other can find the solution as I know this to be correct.
Sounds like you don't have the DNS Client Service running...?
Another idea might be trying setting them to dynamic, that way it should eliminate the chance that there is one setting that is slightly off on the problem PC.
I suppose your LinkSys router works as your DNS server and DHCP server?

It means that it translates names into IP addresses and provides IP addresses to client machine which you connect to your network.
Microsoft have a troubleshooting guide that might help.
I'm guessing the problem PC will have a different master browser to the rest.
You mentioned above that your machines are all set to static IP addresses.
Is the name somehow "special", so it can't be registered on the LinkSys router?
See, if the PC is in the list with its name or if an unknown device with the IP address of that PC is listed (Status / 'Local Network' / 'DHCP Client Table').
