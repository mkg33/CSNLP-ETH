When the deployed servers are finished doing their standalone thing, we reconnect them back into the production network so they can sync up.
As you can see this is a probably not a recommended and slow way to get a server in sync with the production DC.
We have two domain controllers both with OS in RAID1 and DATA in RAID5.
For the DATA part we use a external HDD to copy the data from the production DC onto the server we want to deploy.
I'm happy to anwser any questions, when more information is needed.
Two production DC's and two transportable DC's which are connected with the production DC's so that they keep in sync all the time, untill we disconnect them to use them in a standalone network.
We also have two extra HP servers which we have to deploy as a standalone network from time to time.
The production DC's should always be leading for the OS and DATA part, so the server being plugged back in must NEVER overwrite any data on the production servers.
When we want to deploy such a server we pull a RAID1 disk from a production DC and plug it into the server we want to deploy and let it rebuild it's RAID.
What would be the best way to achieve the desired situation?
