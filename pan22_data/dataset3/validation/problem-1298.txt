Every connection from internal network to internet will only be possible, if host will share his internet connection with vmnet1.
vmnet1 is a virtual switch, by default mapped to a host-only network with an adress coming from VMware DHCP, here it is 192.168.209.0 with mask 255.255.255.0
In your network setting they are all on the same network.
More often, there is a router between PC1 and Internet.
There are several reason for not using all IP adresses.
internal IP is one of 192.168.209.128 - 192.168.209.254
Traffic from PC2 to router will go through virtual switch vmnet1 to host network adapter eth0 if host shares his connection.
One would be, if all clients get adresses dynamically, that you can split vmnet1 network into several subnets by changing the mask.
internal IP:    192.168.209.128 (VMware runs the DHCP)
For your understanding of host-only you can read further
Host-only network means, that IP of internal network will come from internal DHCP.
Confusion comes from the DHCP IP range, that cuts the possible adresses to .128 - .254
