You will need a minimum server size to truly work with those components and running those (or forgetting to turn them off) can drive your bill up rather quickly.
While it is not much to do things for days at a time, it will at least get you familiar with that side of the DBA/BI world.
I play around with data sets I download from Internet and just load them into a database...then you can play with designing SSRS report around it.
You also have the data dump from StackExchange to use as well, which was just updated a few months ago.
Now that is not to say that you should shy away from doing anything in the cloud.
[e.g I've forgot to turn one server off and it ran for a day or so, had a bill for about $40.]
Brent noted on it in his answer but just to expand a bit more...I'll just note around learning the BI side of things that using Azure (or other cloud providers) may get a bit expensive.
With Azure you can get a $25 credit each month from Visual Studio Online, same place where you download free Dev Edition of SQL Server.
I actually do most of my learning with BI locally on my laptop, just have local SQL Server instance installed and then Visual Studio 2015 + SSDT.
