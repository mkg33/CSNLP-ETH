So I have no idea what's disallowing that since it's not the actual credentials.
And if I use an unsecured connection no port 587 I quickly get the error "Access denied - Invalid HELO name (See RFC2821 4.1.1.1)".
So today I improved the authentication by adding spf, dkim, and dmarc as well as creating an rDNS record.
It's only remotely connecting to the SMTP that's an issue.
But now using the same settings on my mail client that were working yesterday I can't connect for SMTP.
Have you considered using raw telnet (or ncat) to test/debug?
Up to yesterday, my mail server (at mail.simunomics.com) was functioning properly with regards to my mail clients - sending and receiving.
(Resulting in automatic filtering to spam/junk folders.)
And if I attempt to send via the server directly, either either through cPanel webmail or (say) automated via the phpmailer script, that's fine.
Any ideas what I might have messed up or where to look?
I tested on https://www.smtper.net/ and it appears that if I use a secured connection on port 465, the operation times out.
However, it was not authenticating properly with recipient servers because it hadn't been configured yet.
