While the Apache server was fine as is, apparently we previously had a specific DH param snippet saved in the certificate file.
Unfortunately that downgrades our certificate from A+ rating to a B, but I'm not allowed to upgrade the Java server from 6 to whatever newer one.
Once I added that snippet to my ssl cert, the reporting server was able to access the images over https!
This snippet was added because the reporting server that asks for the images and files runs on Java 6.
First clear all caches on the "reporting server" and see whether it helps or not.
After this, there's no use for the RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/files/ as everything should be rewritten unconditionally already, giving you the possibility to simplify your configuration:
I would NOT disable http until you've resolved the problem:
The blank page problem doesn't seem a server side issue caused by your Apache at all.

Also, fix all http:// URLs on your content to https://.
That tells the browser to internally rewrite every request for the domain to HTTPS.
If so, the consistency between the redirection and the HSTS policy might prevent such caching in the future.
There's no details how this "reporting server" works, but the blank page might for example be a result of not displaying a cached HTTP URL image on a HTTPS page due to a changed mixed content policy.
The fact that you can access the URL from another computer pretty much proves it.
