I add an "event" to my calendar with at HH:MM am/pm with HH and MM set to +2 minutes from current time and get an SMS with short event description in 1 minute before the "event" begins.
During night or off time I could not check my mails and I'm wondering if I could get notified by SMS(ONLY FILTERED MAILS) for FREE when I receive a mail.
May be it is possible to configure you e-mail checing daemon to execute a script if a filtered mail is in the indox.

Why not configure your GMail account to forward a copy of the specific messages (based on the sender) to the email address of your phone.
This should be ready in about 2 weeks, let me know if you would be interested in using it.
I know the site www.way2sms.com and felt it difficult to configure.
If anybody using any method or site for this, please let me know.
Here is a way of obtaining SMS alert from gmail.com using Google Calendar
Unless your mobile phone provider has the Email to SMS feature builtin (Ex: yourmobilenumber@bell.ca) then you'll have to pay for that service with a third party.
I am using a script which notifies to my Gmail account if one of my websites are slow or down.
Does anyone know how to get notified by SMS for free when a new mail message has been received in the inbox.
I'm currently building a service called gmail2sms but it will cost you a few cents for each SMS (since an SMS relay charges for it).
