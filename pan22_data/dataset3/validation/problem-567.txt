We use a Watchguard firewall (ours is a X1000 which is end-of life now).
Bluecoat (formerly Packeteer) PacketShaper products can dynamically throttle excessive usage on traffic that it manages.
There's a number of commercial extensions available and you can even write your own ISAPI filter if you're feeling brave.
You can even perform rudimentary rate-limiting with any regular Cisco router of any decent capacity/vintage.
It's obviously not open-source but has benefits to a Windows shop and runs on commodity hardware.
They have many feautres revolving around blocking domains or ips who are seen time and time again or are using an obsesive amount of bandwidth.
You have the additional benefits of application-level filtering, the ability to load-balance across multiple webservers (instead of NLB on those servers), VPN termination etc.
Specifically for this requirement, it will limit to 600 HTTP requests/min per IP by default and you can apply an exception for Jon Skeet (sorry, I realise that "joke" has been made already!
This would need some tweaking because you obvisouly would not want to block Jon Skeet on stackoverflow :)
