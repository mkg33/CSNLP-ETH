What steps should I know take to find the blocking statement?
If you are using any Database Monitoring tool like Solarwinds DPA or Idera, even that will be very handy to provide you much more details about the query and blocking.
Using the DBCC INPUTBUFFER command shows the last statement executed by the blocking session, but this is an SELECT on another table than the UPDATE, so I think it can't be the cause.
Well, you already have great answers posted here by experts, I would like to add this to your kind consideration that you may use sp_whoisactive developed by Adam Machanic and you may download the same from Brent Ozar Website
We have obtained a report of All Blocking Transactions and this indeed shows a session blocking an update.
The isolation level being used in the application should be READ UNCOMMITTED, so it should only be another modification that is causing the block, but we can't see where.
The update is using the primary key, so it should affect only one row.
They have also recently added one new procedure called sp_blitzlock, you may download this since it is incorporated into First Responder Kit; I am sure this would be of help.
I presume it must be a statement earlier in the transaction.
It has archive mode to write to a table for the info to be persisted and ability to extract that info out as well.
Excellent documentation and very detailed SP that gets a ton of info to help troubleshoot blocking situation.
The most reliable blocking tool that I have found is beta_lockinfo written by  Erland Sommarskog.
At this point, my SQL Server knowledge runs dry, and I also have problems reproducing the issue; it occurs intermittently.
We have an UPDATE statement running in a large J2EE application that is getting blocked by some other statement.
