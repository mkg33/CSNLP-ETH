You may save yourself a lot of testing, since no matter how much you comment out in your vimrc file, vim will reset the 'compatible' option as soon as it finds a vimrc file, and this will set 'backupcopy' to "auto".
Only thing you can do is narrow the problem down by examining what is the »bad code« and what it's trying to tell you.
you wrote down make any sense at all, only shows when the specific code path is actually hit.
If this might be what is going on with Knife, then try adding :set bkc=yes to your vimrc file.
You could for example try to debug the problem by commenting all things of which you are not perfectly sure they don't cause your problem, try whether Knife works with this configuration and iteratively enable the previous commented out code until you get the error again.
Are you sure that it is vim's exit code, and not the status of the file you are editing?
Under :help 'backupcopy' there is a paragraph on iusing vim to edit your crontab file.
interpreted languages, only thing that can be done is checking for syntactic validity, but whether the function calls etc.
You can get there directly (but lose context) with :help crontab:
