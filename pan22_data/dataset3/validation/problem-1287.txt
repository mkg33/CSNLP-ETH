The items that would not work were my PS-2 KVM, the MP610 printer in-bulit USB hub, an external USB audio device (USB turntable).
And restart the system and check if the issue is resolved.
Anyway copying the missing USB.Inf files fixed the keyboard/mouse and other devices.
Copy "usb.inf" and "usb.PNF" from that directory to "C:\Windows\INF" may fix your problem.
I had exactly the same issue - which hit me when I was troubleshooting an issue with Samsung Kies software which was not detecting my Galaxy S2 phone correctly.
You may find more than one directories with this pattern,  I would use the most recent modified one.
I was seeing a few items that would simply not update drivers.
I would first request you to check if this USB mouse and keyboard is working on a different system(or other computer with win7) , if yes then check if the USB ports are working by connecting different USB devices.
But the USB Controllers were detected and seemed to be working.
If the issue still persistâ€™ s Click on start--type device manager--expand Universal Serial Bus controller and uninstall all the USB root hub's by right clicking on each of the USB root hub's.
What is so weird is that everything seemed to be working at first, but then the keyboard and mouse stopped working.
I could sense something was wrong with USB so tried to uninstall and re-install my USB drivers.
"C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\usb.inf_amd64_neutral_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
I'll re-post also if my Kies and boot up issues get's fixed.
Thank heavens I had an old PS2 mouse and keyboard handy.
From the start menu open 'Devices and Printers', right click your computer and select 'Device installation settings', then I normally select 'Install driver software from Windows Update if it is not found on my computer'.
If the other USB devices are working fine then please update the Chipset drivers from the manufacturer's website and restart the system and check.
Some USB based devices did work which was so weird.
It turns out my usb.inf-file has disappeared from c:\windows\inf.
One other issue was that on startup my PC is not giving me options for pressing F8.
Also, For anyone who also encountered this issue and is wondering where to find the file "usb.inf".
