Multicore CPUs deliver relatively linear performance gain (usually, 0.6-0.7x per additional core) at a usually lower power budget.
Single-core processors are not worthwhile these days.
45nm), given yield, if you scale up the frequency, on the high end of the spectrum the power will scale up much more than linear.
Nowadays processors technology are really advanced.
going from 2.9 GHz to 4.4 GHz is a ~50% overclock but power almost double.
All modern processors can shut down cores and go into lower power states.
Taking the idle power of the system (80 minuses the ~5-7 watt idle power that the CPU draws) you get around 54-100 Watt of peak CPU draw.
There are hardly any single core processors out there these days anyhow.
The reason behind the multicore computing is that for a given architecture (e.g.
For most consumer level CPUs sold today the frequency is at a fairly low level (e.g.
how about connecting to a power hungry computer at home to do some remote number crunching?</rant>
If you look at Intel's specfinder, you'll see that a Core 2 Solo uses significantly less power (look at max TDP) than a quad core i7, but a low-voltage dual-core Core i7 UM uses only a little bit more than the core 2 solo, and will be significantly faster.
All in all, scaling less frequency and more core will generally give you better performance in a well-parallelized task.
<rant>if you had a problem you need to think of parallelizing it to make it work reasonably, perhaps portable PC would not be the answer.
Note that it is system peak power, not CPU peak power that is measured.
2.93GHz above) so that a  modest overclock generally would not cause much increase in peak power, but at the higher end of the spectrum (enthusiest CPU market) you are going into the steeper part of the curve.
Intel processors call this SpeedStep, and basically what it does is runs the processor at a much lower clock speed, and only runs at a higher clock speed when that processor power is actually needed.
When you need one core, you can just run it on one core and park the others (on intel cpus, at least).
