What I did was to stop the lightdm service and reinstall the NVIDIA driver and then started the lightdm service again.
These are the methods I tried but NOT positive results.
here, I executing the script with sudo but the script also has another sudo in it.which caused the login issues (for me)
if name of the shell script is ChangePermission.sh
i ran the above script with sudo in terminal and caught in login loop problem.
WARNING : DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT WITHOUT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE !
I had made a change to my /etc/profile that wacked the PATH.
This has happened a few times before, but this last time it happened I noticed the resolution of the login screen was much lower than it was supposed to be.
So, I had the same issue which for me occurred after some upgrade and/or dist-upgrade.
Other times it happened I have resorted to reinstalling Ubuntu.
Anyway, if it happens again in the future, try that.
$sudo apt-get purge linux-headers-4.13.0-26-generic
( this script helps to change folder access permission )
Hold shift key while booting, and booted to 4.10.0-42 and removed 4.13.--
I figured this was caused by the NVIDIA driver not loading or something of that sort.
Thus i removed login loop issue by running the same script without sudo and resolved the issue.
Then, I rebooted and now I am happily writing to you from my xubuntu
I solved this problem on Ubuntu 16.04 by rolling back to previous kernel.
After careful analysis , found that i ran a shell script with sudo command but the shell script already has a sudo in it.
