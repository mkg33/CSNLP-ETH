Using RANCID for inventory tracking isnt all that pretty though.
I just grep what I am looking for from the config/inventory archive.
Plus, if you don't do config management it would take care of that for you as well.
The best options I have found are parsing CLI show inventory, "show mod" (for platforms that don't support show inventory), and polling ENTITY-MIB.
If you want something that will show you your gear in a rack type of diagram, I would recommend either of the following:
I run python scripts to parse inventory (for the same platforms) on a daily basis...
Switchmap is SNMP-based, but it might be worth taking a look at for building inventories of equipment, modules, etc.
You can set up the basic Zenoss monitoring server, it's supports Cisco Devices information gathering via SNMP.
Since this is all kept in a revision control system you can look back to see when a module was added or removed.
RANCID goes out and logs into all of your devices [launched via cron] grabs config/inventory, places it in a source control system and emails you config/inventory diffs.
This provides a lot of information just by adding an IP (like: IOS version, interfaces + IP configuration, ...)
Sadly, I have to use all three mechanisms, since there isn't a one-size fits all solution for all Cisco HW / SW permutations, unless Cisco NCS can do it...
