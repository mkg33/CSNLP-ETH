Thanks a lot to all of you, all your help give me new look to this problem in the end we are not going to buy any pop3 connector, we just agreed with our provider of our old server to configure that server as a backup and it should be okay than.
But again, thanks a lot for your time and patience
POP3 Connector was introduced and removed in 2003 SBS, you could use any 3rd party software or configure pop3 on each outlook instance to download email from the external/backup server to your exchange server.
However the issue with the password might be something tricky and you might wish to implement something like written on the Microsoft website here and here and set up an delegation account.
Here is a list of Backup & Recovery solution which will enable you to Backup your Exchange information store, to get in detailed check this link.
But as an idea (if your solution you build isnÂ´t an "Backup MX" as mentioned here) you could use imapsync to download emails from the 2nd IMAP postbox and store it inside the Exchange mailbox from the users on your side.
