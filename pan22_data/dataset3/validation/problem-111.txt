Right click on the file or folder and click "add to archive", and click the checkbox "delete files after archiving" in the option window that pops up.
When facing an inability to delete a file because of "the system cannot find the file specified" I've tried all the common tricks (verify permissions, verify it is not in use by any process, command line, free unlocker tools, etc) without success.
I had the same problem trying to delete a nested folder.
microsoft windows 7 cannot delete invalid files that was created by other operating systems like linux or other software.
Using 9.20 "7-zip File Manager" interface (not just the right click on file options) I was able to "Move" the folder which contained the problem files.
After trying all kinds of fixes, I used Winrar to rename the folder and file I was trying to delete.
[7-zip on my admin PC looking at volume with problem files over on a server, moved them off of server]  Sure, that just moves the problem but there is the beauty, you move them to a disk you can format: a VMDK, a thumb drive, etc... problem solved ;)
You must go to the software or operating system that created the file and delete from there.
For deleting stubborn files, folders I usually use Unlocker with quite good results:
