Additional info: in december i put the laptop to charge at work, after an hour or two i noticed that the laptop was so hot that i almost couldn't even grab it, i could fry eggs on it.
The question is: how could i see if the RAM Slot is broken besides doing this memtest?
But nothing else happended it was working as usual.
So i opened the laptop and started trying some stuff.
I noticed that my MacBook Pro 5,5 middle 2009 is very slow so i thought i had some malicious software in it but today i went to check something about the hardware in the computer under "About this Mac" and i noticed that i only had 2gb RAM which is wrong because i have 2 RAM memories of 2GB each.
So once again, how could i check if the memory slot is broken and in case it is how could i fix it?
Only way i found to check if one of the slots is broken was to do a memtest so i ran the command memtest all but i got no errors and the system didn't freeze.
But when changed the memory to the other RAM Slot the computer started with 2GB RAM as always and in conclusion both RAM memories are fine.
I removed one of them and the computer didn't even start i just got a beeping sound.
