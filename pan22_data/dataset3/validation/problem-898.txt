Drop it into your path environment and you could run "elevate iisreset" from a normal command prompt (or even "elevate cmd" from the start/run or a create a shortcut)
Paste that in notepad or something and save as .reg file.
If you want CMD.exe be always run as administrator, just add bellow reg code to your Registry:
To always run as admin only on your user just change HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to HKEY_CURRENT_USER
The only other way, other than what Dracs mentioned, is to disable UAC completely
There have been a couple tools that I've used that were other workarounds (in addition to what Jesse mentioned).
I think the easiest way to always run cmd as admin is to make the .reg file with the code below:
Note: This makes command prompt run as admin for all users.
This will cause the selected program to be launched as administrator.
The solution I use is to open command prompt by opening start menu, typing 'cmd' and pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter.
Back when Vista first came out, Microsoft came out with an "elevate" powerToy that was quite useful and did the job and still, I believe (haven't tested) works for Windows 7.
