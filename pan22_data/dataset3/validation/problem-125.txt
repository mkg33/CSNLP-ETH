Try to use "windows Offline" installation instead of "windows onLine" installation.
open the link above and select Offline installation.
The issue is related to running installation files with administrator rights.
Nothing is displayed on the screen (because I guess it is launched silently by the installation process), resulting in a timeout (as you can see in the jusched.log trace file)
Today (2016-02-05) the installer finished successfully.
If you download the installer, right click and "run as administrator" you will have no issues.
Another option is to reduce the level of authority windows requires to run .exe files.
I wasn't messing anything about Java, network settings nor temporary files.
The au.msi is correctly downloaded but Windows 10 will prevent its execution because the package is not signed.
I've been getting this error message on Win7 SP1 x64 for several weeks, since 2015-11-20 (when I made a screenshot of the message) until yesterday.
So either wait for Oracle to sign au.msi, either launch the offline installer as explained above
Therefore my guess is that Oracle has made some fix, please retry now.
