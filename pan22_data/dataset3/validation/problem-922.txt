Remmina uses a standard Remote Desktop feature ("Drive Redirection" channel).
Microsoft's Windows (and Mac) RDP client also implement this feature, so you can use it for Windows-to-Windows and Mac-to-Windows folder sharing as well.
The other option is SFTP (file transfer over SSH).
While the client side of this feature is implemented by Remmina, it is specified by the underlying protocol (RDP a.k.a.
For non-RDP file access, however, your best option is to provide SMBv2/3 by installing Samba on the Ubuntu system.
(Over LAN it will also be quite a bit faster than RDPDR.)
Install openssh-server on Ubuntu, then a client such as WinSCP on Windows.
The RDP server built into Windows implements the server side - this is the reason, why no additional tools are necessary within Windows.
(The Linux RDP clients cheat a bit by inventing a virtual drive for each folder you share.)
You can find the same feature in Windows' Remote Desktop client (mstsc), although it is only implemented in the form of sharing whole drives.
It is one of several channel types allowing the RDP server to send requests back to the client; all file access goes through the RDP client and is only possible as long as the RDP connection is active.
