I know this answer might sound strange... but consider using Hudson, you can make it do whatever you want to, just by some tweaking .. and writing the scripts..
Ansible also works well for deployment automation, to replace Fabric Capistrano (search for Ansistrano if you like the Capistrano model).
Then you can write some specific code on top of those roles to do what you want.
Have a look for Ansible roles (re-usable script modules from third parties) for your components - there are roles for WordPress, MariaDB/MySQL, and CloudFlare.
If you prefer to use Azure CLI, you can just embed the CLI commands in Ansible using the shell module as long as they are idempotent (have the same effect even if run again).
Ansible works fine to configure Linux VMs running on Azure, and if you want can also create Azure resources such as VMs, network interfaces and network security groups.
I would use Ansible - it's much simpler to get started with Ansible than Chef, Puppet or Saltstack, which all do a similar job but have a much steeper learning curve (just installing Puppet takes quite a while, due to need for server, whereas Ansible is just a single install command and requires no server.
Try the Jeff Geerling roles first, they tend to work well if they cover what you need.
