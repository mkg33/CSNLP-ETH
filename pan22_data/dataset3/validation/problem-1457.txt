If BindsTo is used, whenever svc-init is restarted, this service will be restarted as well.
Assuming you can't get rid of the scripts and have systemd do all the setup itself (which you almost certainly can, but whoever wrote the scripts might not know how; yell at the vendor/developer until they learn) I think you should be using only one unit file for this.
The unit will fail to start if the program called here fails to exit successfully.
Configured like this, when svc-init starts from a stopped state, it will wait to trigger any svc instances until after svc-init finishes launching (Before/After) and will only do so when svc-init finishes launching successfully (BindsTo).
If svc-init is given a stop command, all svc instances will be stopped at the same time as svc-init (BindsTo).
In a single unit file, you will run the init script in an ExecStartPre= option.
BindsTo tells systemd that if the named service is stopped for any reason, this one is too.
If svc-init is given a restart command, svc-init and any depending services will be stopped and then started.
Either of these is a stronger version of the Wants you list in your examples.
Systemd can be hard to reason about, but this seems like a good experiment to try:
Before tells systemd that svc-init needs to be all the way done before any named service will be started.
Using it with an After or Before declaration ensures that this stopping happens in the correct order.
This should give you your explicit must-complete ordering.
After mimics the Before in the svc-init service, and may be more convenient for you.
Once that is done, then any svc instances are started.
If svc-init is intended to launch-then-exit, you might need a SuccessExitStatus= declaration in its Unit section to tell systemd which exit-codes are expected on a successful launch.
Depending on your needs, you may want to use Requires instead of BindsTo, since Requires indicates that only stop this service when the named service is explicitly stopped.
Declaring it in both places is not an error, nor is it required.
