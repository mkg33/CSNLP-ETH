what you need to do is update the firefox to max and install all the update of the pulgins who come in...
But from now on, try adding add-ons one at a time.
Now somehow, firefox locks up a few times a day, with CPU usage going up to 100% and staying there.
There's no easy way to to do other than what Richard said.
I've found (after googling for other search terms) the following page, which is quite helpful:
It lists some of the plugins that I'm using as problematic - Firebug, DownThemAll, Adblock Plus - with some good hints and workarounds for some of the problems.
It's easy to get excited, add many, and not be sure what is messing up.
Once you have shown which group has the problem, repeat by halving that group.
Is there some way I could attach a debugger (this being on a linux box), or detect what's going on "inside" in another way?
I'm using firefox with a handfull of plugins, probably like everyone else.
Now here's the question: Is there an easy way to find the plugin that causes the problem?
these issues happen due non compatible versions...
I'm particularly looking for an easier way than to disable plugin after plugin and waiting to see what happens.
