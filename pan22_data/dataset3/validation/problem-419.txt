To see what is set at startup you can do the following:
The downside here is that if your application does not have it's on web front end, you might have a problem getting to the interactive interface when you are running it as a service.
It only takes a few seconds to recover from sleep mode, and all my applications are returned to the same state.
Each of these applications will allow your .exe to be run as a system service.
By using the sleep and hibernation features of your laptop, you can reduce the number of reboots required.
As for Wireless you could disable the connection, but that would me enabling it each time you want to use it.
Basically install this .NET service which then generically executes any process listed in its INI.
My laptop is usually plugged in, so I usually just use sleep mode.
There is actually a tool that allows you to run arbitrary applications as services, I just can't remember the name, right now.
Also think about adding Memory, more memory can translate to faster computer(usually)
Again, all your open applications will be in the same state.
This takes more time than recovering from sleep mode, but it will likely be less time than a full reboot.
Most non User services are doing exactly what you are asking, starting before you logon.
However you should check how many items are showing next to the clock in the bottom right(unless you've moved the taskbar).
Alternatively, Vista has a greatly improved Task Scheduler, which enables you to do this kind of thing, too.
When the laptop is powered on again, the RAM contents are restored from the harddrive.
I would recommend using either ApplicationAsService or Basta Computing's AppToService
This is not a direct answer to your question, but recently I have found myself rarely booting my Vista laptop.
Hoping to find a "free solution" to save me the 1hr of coding, I was sad to see FireDaemon Lite is no longer available.
Being a developer, I find it just as easy to whip together a .NET service that could do this.
If you are not sure what something is then don't touch it.
Just be very careful about deselecting things, and do them one at a time rebooting between them.
Everyone of those items is starting up when you login and many may be associated with one id.
This means all the RAM is saved to the harddrive, then the laptop shuts itself off.
Thanks @Axxmasterr for those answers, another common tool is FireDaemon.

Many apps have a management interface for just this kind of situation.
Many people end up with too many items in there by installing every toolbar that is offered to them which will slow you boot time.
