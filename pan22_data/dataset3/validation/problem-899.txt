Second, can you use System Restore to go back to a known good state before trying to install VirtualBox?
Of course you want to trust them to enable all of VirtualBox's features.
Third, use the Certificates MMC snap-in to look in both your user store and computer stores for any certificates from Oracle or Sun - and delete them.
After installing VirtualBox 4.1.8r75467 on a Windows 7 64 bit host, the bridge adapter doesn't appear to have been installed.
No error message during install, and yes I did confirm during the installation.
This response here about the MaxNumFilters registry value fixed the problem for me:
You don't mention details about your adapter configuration.
This is a blocking issue, and I'm out of things to try.
I was experiencing similar trouble, and while some of the ideas here helped ultimately the issue was VirtualBox getting hung up on my existing bridged network adapter.
Hope this helps, I was searching for solution for a few months and found nothing.
Raising limit for network filters also helped with Symantec Network Threat Protection (in a perfectly working SEP, firewall module was disabled and not present in the interface).
I think such problems occur if you had installed several different VPNs or similar software on one PC.
VirtualBox bridge adapters also work correctly now.
First, did you verify the MD5SUM/SHA256 hash of your download with the versions stored on the download page: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
This should ensure that you get a prompt when installing asking if you want to trust the device/vendor.
It doesn't show in device manager, and in VB, changing Settings > Network > Attached To to Bridged Adaptor shows only Not Selected in the Name dropdown.
I don't think the bridged adapter is supposed to show up in the device manager, just the VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter - I am guessing that doesn't show up either?
I saw a lot of entries in device manager when I showed the hidden ones, so I set the max limit to 24, and the install appears to have worked.
