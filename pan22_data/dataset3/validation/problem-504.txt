How do I use ffmpeg to combine the ts files described by index.m3u8 into a single mp4 container using the copy codec?
I use the for loop to ensure the correct order of the files.
The correct way to concat multiple video files from m3u8 playlist is
Using the Juan Aquino's answer (and correcting the first command to be compatible with Bash and using the natural ordering of files), plus the 7vujy0f0hy's answer, a simple working script for a Linux Bash shell is:
You can do the concatenating simple like so (with bash):
But converting the ts files themselves seem to work fine.
All the popular answers to this question that mislead readers to concatenate the TS files before running ffmpeg are incorrect.
Replace <number> with the highest number (obviously).
I've got a bunch of ts segments described by a single index.m3u8 file:
The two preparatory lines of code just create a file containing a list of TS files in this line format:
I'd like to combine them into a single mp4 container.
where the generate the filelist.txt from the index.m3u8 file, it complains about not being able to read various files.
To ensure the audio and video do not fall out of sync during the assembly of the mp4 stream, the poorly documented but important "-f concat" feature of ffmpeg should be used.
Maybe itâ€™s even possible to pipe the output to ffmpeg and convert it to mp4 on the fly.
