If you'd like to make an assumption that each unique client IP address is a unique visitor, then you can just feed all the logs for the time period you want through cut -d ' ' -f 1 |sort -u |wc -l (assuming the standard log format where the client IP is the first field).
I don't want to install AWStats just to get the numbers right now.
So for 3 days in November right up to now, Analytics reckons there's been 1,586 unique visitors to my site.
Bottom line, the logs are difficult to go through, but this is crude and relatively quick
LINE 6: Use uniq counting function to group these lines by the date and tell us how many is in it
LINE 2: remove the "time" portion of the timestamp, so we can group the lines by date
I have several servers' apache access logs (multiple servers serving the same domain).
It's very very crude, but it's easy and quick-ish and easy to join multiple log files.
I',m on linux, so the linux environment solution is preferable
This piece of shell gives me 1402 visitors, which is not far off, all things considered.
You can't determine actual unique human visitors from an access log.
LINE 3: move the date to the start of the line, so we can sort by date (this isn't necessary for a single log file, but you can modify the script to use multiple files and sort by date, this helps here)
This works on Apache's combined format only, you need to modify it if that's not what you're working on
It's difficult to track unique visitors by using the Apache access logs, but if you want a quick crude measure that you can do with shell, I've used and tested the following.
LINE 1: prints the IP, timestamp and User agent of the client from the access log
LINE 4: sort | uniq basically sorts all the lines and removes duplicates (i.e.
I've formatted it over multiple lines here to explain it a little better.
What's the simplest way to calculate unique visitors for a given period.
This doesn't take into account monitoring, spiders, NAT, proxies, or dynamic IP addresses, but you can't do much better than that without spending (much) more time than it would take to setup awstats.
multiple hits from the same IP, on the same day with the same user agent is counted now as 1 hit - this is the magic)
