I would imagine that you should be able to use squid for this.
I work in an environment which heavily utilises non-standard restricted ports in URL's for development environments for instance ports 81-104 & 444-456.
As a front end developer this causes many problems with our testing e.g.
AFAIK it can do URL redirections and port translations (in both directions).
most browsers won't load webpages using these ports at all or they require startup flags or heavy configuration.
This is something the server admins aren't willing to change at the moment so I"m looking for a way to be able to hit a local URL that routes to these URL's using non standard ports.
Are there other options or tools I should consider?
For remote proxies, you can utilize nginx, squid, or varnish.
For local proxies, you can try Fiddler (http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/) or Charles Proxy (http://www.charlesproxy.com/).
If you're looking to view a page in your browser over the standard HTTP port (80) that's generated by a server listening on a non-standard port (e.g., 81), you'd need to set up either a remote proxy on a server or a local proxy on your workstation to handle redirection.
