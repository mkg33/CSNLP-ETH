An attacker that has access to your Windows machine WILL have access to the files on Ubuntu.
However, the partition itself will be visible and it may be possible to format or delete the partition.
I am going to partition disk on my laptop and install Ubuntu and Windows 10 separately.
Windows doesn't understand linux filesystems, so unless a third party driver is installed the content of linux filesystems will not be visible through the windows filesystem APIs.
I am going to work with and store leak-critical files on Ubuntu (like private keys and etc.)
An attack on Windows (such as a virus or hacker) will not be able to read the files on your Ubuntu partition.
I don't know whether you will be able to decrypt encrypted files, as I've never tried it.
I assume that if I get some virus on Windows 10 it would not get access to files on Ubuntu.
A virus would have difficulty snooping on the files, as there is no native support for extN file systems, but a destructive virus could delete or reformat the partition.
However, if the attackers software is running with sufficiently high privilages it can access the underlying partition directly.
I use this all the time, though usually in read-only mode.
If you install ext2fsd you will be able to mount and access ext2/3/4 partitions from Windows.
Whilst Ubuntu can read NTFS, Windows cannot read ext4 out of the box.
To do so there would need to be a common encryption standard between Windows and Linux: I don't know if such exists.
It depends on how much effort the attacker/virus writer is willing to go to.
By default, your Windows installation will use NTFS as the file system and Ubuntu will use ext4.
The malware could include it's own implementation of common Linux filesystems and use it to search for valuable files on Linux partitions.
Only way to mitigate that is by encrypting your Ubuntu partition.
