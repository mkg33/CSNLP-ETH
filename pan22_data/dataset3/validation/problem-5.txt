Every single device does not exceed the limit in total they overload the circuit and may start the wires start the fire.
There is actual short-circuit and this faulty connection may start the fire.
One more possibility: Does your laptop charger have a Linetek LS-15 cable attached to it?
Or you prefer buing new laptop or paying off the fire?
More likely there's a small earth fault with your charger/lead.
If the charger is consistently causing the breaker switch to trip, then it is probably fried.
If cold it breaks slightly later, in hot slightly earlier.
If your AC adapter's power cable is affected, contact your system's manufacturer to get a replacement.
the latter typically has a TEST button and a rating in mA.
You can overload it by using power demanding devices at once - for example fridge is on, micorwave is on, washer is on and you connect the laptop.
As I understand your question, the first two options are out - You plug in your charger as usual and it suddenly fails.
This, too can cause the adapter to trip the circuit breaker.
Taking possible costs to account, dispose the charger as soon as possible and buy a new one.
Is it tripping the circuit-breaker, or is it tripping the Residual Current Device (RCD)?
The circuit may be overloaded also by switching on transformer or asynchronous engine.
For short ammount of time they may be considered as a short-circuit and may lead to breaker cutoff.
If the cord was made between mid-2010 and mid-2012, chances are good it's affected by a recall, which was due to a defect causing a possible internal short in the cable and a fire hazard.
The breaker cuts off when the current through it exceed nominal value at nominal temperature.
