With SSDs the importance of backing up is not diminished at all.
We work for a building/plubming/painting company and all their employees have laptops in their cars.
An average SSD is mature enough for everyday use, and depending on the use cases, could have a better lifespan than a traditional drive.
I have yet to see a SSD with a warranty over 1 year, this is probably due to the drives being relatively untested in production systems, it could also indicate the manufacturer believes that the drives are not as reliable as platter based disks.
This has nothing to do with the expected failure of blocks.
Tradies aren't known for being gentle with equipment, and the laptops get thrown around a lot.
It is pricey, but not compared to the cost of a brand new laptop.
It's up to you to balance the cost/benefit ratio, but I upgraded my 3 year old laptop with an SSD and the difference is absolutely amazing.
Between wear-leveling and spare blocks to handle failures, I've never seen a recent SSD that could start experiencing block failures within a three-year lifespan of nonstop writes.
This artical (http://www.internetnews.com/storage/article.php/3801821/HP+Lays+Out+SSD+Datacenter+Ambitions.htm) reveals three main issues re the enterprise SSD.
Using other people's laptops with their 5400rpm drives is pretty much unbearable now.
Unless these 3 issues are addressed, we won't see the SSD widely adopted in enterprise level.
My experience is that SSDs have a much higher failure rate than hard drives, due to the immaturity of the technology, and immaturity of the products developed around the technology.
This topic was recently discussed in an episode of .NET Rocks and they came to the conclusion that RAID based mirroring was probably the answer, as long as the disc is replaced quickly the data will always be protected from hardware failure.
Of course, you should always be backing up regularly, because mechanical drives are relatively likely to fail.
Seconds feel like minutes while waiting for those ancient things to spin and churn.
Hard disks have been the biggest bottleneck in non-gaming computing for the past decade.
In cases where a lot of physical abuse is likely -- lots of heat or vibration -- SSDs will generally be more reliable than a traditional mechanical drive.
Either they're cheap and their write performance is too poor, or they're expensive and they have enough spare blocks.
If the drive is going to experience undue mechanical stress, I've seen SSDs experience much lower failure rates than hard drives.
In this situation, any SSD is going to be great, because there's no moving parts and thus no heads to get stuck and scratch the buggery out of the drive when it gets dropped in the middle of booting up.
For reliability in rough environments, any SSD is probably going to out-rate a normal hard drive.
An important thing to consider is the warranty, a typical enterprise SAS hard drive comes with a 5 year warranty.
The laptop feels brand new -- even though the processor and RAM are medium-range from 3 years ago, the hard disk was the bottleneck.
