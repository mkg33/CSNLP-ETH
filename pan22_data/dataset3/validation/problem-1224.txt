My solution was to run a cable to my office and just get LAN speeds from the router.
Depending on the model of the power-line adapters you're using, you may not be able to have more than the two nodes on the system.
Edit: I forgot to mention that these devices should NOT be plugged into a surge protector or battery backup.
There are some that will allow up to 64, but without knowing the model number of your adapters, the best I can do for you is guess.
I had more than three nodes in my house at one time, and after the fourth was put in place, the system would not work properly for some of the other nodes.
Another thing to keep in mind is that anyone close to you could potentially use the same technology to get onto your network, so use the builtin encryption for the system if you're able.
Surge protectors can actually interfere with the signals that the power-line adapters are sending out when they're conditioning the lines.
As for your speed issue, this would all depend on how much bandwidth each device is using as the maximum speeds of the power-line adapters is shared between all of the other devices, as well as the fact that only one device can be communicating at a time if I'm not mistaken.
