You will be unable to just copy and paste folders to your new drive if you want to migrate your installation, you should clone your HDD.
The other two system folders don't need to be migrated.
WindowsApp will automatically be restored once you connect to the same Microsoft account and install any missing UWP applications.
You can sync your account by configuring OneDrive on your new system.
What do I do with these folders to achieve the goal stated in the first paragraph above please?
I wish to move all of my data from A and B then physically swap their locations and give drive B the current letter of drive A.
SkyDrive is the legacy synchronization folder for SkyDrive/OneDrive and has not been used for 3 years.
My difficulty: there are 4 folders in drive A for which I don't know what to do with them:
In addition, there are some hidden folders: $AVG, msdownld.tmp, and OneDriveTemp.
The content of those folders should not be migrated.
I have a Windows 10 x64 Pro (for which I am the only user), an internal hard drive A (that is not the OS drive) and  an external hard drive B (an internal drive trapped inside an external USB enclosure).
