They may hardcode their application to look in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 for example.
In Windows 7 if you go to [Control Panel] > [Administrative Tools] > [Computer Management] > [Storage] > [Disk Management] you will see all your partitions (even optical drives, floppy drives, and flash drives).
Programmers SHOULD reference the boot partition by variable thus if you change it then the program will still work but programmers are often lazy.
I would stick with C: for compatibility reasons, as you suggested.
If windows isn't on C the application is going to die.
Something that helps us humans relate to computers.
That said, I agree with the contents of Keltari's answer.
You could make your "Windows" drive A:, your CD ROM P: and your USB drive: Z:.
Partitions are logical divisions on storage media.
Drive letters, such as A: B: C: are not partitions.
If you right click on a partition/device there is an option [Change Drive letter].
I've definitely had problems with programs opening "Save as..." dialogs in nonexistent folders and either generating error popups or creating unwanted directories.
Drive letters are logical assignments to a file system made by the OS.
I'm sure that lots of programs out there just assume that the primary drive on Windows machines is C:, just like some programs assume that all Windows machines have the same path for My Documents or other common folders.
Windows will reserve the A: and B: drive for floppy disks, however you can assign other volumes to A: and B: if you desire in disk management.
Sure, it's the programmer's fault, but you're going to be the one stuck with software that doesn't work, so....
Windows sees it as a series of devices and partitions.
AFAIK since Windows Vista the system partition always gets "C:" independent of the drive letter you installed it onto.
Drive letters can be removeable media, hard disks, and other parts of a file system.
As other pointed out partitions and drive letters are not the same thing.
