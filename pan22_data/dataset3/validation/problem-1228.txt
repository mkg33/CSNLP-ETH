If you found some game he liked and helped him recreate it (even on a very superficial yet still graphically similar level) you may really get him going.
I'm listening to iWoz at this point (which seems to be targeted at that age group and would be quite inspirational), by that age he was putting together some pretty advanced circuitry--but his father only ever answered questions, never handed him new concepts he wasn't ready for)
Also check ACM's K-12 CS Curriculum Resources, particularly page 11 and 12 of A Model Curriculum for Kâ€“12.
Or, even better yet, if you found an existing open source game he might like, let him play it then show him how to make little modifications you might be able to get him excited.
It's been going for years and years, has been translated into many languages---and the articles give info on how to run the sessions, what materials are needed and tips form people who have run them before.
Kids can be really impressed with something simple though.
You may want to look up topics covered in IOI competitions and national competitions.
(Modifications always seem to be the best way to get started)
A 12-14 year old that WANTS to should be able to handle just about anything, but he has to pull it in his own time, you can't really push complicated concepts to young people (or for the most part anyone).
We go to schools and do the activities with children, or they come to Uni to do them with us.
A good source of problems to get youngsters thinking about theory in CS, and solving the problems themselves, is the "Computer Science Unplugged" http://csunplugged.org/ series.
Or he may be completely disinterested and there is nothing you will be able to do about it.
There are  summer schools and workshops related to IOI competitions starting at quite early age.
In my experience, it is not difficult to teach basic topics in combinatorics, graph theory, programming, algorithms and similar topics.
My personal favorite topic for such workshops is combinatorial game theory since it is easy to motive by playing games with the audience.
Depends on the person you are teaching and the area of that range.
