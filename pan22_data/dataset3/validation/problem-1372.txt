Then connect the modem to the TP-Link in any of the LAN outputs and you are done.
Better to enable DHCP in the modem and disable it in your TP Link router.
You should be able to manage the modem using http://192.168.1.1 and the TP-Link with http://192.168.1.254.
Basic connection is : straight LAN cable, from modem WAN output to router WAN input.
I have TP Link router with WAN input and 4 LAN outputs.
Anything you then connect to the TP-Link, via WiFi or LAN will get its IP from the modem because it is and should be the only DHCP server in the network, and everything will be able to connect to the Internet without extra NAT.
To do this connect directly to it in isolation using http://192.168.100.1, then you should be able to connect to it with http://192.168.1.254
If I am not wrong they should not be able to communicate each other, because there is a different subnet mask on 192.168.100.1
EDIT : I do have occasional packet loss, is it possible to have that due to bad network configuration?
My ISP gave me modem, that modem only has 1 WAN output (to connect to my router).
DHCP Server is disabled on modem, but enabled on TP Link router, I have already setup DHCP to give my home PCs certain IP addresses.
