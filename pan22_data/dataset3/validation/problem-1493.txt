Add groups and users to this group which you want to have said access to this folder.
To give Linux the same Finesse as windows in file privileges you have to nest groups.
Create a group FooGroup that has the desired access to the folder.
haven't tried this, but how about a public readable directory with an encrypted user-space FS inside (for example encfs).
Since your friend (likely) has a unique group associated with his/her user name change the group ownership of the directory in question to that group, most likely the friend's user name.
would grant both of you full rwx access to the directory and its entire contents.
And then try to obfuscate the location like how nik suggested.
Please note that this assumes that no other user has been added to your friend's group.
In order to be able to share the contents between the two of you you should retain ownership as the user:
It is a big pain to have a group for each folder or file but it is the best way to restrict access at the same level as Windows.
Create one group that has access to your folder as you would like your friend to have.
So if you can add your friend to your group and then mark the folder in question as g+rwx, you'll be set.
By default, each user on an Ubuntu system also has an associated group of the same name.
Add him to that group or the group he resides in to that group.
You may use the groups command to see each group to which your friend, or arbitrary user, belong.
Additionally, unless the permissions have been changed for some reason, you should be able to view the /etc/group file which contains the group assignments for each group on the system.
Then assign appropriate permissions to the directory, dependent upon what access you wish the other user to have:
Then you can share that password with your friend and no one else can make use of that data (well, I guess they could get the data and run a password cracker offline?
The system would not have likely have made this assignment, however, as was mentioned before, the root user may do what they choose.
I vaguely remember this use case being cited as the reason to create a group for each user.
