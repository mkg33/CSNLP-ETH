I tried right-click->Rename, and when I did that, the rename dialog that came up showed that the folder was already called "My Documents".
Once this was done, I went to access a file in my D:\My Documents directory.
After a couple of weeks, repeated system crashes and Microsoft's takedown of the web site that they set up to allow those of us with the VS Vista discs to get registration keys, I gave up and went back to Windows XP.
My main computer is a Windows XP machine, and I've had it for a few years.
However, despite all of this (including reboots and the like), it still shows up as "Aric's Documents" when viewing the folder in explorer.
Note that I have not yet marked it as a special system folder, XP still thinks that c:\documents and settings\whatever is where I'm keeping my documents.
Rather than truly replace it, I dug up an old 30G hard drive and decided to reinstall onto it, putting all of my data onto a separate drive in the computer.
I selected it, hit "F2", and renamed it to "My Documents".
After a brief moment of panic on discovering that it was gone, I discovered that no, it had been renamed (presumably by Vista) to "Aric's Documents".
When I double click on it, "D:\My Documents" shows up in the title bar.
Explorer took the change, but then it continued to show as "Aric's Documents" in the folder window.
I had a directory called "D:\My Documents" and I told Vista to use that as my "My Documents" directory.
I've been holding out for Windows 7, but a few months ago, the hard drive started failing and I needed to replace it.
I had a Windows Vista install disk from the Visual Studio launch event, so I decided to go ahead and try it.
