And it does not cost you anything to have at least basic firewall on all computers.
Your router will be acting as a NAT gateway, which means that nothing can come in unless your specifically allow it, so in this respect, you don't need a firewall.
One example that comes to mind is if one of your computers gets infected from e.g.
USB drive, there is nothing stopping it to propagate through network.
I continue to use Zone Alarm Free for that reason alone.
As mentioned in other posts, assuming your "router" is a NAT router, you should be relatively safe from any attacks from probing from the internet.
I want to know when an application (malicious or not) is trying to call home or has some other reason to access my Internet connection.
I wouldn't worry about installing a 3rd party firewall unless you requires special features such as filtering outbound traffic.
However, as mentioned, it's worth protecting the machines from each other.
Then I can select whether to allow or disallow that access.
Personally, I like Comodo, but it's down to personal taste.
That alone should be enough to protect you from any attacks from infected machines on your LAN.
I don't feel that there is any need for a 3rd party firewall.
It notifies me when an application is trying to access the Internet.
Also, if it happens that router's firewall has some flow, you have additional protection.
However, as also mentioned, the machines on your LAN are still vulnerable to attacking each other if one of them gets infected by a virus.
I can also tell Zone Alarm whether to warn me each time that application tries to access the Internet to just to always block/allow access for that application each time.
Most modern operating systems (Windows XP SP2, Windows Vista, Windows 7, most Linux distros, Mac OS X) ship with firewall which is on by default.
I use a software firewall for outbound protection.
