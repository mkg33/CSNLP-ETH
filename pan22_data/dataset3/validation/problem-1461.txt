This have to be coded into the application and can not be set by any program as far as I know.
Certain ram intensive programs can still make my important programs freeze up by sending them to the page file.
I need a utility that changes the memory priority of the process.
You will probably have much better results by increasing the amount of ram in your computer.
I have hit problems with working-set draining in processes that accidentally got set to low memory priority in several cases.
I need to stop this, and I need to be able to select the EXACT priority of any program.
Please note that this is not "process priority" or cpu priority.
As far as I know there is no way to make sure a process stays in memory on Windows.

You can set memory priority with SetProcessInformation:
The restart manager and task scheduler can both end up doing this.
It sounds like you either need to write your code in the kernel in High IRQL and access only none paged memory which is a very bad idea, or change the target OS to a real time OS.
In Windows the MM will only page-out pages that are not being accessed for some time, also when "Context switch" happens your code will stop running.
There is a Win32 API called VirtualAlloc() that will allocate memory in such a way that the memory manager won't try to push it to disk.
I need to know how to change "memory priority" of a process.
