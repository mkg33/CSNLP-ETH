I know that sounds a bit overkill (it totally is) but I feel like this is what you may actually be looking for.
So, You won't be able to update completely from one system.
It will even give you fine-grained control over which updates are pushed & to which machines.
The functionality you seem to be looking for is available in Windows Server, & the role is called "Windows Server Update Services" (or just "WSUS").
And update won't work if Metered connection is on.
Instead, the download is broken down into smaller parts.
The other 3 PCs will get updates from the Microsoft server, updated PC on the LAN and even from the PCs on the Internet.
So, if you already had update KB4019089 & another machine on the network needed that update, it would pull it from the servers at Microsoft, but also partially from your local machine, like Bittorrent (assuming certain criteria were met, as @MechtEngineer pointed out).
The key to it is in two inconspicuous words in the first sentence of the FAQ:
Windows doesnâ€™t download the entire file from one place.
My understanding of this feature led me to believe it was more of a P2P means of data de-duplication across networks.
