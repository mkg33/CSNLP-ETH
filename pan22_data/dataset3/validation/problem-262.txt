Assuming SSD's are extremely prone to faliure how economical would it be to load an OS into main memory and run it from there?
I can think I can deal with a few obvious drawbacks (I've survived inside the bounds of a 20gig VM for the last 2 years), but what are the pro's, con's, requirements and cost for running Windows 7 or the latest Fedora or Ubuntu distro strictly from RAM.
4gb ram edition/8gb ram edition/16gb ram edition, in which 2gb/4gb/12gb are used to load files from the harddisk... etc.
Just so there's no confusion, I'm not saying run the OS from a USB stick or live CD.
the problem is that doing this particular thing is not easy, and given the estimated users that will do that, it will not be very economically sound for software/OS manufacturers/developers to do that.
I'm saying, start the computer, transfer the entire OS into memory from a external HD or 'the cloud' or a big memory stick and run it there.
admittedly, with the current price of RAM, it becomes a very attractive option for us to run the whole OS from RAM and loading it from harddisk only in the startup (and writing it during shutdown journal-commit style).
When the machine turns off, save the state to the external storage.
however for linux it may be an option and one can try to specify the amount of ram available and make a tailor-made OS for it.
