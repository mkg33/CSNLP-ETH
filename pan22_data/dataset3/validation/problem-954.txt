However if you like the idea of re-installing them all... :)
If one gets cracked, potentially all your machines are compromised.
All access to the password list is logged, and the user needs to enter a motivation for retrieving the root password of a server.
I wouldn't use passwords that you can work out, e.g.
On-line authentication is typically done with an authentication/authorization (AA) system like Kerberos.
When provisioning a VM you can typically settle for not having any root password, and just assign on-line authentication/authorization.
These are randomly selected 10 character passwords that will be difficult to brute force.
Previously the off-line password list was a printed list stored in a safe.
If a cracker were to discover a user password they would still need at least three RSA number generations in a row before being able to duplicate future generations.
I'd advise against sharing passwords between machines.
Personally, I'd use some software designed to store passwords in a secure manner, such as Keepass.
For off-line administration of critical systems the root passwords are stored separately (in our case in a physically disconnected system).
(The '-s' makes them random, pwgen's default is to make them pronounceable)
With that many systems two factor authentication via LDAP would work well.
It's very unlikely that you need to administrate VM machines when your AA servers are off-line.
I use at least 12 chars, and include numbers, uppercase & lowercase, but I do use the 'avoid similar looking characters' option, for times when you have to manually type the password.
Each administrator user is assigned the proper tokens and access rights on the servers
Most places uses two sets of passwords: On-line authentication and off-line passwords.
