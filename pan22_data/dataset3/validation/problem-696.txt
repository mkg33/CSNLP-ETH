You should script out those things you want from master (such as logins).
Running this command gets me the following error.....
This is especially true of the master database, which contains most of the configuration information for the database server.
With a non-system database this is certainly the case.
While user databases can be upgraded to newer versions, systems databases cannot.
I backed up the master database on a machine with SQL Server 2008 version 10.00.1600.
I have not been able to find much help regarding this, so any information would be much appreciated.
Use a third party tool (such as redgate) to make things easier if needs be.
Then I turned on SQL Server in single-user mode on the new machine with SQL Server 2008 R2 version 10.50.1600 with the following command (using sqlcmd)
I haven't ever attempted this with a system database and it may be that SQL Server will prevent it from occurring.
Since I am restoring from a lower version, to a higher version, I assume the restore should be able to complete?
As other posters have said doing this with a system database wont work.
Plan B would be to upgrade the source server to R2 and then restore master to the target server but you've likely considered this approach.
Running the following command on both servers allowed me to verify that the version numbers I posted in the beginning are correct.
