More cores will not help unless you have a lot of simultaneous connections.
However, the main problem of heavy write access to ibdata1 can only be amended by transaction-read-only.
If it is using MyISAM, then key_buffer_size = 50M would be advised.
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 100M may be better and may be safe on your tiny machine.
The machine is idle, still a simple (text-only page) request take about 8 seconds.
I figure that this is due to locking and assuring ACID properties.
I have a small virtual Server: 2 Cores, 2 GB RAM, Windows Server 2012 R2, Plesk, MySQL 5.6 (my.ini see below).
On processing a request, the Windows Ressource Manager shows, that mysqld.exe is writing a lot to file ibdata1.
So the question: What can I do to make the DB (and thus the web-server) more responsive without changing the hardware?
A good idea would probably to use a faster HDD, or to move ibdata1 to a SSD.
This however, is not a suitable solution, as I need the DB to be writeable to add new articles.
Setting both query_cache_size = 0 and query_cache_type = OFF is the way to completely turn off the Query cache, which is advised for most production systems.
Another idea would be to make Wordpress use the SET TRANSACTION statement at runtime when not needing write access, but this only helps to visitors, not authors/admins.
Upgrading is unlikely to make a significant difference.
Vary query_cache_limit between 0 and 10MB, innodb_log_buffer_size and innodb_buffer_pool_size between 4MB and 20MB.
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2 will use less I/O than = 1.
With the other settings, I could reduce response times of Wordpress pages to around 3-4 seconds.
If you would like further analysis, provide SHOW VARIABLES; and SHOW GLOBAL STATUS; after it has been up for at least a day.
However, this is not possible as it is a virtual server.
I even tried to loose ACID properties, by setting transaction-isolation=READ-UNCOMMITTED.
When I uncomment the last line of my.ini, thus making DB read-only, requests are answere in 0.3-0.8 seconds.
I could upgrade the server (more cores, more RAM, more disk space, but I don't think faster) but I do not see how this should help.
Only a single Wordpress installation is running there.
I already tried all kinds of different settings for MySQL.
What is the value of SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Max_used_connections';?
