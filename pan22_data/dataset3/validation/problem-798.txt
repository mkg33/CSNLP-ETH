Unfortunately Synergy tries to enumerate all available entry formats via EnumClipboardFormats, which should also be no problem, but somehow it is.
I seem to have the same problem and I found it annoying enough to spend time to debug and fix it (for me).
In Synergy EnumClipboardFormats returns only the first format which is CF_UNICODETEXT for plain text and something completely different for everything else.
According to the code that should not be a problem since each entry has several formats and always plain text UTF-16 encoded, which is what Synergy expects.
The symptom is that seemingly all non-plain-text entries in the clipboard are ignored.
I wrote a simple test program and there was no problem with that approach.
Replacing CMSWindosClipboard::get with the method below did fix the problem for me.
This can be nicely verified by opening MS Word and the clipboard view, since entries there have little icons identifying the format of the entry.
Instead of returning the other formats, as my test program, in Synergy the next call to EnumClipboardFormats returns error 183 (ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS) which makes no sense and is not documented.
