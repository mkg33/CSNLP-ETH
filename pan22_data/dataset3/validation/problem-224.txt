However, as we are a multinational, we use [office designation]-[username] or [office designation]-[department][4 digit number] for workstations, e.g.
Hardware servers follow the same path - FS-12345ABCDE or IBM-1234ABC.
We also use Roman gods for our various remote boxes.
Plus, we rebuild each machine if a user leaves the company, so using the username makes more sense.
In our decentralized environment full of many servers, we use the following rule for servers: DDCCLo1Lo2Apxx
That system allows us to know where the servers are located from their name.
The only downside there is for short-term contractors, who tend to leave and be replaced with rather alarming frequency such that it's not always practical to rebuild their machine before their replacement arrives.
Uniquely connectable to hardware and never needs to be changed.
We're moving more to the username side now as it's assured they will be unique, and it helps with administration when a particular user needs assistance and remote control is sufficient to solve the issue.
