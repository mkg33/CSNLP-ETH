It's an alternative firmware for your router, offering a lot more possibilities.
Take a look at IPv4 to IPv4 Interface PortProxying.
Looks like you'll need to sit a Linux or Server 2003+ machine between your server and the router.
Of the manual you posted, page 39 is what you need.
You probably want to block TCP as well, I can't remember but Google might take TCP replies on these IPs as well.
I'm sure you looked into the windows HOSTS file, and realized that it will only supersede DNS requests, which is not going to help you here.
The link to the wiki for your router is: http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/DIR-600
Essentially you need a server to sit in the middle of your connection, or proxy to sit in the middle and intercept all traffic going to the Google DNS servers and rebuild the packets to redirect to an alternate destination.
As beeks said, it's not possible with your dlink official software and maybe you need a Linux server to redirect the traffic.
Not sure if you'll find a solution to do that on your consumer grade router.
But I think you can upgrade your router using dd-wrt.
The manual page is too brief to be sure, but you should be able to set up a firewall rule
The D-Link DIR-600 User Manual that you linked to, describes the router's firewall on page 39.
A Simple way to block any dns address is to add it to the WEBSITE FILTER on the D-Link Router I use it to block some IP blocks from my online gaming.

Sounds like you just want to block outgoing UDP to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, which you should be able to do fine if your system DNS is not set to that (guess Chromecast insists on using Google's DNS servers first?
