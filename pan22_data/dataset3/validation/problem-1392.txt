but on confluent , we can see that they fully recommended that zookeeper servers must works with SSD
I searched a lot in HORTONWORKS documentation , but not found the details about using SSD disks for zookeeper
we have HDP clusters version 2.6.0 / 2.6.1 ( hortonworks ) , and maybe in the future the version 3.0
Reference: https://docs.confluent.io/current/zookeeper/deployment.html
Solid state drives (SSD) are highly recommended as Zookeeper must have low latency disk writes in order to perform optimally.
You can use autopurge.purgeInterval and autopurge.snapRetainCount to automatically cleanup Zookeeper data and lower maintenance overhead.
Each request to Zookeeper must be committed to to disk on each server in the quorum before the result is available for read.
A dedicated SSD of at least 64 GB in size on each Zookeeper server is recommended for a production deployment.
so We want to know if we need to replace our disks with SSD disks ( only for the zookeeper )
Disk performance is vital to maintaining a healthy Zookeeper cluster.
