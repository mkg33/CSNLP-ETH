The defaults are "Nothing" (as in don't start the VM) for startup and "Save the virtual machine state" for shutdown.
However, the default seems to be to save state and resume, so you might want to reconfigure that to better suit your needs.
in the settings for the individual VM's, there is a section called "Automatic Start Action" and "Automatic Stop Action" that controls what happens when the host starts up or shuts down.
You can change the shutdown behavior by going into the server management console, opening up the Hyper-V section, right-clicking your VM, and configuring the preferences in there.
if this is just a stand-alone hyper-v server with no clustering or management from SCVMM, then when you reboot the host, the guests will do what they are configured to do.
so unless you have changed those setting from the default, then your VM's will not get rebooted.
If they're set to do a full shutdown when the host shuts down, then yes, a single reboot (from your end) will reboot all of them.
