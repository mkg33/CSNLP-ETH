This is something that one (even a very LARGE corporation) can't just purchase and emulate.
Azure Stack is not exactly the back-end software used by Azure in the datacenter, but is intended to be a consistent administrator, tenant, and developer experience to Azure.
Currently Azure is multiple data centers, multiple regions, and hundreds of thousands of machines.
Here is a nice video / presentation about Azure Stack that has been presented by Microsoft at Microsoft Ignite in may 2015 : https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/2015/BRK3479
In other words, can we manage an independent azure cloud?
Evaluation versions of Azure Stack (also known as Proof of Concept or POC) can be installed on hardware that meets minimum specified requirements for disks, memory, networking, CPUs, et cetera.
No, Azure is Microsoft's proprietary cloud infrastructure, and as far as I know, it's not for sale.
These do not have the capabilities of the full product in terms of performance, fault tolerance... but they do allow evaluation of the user experience and programming surfaces using the actual products capabilities (i.e.
Actual Azure software assumes scales of redundancy and management that aren't applicable at anything short of significant datacenter sizes.
Deployment, update, and management are handled significantly different between the scale of thousands of hosts vs. hundreds or even under 10.
You can also look at Cloud Platform System that is a Private Cloud implementation of Microsoft Solution & Dell Hardware

However Microsoft is working on an on-premises cloud offering, AKA - private cloud.
Full Azure Stack is currently partnering with OEMs for hardware + software solutions that are searchable on the web.
Workloads for tenants are meant to be shareable between on-premise and cloud.
Thus the reason it isn't offered as an on-premises or local installation.
There are a number of online articles on this, including Microsoft MVPs who have built suitcase (and smaller) versions of this for under $5000 (US.)
I've no idea how much it will be, but if you want a local cloud you're looking at around $500k or more for a truly "cloud scale" and "cloud scaling" solution.
