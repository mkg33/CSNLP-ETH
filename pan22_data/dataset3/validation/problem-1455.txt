If I started a bunch more programs and VMs, that memory used for cache would go to any program that needed it.
I remember somebody saying "I have a brand new machine with 24MB of RAM in it and NT, idle is using 22MB.
As an example, I'm running Windows 7 on a machine with 16GB of memory, and my machine is currently using 5,635MB for cache.
But that's nothing to worry about, that's only because I have nearly 8GB of free memory, and Windows is using my free memory to speed up my system.
Have a look at this a for better understanding of the various counters ( a little bit old (2008) but still valid):
Would you really want a system that didn't try to speed itself up by using otherwise unused RAM?
This sort of question has been floating around since the inception of Windows NT.
Win 2008 R2 is the host, Hyper-V role only installed and host takes 3GB RAM when windows is booted.

I am scared how that will look when I start adding virtual machines.
Most of what you are seeing is cache or preallocation that will be moved out of the way for real work processes.
Go to "performance", open Resource Monitor, look at the different memory categories :
Anybody knows why bare host without any virtual machines takes so much memory?
The OS will take what it needs, and the rest is free for your VMs to use.
Windows will use available RAM to speed things up, leaving code images in memory and for file cache.
The answer is the same now as it was then, though the numbers are different.
If you actually put the machine to some sort of use, much of that RAM will be scavenged and used for other things.
If you are seeing 48GB in the System menu, but only 3GB in use in Task Manager, then you are in fine shape.
