These mechanisms include Kerberos, NTLM, and SPNEGO (Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism): a GSSAPI pseudo-mechanism which allows GSSAPI-compatible clients to negotiate which GSSAPI mechanism they want to use.
It is itself another framework for developing and implementing various authentication mechanisms.
GSSAPI stands for Generic Security Services Application Program Interface; it is usually made available as one of the mechanisms that SASL can use.
People wishing to use Kerberos authentication in an app that supports SASL or GSSAPI need only to provide the appropriate Kerberos plugin, rather than rewrite the app with Kerberos-specific code.
Here's an example to help make this a little clearer (brutally simplified for clarity's sake):
SASL and GSSAPI are frameworks that various authentication providers can be plugged into.
SASL stands for Simple Authentication and Security Layer; it's a framework that allows developers to implement different authentication mechanisms, and allows clients and servers to negotiate a mutually acceptable mechanism for each connection (rather than hard-coding or pre-configuring them).
