The Subversive plug-in gives you the ability to work with this CVS successor version control system from the Eclipse workbench.
You can work with Subversion repositories in almost exactly the same way that has long been possible with CVS repositories using the CVS plug-in bundled in the standard Eclipse distribution.
The Subversive project aims to provide Subversion (SVN) integration for Eclipse.
What's important to note, though: If you have multiple clients and Subversion changes the working copy format again, you have to upgrade all to a new version.
I haven't used it myself however, so I don't know its pros and cons!
I tend to use either one, depending on in which environment I am currently.
If you want a (free) solution that integrates into Visual Studio, you could give AnkhSVN a try.
General features of the Subversive plug-in are quite similar to those of the CVS plug-in:
Would be so much easier, if they all shared a single library ...
I've used it successfully before now, and the only reason I don't use it is that I prefer tortoise.
smartSVN can be used for free in limited mode and it is quite good even with the limits.
I used Subclipse when I still used Eclipse, it also tied into mylar the bug-tracking plugin, tagging commits with the bug id.
