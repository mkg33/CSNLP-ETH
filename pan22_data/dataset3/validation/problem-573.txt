That port should now operate just like a headphone jack.
I usually have external speakers connected (via green speakers jack at the back of my PC).
This behavior can be configured within the sound settings.
That's the behavior that happens without the monitor attached (i.e.
Go into Sound properties, switch to the recording tab, then the properties for the monitor's audio device, and check the "Listen to this device" box.
However, I am only using those headphone jacks, not HDMI.
Is there any way to get Windows 7 to automatically switch the output to the headphones when they're plugged in?
I don't know, if the sound driver would support this, too.
When I plugin headphones into the front headphone jack, the rear speakers are automatically shut off.
I have an HP dv5t laptop running Windows 7 64 bit with an Acer H235H monitor connected to it via an HDMI cable.
My current PC behaves like this, and my two laptops before did, too.
I have the same issue with a Sony Vaio laptop running Windows 7 64-bit and an identical monitor, for reference.
It probably outputs at a sample/bit rate higher and with less noise than the on-board sound card as well.
If it is possible at all, then you might look into the sound settings.
it will switch from the laptop speakers to headphones when headphones are plugged in).
It's not in the standard windows settings but in those of the sound chip.
The monitor has built-in speakers, which are a huge improvement over the laptop's speakers.
It looks like the monitor has a 3.5mm audio out jack.
However, when I want to use headphones, right now, I have to connect them to the laptop, then right-click the sound icon in the task bar, select Playback Devices, right click the monitor, and disable it.
