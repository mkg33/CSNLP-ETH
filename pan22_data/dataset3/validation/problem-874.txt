How to know if it is Fiber to Ethernet or Ethernet to Fiber ?
For Example, if for some Reasons, I must change a Fiber Internet Modem.
Would be a Media Converter (Fiber to Ethernet) and an Ethernet Router, a good Choice to set up a basic Internet Connection ?
Is this Model the right Device to convert Fiber to Ethernet ?
It is performing both a media conversion (optical to copper) AND a protocol conversion of xDSL (which the standards can vary) to Ethernet (IEEE 802.3).
Regardless, the optical or interface MAC address likely would need to be provisioned by your ISP prior to it being a functional replacement unit.
These types of ONT devices are often only available from you ISP, or if you purchase them outside of your ISP they many need to be approved by them.
A media converter as you linked in your original question will either not function at all, or will just produce an error as it is only doing half of the necessary requirement for connectivity, attempting to convert Optical Ethernet (which this is not) to Copper Ethernet, and making no provisions for the xDSL connectivity.
Your ISP is using a Siligense SAS SGA441SW ONT, or Optical Network Terminal, to convert optical xDSL to Ethernet.
