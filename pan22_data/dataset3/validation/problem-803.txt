Edit system/bind9.service to use the options in /etc/default/bind9.
If you are disconnected for a long time they can fill up the disk.
Add EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/bind9 and modify ExecStart to include $OPTIONS.
You can't turn off a particular message in bind, so this is as close as you can get:
This will stop it using IPv6 on start up and restart DNS
Make sure to keep the -f option needed for systemd.
Move bind9.service to avoid it being overwritten on updates
For me the problem caused by this message was a little more serious.
In that case, you need to modify the systemd bind9.service file:
It may be worth noting that in Debian Jessie with systemd, the -4 option in /etc/default/bind9 may be ignored.
The problem is caused by an update to BIND in Centos, it tries to use IPv6 as well as IPv4.
For ubuntu order than 16.04: sudo vi /etc/default/bind9
Best way to fix it is either use IPv6 or configure bind to only use IPv4
When the server is disconnected from the internet you get many of these per second.
The obvious solution is to turn this particular message off, not just for IPv6 as mentioned in the other solutions but for all protocols.
(I remove -u bind, because on Debian, it is already included in $OPTIONS)
