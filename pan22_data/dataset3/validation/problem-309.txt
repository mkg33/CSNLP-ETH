Every sysadmin at the company I work at has a copy on their desk.
More important than the technical skills (which aren't hard to learn and which change frequently anyway), this book teaches you the crucial soft skills.
I can't stress enough how important theoretical knowledge is in networking in my opinion.
Similar to this but more basic, Sybex's CCNA study guide is relatively good, but again only really useful if you're working with Cisco gear.
If you have a support contract with a vendor (Symantec Backup Exec?)
Network Warrior is a decent introduction to actual admin work.
It's worth noting that it is very cisco centric however.
"Practice of System and Network Administration", by Limoncelli, Hogan and Chalup.
Learning to think about the different layers of the stack as OSI level model approaches them is very important, as is learning the protocols.
Even though it is Cisco oriented it approaches the fundamentals well.
The official Cisco books are pretty good for leaning the material and will give you a solid foundation, even if you don't ever want the certifications.
I would start out with purchasing the Cisco CCENT books and cover the core of switching and routing.
It shouldnt cost more than ~$400 (4*100/hr), and will be worth its weight in gold.
The number one best thing you can do -- better than anything else -- is keep backups.
I'd echo the recommendation to read TCP/IP Illustrated, mostly volume one and three.
Lastly, although maybe a bit more "hard-core", TCP/IP Illustrated is a classic, and Stevens is one of the greatest authors of computer books of all time.
It will help whoever you have to bring in to fix something big; or the eventual hire.
It goes through STP/VLANs/Trunking and the like, as well as routing, access lists, and all the other things you're likely to have to deal with day to day.
If you do nothing else; hire a consultant to come in and audit your backups to make sure they are tight; and train you how to manage them.
