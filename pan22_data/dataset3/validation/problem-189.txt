The most impressive feature for me is the ability to preview selected text or the current environment in a tab in the editor window.
The integration with KDE is very good, the main editing environment being katepart.
For editing TeX directly, I use Texmaker, which is basic but has a lot of nice features, such as one-click rendering.
Inlage is a very modern LaTeX software with Windows7 tablet pc support.
It has an intelligent autocompletion for many commands and symbols with descriptions, spellchecker, office table import, docking system, report window...
On Mac OS X, I use TextMate with its LaTex Bundle, and Skim as a PDF reader.
I use MacVim on Mac OS X and a makefile to create the pdf.
The newest version (2.1) written for KDE4 has some issues at the moment but the KDE3.5 version (2.0) is rock solid.
setting up SumatraPDF with inverse/forwards should be not a problem for LaTeX beginners and takes not much time.
But I had trouble configuring it to do some things: adjusting spacing between itemize items, etc.
There is also good auto-complete support and easy to use symbol lists.
I always ended up tinkering with the TeX source in a separate editor.
