may not have supported it (I know some were Pentium compatible, not PPro), and that is probably it.
I'll answer from a different perspective -- how much end user benefit there is in PAE today.
In my experience, PAE is a technology that even quite tech-savvy users don't know about or don't care about (or both)... For most sysadmins today, if they need more than ~3.5GB RAM, they'll immediately reach for a 64-bit OS.
Ubuntu Precise, for example, has two kernels, pae and non-pae, and seems to choose the correct one.
Note however that NX is a feature that is marketed quite a lot, and that feature requires PAE (even Windows had to enable PAE with physical address space limited to 4GB in order to enable NX), and there is a lot of CPUs that support NX that do not support 64-bit.
I would say go for it if you have any reason to at all, unless you really target the low end, I doubt anyone will be hit by it.
I think the early VIA CPU (the C3, perhaps the early C7?)
But I believe even a VIA C7M supports it, it might be possible that some very low end embeded CPUs might not, but they will not be running a standard distro anyways.
Ubuntu, again, for later kernels seem to have dropped -pae from their kernels.
Is there a benefit for systems with 32 bit cpu and 2 or fewer GB of ram?
I don't know if this means they've dropped pae support (which I doubt) or it is detected during runtime.
PAE's use case has been completely taken over by 64bit addressing now.
I may be wrong but don't Linux distributions usually check for certain features during installation to decide which kernel to install?
So IMHO regardless of how little incompatibility risk PAE has, you should not enable it.
