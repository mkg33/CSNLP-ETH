Even after reducing drag back down to 0 this problem persists, meaning that although the surface to surface friction was returned to 0, the air drag was not.
I deleted everything and started fresh, on doing so, the original code worked fine.
After several more hours working on it, I've narrowed it down to a bug/peculiarity in the Unity engine.
During my attempts to replicate what I originally had, I found that adjusting the drag to something > 1 while either turning on/off the "Use Gravity" tickmark or changing the gravity from 0 to 9.81 or reverse between two runs caused the problem with no way to undo it.
The slowness was also caused by the drag, which I managed to overcome by writing my own function to simulate the acceleration due to gravity, though this stopped working properly when I re-did the entire project, causing the cube to drop at incredible speeds as it no longer needed to overcome the 'invisible air resistance'.
As best I can tell, what happened was the cube moved at an incredible speed, seeming to teleport, but then was restricted to its maximum velocity in the second frame, then had its velocity reduced due to the gravity, making it stand still then fall.
