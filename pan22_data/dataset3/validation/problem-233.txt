It's quite the easiest and best solution you can use for this.
And I've made the experience that CDC can be a fragile thing in some circumstances.
But this way you need to build nearly everything on your own.
production database to test database from time to time.
This will use up a part of your tempdb, but your table is always read- and writeable and the replication can work in the background.
CDC will capture all data on a watched table (you need to specify each watched table manually).
By the way, CDC uses the SQL Server Replication under the hood too.
The replication is easy to setup, replicate fast and you don't have to invent the wheel again.
What is the easiest way to sync data between two databases on two different instances.
CDC will hold back those information for a period of time (you can specify it on your own).
Afterwards you'll get the value before and the value after an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE.
If you just weird about locking, you may try to set the ISOLATION LEVEL to READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT.
The approach could be to use CDC on certain tables you need to watch and manually replicate those changes to the other database.
