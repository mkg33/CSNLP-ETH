People who are not so comfortable supporting themselves -- and businesses who have different needs than I do as an individual -- pay for warrantee and support as much as for the hardware.
Upgrading with extra memory, graphics card and hard drives and the will notice price soon skyrockets.
It's also easier to let someone else assemble them when talking about the numbers a corporation might use.
If you want cheap commodity level machines then they are a good source.
You will find that when it comes to very cheap low-end configurations the prices from Dell/HP/etc are very competitive because of the remorseless competition at this level.
For high-end machines then they are very expensive and you can save alot of money buying the components and putting them together yourself.
Completely out of proportion to the cost of the components themselves.
Also, when you're a corporation, you want a collection of cookie-cutter identical machines to ease support.
This is significantly more expensive to purchase relative to the low-end machines.
But as soon as you start creating a high-end system they make big margins.
Systems for people who don't care about performance I'll sometimes purchase pre-built, but just as often I'll build it myself.
For my own machines, I will normally go for higher-end memory, a CPU that is at the peak of performance per dollar, a carefully chosen motherboard, and so on.
Systems for myself I always build from components, but that's because I'm picky about exactly what components go into my systems.
I am completely comfortable supporting myself should any problem arise, and in any case I am more likely to be able to support myself than most companies are.
