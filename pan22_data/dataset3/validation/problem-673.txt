You didn't mention if how these servers are connected ... LAN / WAN etc, which will make a huge difference in where you should start troubleshooting.
I can't offer any Solaris-specific advice, but rather than testing the connection by pinging or something similar, you're probably better off monitoring the interfaces; if the connection is being dropped, I'd imagine you'd see something about it in the logs.
You could also be seeing timeouts due to plain old congestion - there's a malware infected PC on the switch / you're running on 10BaseT.
If you're going across a WAN, start with a tool like smokeping, which will monitor a connection and tell you when, and for how long, you lose connectivity.
If it's a LAN, start monitoring the switch interfaces these servers are plugged into, look for errors (maybe your duplex/speed settings are wrong), maybe one of the servers keeps requesting auto negotiation, or there's just a bad cable somewhere in the mix.
If you are seeing  drops, this could be congestion / crappy connectivity / someone is stepping on the cable at your ISP ... could be anything.
