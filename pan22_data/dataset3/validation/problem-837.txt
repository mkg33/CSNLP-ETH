These apps provide web interface as well, but only if their gui potion is open.
Please add to this if you find a way to start the screen from the gui on boot.
Therefore, I can launch transmission-gtk or whatever from the command line by sshing in and reattaching the screen.
That newly made terminal session/screen has access to x11 stuff.
But to answer your question, @rlduffy's suggestion of using rc.local is a good place to start.
You would need to add a line to the rc.local like the following that would start the screen process in detached mode:
You can use screen -r myscreen to reattach to your detached screen processs.
I could be wrong, but as far as I know, screen has no connection to GUI displays.
Some times, after a reboot, some of my apps that have a GUI close.
but, if i dont have a screen attached to the physical machine, transmission-gtk will output
It has been a while, but here is the "part" solution.
Note: I know there are commandline transmission as well as most other apps.
If the unit is physically available to me, I can start a screen with the screen command, detach from it and if i ever need to open anything else that requires a gui, I can reconnect to that same screen to achieve the task.
I think the "error, no display attached" happens because you are trying to start a GUI program from a screen terminal.
If on the desktop, I start a terminal session and start a screen.
Since rc.local runs after all other start-up processes, there no longer is a question of which RC level to use.
