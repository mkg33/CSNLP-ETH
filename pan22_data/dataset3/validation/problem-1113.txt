The volume mounts perfectly fine on my Mac OS X 10.5.8 machine and Disk Utility on the mac reports no issues with the volume.
Normally it should be a multiple of your physical sector size (like 512, 1024, 2048 etc.
However when I connect the drive to my Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic system, the partition does not mount.
I would prefer not to have to completely reformat the disk if possible because it contains about 280GB of data I would rather not have to find a temporary home for.
There's so surprisingly few useful info on this error at the web and so much noise that it became quicker to look into the source code for answers.
It seems that fat32 has a backup boot sector at sector 6.
I backed the drives up on my mac and reformatted the drives on lnux using mkfs.vfat and they were then usable.
(If anyone has any other ideas, answer this question and I'll try them, and accept your answer if it works!)
You could always try to replace sector 0 with that sector and see if it helps you out, but I would probably try the chkdsk route and see if that helps you out at all.
This has happened a few more times... it seems to be a problem specific to drives formatted as FAT-32 under Mac OS X 10.5.
You could dig into the bytes yourself and see how badly it's screwed up (be careful!
Not an answer to my question, but I wanted to close this, so I'm just posting what I did.
Logical sector size is written at offset 0x0B of your partition, little-ending, 2-byte size.
Googling "vfat Logical sector size is zero" produced no consensus as to the solution.
First, I would try to get access to chkdsk.exe if possible and run that on the drive just incase there is a problem with the filesystem and linux is just being much more picky about it.
I have a 320GB USB drive with a single large FAT32 partition.
