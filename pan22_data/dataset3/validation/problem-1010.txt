As required, I had to remove the endpoints from the VM in order to attach the NSG.
The VM create in ASM module, it will create by a shared IP(NAT) and a FQDN, we can connect to this VM by FQDN or public IP and port.
More information about ACLs, please refer to this link.
I have three classic Azure VMs in a sub-net with Domain Services enabled.
If I remove the NSG and re-add the Endpoint RDP works.
If you want to use NSG with classic VM, we should use Instance IP.
The NSG in ARM module, it work with public IP address(ARM) by default.
I think I'm missing some fundamental points about how Azure Networks and NSG work.
Machines are joined to a domain and accessible via RD.
In classic module, an endpoint Access Control List (ACL) is a security enhancement available for your Azure deployment.
The only way to reach the VM with NSG attached was to toggle the switch for "Instance IP" and use this second IP from Remote Desktop.
In order to apply a common set of inbound rules I created a Network Security Group and associate it to the VMs.
An ACL provides the ability to selectively permit or deny traffic for a virtual machine endpoint.
Please note that VMs were created in classic mode due to Azure a Domain Services requirements.
After NSG were taken into use the machines can no longer be reached by using the Virtual IP.
