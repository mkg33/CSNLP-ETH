It's bandwidth will always be gigabit on any of the ports but the total throughput it can sustain can be 10 gigabit or more.
That means it will never be overloaded even if full traffic is present on all ports.
Also, if a network switch were to drop a frame due to over-congestion, that will cause TCP to halt everything, ask for a fast retransmit of the missing packet (since packets will start to arrive out of order), and then resume processing of the other packets.
The throughput is the amount of data sent, and that will need to subtract the protocol overhead from the bandwidth, so no, the throughput cannot exceed the bandwidth.
TCP also implements a receive window that's sent in the ACK for each received packet, so if you try to overload the host on the other end, it'll set the receive window to a smaller value as the TCP receive buffer fills, until finally it's set to 0 to tell the sending party to back off until it has had time process the incoming packets and hand them off to the upper layers of the networking stack.
The bandwidth is the number of bits that can be sent on a link in one second.
TCP doesn't care about maximum speed or throughput, it cares about getting every single frame through, in order and without errors.
Example: a 52-port XGS2210 switch can sustain a throughput of 176 Gpbs, which is more than 48Gbps from ethernet ports + 40Gbps from optical ports.
The closer the value is to the total combined speed of the ports, the better the switch will be under heavy traffic load.
ISPs often "oversell" the capacities of their lines, so that the total throughput available to the users is greater than the capacity of their line.
Throughput on the network device can and in fact it is highly recommended to be so.
For instance, if they have a line that has 1 GB/s of throughput, they might sell 50 100 MB/s plans to their customers.
They do this because usually the data the users use is significantly less than what they'd be allowed to use, theoretically - it's rare for all of the users to use their maximum allocated capacity at the same time.
Let's say we have an industrial switch with 24 gigabit ports.
A bad implementation example are some home routers that do offer gigabit ports for both LAN and WAN but their throughput is limited to 500Mbps or less.
It may seem that way if you compress the data, but that is an illusion.
For what you're describing to even happen, you'd need to use another Layer 4 protocol, preferably something which doesn't care about anything, like UDP.
