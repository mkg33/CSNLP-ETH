There are a mix of table types, 48 MyISAM tables and 4 INNODB tables and DB's about 8 GB in size and I'm hoping that a change to Mysql 5.x will result in faster performance as well?
Each has general upgrade advice, and also a subsection on specific gotchas.
I would also recommend using a testing tool to check if the queries you use in your application have any regression failures or dramatic performance degradation between releases.
While backward compatibility is a goal, there are always corner cases for which you need to research or test.
I'm considering of upgrading my current server to a new one and by default it comes with Mysql 5.x although have the option of continuing with old version as well.
The question is can I just migrate without having to worry or will I need to make changes in my code/queries or table structures?
Each version of the manual has a section on upgrading from the prior major release, so if you upgrade from 4.1 directly to 5.1 or 5.5, you should read the section for each major version upgrade.
