I even did the ripping there using an external DVD drive.
I remember playing DVDs on my old Pentium III at 450 MHz, so an Atom processor should handle that just fine.
The original DVD files may be as high at 5000kbps, but you can't really reproduce that on a netbook's video system anyway so it just adds overhead for the player to drop frames while taking up more space.
I would recommend using an actual ripper instead of just copying the DVD files to your hard drive.
If you're using the built-in speakers, they're probably not great, so there's no benefit to putting the audio bitrate over about 64k.
Whatever ripper you use, I would suggest ripping at a reasonable video bitrate, say 512kbps.
In terms of software, if Windows Media Player 12 (which ships with Windows 7) does not work, then VLC should be able to play the DVD files.
If you're using headphones or external speakers, a higher audio bitrate might give you detectably better sound.
I'm sure many of our competitors will also work, but I haven't actually tested them.
For that reason, I have tested it extensively on my own netbook, and the MPEG 4 files it rips play great on my Atom-based Eee PC.
Save space, for one thing, often at a premium on netbooks.
I haven't tested Windows 7 on the netbook, just XP and Ubuntu, but that should not be a problem.
