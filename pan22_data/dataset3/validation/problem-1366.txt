I create a Host which has the address of the ip address above and create a service as follows.
When you are calling check_http from the nagios config, it looks at /etc/nagios-plugins/config/http.cfg to determine the check_http command arguments.
But if I change the filename it is checking or the text it is checking it still passes even though I know they don't exist on the website.
Then in your service configuration your check_command should be something like:
Now I want to incorporate this into my nagios config files.
When you are executing the command manually, you are calling /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_http correct?
Which passes OK and fails if I delete the file or change the text it is looking for.
You can set the following in the Nagios config too see what command is actually be executed ( see the expansion of the full command):
What you need to do is create a custom check like:
What am I doing wrong I think I must be testing a different file or something for it to always pass.
I want to create a nagios check that test if a certain file is available on a public website and if that file contains a certain line of text.
