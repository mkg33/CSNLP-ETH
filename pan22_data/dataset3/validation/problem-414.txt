Our computing labs have a refresh policy that resets display properties and power plans in case students modify.
The "kiosk" system is in a semi-secure classroom with windows (panes of glass, not the OS) along the interior hallway so folks can see the content on the projector screens (2, dual monitors).
So for folks experiencing a similar mystery, check with your administrator for group policies that reset or refresh power plans across the network.
The Kiosk user account is pretty restricted to keep students from adjusting the system.
-- So looks like a Power Plan switching problem... ugh...
In a fit of inspiration, I decided to create a New Power Plan called "Kiosk" with the settings I need.
I will continue to work with our system administrators to make sure the group policies for this computer do not override the local changes in the power plan, which is looking like the root of the problem...
I looked into the support article, and that does not look like the problem.
15 min later, the system had switched back to the "High Performance Plan" and shut down the monitors.
With hundreds of computers across campus, it saves a wad of energy to have them power down when not being used.
