For most edits, the software is pretty good at automatically merging changes you both make.
A co-worker and I are required to build an HTML based website (no PHP, no ASP.net, etc.).
Live edits would be the best, any other system would be acceptable, however.
It'll make sure you don't destory each other's work, and make it easy to revert back to an earlier version of the files (website in this case) in case you mess something up.
Also you can use branching to test out different ideas/features and and merge them back to the mainline if you like them/they work.
I'd recommend git because it has decent cross-platform support, well documented, and well used, so it's pretty easy to find some good guides/help for it.
Other VCS include Mercurial and Subversion (there are many more).
Is there anyway for us to work in the same files/projects across our LAN?
I'd suggest using Version Control software, specifically I like git.
Basically, by using source control, both of you can edit files, and if you happen to make edits on the same file that conflict, the VCS will let you know and allow you to manually merge the changes.
