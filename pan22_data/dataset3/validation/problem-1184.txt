The poster did a similar step, among other things.
Anyway, it looks like your problem was solved, but these are just ideas as to why it didn't work.
Do you have an antivirus or something that blocks googleapis.com?
I know that AJAX calls have a 'same origin policy'.
Goto Options>Security, if the "Warn me when sites try to install add-ons" check box is selected goto the "Exceptions" and add "http://ajax.googleapis.com/".
This is the link that superuser.com uses for jQuery.
You could try backing up and deleting your user profile.
When you start Firefox again, you should end up with a new profile.
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js
Is there some kind of setting that only allows scripts to be downloaded from the same site (superuser.com).
Specifically, I clicked on the link given by Garreth, got an error from Firefox (something like "can't access the file", but from firefox) and pressed Shift-F5 (force reload) or maybe F5 (Shift-F5 is safer).
If you're using FF 4, it seems that others have this problem too.
I've just had the same problem on Linux, with Firefox 3.6, and solved it.
If you get the same problem, simply move your profile copy back into Profiles.
Try navigating to a Stack Exchange site and see if you get the same warning message.
The file was loaded, and Super User started working again.
Find the folder that ends with .default and copy it to someplace else, and then delete the folder in the Profiles directory.
Perhaps you could try disabling all add-ons and try accessing superuser.com again.
Reset Firefox preferences to troubleshoot and fix problems
If it works, then something was wrong with your previous profile.
