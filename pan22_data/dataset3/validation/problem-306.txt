After you have got the numbering then copy the whole A column where you have got the value then again then Use right click option to use Paste special as values.
So formula will be gone and you will get your int values In there.
As you can check on the Microsoft Office Online Help, Excel doesn't have any tool for doing that, but you can fill it with the ROW function...
What i Did was I Put the number in A1 column as 100 and In A2 column I did apply the formula that is =A1+1 and then press enter so value comes here as 101 and then select A2 Cell then use the fill Option where you get the option fill down the series.
and Hence I got all the numbers in increasing order.
The Most Wonderful way to do this just fill the number in your column and in the next column do this column above+1 and then use the fill series button on the home right corner of the excel sheet and it will autofill the whole column.
