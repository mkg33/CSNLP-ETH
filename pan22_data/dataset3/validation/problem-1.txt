And here is the question: why do I have to use NAT here?
and you can use it to access resources of a private network from other private one.
What I'm going to ask may be trivial but I really need to understand cause my teacher is confusing me!
It should not be taught, period (except in History class).
On a side note: S/He should be reprimanded for even teaching Classed Networking, that was antiquated 16 years ago.
The NAT device takes a single (usually) Internet IP and allows the computers with Internal IPs to "fake" it (communications to the Internet will use the valid IP, and the NAT device keeps everything straight).
Now I got one router between A1 and A2, and another between A2 and C1.
Your three networks do not interface with the public Internet, and they are all using internal IP ranges.
I would like to suggest you to go through the following urls which may give a clear idea why your teacher had told like that?

I've configured the routing so that packets can go from A1 to A2 and from A2 to C1.
I think you need to use NAT just if want to access from private network to public one,
NAT would be necessary if your networks were communicating with the Internet because your Internal IP ranges will not work on the Internet.
I can't figure out why NAT is needed between two private networks!
Then teacher told me: "Router between A1 and A2 is ok, but A2 and C1 can't communicate cause they are different networks!
