Now according to the tutorial I am following, I should just ground 1 and 2 back to the Pi.
I want output 1 to always be the +12V and output 2 to behave as the ground, or for no current to be flowing at all):
Where the u in the middle top represents the divet present on the top of the motor driver to tell which side is "up."
However, my concern is that that would cause a problem because the motor powering circuit is powered by a 12V supply.
According to Texas Instruments, the L293D has the following setup
Therefore, here is my partially completed schematic of the system (top is now on left side; Ground is the middle two pins on the bottom side of the L293D in the schematic).
Hence, should I ground 1 and 2 back to the Pi (bottom)?
You need to connect at least one Pi ground to a L293D ground.
Ground is the reference voltage for all circuitry.
For my project specifically, I will strictly only be needing the left side motor control logic (1, 2) and since I am not running a DC stepper motor, I will only run the following two states (i.e.
