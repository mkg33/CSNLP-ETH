Though for better setup, what I will suggest that you can run a small instance and run some caching server on top of that, something like Varnish or nginx, which will increase the performance of your website drastically and on top of that, will provide you the facility of Load Balancing with zero downtime.
Using Amazon Route53 DNS, is it possible to build a highly available setup pointing to multiple web servers not on Amazon?
When web2 goes down, can I have an automated script which deletes the A record for 50.23.45.101?
The setup you are looking for, is fisible, but then there will be a downtime of around one minute, when any of your server goes down.
How are requests sent when both web servers are up?
Although I will recommend putting the TTL to be less than that, somewhere around 30 secs (in ideal scenarios, it should be 0 sec), so that your downtime can be decreased.
There are few DNS providers which provides the service of weighted load Balancing in DNS, but mostly are paid services.
When both web servers are up,  one client will get the first IP and the next client will get the second IP.
In normal scenario, all your requests will be send in round robin fashion.
Then when web2 comes back up, simple re-create the A record?
pointing to 50.23.45.100 and 50.23.45.101 with a TTL of 1 minute each, will this work?
