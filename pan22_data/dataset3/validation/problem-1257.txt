There is also an article here that seems to indicate it is possible to backup Exchange using NTBackup on server 2008 with some hacking.
 - MBS-online-backup.ps1 (GUI Version) - Uses powershell and VSS to make an online backup.
There aren't any recovery instructions posted yet though but I think you can mount the backup files as a recovery storage group.
Exchange 2007 SP2 has now provided addon support for the Windows 2008 Server Backup tool.
Michael B. Smith, its author, is a very knowledgeable guy, and his script does a good job.
The problem with using NTBackup is that it can corrupt the mail store if you have LCR enabled.
Microsofts DPM seems to be the common choice with many.
Each looks like it has its own advantages/disadvantages.
Not for the faint of heart but looks like it will get the job done.
Not sure how well it restores though so you would need to test that quite thoroughly.
Without either of these enabled, NTBackup should run through fine however it will be necessary to test after major updates.
Good news: the solution is coming in Exchange 2007 SP2, coming soon.
In the meantime, I'd use the MBS-online script that @TonyB mentioned.
