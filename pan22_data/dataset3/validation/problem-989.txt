I was also wondering if there was any information on exactly how inefficient a mesh collider is to say having 20 box or cylinder colliders on a character mesh.
I have been reading through the Unity Manual and have come across some interesting information about mesh colliders and primitive colliders.
But you're best off using primitive colliders unless you really need to be able to shoot a bullet between someone's arm and his side, and possibly miss.
It got me wondering if using many primitive colliders would be better than using a mesh collider for say a character object?
Use the profiler to do detailed checks on these things.
I am guessing that the number of polygons on the mesh would be a factor but it would be interesting to see some raw comparisons between how this efficiency scales per polygon (or per 100 polys or some unit of measurement)
The only time when a mesh collider may be appropriate would be for terrain surfaces that are often not flat and it's important to give a more realistic feel to walking on the ground surface as possible.
For most purposes, a simple pill shape is good enough for character collision.
