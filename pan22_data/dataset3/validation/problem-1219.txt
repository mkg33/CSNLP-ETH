In any case for a newbie 2 partitions for linux is enough - one 10-20 gig partition for system, and one partition about twice as much as your ram for swap
I like to partition my systems before i even start installing, unless its a fresh install on a system with no previous OS.Even if you don't, start planning for your partitions now, before you even do the install.
For most newbies i'd suggest a fairly well supported, and common distribution to start with, and one that has a livecd or minimal install cd - I tend to suggest ubuntu (for people using newer systems) or debian, but there's plenty of good newbie centered distros.
The easiest way to try a Linux distribution, without affecting your existing system, is probably to install VirtualBox and then download a pre-made VirtualBox image from here.
Once that's done, look up your hardware or VM software to make sure there's no known issues with what you're using
Go to the site of a distributor, download the cd, burn the cd, and follow the on-screen steps...
Once all that's done, download a CD and burn it or get a installation USB ready (unetbootin is great for this), get your computer online if need be.
Pop it in, run the install process, cross your fingers, and you're good to go.
Do you want to dualboot or singleboot if its a physical system?
If you have any general questions I would point you to the newbie forum on LinuxQuestions.org, or the Ubuntu forums.
While most VM distros have a partitioner, i suggest backing up your original system (or better yet, image it with something like clonezilla, and partitioning it before even starting to install.
