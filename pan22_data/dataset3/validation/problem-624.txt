For example, to specify FlashMode (integer) as Off you can use (note the #):
GIF is an older format that may have text headers, but the format never was extended to include EXIF information.
There are two (mostly compatible) formats for that: the older JFIF and the newer EXIF.
Note: -FlashMode is a shortcut for -XMP-exif:FlashMode.
You can see a list of all supported XMP tags here, and the XMP EXIF tags supported are listed here.
Actually, JPEG isn't an image file format - it's a compression algorithm.
Most modern software will also accept mixed formats.
I always turn to ExifTool for all my tagging needs.
While they don't support embedding of EXIF data, they do support embedding XMP metadata/tags.
Since it is native to this type of file, Windows allows manipulation of a subset of the data (similar to MP3 file tags).
EXIF is a data collection system used in jpeg files taken on cameras to provide state information (thumbnail, exposure, ISO speed, date, time, location, etc) about when the picture was taken.
Maybe there's a shell extension available, will update this answer if I find one.
Entire JPEG image files are in fact EXIF (or JFIF) files and tagging is one of EXIF's features.
Also, I don't currently know of any way to make Windows aware of these tags though.
The following command will allow you to update the Comment tag:
JPEG specs don't describe how to pack compressed image into file.
Other files that can have EXIF information are TIFF and WAV files
GIFs don't use EXIF at all, so you can't put EXIF tags on them.
