you can also type chmod 777 filename in the terminal in order to set full read write and execute permissions for all users.
Now try to do whatever your trying to do in nautilus.
My Ubuntu 8.10 crashed due to the overheating problem of the CPU when I am opening some directory and intend to do some file transfer under Nautilus.
Note that this will open up nautilus as the root user.
The desktop and home folders will link to the root users profile so you'll have to navigate over to your own profile under File System and then home.
After reboot, under gnome, all the files cannot be removed, their properties cannot be  viewed and they can only be opened, although all are still fine under terminal.
Please do an ls -al on the files you are talking about and paste them in so we can see the permissions and ownership of the files.
If you are listed as the owner and group of those files and the permissions are set to full access... you might want to try running fsck -fy /dev/hda1 (or sda1) from single user mode or from a live cd
