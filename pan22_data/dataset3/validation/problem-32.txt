note:  test the glue is stuck firmly to the card when its cured.
up thus removing the indentation on the side of the card completely.
its not working in my camera because the tape gives a little under pressure and doesnt push the switch closed.
I'd try and tape over the switch area with something like scotch tape and darkening it with a sharpie.
I'm fairly certain that the lock is a physical mechanism, and therefore all you need to do is put a piece of scotch tape over the SD card.
in 18C temperature that took about 10 minutes to go opaque and get thick enough to paste it into the groove.
if the glue drops off into your electronic equipment, it may cause havoc !!
Be very precise in placing the tape over the notch, but not over the brass connector on the opposite side.
it to the card, that way it becomes thick enough to stay put and not run out of the groove.
I'd worry about the tape pealing off inside the SD card slot and then you might end up really screwed.
The best solution well what I have used was to erase everything like I use micro sd with adapter to connect to computer to upload stuff and for some reason it was saying its locked and I cant upload anything so I just uploaded everything from sd to my computer and then put the sd card into my phone erased everything and poped it back into the computer and I works fine now !
The notch forces the read-only to work with camera's, PDA's, MP3 players, etc, however they are not guaranteed to work on all SD readers (apparently it works on your reader).
Really, though, they're so cheap it would be better to just replace the card.
The lock blocks a lightbeam if it is in the correct position.
It's simply a physical thing, therefore the tape will trick the SD card reader into thinking the SD card is unlocked.
If I'm not mistaken - its the same kind of thing as the old floppy disk.
a flat surface by scraping the excess off with the knife.
if you are unsure of this method or unsure of the bond between the glue and the card, DON'T DO IT this way as i won't be responsible for the loss of your equipment - do it at your own risk.
( a thin sliver of wood such as that off a matchstick )
i am finding a way of taping a little piece of wood to fill the slot
which CLOSES when the plastic sliding lock is forwards (towards the contacts).
leave the glue for a while to become mostly hard, perhaps an hour or more, and then using a sharp hobby knife ensure its
tape over the slot only with scotch tape and the switch may be weak enough
There's no electrical component to it - just that if the switch is in a certain spot, the lightbeam gets broken and you can read and write.
method 2:  i am now using some semi-hardened gorilla glue and building it
i allowed the gorilla glue to become opaque and thick before trying to apply
as the switch in my camera requires a lot of pressure to activate it.
to activate, thus closing the circuit and allowing the card to write.
