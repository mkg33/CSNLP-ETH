If so you can probably get away with just the shutdown command; no scheduled task needed.
yes,  set your scheduled task to run whether user is logged on or not and is set to run with highest privledges.
The task is scheduled for 11:00PM, but when I come in the next day, it says "Last Run Result: (0x1)."
For the Actions section, set the action to "start a program" with C:\Windows\System32\shutdown.exe and then /r /f /t 5 as the arguments.
This is contra to Microsoft's docs on the command which state the maximum delay is 600 seconds all the way though to Server 2012.
I've been trying to get Server 2008 R2 to reboot after everyone is gone from work, to get its updates installed, but what I've been trying apparently isn't working.
Make sure the account credentials used for the task have Log on as Batch Job rights.
Unfortunately, this doesn't work on all versions; Server 2003 and Vista restrict you to 600 seconds (10 minutes).
For all versions since then and, strangely, also XP, the maximum is 315359999 seconds (~10 years).
