If you're looking to help with a more FreeBSD-specific project, there is a newer BSD hypervisor project called BHyVe.
To my knowledge the hypervisor options for FreeBSD systems are:
is there any possibility to have FreeBSD running virtual guests (Linux and Windows) apart from VirtualBox?
If you're looking for something to start running with right away, voretaq7's answer is the way to go.
It looks like NetApp is sponsoring it and/or providing development resources, so it looks interesting.
I think the domU support is more active and someone is working on it now for Amazon's EC2 specifically.
I believe Xen was ported at some point but wasn't kept up.
The FreeBSD wiki page has links to the freebsd-virtualization mailing list (where project coordination is taking place), a PDF from the 2011 DevSummit presentation, and a Subversion link.
You can also look in ports/emulators for other stuff I may have missed...
There seems to be activity now for both dom0 and domU Xen support in FreeBSD but it isn't clear how far the dom0 support is.
