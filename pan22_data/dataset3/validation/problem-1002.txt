Heres some more information that might be helpful,
This is the state of play as I experience with Evolution 2.22.
As far as I know (and I am battling with the very same issue), this doesn't work.
I got the network administrator to allow access to the server via IMAP.
Preferably natively (Exchange mode), so that my calendar, etc, all sync up properly.
When my Company mail server upgraded from Microsoft Windows Exchange Server 2003 to Microsoft Windows Exchange Server 2007 my Evolution mail client stopped receiving mail (in Ubuntu).
DavMail Gateway 4.5.0 worked smoothly with Evolution 3.4.4 for accessing mail, calendar, and corporate directory on Exchange 2010 SP1 from Debian Wheezy.
You don't get any further errors, and you can download the list of folders, but you can't open any of them.
It was working fine under our old version of Exchange (2007?
Prefer not to drop down to IMAP mode for mail only.
After configuring the connector, and entering the password, a message pops up saying that the server runs version 5.5 of MS Exchange and the connector is not compatible.
