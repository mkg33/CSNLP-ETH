So what would be the best approach in order to install a new Windows version and keep the data intact on my other drives (in the end it would be fine if the C drive need to be formatted)
Currently I am running Windows 7 (installed on the C drive) and I bought Windows 8.1 and a new SSD drive.
But I could imagine that this would also conflict due to the fact that on my C drive Windows 7 is installed.
The reason that installing Windows on a new drive with an old Windows drive connected is a bad idea:
You'll need to reinstall Windows Boot Manager and rebuild the BCD store with bcdboot, if it's a UEFI installations, you'll even need to shrink your C: to get some space for a new EFI System Partition, and in any case, you'll lost the recovery environment (though some people might consider it useless).
I was wondering if I install Windows 8.1 on my SSD drive would that conflict bad with my installed windows 7 on my C drive?
Therefore, in my opinion, it's mostly a better idea to install Windows on a new drive without any old Windows drive connected to the system, so that the new installation will be standalone, unless your motherboard has a UEFI that sucks, for which its boot menu is not accessible or so.
I got a question regarding installing Windows on a SSD drive.
Installing windows 8.1 on my SSD drive would let me keep the data that was available on my other drives (C, D and G drives) right?
The new installation will not have its own boot and recovery partition(s) but rely on the those on the old installation, which means when you unplug your old drive or it dies someday, you won't be able to boot the new drive as well without a hassle.
And you can always add an entry to the BCD store of the old installation for the new installation (without touching ANYTHING on the new drive).
