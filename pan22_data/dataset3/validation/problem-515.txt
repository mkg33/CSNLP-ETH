EC2 now lets you do configurable reverse DNS, which is a big help if you're trying to send out email from an EC2 instance.

The only thing what you could about it to use elastic IP and ask the common spam filtering services to remove your /32s.
Have a look at this AWS blog post for more details.
My site sends several hundred (legitimate, opt-in) emails a day.
Generally EC2 IPs are banned and blacklisted almost in all spam filtering service due to an unfortunate thing that spammers like to buy instances and use it for spamming.
My web application's mails don't get routed to spam by GMail anymore.
Other solution would be to use some SMTP proxy service somewhere.
Since transferring to EC2, despite having the AWS imposed SMTP limits removed, I'm finding that my server's email goes into my spambox.
When on a different IP (the same server set up, domain etc), we had no problems with email deliverability.
Hmmm in my case using postfix and forward emails via authsmtp or sendgrid.
This is what worked for me after some trial and error with the EC2 instances
Not until they dream up some new anti-EC2 -err anti-spam cock and bull anyway!
