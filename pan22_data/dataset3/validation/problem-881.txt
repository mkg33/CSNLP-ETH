Common bit-level operations like setting bit 7 are easy to do with hex anyway - 1000 0000base2 = 80base16, so if a hex value is under 80base2 bit 7 is clear and adding 8base16 will set it.
Of course, there is occasion to actually edit individual bits of data, but not often.
It's easier to "see" things like ascii or Unicode characters in the hex code, too.
Any compiled, runnable file (like somefile.exe, for example, on Windows) is sometimes called a "binary", since it's been compiled into machine-level code which is correct on the binary level to be executed by the processor directly.

The UI usually works in hex by default because it's more convenient - e.g.
That's typically the abstraction one is working with when directly editing a file.
But most of them will switch to showing you binary bits if you really want them to.
On a personal note, though, I would tend to agree that "binary editor" is confusing on balance.
It just happens to be displayed in hex because hex is useful for humans.
Files on the great majority, if all, of computers today are 8-bit bytes.
Neither is technically incorrect; they just come at the naming problem from different angles.
Recall that files not readily representable in higher-level text form are called "binary files" or "binaries", for the same reason.

In this instance, it appears that the hex in "hex editor" refers to the conventional human-readable representation of each byte's value, whereas the binary in "binary editor" refers to the notion that you're indeed editing the file at the byte layer (and computers store bytes in binary), without consideration for higher-level text encoding and the like.
Other reasons why hex is more strongly associated to this type of activity:
(That's an actual address from a debugging problem, not a made-up example.)
Different people have all sorts of different names for things.
They're called "binary" because they let you change individual bits.
