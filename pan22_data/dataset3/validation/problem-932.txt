Now for the amount of power that these fully stocked pods consume, that is serious monies that could be saved without paying any more shipping costs then to move a trailer.
My guess is that is they could take these pods pull them out and move them to a different datacenter.
Certainly the idea of spending millions building a traditional hot/cold-row room is starting to look old-hat, drawing ambient filtered air and simply expelling the hot air is much more progressive.
The same goes for how much you should put in a rack, I see no reason why you shouldn't fill 50U racks to the top if you trust your air extraction, combining this with blades, virtualisation and converged network can make difference to initial and ongoing costs.
The containers can be pre-build at a remote location and shipped to wherever they are required as a complete unit.
A container (potentially containing thousands of servers) can be treated as a unit of computing.
easier to move around [ eg to neighbor state that has cheaper energy because of some political turbulence ].
For the large scale data center operators, containers provide the option of moving the unit of scale from the server or rack to the container.
easier to do drop in replacement... whole container not just server-by server.
Containers are an option for data centers at the threshold of their operating capacity, or for data centers that require a temporary capacity increase.
So I think containers/pods are great but it's the paradigm shift that's more important - go see a container and let it open your mind :)
When working on such a large scale it has a number of advantages.
Containers provide increased energy efficiency by isolating hot and cold air flows as well as reducing the amount of power required to move air using fans.
Individual containers can be deployed and replaced as needed rather than spending administration time on maintaining and servicing individual servers or racks.
I've had a good look inside one of the HP 'Pod' containers and although I thought they were great they were very expensive but importantly it made me take a step back and revise my thinking about what IS a data centre.
3 primary benefits that appeal to different market segments:
However, these efficiency gains can be obtained in traditional data center designs through the use of air plenums.
The list goes on and on but the bottom line is large cost savings.
Lets say that this datacenter is paying $0.12 per kilowatt hour and there is another datacenter that just got cut a deal for $0.08.
