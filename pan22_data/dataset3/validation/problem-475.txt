Even if you use TrueCrypt with a super strong password.. you'd always have that doubt in your mind.
They had some command line tools so you could push down these changes inside of a config file, which was nice since we could automate that through the primary application they ran on the notebook.
Technology, and the way computers work and are used, is changing - it is now perfectly reasonable to have always-available Internet access from every/most places a user could be expected to be, either through a wired connection at work, via a wireless network, or by handing them a laptop with a built-in 3G broadband dongle.
Not allow it to get there in the first place (at least, that's what we're working towards...).
If the user types the correct password it will log them onto the computer with the same username\password combo (or a cached set of credentials).
If someone tried hacking the password it progressively increased the timeout between attempts (something like 3X the timeout each attempt, so it would have a crazy-long delay even after only a few incorrect attempts).
It had some nice tools for remotely allowing a log-in if someone got locked out via a generated key and it let you set an expiration policy on users.
This allows the user to log on once, which is right after the POST finishes.
Consider publicity; the press take a simplistic view of things.
We use a whole disk encryption solution which has single sign-on built in.
If you enter the wrong password, the length of time between password attempts continue to double.
They'd say "Acme corp loses laptop with 30,000 employee records".
If the notebook went missing we knew the user/password would be expiring within a week (even if they knew the password) they'd eventually be locked out.
Think of it this way: If the laptop was stolen or lost and contained all your companies secrets - how would you feel?
I've used a product called SafeGuard Easy from Utimaco.
You couldn't boot the laptop w/o first entering a password.
Therefore you can disable the use of USB drives via Windows GPO and have them access data via a VPN, probably simply by using applications via Terminal Services (or VNC/SSH, or whatever) and using however-many factor security you like.
And if you restart, it stays at whatever the last time period was, but starts it over.
Not being facetious but the best way is to not put it there in the first place.
Therefore, brute forcing isn't really a possibility.
The fact that it was highly encrypted might not be enough to prevent reputational damage.
We can manage them by backing up the headers in case the passwd gets lost and since they are easy to use, no problems getting the users to use them.
This won't stop the case of a user booting through and then leaving the laptop unlocked, but it does protect the drive "at rest."
