I downloaded php 7.0.4 Win32 from http://windows.php.net/download/ and extracted the contents to a local directory.
To see the output of the pages access http://localhost/nameofyourfolder in the browser.
It will search for the file index.php and display the processed output.
I'm trying to install PHP on my Windows 10 64 bit computer.
( C:\wamp64\www if you're running the 64 bit version)
http://php.net/manual/en/install.windows.php to see how to install, run and configure PHP.
PHP is an interpereter which reads and executes scripted code files (.php or similarr files).
After installing, create a folder inside the C:\wamp\www folder and write your php pages in it.
You will have all the necessary software to start learning PHP with a simple "click Next" installer.
I then tried to run php.exe and I get a console window.
If you get stuck on any of these stages specifically, ask away and I will do my best to answer.
How do I find out why this application is not executing
Once you've written your scripts and are ready to test, you don't actually install PHP as much as extract is, configure it and then run it through IIS
I try to run php-win.exe and other than the wait cursor showing for less than 1/2 a second, nothing happens.
To write/test/develop in PHP - all you really need is notepad.
