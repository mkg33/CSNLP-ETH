This is unsurprising to me, as I understand this to merely be the public IP of my router.
Importantly, this does not allow an external machine to talk directly to any of my networked machines unless it is configured to use port forwarding.
If I then used putty to ssh in to foo.university.edu at port 1000, would I be able to ssh into .102 because it would be the only thing listening there?
I understand how Network Address Translation (NAT) can play games to allow each machine to access external information, or at least I think I do.
What would happen if I connected another server to this network?
Let's say that on my router, the server foo has local IP 192.168.1.100 and my workstation is at .101.
When I check my workstation's public IP, I find it is x.x.123.4, and when I check what the IP address for foo.university.edu is, it is exactly the same.
Let's say I connected a new server on my router at 192.168.1.102, and I set it to accept ssh from port 1000 (or something).
I have a server that is accessible via ssh at foo.university.edu, and my workstation is on the same router (which has a decent hardware firewall).
Is it merely that there there is no other machine listening on port 22?
When I ssh into foo, how does everything know that I need to be connecting to 100?
