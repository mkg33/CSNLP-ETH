You have to change this in your db host's sqlnet.ora and listener.ora files:
Make sure to test all network groups private/office/public.
To check what you're running now, invoke LSNRCTL on the database host and issue the command:
- The LOCAL_LISTENER parametyer in SPFILE was NULL -- that is it was never set
Although this is treating the symptom rather than whatever network stack disease you have, you could try increasing the
inbound_connect_timeout to see if the problem goes away.
- JDBC Client was running on a machine with IP ZZ.ZZ.ZZ.ZZ
- Added an entry in TNSNAMES.ORA to set the local listener (LISTENER = (...)), essentially a copy of the entry used in LISTENER.ORA)
SQLNET.INBOUND_CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 100  (assuming 100 is greater than your current timeout)
- The default "LISTENER" was listening on YY.YY.YY.YY port 1521, (hostname resolves to this IP)
Inbound port 1521 on the database server should be open (if you are connecting to the DB server from another server) .
- Using routing table, the client ZZ.ZZ.ZZ.ZZ was able to reach XX.XX.XX.XX
I had this issue when the following conditions were true:
The particular error and the fact that it happens to all applications running against the database would strongly point to a network hiccup as the source of the problem.
- Added a parameter LOCAL_LISTENER = LISTENER in spfile (ALTER SYSTEM SET ... SCOPE=SPFILE)
- Database Server had two NICs - one with IP XX.XX.XX.XX and another with YY.YY.YY.YY
On some windows operating system such as Vista/Win7/Win Server; firewall is enable for SOHO network computers.
- JDBC client URL was pointing to IP XX.XX.XX.XX, port 1521
Additional Tips: Please check your server/PC firewall settings.
INBOUND_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_yourLIstenerNameGoesHere = 100
- Changed LISTENER.ORA to listen on XX.XX.XX.XX (instead of the hostname default of YY.YY.YY.YY)
Then stop the firewall service and test for the connection.
