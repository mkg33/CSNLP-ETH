As far as I know, a switch stores the source MAC address of each incoming packet (regardless of the packet content) in its MAC address table.
I'm doing some research on switching algorithms using a Level 1 GSW-2476 switch and I have a problem regarding MAC learning.
I have connected 4 ports of the switch to a hardware traffic generator.
a destination MAC address of E1E1E1E1E1E1, a source MAC address of 131313131313, an Ethertype of 0800 and about 200 bytes of value 55 as the frame payload.
However, I cannot learn the switch using this simple rule!
13 13 13 13 13 13 14 14 14 14 14 14 08 00 55 55 55 ... 55 55
However, when I send a packet with a destination MAX address of 131313131313 (such as the below packet) using one of the other ports, the switch sends the packet to all the ports!
Using the traffic generator I send this packet from port 1:
Consequently, it is expected that the switch attaches 131313131313 to the port 1.
It should also be noted that the switch is in its reset factory settings.
E1 E1 E1 E1 E1 E1 13 13 13 13 13 13 08 00 55 55 55 ... 55 55
