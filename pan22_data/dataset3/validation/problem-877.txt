I also enabled the email notifications feature so I'll be able to be informed immediately about critical events.
I had the same issue, needed a syslog server running on my OSX platform to capture syslog events from my network devices.
Any suggestions or insights would be gratefully accepted.
This is where I diverge slightly from the instructions as with many things in /etc on OSX, if it also has a sub folder structure you're better off adding your conf in there and leaving the main one alone.
It supports syslog and OSX has ASL (a superset of syslog, apparently).
I solved this issue by downloading and installing the following application "Lan-Secure Mac Syslog Server" that can be found on the following link: http://www.lan-secure.com/SyslogServerMac.htm
I can see logs coming in but nothing shows up in the Console even if I reload the plist.
I've followed the instructions in OS X Lion as a syslog server but the Console shows nothing under /var/log/network (though the directory does show).
Once I installed the software that was very simple as just running the installer, my OSX platform starts collecting syslog events and display them on the software console.
I've even taken a look at RFC5424 to see if I could glean how I might match on the hostname, but as ever with RFC's, they're pretty abstract.
I want to receive the logs from my router (an ASUS RT68U) on my laptop (OSX 10.9).
Finally, I turned off the firewall and ran sudo tcpdump udp port 514.
The only thing I can think to do is edit /etc/syslog.conf, but I wouldn't know with what.
