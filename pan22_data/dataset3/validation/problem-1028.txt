Windows DEFRAG shows very high fragmentation (90%) on the volume.
Windows defrag just uses a defragmentation API which is built on top of a logical filesystem which in turn will sit somewhere above the HAL; at this level the underlying hardware really doesn't matter: so long as your device drivers are doing their job correctly the reported fragmentation will be at worst consistent irrespective of the app used.
Defrag will report the fragmentation of the logical disk: What this means in terms of how your data is scattered on the physical disks in the array depends on what kind of RAID (0, 1, 5, etc.)
RAID systems shouldn't have any effect on the fragmentation count in windows.
Generally you can probably treat it like you would any other hard drive (i.e.
My chief asked if DEFRAG reported fragmentation is correct (or near correct) or not.
If these are original disks you may want to make extra sure that your backups are good before defragging, just in case the defrag convinces the RAID controller that one or more drives are "failing".
The file system (where the fragmentation is calculated) is built on top of this.
It's a production server and we are very worried about it.
"), though at 90% that may be a painful experience.
We don't have any defrag being made for a long time (at least, not in the last 4 months, the time I work here).
Also of note: Defragmenting is obviously very disk-intensive.
