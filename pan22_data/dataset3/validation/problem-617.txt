You are correct - no video card I've heard of would be stealing that much RAM.
All from uninstalling some JDKs and rebooting....very odd.
But this computer I'm using has had many previous users, so I had like 9 jdks installed, some 64bit some x86.
especially the dxdiag command, I hadn't been aware of that before this.
Alright so I'm not sure why in the hell this did the trick.
The settings on dxdiag are the same as when I checked before as well.
So I figured I may as well get rid of all of the x86 installations because I had reason to believe that netbeans was running one of these x86 jdk installations, (which it was), because I wasn't even getting much over 4gb of ram usage when I was overflowing my heap space while trying to find a bug.
Anyway, long story short, now it shows a straight 12GB of memory installed on the System page of the control panel, no sub-text about how only a certain amount is available.
If you do swap out, periodically check whether your machine shows all of the RAM available.
