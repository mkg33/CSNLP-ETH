If you have a spare drive, you should make full backup of the faulty drive before proceeding.
It can be done with dd tool (found in most Linux distributions, including LiveCD ones, eg.
Press Win, type cmd, right-click the item that appears and choose Run as Administrator.
The partition type could be Linux, which is not recognized by Windows.
You can do something like: (assuming /dev/sda is the drive you want to back up and /dev/sdb0/backup.img is the path for the backup)
Confirm UAC dialog, then run: (replace e: with your drive letter followed by a colon)
It will analyze your drive's structure and (hopefully) rebuild partition table, making your drive ready for further recovery.
Testdisk should fix your partitions, but before starting to browse them you should run chkdsk on each one.
It will display the contents as far as it can, so maybe you can at least detect if there's something on the drive or all zeros.
If you use Linux, you can use dd or dd_rescue to save the partition to an image.
Conneting it to a Linux machine might reveal what the content is.
The best tool for the job I can think of is testdisk which has already saved many disks that have suffered from the same issue, including mine.
On Windows you'd need a 3rd party tool like TrueImage or similar for backup.
If you want to see the disk content before, try FTK Imager Lite, which is free.
Don't create new partition table or partitions or you may overwrite your data.
It can take some time, but when chkdsk is done you should have most of your data recovered.
