I think the best strategy to do this would be able using the same technique used to test telephony links.
This becomes very expensive a long time before it becomes practical.
This would be difficult to benchmark without sophisticated audio equipment.
It will interwork with your own servers, so you can setup your own border server if needed.
This solution would be a software that generates a specific (and fixed) bandwidth signals, with all components on the same level on the transmiter side; and a frequency component reader on the reception side.
Most consumer level equipment, from the speakers to the headphones to the microphones, are very low quality, providing only enough data to basically transmit recognizable human speach.
It violates my mostly closed firewall setup severely.
but in real life I've only ever experienced the pleasure of a 16 Kbps Speex call.
I haven't used Live Messager as I mostly use Linux.
I had very acceptable latency of about 200-250ms; much better than I thought.
It works well with my mostly closed firewall setup.
to get a call for more than 3 seconds without almost 100% dropped packets I had to VPN through the connection (as expected, as I'm on the middle tier for my mobile broadband package it deprioritises Skype traffic).
This is a fairly subjective question - I can only provide subjective responses :-) but I've used all three (Skype, GTalk, WLM) a fair amount.
The cheap way to do this is to use the same computer and the same people to rehearse a set selection of dialog and rate it subjectively on clarity and comprehension.
GTalk uses very few ports, and uses open protocols.
Here you have both conversation sides, called A (the caller) and B (the called one).
Or, you can just go online and read what others who have more money and more time have done.
I dont know if there is already a software solution to test it, but it wolud be great to have some solution.
However, Google Plus' Hangout (which uses the latest Vidyo codecs) is (at the moment at least) really good quality and pretty much on a par with Skype for pure audio quality.
You would need very high quality, reference tuned inputs and outputs (microphones and speakers) and then a recording device that can compare the resulting sound output to the reference input and highlight any differences.
:-( Windows Live Messenger is pretty much the same quality wise - Skype edges it.
My recomendation is (if you dont find any specific software that does that) is use Matlab to generate a linear audio source, transmit it over the voip link channel, receive and analyze it on the frequency domain.
So at the moment, Skype pips it for call quality - but I very much expect Google/Vidyo to surpass that quality, particularly given the SQ and PQ of calls I've seen over standard broadband using the standard Vidyo-branded service.
GTalk's quality could in theory be excellent; their plugin supports:
Skype's SILK codec is vastly improved over previous iterations but for me - even with over 2 Mbps of upstream bandwidth - it still takes a while to scale up to use all the available bandwidth, then it seems to want to lower in quality at the drop of a hat (or lost packet).
The technique consists on inject on A side a wide and linear range of acceptable frequencies (for example from 3k to 15kHz) and analyze how this range of frequencies are heard on B side (on telephony and data links this are made by network analyzers).
The aplication compares the diferences between transmited and received signals and give you a "benchmark note" to the link (and consequently to the voip solution software used).
You would need an accurate sound sample conveying a wide range of possible sounds in different frequencies and with different types of stops (consonant sounds), and you'd need a system that has a very good sound card electronically isolated from the rest of the system to prevent sample contamination.
The best link would give exactly the same wide and linear levels of transmitted signal on B side (this is theorical, on phisical links you will never get this enviroment).
I would expect no significant call quality differences between any of the three services.
The article Best Free Video Conference Software Review grades video and voice conferencing software for audio and video.
My choice would be based more on security considerations such as firewall requirements.
I tested GTalk to my wife when she was on a train using wireless.
Skype is also quite tolerant (so it seems, from  a weekend of testing in a hotel with overpriced wifi) of 3G connections, at least with a VPN, HSDPA and an acceptable level of contention on the cell tower.
