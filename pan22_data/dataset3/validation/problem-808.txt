I'm using LibreOffice Calc, so the user interface is a little different from Excel.
Columns K and L use Boolean arithmetic, based on TRUE being treated as a value of 1 and FALSE as a value of 0.
Column J uses the AND function to test whether both individual tests are true.
I set up the first row and then used Copy and Paste Special, Formats to replicate the conditional formatting to the other rows.
Apply the formula Conditional Formatting to range B2:C11
When you encounter an Excel problem that seems complex, break it down into the components that need to be accomplished.
You just need to select one and use it in a conditional formatting formula.
You can evaluate each cell and then look at the combination of results.
The next step is testing that both cells meet the condition.
When you're testing for blanks, you can test whether multiple cells are blank using the fact that stacking blanks next to each other still results in a blank.
You can use any test you want, just pick the one you prefer.
A few commonly used ones are shown in columns E:G below (what is shown in the header is just the test, not an actual formula):
So you have a bunch of different ways to do the test.
