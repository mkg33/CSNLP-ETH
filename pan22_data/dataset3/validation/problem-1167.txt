Employing both could be a reasonable solution as well.
Basically you will need three things: a probe, a data collector and a visualizer/shaper/web interface.
It can't give you real time statistics but you can right nightly scripts that pulls IP's and sites visited and than tailor your squid.conf file to do quality of service for specific hosts and protocols.
It's 3.XX family is free but it lacks English documentation almost completely.
It does not need a probe on Linux, since it can use libpcap for measuring traffic.
I have a sub-net of machines which are run autonomously by users.
There are a number of free probes on the market: ipcad and ndsad are probably the most popular.
If you want to cap something or 'shape traffic' (Which i think you mean more QoS) than I would go with Squid Proxy server.
That may be a good solution for statistics but it seems you may want more...
Basically, something that let's me account and charge users for their network traffic.
A good visualizer/shaper is more difficult to find.
There is something called Captrap, but I've never tried it.
A free data collector is pmacct, it can collect both NetFlow and sFlow and right traffic information to an RDBMS.
I control the server which acts as gateway between the sub-net and the internet.
