Alternatively, is there a way to initiate transferring a configuration snippet to apply, rather than replacing the entire configuration?
If copying to the start configuration, a merge operation is not done, so it replaces the entire config.
I know there is a method for initiating a TFTP copy via SNMP (doc), but is there something like port level config directly from SNMP writes?
Is it possible to configure a Cisco switch running IOS via SNMP?
This means a configuration snippet could be written to a text file, then TFTP'd to the switch which will merge with the running config, rather than replacing it.
I'm trying to avoid using Expect or anything that is not similar to accessing an API.
To answer my own question, it doesn't look like Cisco provides high granularity configuration via SNMP (e.g., port configuration), but it does provide a method for initiating a FTP/TFTP/SCP config copy to the switch.
This copy can be performed to the running configuration which allows merging.
