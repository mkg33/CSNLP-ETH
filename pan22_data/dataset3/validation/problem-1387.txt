If you're looking for "tiny" examples and you like Roguelikes, you should check out the listings for the 1kb roguelikes contest.
Maybe it is a good idea not only look at open source games but to some freely available game systems (editors etc.)
If you want 200 lines, then the only type of game I can think of would be a good old-fashioned text adventure.
It is something I would reccomend You if You are more advanced programmer, because some of these techniques are quite non-readable.Nevertheless, it is a nice set of techniques.
There are a couple C examples that are rather clever (though they probably aren't good learning examples, just fun to read.)
Although most are larger than a few hundred lines.
I've got the source for a simple one we're using for a code war competition at Windward Wrocks.
I mean for example GameStylus adventure game editor and engine, where - in the editor - you can clearly see what data structures are in the back of the game and how they are used.
Please, this is not how You should program but a demonstration how much a game can be compressed.
Proper way would not be to make such "abominations" but to properly design, document, test (...) Your program and such code would be the result of many compression techniques applied on very good design.
where you can find some inspiration for your data structures and what is behind it all.
You can find a few open source games written in objective-c on github.
