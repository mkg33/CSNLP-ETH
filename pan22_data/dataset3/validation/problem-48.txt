I had about a dozen of them depending on which services I wanted running (we had brokers of all different versions installed for in-house software).
I set up a bunch of batch files with NET START and NET STOP.
The hard part is knowing which services and particular test configuration is going to need running or stopped.
I suspect that, in those happy times, most tester will use virtual machines to handle your scenario.
And then, on the services mmc on each service logon tab, you can specify on which hardware profile this service will run.
Saved the file as "Apache-Hamachi.bat" and stuck them all in my quick launch.
I had a similar scenario once where I needed to stop/start or restart a whole bunch of services.
Create a batch file to start or stop services is simple enough using the NET START and NET STOP commands.
control panel=> system => hardware tab => hardware profile.
This is something you really have to do yourself, as none of us can know your requirements as well as you do.
You can enable or disable services based on hardware profile.
