But, you can pay a company like dnsexit.com to route DNS requests to
1) Most internet service providers provide alternative port numbers for remote use.
This will usually result in ugly access to your server
In your case verizon should have an SMTP server that you can use for your outbound email.
I got around their brutal blocking tactics by using non-standard port #'s.
2) If 1 fails then simply use the SMTP server local to that network.
for remote SMTP I have to use 587 and I have to authenticate first.
It is hard to believe Verizon blocks SMTP ports, but here is a way:  If you are able to keep your home PC turned on, then I recommend installing Bitwise SSHD on it, then open port 22 in your firewall.
The solution I eventually settled on was to use "putty" ssh client which has built in options to create a ssh tunnel.
When you move to another network you can change back to 1) or use 2 again etc.
So you can just change your email program to use that server as your smtp server while you're on that network.
Just make sure to telnet into the port after opening up a server to listen via TCP so you can test the port is not blocked by verizon before you setup the port forwarding.
This isn't a general solution, but does take care of the most pressing problem (if the ssh port is open)
I log into the smtp server and use putty to tunnel outgoing mail to it.
Then, from your netbook, if you need access to the Verizon SMTP server, you can use the Tunnelier client to tunnel through, via your desktop at home.
