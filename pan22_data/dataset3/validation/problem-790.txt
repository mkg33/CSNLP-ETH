1) Change the server configuration on the server to listen on 80
Browsers open HTTP on port 80, and HTTPS, on port 443.
I strongly recommend against option 3 as it breaks many things from a scalability perspective later on, and isn't a very good fix.
3 possible solutions to the problem are as follow:
You shouldn't be serving directly off the container.
2) Add a Web Server either on the Ubuntu host, or on a separate host to listen on 80 and redirect to port 80
3) You could add an azure load balancer and do a reverse NAT from 80 to 8080 on your server.
DNS can't solve this problem directly because it's only responsible for translating xxx.cloudapp.westeurope.azure.com to your public IP.
You can't directly have a browser open port 8080 by default.
Are you running a J2EE container listening on port 8080?
It's been a while, but I think websphere listens to 8080 by default.
DNS is used for name resolution - not the services behind this.
Check on the service definition or NAT to make your service accessible on application default ports (which is 80 for http / 443 for https)
