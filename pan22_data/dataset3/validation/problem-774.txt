Immediately before the first stage of the crash the router logs the following events (captured using the remote save system log function:)
As it was my understanding based on http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131 that servers should only receive DISCOVER.

I have a TP-Link router that keeps crashing but in two stages, first the DHCP, web management and remote log saving become nonfunctional then about 2 hours after this the router becomes of less use than a lobster, that is it responds to no form of outside input that I could think of, until it is rebooted.

My Question is: Can/Should a DHCP server send a DISCOVER message?
