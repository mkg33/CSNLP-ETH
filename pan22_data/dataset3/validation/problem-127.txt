Do note that I don't necessarily want to do Apple NetBoot.
I've already tried booting the Mac Mini using gPXE and iPXE, and in both cases the [gi]PXE complains that it can't find any network hardware.
I could, possibly, hack the codebase of either project to â€“ maybe the PCI IDs for the Mini's network card just isn't listed, but I need to find other alternatives.
I also don't want to have to purchase Lion Server either, as much as possible.
If I could do Apple NetBoot into the CloneZilla client, that would be nice.
Are there any decent ways to accomplish PXE booting on a mid-2011 Mac Mini (Core i5)?
I need to be able to boot into CloneZilla over the network (as I want to image the Mac Mini's hard drive, and later on clone it to other Mac Minis).
Alternatively, is there a way to accomplish something like a PXE network boot via USB?
What I mean is, is it possible to boot of a USB, and then continue the rest of the boot process as though the machine were booted off of PXE?
I do know you could set up NetInstall/NetRestore on Lion Server, but that's a cost I want to avoid: we've already set up CloneZilla for imaging our Linux machines, and having to set up parallel infrastructure just for the handful of Mac Minis we're going to clone is going to add to our costs.
