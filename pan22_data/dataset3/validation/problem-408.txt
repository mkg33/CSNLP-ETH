Once you've decided on these factors, the advantages and disadvantages of using a separate ESP on the external disk will become clearer.
Normally only one drive in a system needs an ESP; this will be the drive set as the "drive to boot from" in the firmware settings.
Overall, I'd say you should consider how you intend to use the disk (always plugged into one computer, plugged in sometimes but never used on another machine, or as a roaming OS installation used on multiple machines) and what sort of boot loader configuration you want (a single GRUB or the like that boots everything, a boot manager that boots a separate boot loader for each OS or distribution, using the machine's built-in boot manager to launch a boot loader for each OS, etc.).
In many cases the differences will be small to nonexistent.
In the vast majority of systems the only purpose for an ESP is for booting.
Unless you want to fiddle with your firmware settings so as to boot from different drives' ESPs at different times, nothing will ever use the ESPs from additional drives (again: In the vast majority of cases).
Either method will work, but there are some caveats and differences:
