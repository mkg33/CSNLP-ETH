If I were a gambling man I'd suspect that your network could do with either a redesign or some investment as many company's regular office networks haven't been upgraded to take into account the huge increase in internet and intranet traffic seen over recent years.
Whilst there are faster protocols than SMB it's not by any means inherently slow.
I know this is old, but a very important factor to take into consideration is disk I/O.
Also there's a reasonable chance that the server/s may need replacing or rework to get the best from them.
It is however perhaps a little more susceptible to outside influences than other protocols, these being saturated servers, saturated segments etc.
Either way I wouldn't put too much emphasis on SMB being the direct culprit, it's more than likely to just the fall-guy for bad/old network and server kit.
Having said that, the operations that you describe shouldn't take a long time.
File listing of large directories can take a while - some of this is due to SMB, some due to NTFS, some due to stupid things that the various versions of Explorer, and installed software, can do from the client end.
Certain things like file-based databases (Access, PST files) should not be opened across slow (WAN) links because they don't deal well with latency.
I've seen that before as the case and our solution was to remove direct RDP access and shift end remote users to VPN in.
If there is a network process using a lot of bandwidth, check that process and inspect how many and what the hosts are that are tied to that process.
Maybe the company has some software as part of the standard install that slows things down.
It does have more overhead (for transfer) than things like NFS or FTP.
From this vantage, you can see if there is a culprit process or set of processes eating away at Disk I/O, or a memory leak (SQLServer.exe - SBSMonitoring instance), etc.
Maybe there's a WAN link you don't know about between you and the server.
It could be a lot of hack attempts to RDP in on 3389.
Network load is a factor, but the best thing to do as a sysadmin is look at Resource Monitor and inspect where the bottlenecks might be originating from - inspecting the Overview tab to show overall CPU, Network, Disk I/O, Memory, etc.
If the disk write performance is incredibly slow due to software / motherboard RAID as opposed to a hardware-based RAID card with dedicated memory.
