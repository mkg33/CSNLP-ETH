Also, what kind of attack is this formally called?
If it's /24, you're likely seeing someone else's traffic because their destination address isn't in the switch's CAM table.
In either case, go after the sender as identified by their MAC address.
It filters by Ethernet hardware address, but it doesn't always know for sure which port is associated with an Ethernet hardware address.
I have a bunch of UDP datagrams reaching my server that look like so:
Maybe these datagrams are destined for another container that shares the same NIC with your node.
This would be a UDP Flood attack, if the datagrams weren't corrupted and were destined for random ports.
(...and for some reason your NIC is in promiscuous mode)
Maybe someone is trying to see if 208.69.57.21 is vulnerable to MS11-083/CVE-2011-2013.
I could be wrong, but the only way I can think of for a datagram to reach your computer when the layer 3 address doesn't match is if the layer 2 address is manually resolved on the sender and the sender is on the same layer 2 segment.
Unless you have an atypical network, there are no rules to prevent a packet from getting switched to machines other than its destination.
If a switch doesn't know which port a device is on it will send traffic destined to that device out every port.
Any chance that your host is a virtual private server?
So some packets do get flooded to all switched ports.
The fact that the source and destination port numbers are 0 along with the UDP length error looks odd.
The Ethernet layer has no idea what IP address the packets are bound for, so it cannot reliably filter them by IP.
If this is true, you should be able to identify the sender by the layer 2 source address in that packet capture.
The question is, my IP is not 208.69.57.21, (it was 208.69.57.101) so how are those datagrams even being received/logged by my tcpdump?
I suppose it's also possible that the layer 3 device (router or firewall) that does sit on your layer 2 segment could be compromised or misconfigured to result in the improper resolution of that layer 3 address to your layer 2 address.
