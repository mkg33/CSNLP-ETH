I assume that you did install the client tools on the guests?
being enabled on the host NIC, and needing to disable it in ESX 4.0.
I installed ESXi 4.0 on an HP Proliant g5 with a 64bit Xeon processor and took advantage of the free license as I work for a public school.
The "locked up" state means that as far I could tell, all services were stopped; dhcp no longer handed out IP's, DNS stopped working, I couldn't RDP into the server.
I've seen this happen a couple of times on ESX 3.5 and 4.0.
Thanks for your replies, and I'll do my best to respond ASAP.
Now, can anyone tell me what is happening, and how I can fix it, or take steps to prevent it?
Several times I had to restart ESXi from it's console in order to restart my machines.
I had both guests up and running fine, setup my user accounts, transferred the data, etc etc.
If the guests are upgrades from 3.5 then you need to make sure that the hardware version has been upgraded, as well as the client tools.
Currently, the server is powered off, and I've reinstituted my nine year old Server 2000 boxes, and I'm considering installing ESXi 3.5.
I'd really like to avoid having to rebuild those accounts!
If the process which is the VM is orphaned then you'll have to reboot the host to clear the process.
Does anyone know a host created in 4.0 will work in 3.5?
He spoke to a friend of his who is VM certified, and he also said he had never heard of this issue.
Have you ruled out problems with the install media?
Sometimes it would be for five or so minutes, once it was overnight.
I hired a consultant to come take a look at it, someone who's experience and knowledge I trust, and he told me he had never seen anything like this ever before.
How did you configure your virtual machines, how man vCPU did you choose for each?
Once I joined a client machine to the domain, I would find that both of my Windows guests would lock up.
When this happens look can you get onto a console on the host (not sure if ESXi gives you a console or not) and look to see if the process is orphaned or not.
VSphere was working, and I could look at the performance of the individual guests.I would try Powering off the hosts from inside VSPhere, and the hosts would start powering off, but get stuck at 95%, and stay that way, sometimes only for 10 minutes, others for hours.
I created two instances of server 2003 from scratch, one to be the DC, DHCP, the other to be a file server and DNS/DHCP backup.
The ESXi host, my HP server, was still running fine.
Edit: just remembered... check your NIC settings on the host server.
I vaguely remember having problems with one of the NIC features (TCP offloading?)
I've no reason to suspect that there is a compatibility problem but have you checked the servers themselves and all of the component hardware (especially NICs, seen lots of problems with NICs in my time) for compatibility with ESXi 4 VMware HCL?
I know 4.0 works on this server, as I have another server in another school with the same exact hardware running 4.0 fine.
I know for a fact that 3.5 has issues with their bootup-time if you selected more than 1 vCPU on each machine, and you didn't really gain any performance from it anyway.
