I have selected the option to not automatically register these IPs in DNS.
I forgot to choose the interfaces that DNS listens to on the new server.
Because of this, it seems to register all interfaces that are enabled.
I have also deleted these non-routeable IPs manually in DNS.
Also, I have tried fixing the nameserver ( NS ) records on the zone to be the 2 IPs we need them to be.
You can then select the interfaces you would like.
My problem is that everytime I delete these IPs, they are created again in DNS.
Right-click on the server in the DNS management snap-in, and choose properties.
But sure enough, the non-routeable IPs get added as NS records repeatedly after being deleted.
I have turned off dynamic updates on the zone on the server side and set the interface to not register in DNS on the client site!
How can I get Windows to stop dynamically adding IPs I am deleting?
By default the DNS server listens to all network interfaces.
On these servers we have routeable and private/non-routeable ( 10.
If you do, please check if you have any abandoned computer records.
The problem is that a query for the nameserver's network name returns non-routeable ips.
These IPs need to be on the computer but shouldn't be returned by DNS.
