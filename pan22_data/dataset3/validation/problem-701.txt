I also have the VX Nano, but that one is actually a little too small and I don't like the fact you cannot click the scroll wheel for middle click.
And the batteries are AAs, (and they last a long time), so you don't have to worry about charging batteries, or being stuck with a dead mouse.
Middle click has been relegated to a small button behind the wheel.
This will keep you from wearing your finger out doing these kinds of things.
So much I bought three of them (One for work, one for home, one for a friend.)
It takes two standard AA batteries, and they last a long time.
This mouse fits my slightly smaller hands perfectly, plus it's got the nano receiver that you can just plug into your notebook and forget about!
Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000 is good choice.
If you have bluetooth, get a Logitech v270, or its replacement, the v470.
Instead, it changes the wheel from normal mode to "free spin" mode.
I found I don't really used the "free spin" mode very often (PgUp, PgDn, Ctrl+[Home/End] are your friends.)
One very nice feature is the flywheel scroll wheel.

This mouse is by far the best one I have ever used!!!
Also Vista apps couldn't really keep up with the "free spin" mode for me, so it didn't work well.
I can't tell you the hardship having to go back to a normal mouse after using one of these.
I like it so much I had to buy one for every computer I own.
When navigating large spreadsheets or long documents, the wheel will spin freely for a full 7 seconds.
I'm using the BT600 for a while and I'm really happy with it.
They have a standard mini-USB connector so you can charge them quite everywhere.
It also has the smallest receiver I have seen on any mouse.
