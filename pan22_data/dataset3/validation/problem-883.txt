If (1) you should probably get different results making a third copy and comparing the copies.
The Finder just hides this fact from you for folders called *.app.
I'm pretty sure what's happening is that Finder / Get Info is using some not-very-clever heuristic to calculate the size of the .app folder.
I had this problem with my Home Directory once I moved it onto an internal HDD after installing Yosemite on the SSD.
My guess is that the estimate on the copy is correct because OSX has recently had to inspect every file in it when you did the copy, whereas on the original, OSX may never have had to do so (e.g.
I fixed it by clicking Get Info on the Users folder, which then calculated properly and fixed the incorrect size being reported by Home Directory.
Firstly, you need to be aware that Mac .app files are in fact Directories, not compiled binaries like Windows .exe files.
When using 'Get Info' it reported an incorrect size of only 8GB, although it showed the correct size of 240GB in the status bar of Finder.
This is basically a guess, but I see two possibilities:
This means it doesn't need to enumerate every single subfolder and file and add together all those sizes.
