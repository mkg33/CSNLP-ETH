Not familiar with ESXi bonding in particular but I bet it uses Linux bonding.
So if you don't need anywhere need the bonded bandwidth some like to just keep it simple.
In general the Active/Standby model is the most straight forward and keeps thie KISS principal.
This could reduce latency and eliminate a bottleneck, depending on the way your network traffic patterns look.
This is useful especially in ethernet based storage networks where redundancy is required at the host, switch, and filer levels.
Then during a failure the application is congested and acts up, making it much more difficult to trace the source.
One of the main reasons to use Active/Backup mode is when he NIC connects to a different switch it can be more simple.
The only thing that comes to mind is that in case of a (single) link failure, you don't lose capacity and your application becomes more predictable.
You might want to try to keep all communication within a single switch in normal operating conditions, so that you do not put any unneccessary load and risk congestion on a link between the switches, instead keeping the traffic within a single switch backplane.
For example link usage can slowly creep up beyond a single link (application growth over months) without anyone fully realizing that.
Your network switch must be properly configured to use an active-active nic teaming.. in Cisco switches you need to configure a port-channel.

Well actually, the most commmon reason is because each nic might go to a different switch.
