The content of the keys should not be related to the hardware or O/S, but do depend on the random numbers they provide.
Once generated these keys are stored for future use.
puttygen the ssh key generator tool for windows actually lets the user move the mouse cursor randomly within the window to seed the random number generator.
Public keys and are freely distributable, and are automatically exchanged during the connection.
Logically I assume that the keys are generated at random and have nothing to do with the hardware/os (besides the last line with the user/computer) they are on.
Putty uses a different format than OpenSSH, but there are tools for both to convert the format.
terminal based key generators can let the user type random keys on the keyboard in order to seed the random number generator.
There are multiple algorithms to generate public/private key pairs.
this is better than any pure program based generator would do.
Copying the old keys may allow the transfer of trust.
It does require re-establishing trust relationships.
If the random number generator is predictable, then it may be possible for a remote attacker to generate the same keys.
You can have a look at RSA and DSA if you are interested.
Saw a question on Twitter about moving the current SSH Keys to the same machine after a new installation.
This raised my curiosity and I asked myself how they are made.
I understand the process on generating a key and the difference between the private and public.
This allows you to transfer the list of devices you trust.
If you move from one platform to another you may need to change the key format.
Usually known keys are stored so that the verification dialog is not required on subsequent connections.
There are various formats used to transport the keys.
I generally generate new keys for new devices as this is more secure.
The private key should rarely need to be transported.
Sometimes the trust includes other information such as hostname and/or IP address preventing the transfer of trust.
Generation of ssh keys does depend on the quality of the random number generator provided by the host operating system.
