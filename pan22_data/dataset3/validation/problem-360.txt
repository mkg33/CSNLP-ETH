5 isn't going away anytime soon, and despite it going out of support with RH in less than a year, I still have to get the population of 5's integrated with AD.
We have several instances of AD: one is a "management AD" ("MAD") where all sysadmin accounts should live.
Given the choice between the two, I'd prefer SSSD as Winbind is "pretty old".
I won't post the entire sssd_CAD.log unless someone asks, but here are the first indicators that something is wrong.
All other domains ("CAD", "FAD", "BAD") trust MAD.
The main platform is RHEL, and I have a mixture of 5, 6, and 7.
This isn't optional with several hundred systems; user account management is long past being an issue.
I've found nothing to help me figure out what's wrong when one of those steps doesn't work.
One more requirement is that "groups" and "id" produce information out of AD as we intend to use openssh's "AllowGroups" feature to restrict logins to particular AD groups.
Any solution needs to work across 5, 6, and 7 as we don't want to be supporting multiple ways of doing things.
Only internal systems will be associated with MAD.
There are later entries that complain about sssd_ad not being connected to the AD, but that's no surprise given what I see here.
My main options (at least the ones I am working on) are Winbind and SSSD.
There's a lot of setup here, so please bear with me.
For lab purposes, I'm starting with a fresh install of RHEL7 off ISO (kickstart with some basic config stuff), with no authentication bits set up within the KS.
I'm at the end of my rope with this thing, and beginning to think making sandwiches would be a less annoying career choice.
I am fairly strong with unix/linux in general, but I am not strong with AD, Kerberos, or LDAP.
First off, the goal is to have all of our Linux and Unix systems authenticate against AD.
If there's more stuff I need to add here, just say the word and it'll be up.
Any guidance from you folks would be greatly appreciated.
Manually as so far I can't depend on later steps to get it right.
I've been perusing various posts already about getting linux systems to authenticate using AD, but haven't seen anything approaching what I'm beating my head against.
Most systems will be associated with CAD, FAD, or BAD.
Browsing through /var/log/sssd/sssd_CAD.log, I find a few things that give me a clue as to where things are screwing up, but I've not been successful in finding a way to fix them: every guide I read gives a sequence of steps and assumes every step works.
I am guessing that this list should be much longer, but not being strong in kerb, I don't know if this really is correct, if not what it should look like, nor how to get it there.
I have followed every manual, every howto, every guide, and when it comes down to it, there's always one little thing that doesn't seem to be usefully documented that blocks me.
"kinit Administrator" followed by "net ads join -k".
So: fresh image with timesync/krb5.conf/smb.conf all done, now "kinit Administrator" followed by "klist"
Step 3: Make sure there are both forward and reverse DNS entries for the target system.
