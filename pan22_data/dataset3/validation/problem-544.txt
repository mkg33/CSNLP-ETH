Due to the recent changes in our network I added last 2 recently and did not bother commenting the old ones as I thought that having extra nameservers won't effect if the name is resolved or not and it will probably just take little bit more time.
This is compounded multiplicatively if you have search entries and are resolving single-label names where search list entries are appended.
Bottom line, having additional nameserver references to known dead nameservers on Linux / Unix systems using straight /etc/resolv.conf for resolution is detrimental.
If the first 4 nameservers are non-responsive, you have to wait a minimum of 20 seconds for every DNS query.
Typical applications, e.g., web browser, will give up waiting for an answer after ~15 seconds, so from that perspective, the perception is "the Internet is down" even though an answer may be forthcoming.
Having many servers are fine as long as you understand a 'not found' answer, is completely different from a failure to communicate with the server.
If you client attempts to resolve your intenal domain against the public sever and got a response saying there was no results then it stops.
But without commenting out the previous 4 nameservers the names wont't resolve and I am just wondering why.
Lets say you your client is configured to use Google DNS, and also pointed at internal servers for Active Directory.
For Unix / Linux using the standard C library resolver code (implied by reference to /etc/resolv.conf), the nameserver entries are used in order with ~5 second timeout between them.
Your resolver only tries another server if there is a failure.
So I see no reason why it should not work without uncommenting the previous nameserver entries.
