So you should really be comparing the mA-H rating of the batteries (old and new) to determine its life difference.
If the 30W consuming laptop used a 9V voltage regulator it would use 63W at 19V.
I ordered a new battery for my faithful XPS M1710.
If we assume the needed power draw to be constant, a higher voltage would indicate less amperage needed, therefore the battery would last longer before running out, yes?
The higher voltage DOES NOT mean longer period of operating time, laptop shuts off when any single cell in the battery reaches the low voltage limit.
A quick look at the Dell web site shows the replacement battery for that model is 11.1 volts (3 stacked Li-ion cells).
I'm not sure of the voltage of the battery I have now, but the new one that the Dell rep got me (after 3-4 times confirming my phone number and laptop model number) is 14.8v.
I was a bit concerned about potential incompatibilities (as most of the other compatible batteries listed were 11.1v), but I figure that there's no way that Dell would "recommend" batteries that wouldn't work or fry your system.
The higher voltage means that the battery can maintain the minimum voltage required to operate the computer for a longer period of time, hence extending battery life.
The voltage doesn't really make that much difference, and any excess is mostly wasted.
The single-charge battery life is entirely determined by its charge capacity, measured in amp-hours, and the current draw on it by the load.
It does not matter what voltage is available from battery, high voltage and low current equals low voltage and high current.
The actual voltage used by the computer is electronically regulated, so this cannot cause any damage to the computer.
That increased drop would be converted into heat energy (and wasted).
It is actually more likely to have one weak cell if there are 4 cells in series than 3 cells.
Any additional voltage (as supplied by a fourth cell in series as found in the 14.8 volt part) would have to be dropped across the voltage regulator.
That is the voltage your systems voltage regulator will expect.
Now, my question is, how does voltage affect battery life?
Full 14.8V Li ion battery is 16.8V and empty 11.1V battery is 9V.
If your laptop consumes 30W it will work 1 hour and 46 minutes with battery A or B.
