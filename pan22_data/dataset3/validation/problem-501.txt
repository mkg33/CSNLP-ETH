The National Institute of Standards and Technology agrees:
If the password wasn't long enough, it will be cracked in a matter of minutes and up to several days.
Latest crackers can, on machines with the right video cards, use the GPU itself to crack passwords with a brute-force attack at a speed comparable to a super-computer.
Conclusion: Only if you use the latest Acrobat version and employ very longggg passwords and no dictionary words, will you be safe enough.
see how PayPal now optionally allows access only via a new security code sent to your mobile.
But then, all this will be a wasted effort if your password leaked to the web ...
So, you can expect to provide a password such as mypaSwURD_frOM2009onMunTH#16, which is easier to memorize (includes purposed typos) and still obtain the same high security level.
And while they upgraded the encryption to 256-bit AES, the algorithm allows for brute force and dictionary attacks to waste less processor cycles on each password interaction.
Your recipient will have to know what it is - and may leak it as in the next item.
A PC key-logger would find this difficult to defeat unless your mobile is already infected by a key-logger!
The simple test is to send a pdf file encrypted as V9.0 acrobat with a password similar to  sd8Jf+*e8fhÂ§$fd8sHa,  and ask anyone to decrypt it.
Necessarily, that type of password will be a strong one under Acrobat 9 and will render any brute-force or dictionary attack (pretty much the only means of breaking a pdf protected document) very inefficient methods.
Your keyboard 'buffer' is your enemy in this respect.
Place you data-files on a server - where you can only gain access via a two part process.
One last comment, the size of your password will be the most determining factor in protection, as well as the unique count of characters.
Doesn't matter how securely the password is stored if there are work-arounds (Acrobat is way better than Word, however).
If after say 10 days no-one has replied with the contents on view then you know your data is safe.
Under Acrobat 9, Adobe made changes to the underlying algorithm.
From a more practical...shall we say legal...point of view, going to full encryption is going to do a lot to show that you're taken due dilligence with sensitive data.
Password protections built into pdf, word processing, spreadsheets, archiving software...They're nearly all hobby-ist systems, put in place to stop people who are honest, not people who are determined.
And while it needs to be said these tools will perform faster under Acrobat 9, it would still be years before a common user machine could eventually break your password.
From the Adobe site - Securing documents with passwords:
I'd say you're very safe, especially with a password like that.
You can integrate them with email, you can save whatever document format is convenient, and you can be sure that, as long as your key exchange procedures are solid, no one is going to be reading your mail.
I'd recommend looking into GPG or PGP for actual encryption (they're basically the same program, but PGP is polished, commercial, and expensive, and gpg is open source, little rough around the edges (as far as user friendliness goes), and free-as-in-beer.)
With such a password your documents will be pretty much well protected.
These read your passwords as you type them and potentially send them anywhere without you knowing.
