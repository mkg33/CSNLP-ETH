A SQL Server clustered instance can run on any node in the cluster, but it will only be running on one node.
It might be running on node 1 like SQLServerA, but it might also be on node 2 - it's independent.
As long as it is licensed correctly, another instance of SQL Server can be installed onto the cluster - it's called instance stacking.
This might be called active/passive, because only one node is used - and licensed.
If it's on node 2, the cluster might be called active/active.
A virtual name given to the client/application means that it doesn't matter which node it is running on.
And so it goes on - you can install more instances of SQL Server - and you can add more nodes, if you edition of SQL Server and Windows allows.
Highly available, but becoming increasingly complex to administer.
So, if you have two nodes in the cluster, SQLServerA might be running on node 1 - and it can be failed over to run on node 2.
Holocryptic is spot on with the description, but it might be open to a bit of mis-interpretation.
