Another interesting point is saturation of host port.
Three probably isn't enough to justify making a product when 4 ports are readily available, so I'm sure that's why companies skip them.
Since each powered port needs 500 mA plus, we get 3.5 A power supply for external components (I'll assume that host computer can power the hub itself).
On 7 port USB 2.0 hub, external power source is required to provide power for each port.
As we get more and more ports on the hub, more and more devices will be connected meaning that the chances that several devices will try to use port at the same time increase.
As we are slowly moving to USB 3.0, power situation gets worse, since most basic unit load is 150 mA (up from 100 mA in USB 2.0) and each port can take up to 900 mA.
8-port is a lot of ports, I would estimate the demand is small.
Here's another aspect that is easily overlooked: Power!
If you're tying up one port to only really gain two, why do it?
At this point power supplies tend to get big and expensive and just the power supply can cost few times more that the hub itself.
4 port hubs are common, and an seven port hub is simply a doubled up four port with one port gone because you're using it to extend the four port again.
Why are USB hubs provided in 4- and 7-port varieties.
USB 2.0 hub with 4 ports can directly run form host computer and provide minimum power to each port just form host.
Is there something special about 4- and 7-port configurations that makes them more attractive?
