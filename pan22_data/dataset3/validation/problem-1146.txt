The EULAs for all Microsoft products can be found here:
No, you are not allowed to install the software on more than one computer at a time.
Up to five hundred disks and up to three days to install on one computer, so to do this on three computers could take up to six days.
I believe depending on what package you have the TOS will be available with the software.

In my home use program, I can buy more than one license, so I would expect that you can, too.
That is if you want a legal copy on all your computers.
One site where you can see this explained is here:

If you look at the 2010 agreement you can see the same "portable device" language.
The EULA for Office 2007 with the relevant portion highlighted is here:
There is support in the HUP license (which is the same as a retail license for this discussion) for installing on two machines, a primary and a portable.
There is no problem to install MS Office (any version) on three computers, but only if the license states so up front.
It is known to be more difficult and time consuming to install MS Office 2010 (Professional Edition) from the Floppy Disk.
It may be technically possible to install the same licence twice using the same key.
