balance-xor may or may not require switch configuration.
You need to set up an interface group (not LACP) on HP and Cisco switches, but apparently it's not necessary on D-Link, Netgear and Fujitsu switches.
You may need to tweak various settings (miimon, updelay) to get stable networking.
Most of these points are quite thoroughly described in the /usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt documentation file from the linux source package of your favorite distro.
balance-alb and balance-tlb may not work properly with all switches; there are often some arp problems (some machines may fail to connect to each other for instance).
Speed of failover is controlled by the "miimon" parameter for most modes, but shouldn't be set too low; normal values are under one second anyway.
802.3ad absolutely requires an LACP group on the switch side.
So when aggregating GigE interfaces, a file transfer from machine A to machine B can't top 1 gigabit/s, even if each machine has 4 aggregated GigE interfaces (whatever the bonding mode in use).
Note: whatever you do, one network connection always go through one and only one physical link.
balance-rr, active-backup, balance-tlb and balance-alb don't need switch support.
It's the best supported option overall for augmenting performance.
balance-rr augments performance at the price of fragmentation, performs poorly with some protocols (CIFS) and with more than 2 interfaces.
