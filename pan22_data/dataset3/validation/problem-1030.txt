Now, I do admit that you might be able to claim that this is similar to the biggest non-fair use exemption to copyright: the infamous home copy you're allowed to have.
4C: You will only access our content through our website (so, not through any programs);
I was originally planning on a comment, but it turned into an answer.
4A: You will not distribute any of the content on our site on any medium without our permission;
I've checked the Fanfiction, WattPad and DeviantArt ToS pages.
In addition, there are internationally agreed upon copyright laws that support the above statements, for example, the US copyright Act of 1976.
FF and WP both have 4 rules in their terms which will give you problems, even with the same number and wording:
5D: you will not copy any of the content on our site.
There is also the idea that this might be a transformative use, since this can turn any article on those websites into an audiobook that is more accessible to those with poor vision.
Some of this information might not be correct in your jurisdiction.
While not exactly a concern with the code itself, I do want to call out the issue of copyright and authorship here.
However, as far as I'm aware, you need permission to make audiobooks.
4E: You will not use any scrapers on our website, unless you have our permission.
DeviantArt has an entirely different format on their ToS, but they still say that you can't reproduce any of their user submitted content in any medium without their express permission.
