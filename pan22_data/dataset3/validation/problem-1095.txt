It all depends on what you want to do; industry or academia?
For example, Stockholm University does not require any math above algebra for its CS programs (some courses may have higher requirements, but not often).
I don't see the Ph.D program listed yet in the link you provided.
Rarely does a professor of a given course have to have a specific degree in order to teach it.
As far as mathematical rigor is concerned, I would expect Data Science to leverage a heavy dose of mathematically based material.
When I went to college, MIS, Computer Engineering, and Computer Science were new subjects.
I don't know why you couldn't be a professor with a PhD in data science.
Being a part of that puts you in rare company for that field.
Signal processing, robotics, applied physics, operations research, etc.
No-one knows since no-one's completed one of these PhD programs yet!
The research could be rigorous in its own right, but it definitely won't be tailored to someone who wants to optimize new algorithms or solve the low-level problems of machine learning.
Within a few years, CS programs around the country matured significantly.
As far as publishing goes, there are any number of related journals that would accept papers from somebody on topics that would be covered by the topic of Data Science.
However, I would look at the syllabus and the teachers to base my decision.
Since a "data scientist" is by nature is somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades it does seem a little odd to me.
It's hard to gauge the benefit of a program that doesn't exist yet.
I wouldn't expect anything particularly new - statistics, calculus, etc.
Will you please follow up here if you get more specific information?
Masters and PhD programs should be more about applying that knowledge and not so much about learning it.
If the rigor scares (or bores) you, then what about a more applied area?
Computer Science is itself a multi-disciplinary field which has varying requirements among universities.
As a student at NYU, I only know of a Masters in Data Science.
I am not sure what you mean by a machine learning program being more rigorous.
Data Science would likely take a broader view and focus on application and management (business courses are maybe on offer?).
Most of the people in my graduating class for Computer Science couldn't program anything significant at graduation.
It seems to me that the premise of a PhD is to expand knowledge in some little slice of the world.
When you are part of a new program, sometimes it's possible to help define what it is that's required for graduation.
