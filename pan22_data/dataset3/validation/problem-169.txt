It's also worth considering that you'll get lower ping times, less CPU overhead for decryption of WEP/WPA; and a more reliable connection with no interference from other networks.
While Wireless-N is theoretically faster, you'll be very hard pressed to get anything like the maximum speed, especially with multiple machines trying to get it at the same time.
In real terms, unless both of your machines are right next to the router, you'll be getting better speeds with wires.
An extra point to consider as well as those already mentioned (distance, interference, latency, : a wireless access point essentially acts as a hub rather than a switch so once you have more than one active transfer between machines on the wireless network the total throughput will fall due to collisions.
Collisions on the wireless side of your device will not slow down anything connected to the wired side though (unless one of the machines on the wired side is talking to a machine connected via wireless, or course, or the router is very badly designed).
At the transfer speed of wireless n or the 10/100 transfer speeds?
If I have a wireless n router with only a 10/100 LAN ports.
