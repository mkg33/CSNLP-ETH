It's just a front end script for all the built-in tools that linux uses for backups and tape management.
Rsync will work for local copies too (not over the network).
All you need is an 'rsync' script and a configured cron job.
And everything is done using hard links, so you don't waste disk space on multiple copies of the same files.
You may need to mount your external disk to one of the machines first.
You can do a full backup at the start of each day, and then store an incremental to each of those on an hourly/6-hourly/whatever basis.
A great advantage of rsnapshot is that you get multiple snapshots of the disks you decide to backup, all instantly available.
A number of them come with backup software or the option of being configured as the backup target.
have weekly, daily and multiple hourly snapshots taken.
rsync works but you might want to also consider some of the personal home NAS solutions.
I use it over SSH with a cron job that runs weekly.
It can also backup over the network via rsync or ssh.
Have a look at rsnapshot, which is a Perl-based wrapper around rsync that takes care of all the details around incremental backups etc.
You could go for either of those two, but for a small setup, I would just use rsync.
If it's important enough to backup, it's usually important enough to off-site.
If you are using rsync (which is a fine way as well) over a network, remember that your backups will be worthless if your backup server (and all of the backups on the system) is destroyed (fire, flood, robbery, etc).
