In that case you'd need to create a third partition (or use an external disk) and use a filesystem that both can read; NTFS should work for this, as last I knew the latest version of Ubuntu can read and write NTFS and FAT32 won't let you create files over 2 gig in size.
Then, re-install the guest OS in VirtualBox on the host OS.
You don't need to uninstall either OS, just need a lot of disk space.
Essentially you create a VMDK file for the Ubuntu drive and point VirtualBox at it using a bootable Grub mount as the boot media
someone else may chime in with a different answer on that, though.
If possible, what is the best way to accomplish this?
Not sure what the etiquette is for this in terms of linking or copying content from.
The option is not exposed in the user interface, but is documented in the User Manual.
I think I'm missing what the issue is...Virtualbox will install on either one (there's a Linux and Windows version as I recall), then you can boot a virtual system in which to install whatever operating system you want.
My advice would be to backup any data on the OS that you pick as the guest OS, then use a partition editing tool like PartedMagic to delete the guest OS's partitions and grow the host OS's partition(s) to fill the disk.
I've done it in Ubuntu, and I believe it's also possible on Windows.
Ubuntu is probably better at dealing with hardware changing around on an existing install, so I would recommend using Windows as the host.
If you create a VM under one platform and attach the disks of the other platform, you should be able to run one in the other without wiping and reinstalling.
AFAIK, there's not physical-to-virtual conversion tool for virtualbox.
I don't care about which OS will be the main system.
Whether you can do the P2V migration automatically or not, you'll still need to delete guest OS and grow your partition(s) for your host OS, and I've had great success with PartedMagic in the past.
I have a Vista/Ubuntu dual boot system, and would like to install VirtualBox to use both systems, but I don't want to uninstall any of these OS.
VirtualBox will allow you to attach physical hard drives, including existing partitions, to virtual machines.
There is the  VMWare converter, but I'm not sure if VirtualBox can run VMWare VMs.
(I also echo the current sentiments regarding backing up before doing anything just in case)
Do you mean you want to share the VM's with whatever OS is currently running?
You will almost certainly want to take a backup of your entire drive before attempting the instructions!
