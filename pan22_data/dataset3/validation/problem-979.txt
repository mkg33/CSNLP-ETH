That way you can have more restrictions in place for outside messages, more strict spam/attachment control, and less restrictive rules for internal mail (for example you might consider larger message size on internal server).
Nice idea is to have two separate machines (physical or virtual) for incoming and internal/outgoing SMTP traffic.
The reject_non_fqdn_hostname option catches a lot of servers, but your mileage may very depending who you receive mail from.
My first line of defense is my firewall, and I put it to good use since it provides the highest ROI and is exceedingly simple to implement.
This way if a mail server is unknown to your SMTP, it will have to wait a couple of minutes before trying to deliver a message again, thus relieving your spam filter and greatly reducing UBE.
Since I do not wish to make my network accessible to the entire world, I unapologetically block most of it (your mileage may vary, obviously).
Use SPF, SpamAssassin, Razor, Pyzor, DCC, Graylist and use a setup like the other answer example:
Next, replace Sendmail with Postfix -- yet another high-ROI modification.
I can count on one hand the number of daily UCE attempts to my mail server, and, along with some of cop1152's suggestions  (to which I would add no domain catch-alls), I average less than one successful delivery per month.
Using greylisting (for example postgrey) can be an excellent idea, if you don't want to use SpamAssassin.
Check out http://www.gabacho-net.jp/en/anti-spam/anti-spam-system.html - its a set of regex block rules for Postfix that block a high-amount of dynamic IP addresses without catching too many legit servers.
I also run postgrey (http://postgrey.schweikert.ch/) which helps catch what the regex doesn't.
Just put it high on smtpd_recipient_restrictions list, like that:
Finally, I used Jim Seymore's Postfix Anti-UCE Cheatsheet (minus some RBL and other external UCE list sites) to choose what would work best for me.
And remember to change default delay time from 300 to something higher, preferably random (but not higher than 1200-1500).
I also suggest acquiring good blacklist of popular spammer CIDR classes, filter out incoming server SMTP traffic (not client) from ppp or dynamic domains.
