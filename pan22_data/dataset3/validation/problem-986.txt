Instead of one Chrome file in task manager it had upwards of five or six Chrome programs running at once even though I only had a single tab open on a single window.
When I opened Chrome, I noticed another strange thing.
I read a couple other questions and tried to open the command prompt to see if I could shut things down that way but the window opens for about a second than disappears.
I'm having to restart my computer multiple times a day just to be able to get work done!
I reinstalled Firefox and didn't have any issues for the evening but now this morning it's started up again.
I opened up task manager to try and shut it down manually but even after I hit end task several times it wouldn't work.
I don't know why you can't force-quit Skype or FF.

Last week I noticed this happening for the first time.
I restarted the computer and went about my business without issue for a few days and then last night it started acting up again.
Chrome uses a new process for each tab, so that is why you see it multiple times.
But the reason Chrome has more than one item in that list is it uses separate processes instead of just separate threads, like FF.
The internet was working fine but the browser was stuck.
Separate threads mean that the OS sees it more or less as 1 process, but the process may have concurrent code running that it is managing itself.
So I closed the window and when I tried to open it again I got a notification that it was still running.
I uninstalled Firefox, restarted the computer, and used Chrome to reinstall it.
The Firefox program won't end, now the Skype program won't end either, and Chrome has five files showing up in task manager.
Basically, separate processes means that the OS knows that 2 things are running concurrently, and can help manage it.
