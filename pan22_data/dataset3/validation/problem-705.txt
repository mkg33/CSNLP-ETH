(If You want to execute the file on some machine You can change the execute bit there before execute.)
So two options: automate on server or on client that the bits get set if You really need them on files.
That said, You can of course compile a patched ProFTPD Yourself (which starts persmissions / umask calculation by 7 instead of 6) and set Umask Configuration to 002 for files.
For 2: there are different possibilities, depends on Your exact use case.
It would be possible to allow ftp-users changing file permissions explicitly to have execute bits set after upload.
Alternatively a ProFTPD specific approach to Force a Owner Group would be to set the UserOwner Parameter for the Directories where this shall apply (http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_UserOwner.html).
A generic solution that should work also with ProFTPD is to make a group www-data the owning group of the parent directory and set the directories Set-GID bit.
This would cause all uploaded content (including created diretories) into that directory to have owner group www-data, with the directory Umask setting new directories to be group-writable.
I would like that the new uploaded files via FTP has 2 features:
I have activated an FTP server with ProFTPD on Debian Server 8.11.
For 1: It is for security reasons not permitted to allow default execute-bits on files, and they are also not really needed.
Maybe You should elaborate first on why You want them 775 or such by default, then You could get an answer.
