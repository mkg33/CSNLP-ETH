While I did not go through with it, this way of copying the vmdk seems to yield the same results as diskCreate.
The diskCreate tool can be used to clone an existing vmdk file (including vmdk files that refer to an actual drive or partition) onto a new one.
VMWare Fusion is accompanied by a bunch of CLI utilities in its Contents/MacOS folder.
I didn't use Boot Camp, but rather installed to a raw partition and used reFIT to boot.
However, there's no explicit mention of Windows 7 in the list of supported operating systems.

The only problem here is that I don't know how to turn a physical partition into a VMDK file.
If you create a VM without using an install disk, you have the option to choose an existing vmdk file, and the option to copy it.
When creating the new VM though, I realized that there is a graphical user interface to do the same thing.
I stumbled upon Live View, which can turn a raw image (dd style) into a VMDK.
In order to pull the data off the partition I used the command line:
/Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmware-vdiskmanager -r path/to/rawdisk-file.vmdk -t 0 path/to/virtualdisk-file.vmdk
There's enough room left on my drive for this, even without the slightest compression, I just don't know how.
Just so you know, the process took about an hour and a half (for a 120 GB partition with about 80 GB of actual data) during which the disk IO was (obviously) saturated, resulting in a significant slowdown of my system.
I'm looking for a clever way to upgrade to Windows 64 bits on my MacBook Pro's Boot Camp partition.
This is the plan I have established (considering you can't just upgrade Win32 to Win64):
("Boot Camp.vmdk" being located in ~/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/Virtual Machines/Boot Camp/Boot Camp.vmwarevm/)
I actually found an easier command-line way, and then it made me realize there is an easy GUI way.
(There's no Mac OS version of it, but since it's Java, I assume I'll be able to run it anyways.)
I was able to clone my Boot Camp partition into an usable vmdk file.
Note: The time it takes for the import process to complete depends on the size of your Boot Camp partition.
If you go in to Windows, you can use the free VMWare Converter utility.
Unmounting my Boot Camp partition (through the Disk Utility) and using this command:
I have no experience with VMWare fusion, but I do use a lot of the time with VMWare Workstation and it works well, so I am guessing it should work the same for fusion!
