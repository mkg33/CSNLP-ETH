For the user you could either edit their password policy through the Computer Management interface if it's local or through the Users and Computers interface if it's a domain account.
I set up a user on our staging server for the reporting services to use for its required tasks.
I updated the password but this seemed to make no difference.
It is created locally on any machine that has Reporting Services installed on it.
I am happy to hear about anything else that may cause this.)
Because of 2 when I tried to restart the service it failed.
However then it can't access the database, I would rather the Reporting Services Account had permission to start the service, how do I grant it that privilege?
Because of 1, when the password expired all reports defaulted back to trying to use my dev Data Source instead of the Data Source I had configured on the server.
(I am assuming that it was the password expiry that triggered this permissions fault, and that it is a permissions fault, the behaviour is that the reports no longer seem able to see shared data sources anyway.
That should give them access to be the logon account for Reporting Services.
So to get it running at all I had to change the service account to a built in one.
