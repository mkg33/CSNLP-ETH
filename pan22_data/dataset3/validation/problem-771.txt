(gMSA accounts are being used so I assume no SPN registration is required)
Would Active Directory know that the exchange server in question is a week old and populate all changes such as send and receive connectors, newly accepted receive domains, additionally created user mailboxes to the restored Exchange Server, time and date difference?
Provoking a recovery scenario where the exchange server has completely failed (let's say by deleting the VM).
Also, with SQL, would the correct procedure be to restore the SQL server in question and simply detach existing database and attach the most recently backed up ones?
Without questioning the latent weekly backup (this is a learning curve) would the recovery situation be as simple as firing up the most recent backup, kicking off a restore job and simply starting Exchange Server (or even restoring the VHDx file to an alternate location and recreating the VM + necessary settings)?
Virtualised: DC, Exchange 2013 and SQL 2016 (2012R2).
The Full VSS backup includes BMR, SS, all VM's and the relevant files and folders once weekly.
In short, we currently backup the entire environment using WSB at the host level.
This is a lab environment so numerous options are welcomed.
