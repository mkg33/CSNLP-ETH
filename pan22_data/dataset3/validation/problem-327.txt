figure out how to dump the parts of the database you want into a flat file (mysqldump or mysql-hotcopy may be of help here)
For the database, you could call mysqldump via PHP to copy the dev database to live (automatically backing up the previous live of course).
This means to installing new plugins, changing the content, testing updates of wordpress to see if they work with the theme, etc.
Then you've got all the pieces and can pull data from the db and check it into svn or push data from svn back into the db if/when you want to restore.
I want to setup a website using wordpress, which we can modified locally and then via subversion commit the site and make it public.
The script performs an SVN update to update all the sources in the test environment (and then Selenium runs a number of predefined integration tests -- but you probably don't care about that).
I've read this article in codex, however I'm not sure how this is done when, we want to include the content and changes on the options of worpdress and plugins (which is in the mysql).
We have a PHP script on the server that listens for the remote call from a post-commit hook.
The idea is to control the development on the site, in case we need to keep track of the dev or roll back, because of unexpected bugs in a the plugins, theme, etc.
automate doing so with a script (which you also put in version control)
We do something similar with an automated Selenium-based integration testing system.
