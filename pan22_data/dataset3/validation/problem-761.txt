Also a win7 install takes about 20-30mins on a good computer.
The remedy is simply replacing a system file located in the C:\Windows\System32 and \SystemWOW64 folders; this file being named "ExplorerFrame.DLL."
Heck it only took an hour when I installed it on a p4.
Hard drive sectors go bad and you lose important system files.
At the time this page helped me fix it: http://www.dougknox.com/xp/file_assoc.htm
Replacing the Explorerframe.DLL file not only fixed my navigation pane, but additionally, ceased the appearance of the earlier mentioned error messages.
Once this happened to me in Vista, and the problem was that Windows lost the EXE file association, i.e.
Before applying the fix, be sure do to a full registry backup, at least for HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.
It's made for Windows XP 32, and it worked for me on Vista 32, and I believe it also does on Windows 7 x64.
:) If you are a good computer user, everything important is already backed up.
The only problem is that this specific DLL file is quite hard to find on the internet.
I was also getting the "Class Not Registered" errors in some applications, but this wasn't as big a deal.
Apparently it also controls how applications get to open explorer, and if at all.
If you have a backup of these files, then pull the Explorerframe.DLL file from there, or, if you feel like customizing your GUI a bit, then download a custom one from a site such as DeviantART.
I know it sucks but honestly it is probably the most stable solution.
It can be associated with other problems as well, such as the explorer navigation pane becoming non-operational, or other GUI elements becoming screwed up.
I am on a Windows 7 x64 right now and checked some of they keys in the .reg file and it seems to have the same keys/values.
This file is, in essence, the parts of the explorer GUI that a simple personalization theme CANNOT change- the forward and back buttons, the sidebar, etc.
A Couple weeks ago I finally decided to fix a problem that i mentioned earlier; my navigation pane was non operational, making some applications completely useless.
