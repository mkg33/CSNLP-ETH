I'm not too familiar with Windows' DHCP server so I don't know if it will do what you want it to do - multiple subnets on a single network segment.
One problem with doing this is that all your traffic from your LAN to the server will have to pass through the router, which will most probably not be able to route at gigabit speeds, and even if it can, there'll still be a slowdown.
But you'd have to have some way to configure the DHCP server to provide different subnets depending on the MAC address of the computer requesting an IP.
I would personally not implement something like this, because it would make your network more complex - not less.
I would either use multiple VLANs or I'd just stick everything on the same subnet.
While this is possible, this will require you to define an "ip alias" or a "subinterface" (depending on the exact terminology used by your exact brand of router - I am not familiar with it) basically assigning multiple IP addresses on the same physical interface.
I assume you want to add multiple subnets on the same physical segment?
There is not really any security benefit, either, an attacker could just as well just create an IP alias on your workstations to access your server LAN directly.
