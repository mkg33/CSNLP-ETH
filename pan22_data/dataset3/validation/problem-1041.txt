so when you paste-special as values your destination sheet is already formatted and you don't need to copy across the formatting.
This approach strips away not only the formulas, but also cell formatting (and there is quite a bit of formatting).
Those formulas will break when opened on another computer that doesn't have master spreadsheet.
Doesn't touch the formatting.You might leave the master alone, make a copy of the updated summary, convert formulas to values, and then distribute that page.
I've found the easiest way is to do a normal paste followed by a Paste Special -> Values in succession.
The goal is for the person doing data entry to keep this "master spreadsheet"... and distribute copies of only the summary tab.
I just want a visually-pleasing snapshot of that summary tab for distributing to other people.
I have an Excel spreadsheet with multiple worksheet tabs for collecting data... and a final tab with a lot of formulas, to summarize the other tabs for a given date range.
Alternatively, once you've done Paste Special -> Values, do Paste Special -> Formats immediately.
Is there any way to copy over cell values AND cell formatting from one worksheet tab to a separate spreadsheet file?
Can you not make a template of the destination "summary" sheet and format it the same as the sheets you're taking the data from?
On the other hand, using "Edit->Paste Special" and selecting only "Values" has problems too.
You can't simply cut-n-paste the cells from that tab into a separate spreadsheet (or use "Edit->Move or Copy Sheet")... because that will copy over all the formulas.
You can do lots of things with it--and one of the things is to CONVERT ALL FORMULAS TO THEIR VALUES which I find very useful.
The destination range should be the data you've just copied over, so as long as you don't move or hit escape (to clear the copied information) you should be fine.
I use the keyboard shortcuts so it is a very quick process.
