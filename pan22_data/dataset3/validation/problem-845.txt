If I was to take your code then multiply it out 100 or a thousand times into other files (the size of a regular commercial/enterprise application then it would be a dog's breakfast and not maintainable at all.
Think of it as formatting your resume for a potential employer.
You need to take more care with your code and make it readable and consistent.
If they're scanning through the code then suddenly there's a random comment floating in the page it's a real distraction.
A good book to read is Clean Code by Robert Martin.
Run your code through pep8 and possibly a more pedantic static analyzer like pylint.
They will likely complain there are too many variables, branches, etc.
Use consistent whitespace between characters, consistent comments above the code (not multiple line breaks between) and above all adopt one of the common style guides for the language.
You must read this as if your life depended on it.
because the code is not broken up into modularized functions.
If you're coding in a professional environment, other people have to read the code you wrote as well and they need to understand it quickly.
You will find these tools don't like some of your formatting and variable names.
This shows you can at least write code that reads and presents well.
