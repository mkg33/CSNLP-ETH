It is difficult to completely understand your network environment because lack of answers to my questions (where is the switch connected, what has 192.168.1.1).
If you use a static ip address from this address block you violate specification.
You have to ensure that only one DHCP server is running on your broadcast domain (subnet without router connection).
The pool on your DHCP server is set from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254 (I guess because you write IP range is 192.168.2 - 254).
When using a static ip address and a DHCP server is also running on the network you should ensure that the ip address is outside the range that the DHCP server will give to devices.
If the interface does not have a static ip address and if it does not find a DHCP server on the subnet it is connected to then the avahi daemon will give it an ip address from the reserved ip address block 169.254.0.0/16 (Link-local addresses).
More detailed answers to this feature you will find at Does dhcpcd prevent a remote DHCP server serving an IP address that is declared static?.
You should set it for example from 192.168.1.128 to 192.168.1.253 (192.168.1.254 is used for the wifi router itself).
If a device has DHCP lookup enabled and it does not have an ip address it will broadcast into the subnet it is connected to and request for an address.
Otherwise each DHCP server will response to a request from a device with a different ip address from its different pool.
There are mainly three ways to give an interface an ip address in this priority:
So I can only give general information about how DHCP is working but it may help you to find what's going wrong with your setup.
The DHCP server may check this conflict by pinging the address and avoid to give the same ip address from its pool to another device.
avahi will also give a DNS name to the ip address from the also reserved DNS domain .local, for example raspberrypi.local.
But this only works if the conflicting device is just online.
You are always on the save side if you use a static ip address outside the pool from the DHCP server.
avahi ensures that the ip address it gives to the interface will be unique on the broadcast domain.
Link-local addresses work ad hoc on (small) networks without a DHCP server.
