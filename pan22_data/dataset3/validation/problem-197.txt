- which does not have any conversation about what to do in that situation.
I want to replace the individual VPNs with a persistent site-to-site VPN between the two firewalls/routers, and set up domain replication between the two servers.
My goal is to have a single forest with a single domain with two sites, connected via the site-to-site VPN.
We have two offices of similar size, with a single server at each.
Office #2 running Windows Server 2016 Essentials with roles:
I've only found this thread: Active Directory - forest trust between forests with same name?
Any thoughts or direction on this will be greatly appreciated!
Ideally I would change the domain name to "corp.company.com" from "company.local" as well, but I think that will be even harder.
Office #1 running Windows Server 2016 Standard with roles:
Here's where I am at a loss: both servers are Forest Root Domains with the same name "company.local".
Currently users at office #2 manually VPN directly to Office #1 to access resources.
Both Active Directories have separate users/groups set up - users have the same domain\login\password on both.
