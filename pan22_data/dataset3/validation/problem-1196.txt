The server has a serveraid support CD for configuring the raid controller, but not any specific diagnostics software.
I'm only familiar with the Unix world tools, you can use sgtools and mostly sg_logs to peek at the disk status.
Beyond that you'll need to have better understanding of disks to make a decision.
If that page shows asc/ascq of 0x0 than the disks don't think they are dead.
Can I run diagnostics for the drives from Windows Server 2008 which is installed on one of the servers?
The server I have access to is an IBM with ServeRAID 7k controller.
Some have red stickers presumably indicating they are faulty.
You can see different pages where the most important is page 0x2f which shows "Informational Exceptions", esssentially SMART.
How do I test them to ensure they are working correctly?
The other tool to use is sg_senddiag which can utilize SEND DIAGNOSTICS commands to tell the drive to test itself and then to monitor the test state with sg_logs again (forgot the page number for test results, use page 0 to find the page number).
