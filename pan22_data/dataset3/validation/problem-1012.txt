The admin tool is webbased and works like a charm.
Virtualbox, VMWare Workstation/Player/Server, QEMU, User-mode-linux etc fall into one category of VM - they're hosted within an existing OS, such as windows or linux.
If you actually want a dedicated server environment for production systems, then you should be looking at the second category of systems, as they offer more advanced features which you may want down the line (server pooling, shared storage, live migration, high availability)
Xen, KVM, VMWare ESX, fall into a different category - they're hypervisor based virtualisation stacks.
(No, I don't have any affiliation with VMware, I'm just a very happy user)
Stuff can get mangled if you boot the same partition from a virtual machine again.
(it's basicly a Linux with the VMware virtualization technology)
We use it at work and it does the job really well.
Then you can connect to the machines over the network using XenCenter admin console, which is very similar to VMWare one.
It installs as the OS on the host computer with only 32 MB ram overhead.
You can generally mount any kind of file-based VM image using Linux's loopback device should you need to do so.
Try out their ESX solution, it's free and incredibly powerful.
The only requirement from your list it doesn't fulfill is that you need a separate machine as a VM server.
You can also use their 'Infrastructure client' on windows.
They still have an OS that gets booted first, but they operate at a fundamentally different layer.
The console is available for Windows, don't know about linux as I use Windows as a client.
You can simply move running OS's to the VMware ESX, or import them from a drive.
Word of caution: Watch out with booting from a real partition.
I believe it has all the features you mentioned although I've never used the feature to use an actual disk and am not sure about scripting guest creation.
Since it's completely free, it's very much worth trying.
I use virtualization myself and I can very much recommend VMware server.
As to which one suits you best, it depends on what want to do with them.
Sounds crazy, I know, but I've seen people try this and it almost always wrecks the OS.
If you want to run VMs on your workstation, for development or testing purposes, then one of the hosted platforms (Virtualbox, VMWare Workstation etc), is ideal.
I've used it both on my laptop (linux) and my desktop(Windows XP) for development purposes (testing software across multiple OS's) and am using it to run my webserver for my hosted sites as well.
I use VMWare Server and have since it was released.
