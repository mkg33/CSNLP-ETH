The IPsec interface is the destination interface for the outbound policy and the source interface for the inbound policy.
[VPN Name] properties / Networking / IPv4 settings / Advanced
Have you checked that windows is using the Remote Gateway for all non-local traffic
I would be grateful for any help with this issue, thanks.
A route-based VPN requires an Accept security policy for each direction.
But VPN works fine and I can access local network resources.
As source and destination interfaces, you specify the interface to the private network and the virtual IPsec interface (Phase 1 configuration) of the VPN.
One security policy must be configured for each direction of each VPN interface.
Everything works fine, but the problem that when I am connected to the VPN from Windows 10 client I have external IP of the network where I connected from to VPN.
I have just set up VPN server using IKEv2 at home.
In network and sharing center (or whatever its now called), in the display in
From windows client I check my IP while being connected to the VPN, for example using online service https://www.whatismyip.com/ and it displays 46.42.24.33 instead of my home server.
I have no idea where is the problem, maybe some changes to iptables should be made ?
The most interesting thing is that from MacOS and Android the Home server IP is displayed.
