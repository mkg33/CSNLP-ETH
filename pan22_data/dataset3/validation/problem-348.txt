I tried playing around with the quality settings (Edit > Project Settings > Quality) and switched between them.
http://docs.unity3d.com/462/Documentation/Manual/HOWTO-alphamaps.html
they will have identical object position and seam position rounding errors sent to the graphics card.
I had the same problem with a very simple labyrinth I made.
If you put all your cubes on 0,0,0 and instead change their vertex positions to the positions you want, and send them all to the graphics card, they will not contain seams.
The main difference between Beautiful and the next best setting ("Good") was the fact that anti-aliasing (2x MSAA) was on.
I had the same problem and it was resolved by making sure Unity treat the alpha as transparency.
Turning it off for every quality setting solved the problem.
the further you go from origin, the bigger the rounding error will be.
AFAIK i solved the issue after some time and puzzling, perhaps waster 50 hours to solve it, becaues i was told that my problem was inside the game engine not the graphics card.
Click on the actual texture, in the inspector, the texture type was "default" so I had to manually check "Alpha is Transparency".
If you send mesh objects with different positions to the graphics card, unity's precision is not high enough and the actual vertex positions in the graphics cards, the seams, will not be the same.
Its a weird error inside Unity that no one else than me knows about because i am a lame coder who never managed to code a game but i am basically a genious:) mark me down.
I read that Valve's AA (used in The Lab) is supposedly very good for VR.
So... keep all cubes on zero zero zero, edit their vertex positions, rewrite all the vertices to the new positions you want the cubes to be in, otherwise the seam positions in the graphics card differ microscopically.
I plan on trying out another AA solution than Unity's.
Note: yes, in my labyrinth everything is vertex-snapped.
I noticed that the seams were present exclusively when it was set to either "Beautiful" or "Fantastic".
hence you will see seams inside the graphics card.
