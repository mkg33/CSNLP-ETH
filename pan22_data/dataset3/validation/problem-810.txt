Be aware that Windows is using dynamic port allocation for some services e.g.
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="Remote Volume Management" new enable=yes
In Brazilian Portuguese, the group name is "Gerenciamento de Volumes Remoto".
Enabling "Remote Volume Management" needs to be done on both machines... the Core Hyper V Server and the client machine:
You need to change the Firewall rules on both machines (NOT only the Hyper-V Server)
Servers are in the same AD domain and MMC console is enabled on Hyper-V.
On the client machine (Windows 7 and Windows 8 ... XP is no longer supported... lol ;), "netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="Remote Volume Management" new enable=yes" will run smoothly.
does someone faced error "The RPC server is unavailable" during connecting to Disk management MMC console to Hyper-V Server R2?
For errors "RPC Server is unavailable" when trying to use Disk Management MMC or Server Manager MMC or Computer Management MMC to connect to a Windows Hyper-V (Hyper V) Core Server, please note the following:
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929851?wa=wsignin1.0 Meaning Microsoft finally uses one of these ports 49152 - 65535.
I was able to enable "Remote Volume Management" by using the GUI tool "Corefig for Windows Server 2012 Core and Hyper-V Server 2012"... *downloadable from http://corefig.codeplex.com/releases.
On the Windows Hyper-V  (hyper V) Core Server (in my case I am on Server 2012 R2), I was not eble to run the netsh command.
