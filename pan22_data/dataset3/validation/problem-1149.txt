Spend the extra few hundred dollars and get a hardware RAID controller.
I plan on creating a Windows software RAID 5 array but need to know when a drive goes bum.
Here's a simple batch file which can be setup via task scheduler, it will create an event in the system log with the failed array info; needs to be run elevated:

SW RAID on Windows is poo, and you can get a new RAID controller for a few hundred dollars and the same part or its immediate predecessor off ebay for maybe $100-200.

I don't plan on wanting to check the server every so often, so how can I have an email sent when a drive goes kapÃ¼t or otherwise has problems?
In addition, the controllers will do hot spares properly, run RAID 5/50 fairly quickly and offer a much wider feature set than the SW RAID functionality available on Windows.
Do your homework and find one that will do what you want.
FINDSTR "Failed" C:\RAID_STATUS.TXT > C:\FAILED_RAID.TXT
ship a RAID management tool with the controller and these often have some sort of notification facility.
Keying off the event log would be OK, but how does one set up notifications on it when the exact event ID(s) may not be known?
