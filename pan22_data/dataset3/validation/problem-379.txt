Not every person that works in computing does so as a programmer, for example.
Solve ANY problem you know how to solve and post it to codereview here on stackexchange, say its prep work for a interview.
You can't go back and undo the mistakes you made getting to where you are.
Meet another person at least every second day, minimum!
You aren't going to become a good programmer in a week.
You will get ahead more where you have talent, but don't forget the basics.
Read the top 100 questions and answers on stackoverflow in programing and top 100 for c++.
This is things that are interesting or many have struggled with.
Spend the remaining time on what motivates  you about work/career at the time.
I think you are probably asking the wrong question.
But if you figure out your strengths and write applications that emphasize them and stress them in interviews you may be fine.
My advice is to figure out what you are good at, not what you are bad at.
If you have soft skills and can be social with both nerds and "normals" there is lots of places that needs (even if they don't know it) bridging between the two.
In a week you can be better prepared than some interviewers.
Spend about two hours reading soft material, two hours coding and two hours learning hard stuff.
But not every position where programing is wanted need to excel at coding.
Just don't suggest you are a programmer, nor stress that you are bad at it.
Often enough the question is more important than any answer.
I once told a student who was struggling in a hard course that she would probably wind up as the manager of all the superstar programmers in the class.
Look in to the programs they may ask you to write AT the interview, and what they would be looking for in a answer.
Read up on all the bad things that happen during interviews and make sure you are aware of the pitfalls.
Not failing a interview is all you need to get a job if you have the qualifications.
I did not understand how anyone could make anything.
Fix all the problems pointed out and post it again.
Don't think you have wasted time, life is just starting and you are educated in a field with a massive demand.
Turns out pointer arithmetics is really hard and unintuitive.
I struggled with c++ so bad I thought programing was not for me.
Get accustomed to the kinds of interviews and questions they ask.
