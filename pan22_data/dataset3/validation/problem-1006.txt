In the Display section click "Change Screen Saver".
This is the way I get rid of that awful screensaver:
Go to Control panel > Programs > Programs and Features.
Run it, click on "restore", exit out and VOILA You can run your screen savers again, just no background images.
1.Open Screen Saver Settings by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, clicking Personalization, and then clicking Screen Saver.
But if you upgrade, you wouldn't have the need for a wallpaper changing program.
Windows 7 opens the correct screen for you where you can change the settings :)
2.To turn off all screen savers, under Screen Saver, click (None) in the drop-down list, and then click OK.
Open the Control Panel by clicking on the Start button and selecting Control Panel.
Click the start button and just type screensaver in the searchbar and press enter.
If you upgrade, this problem could probably follow you as well.
To turn on a screen saver, click a screen saver in the drop-down list, and then click OK.
Do you have the wallpaper changer program installed that is linked on this site?
This is a little different on Windows 7 Starter Edition.
Hope this helps everyone experiencing this problem.
