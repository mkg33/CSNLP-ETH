After you logout/login, you will need to issue ssh-add to ask gpg-agent to handle your SSH key.
This is needed only the first time you use gpg-agent, not after each login.
Add these modules to the respective sections of your PAM configuration in /etc/pam.d/system-login (or, for GDM, gdm-password).
And I'd rather ssh remembered on subsequent accesses.
Is there some feature in either of those tools or some other tool that would remember the ssh passphrase, but maybe grab it when I type it in for ssh instead of when the session opens?
Here's what I used to solve this problem for ssh shells.
ssh-agent/keychain seem to just about fit the bill, except they bother me for the passphrase when I log in (when I might not be sure I need to use my ssh keys), not when I'm trying to use ssh.
If you run ssh-agent without providing it with a key, you can later run ssh-add the first time you need the key.
This should be enough if you use GNOME (which starts the keyring daemon from XDG Autostart).
I somehow got this working on a Fedora 16 box a while ago, but can't remember what I did.
I alias the ssh command to first check if the keys have been loaded and if not, load them first, then perform the ssh command:
I put that in my .alias and source it from .bashrc
This is the default behavior of GNOME Keyring's internal SSH agent.
It can handle SSH keys in addition to PGP keys, asks for your passphrase once only when you need it and uses pinentry for the input.
If you're using any other environment, add this to your .xinitrc (for startx) or .xprofile (for gdm/lxdm/kdm):
