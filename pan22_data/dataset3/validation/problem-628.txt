I have a Broadcom BCM5352 router running DD-WRT firmware and four external IPs.
I run DD-WRT on my router and have an ISP that assigns 5 DHCP IPs.
It is possible to do with pf, where the feature is called bidirectional nat mapping (1:1 mapping).
I have my internet connection go directly into a switch that then plugs into my servers and into my DD-WRT router.
( In this case the server would be doing what you stated you wanted the router to do )
However I can still talk to my servers at the full 100Mbps (The speed of my switch) vs the speed of my internet connection.
Another option is to just hook your server into your Router and make it a DMZ server, this would have a similar effect but your router and server would share an IP.
The firmware supports iptables, so if it can be done with iptables, then that is a solution.
I'm 99% sure the only way to get that is with static IPs, I've never heard of an ISP giving two IPs via DHCP.
Each device gets its own DHCP IP as if it was on its own network connection.
Yes, it is possible to do with iptables, however you need to have two IPs assigned to you from your ISP.
A server is connected to the switch, and if possible, I would like to give that server a different external ip (that is, tell the router to route all traffic to the specified external ip to the server and vice versa).
A fourth and much more complicated way of doing this would be to use 2 NICs in your server and have you server add a virtual interface on its outgoing connection and bridge that virtual interface to your router.
In my network config at home I have first a router, and then a switch connected to the router (to avoid multiple cables through the whole appartment.
