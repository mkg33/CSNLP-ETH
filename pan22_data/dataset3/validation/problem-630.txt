When you put the Day Count field in the Values area of the pivot table you can change it from summing the value to only including the maximum value.
Am I misinterpreting the results or is this a possible bug in Excel?
To do this, right-click on cell E2 (in your pivot table) and choose Summarize Values By and select Max
I see that 4 is the sum of all day count's  for day A and 6 is the sum of all day count's for day B.
I calculated it with the following array formula in A2: =SUM(1/COUNTIF($A$2:A2;$A$2:A2)) (Ctrl+Shift+Enter for the array formula) and pasted it down the table.
I calculated =MAX('Day Count') as calculated field (see screenshot), but instead of 1 (for day A) and 2 (for day B) I got 4 and 6.
So I added another test: I created a calculated field that returns 1 (=1).
After some experimenting, I ended up adding a column to my source table (Day Count in my example) that counts the unique values of Day.
Now I would expect that this would then return 4 and 3, but it returns 1 and 1.
I added the index (not shown in the picture, but I took the Maximum value of Day Count, which resulted in and index).
But that's unexpected and possibly an bug in Excel, right?
My question is how to explain the observed behavior.
I wanted to use the Day Count in a calculated field, but that gave some strange results.
I wanted to add an index number (1, 2, 3, ...) to the rows of my pivot table.
I think somehow the array formula is expanded during the calculation of the Pivot table.
