OMA is only a browser based "view" of the mailbox and is not a connection method.
Is there some special trick to getting the iPad to connect to Exchange?
As this is only a single user I would normally be inclined to tell her to just settle for IMAP.
Unfortunately, I have been informed that the company owner and managing director both intend to get iPads, so this will become a BIG problem very soon.
We have Exchange 2003 and both OWA and OMA working over HTTPS.
As Sam has stated, you should be looking into configuring RPC over HTTP on the Exchange server so that you can utilize ActiveSync.
We have a user with an iPad that we're trying to get connected to Exchange.
I don't have a device to test OMA with but at least I can access it with a browser, even though I get a message saying that it's an unsupported device.
I've followed a bunch of articles found on the Internet but am getting nowhere.
Although there's no problem using IMAP the MAPI connection just will not work.
Perhaps, like Mac Snow Leopard's Mail, it really only works with Exchange 2007 onwards but I've found no mention of that.
