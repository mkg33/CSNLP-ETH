Pay the money, get the dedicated IP or DnS service.
You would have to look up in GoDaddy's help about how to add it, but it's a standard DNS feature that they certainly support.
You don't want domain masking, you want something like a CNAME record.

Either you have been given a dedicated ip from dyndns that will resolve to your router (where you logged in).
I was facing this same issue and, after finding a powershell script that did the update, I decided to create an application to automatically update the IP of the DNS records on GoDaddy, pretty much like what DynDNS does, the difference is that I don't have to pay for another service to do that for me anymore.
I use DynDNS and host 6 web sites at home using their dynamic DNS client.
Check your routers manual on how to use it, by it probably involves going to 192.168.0.1, clicking DNS and entering the details for dyndns.
My suggestion would be to move your name servers to DynDNS, set up your DNS records there, and install one of their dynamic DNS clients somewhere on your local network to keep your dynamic ip address in sync with your DNS records.
Assuming this is a web server at home, I'm 80% sure your router will be capable for dyndns.
It's a Windows application though, hopefully it will suit you as well: https://github.com/leandrokoiti/GoDaddyDnsUpdater
Or you have been given a free sub domain such as myfreeaccount.dyndns.org and you are being a cheap skate.
I wrote a little python script to update the A record.
