If we do a bit of math, this doesn't seem so unreasonable.
It's approximately 44KB - now run it through Photoshop with some optimizations.
You mentioned that the app is less than '40MB in memory' which implies you know the amount of memory its consuming - but I'm going to go ahead and assume you actually meant the package is 40MB.
One other possibility:  The game has network communication access.
I was curious as to how this works, is it each photo being optimized in photoshop (save for web and devices) (png or jpeg) or is it something to do with the code or something else?
350 levels * 4 per level * 50 size of pictures per level = 70000 kilobytes
Without knowing the exact internal workings, I'd take a gander at the fact that a simple JPG of only 200px200px can be quite small - around 30 kilobytes if optimized properly.
Here's the Google Play store page for 4 Pics 1 Word.
The easiest example I can give is an app called '4 pics 1 word' it has over 350 levels and obviously 4 pics on each level and the photos are good quality on retina screens but the memory of the app is less than 40mb, if I have remembered correctly.
50 kilobytes can be quite large however, and it's defintely not a fair representation neccesairly.
It's also possible they share images between levels to save space.
I know this question is quite broad but any answers, help, links to anything would be greatly appreciated.
The entire thing would fit into 8.4MB (350 * 4 * 6 / 1000).
If you mean download size when you say "memory" then the answer is that jpegs at that size can be quite small, especially if you don't use the maximum quality setting.
This is uncompressed which of course when it's shoved into a package will shrunk from all sorts of fancy tricks.
This trick can apply to even higher resolution images as well - the game in particular relies on a lot of photographs which JPGs can compress well as it's lossy and still look great.
There have been a lot of word games (apps) lately and some use graphics but others use photographs and I was hoping that someone could explain how these games manage to get so many photos in an app without taking up huge amounts of memory?
