Besides, pirates are usually the people that buy the most.
It doesn't matter what you think of this practice ethically, but if you release a reasonable gameplay demo that serves this purpose, you will at least cut out one chunk of piracy.
You can't play online without having to re-input your serial codes to make a username & password.
When you buy the game, they give you serial codes (the old school, serial codes).
But here's the gist, it contacts the servers and checks if the serial code has been used yet!
However, then the game won't run without an Internet connection and you have to maintain the server and pay for this bandwidth.
In fact, almost all traditional DRM methods don't work.
The best you could hope for is making it too inconvenient to pirate the game, so it's not worth the trouble.
The best you can do is make your product reasonably priced, don't piss off the consumer, make a good product, and make it accessible (steam, app stores, etc).
For example, have all the maps be stored on a server which you maintain and downloaded when the user runs the game.
In addition, even this can easily be defeated by a determined pirate.
Obviously, only after you input the codes, you can play the game.
This of course can be a slight problem to some players that don't have internet.
Third, remember that SOME people pirate because the company doesn't release a demo, and they're using this as a "try-before-you-buy" approach.
You can make this somewhat more effective by making users sign in with a username and password before the game can download this content.
If AOE III would have used "Part 2" from the beginning of installation, the problem would be solved!
Second, even professional big-budget AAA games get cracked, often within a week or two of release.
Maybe there are a dozen people trying to crack your game, for every one person on your dev team assigned to the task of "copy protection."
which have been very profitable without using any form of DRM.
Now that the hacker cracked the game, they can play it, but only to a certain degree.
If your game is more modest in budget, and you don't expect to make the majority of your sales on release day, it's probably not a good use of your time from a pure cost/benefit analysis.
No playing the game without contacting the servers.
The only people you will be inconveniencing are the people who purchased your product (look at what happened to Spore).
First, another reason why your game WILL be pirated is that pirates' resources are greater than yours.
Sure, you end up with some piracy, but there are plenty of businesses (GoG.com, Wolfire, 2DBoy, etc.)
I recommend implementing AOE III's method of anti-piracy.
For major titles, that may be worth the extra expense: an extra week of sales for a million-plus seller is big money, easy to justify spending a few tens of thousands -- not to keep pirates out for good, but to buy an extra few days of release sales.
People pirate cause its hard or inconvenient to get it legitimately.
The most effective type of DRM is to make sure that at least one part of the game is not actually included with the installer and cannot be duplicated by pirates.
Whatever you do, it will be cracked because your product will be in the hands of the bad guys.
