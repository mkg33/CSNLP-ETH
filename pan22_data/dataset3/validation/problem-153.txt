Is it true that AWS IP's are blacklisted from certain domains?
Your instance may be configured with a security policy restring egress traffic for instance...
When I run this command on my Ubuntu 16.04 EC2 Instance:
One of several old jobs I've been involved with was involved with web scraping, and you get to know several degrees of scraping tolerance when dealing with the different cloud servers providers.
To such sites AWS IP-addresses typically represent users trying to hide their real IP address and/or also those IPâ€™s are never the actual IP address of a human content consumer and therefore blocked.
You might want to game in other cloud providers to your mix and maybe you get a different blend of things.
Sites that offer region locked content will use a number of techniques to ensure such policies and a common one is use the source (IPv4) IP-address as a discriminator.
However, on my local machine, it returns the expected HTML.
There (I mean at this shop), AWS was not only famous from old blacklisting experiences, but also as one of cloud servers providers which would be most wary of the facts hinting that their servers might being used for web scraping.
I would think of this thing as that from each vendor's control panel it sort of shines as a pretty obvious thing, and so somehow becomes a matter of company strategy.
That might not be the root of your problem though.
All of this notwithstanding the fact any domain owner has the right to ban whatever address ranges they want.
