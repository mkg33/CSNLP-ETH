You may find it beneficial to span the internet side and the server side into separate nics since you have two to play with.
Internet -> L3 switch -> L1 switch -> monitor -> L1 switch -> Server
Then set the internet & server ports up as port monitor sources, and the monitoring server port(s) up as a port monitor destination.
You can use a commercially available network tap (active or passive) or you can "build" your own by inserting a switch that supports port mirroring (SPAN in Cisco parlance) between the devices and configuring the port monitor accordingly, with your monitoring station connected to this switch (this isn't a true network tap but it will accomplish the task).
I am looking for something that will allow me to take a computer with 2 NICs, and drop it in between a link of 2 things (router, server, computer, etc) and monitor all the network traffic, bandwidth, etc.
I ask because I am trying to diagnose certain problems on our network here at work.
If you have a managed switch you should look into port mirroring/monitoring on your switch and set your network up like this

Using a hub would be the least preferred method but in a pinch I've used one in this manner.
You could also insert a hub between the devices but you'll either cause the devices connected to the hub to communicate at half-duplex or you'll cause collisions between the two devices.
