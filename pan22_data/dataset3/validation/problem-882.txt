Then boot to the root shell, remount as r/w, and change password.
Same way you open up any machine that you have direct access to.
The following works for pretty much all Linux distro's:
Have Oralce VM VirtualBox and FedoraClient21 64bit is installed in the VM.
I had the same problem on my Fedora VM, rebooting in rescue mode didn't detect my root volume.
Both all start up and leaving me at "localhost login".
The great thing about it, it also support other linux distribution.
Is there a way to reset the root or local login password before it reaches to the localhost login?
As soon as I start up Fedora, I see two options of FedoraClient and Rescue.
you can use fdisk to look for the the root volume manually or like I did, I tried AutoRoot, it worked perfectly for me.

In latest CentOS or Fedora versions, there are some small changes in resetting the root password:
Press esc / shift (depending on grub version) to get the menu on boot, then e to edit the boot command, add init=/bin/bash at the end of the "linux ...." kernel commandline.
