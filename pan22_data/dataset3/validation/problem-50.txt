But some decreases the number of cleaning left, even it doesn't use it.
A cleaning tape with an number of cleaning left null is ejected immediately.
With LTO drive, when you put the cleaning tape in a drive which doesn't need it, the drive ejects the tape immediately.
As others have stated, just put the cleaning tape in and wait until it ejects.
If this is for cleaning the tape drive, then you just need to put a cleaning tape in the drive, and it will automatically start a cleaning cycle.
So you may have some cleaning tape unusable, even if no drive ever load the tape.
You put the cleaning tape in the drive, the drive clean itself, then eject the cleaning tape... job done.
If I'd walked into this situation, I'd check at least a couple of tapes (depends on the backup schedule) and make sure I couple restore everything, and then test restoring something off of all the other active tapes.
If you haven't cleaned the drive for 5 years, you really, really need to check your backups and make sure they're readable.
You just put the tape in until it either finishes or ejects.
LTO recommendation are not the preventive cleaning that was needed with older drive like DLT.
The drive will eject the cleaning tape once it's done a cleaning cycle.
