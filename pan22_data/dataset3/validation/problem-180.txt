In bacula, there is the option restoreclient to declare the client to put the saved files :
For this I have set up a separate host called backupvalidator.
By default, if you have only the option client declared in your job, it will define the source and the destination of the restore job.

What I can't figure out, is, how I can specify this job in a config file.
But I can't find an option, with which I can specify from which client to which client I want to restore.
I'm taking backups with Bareos and would like to verify my database backup every once in a while.
I know how I can restore the files to this host via bconsole commands, where I list the jobs that were running lately, pick the right job and specify the file path and which files to restore.
From the manual, section 9.2, on (Job) Type=Restore:
Job type "Restore" is not intended for actual job definitions, but as a template for running restore in the console.
If you want to plan a restoration, you can add the option schedule in your job declaration.
It seems like I can only specify in the job, that the files are restored on the same client, the backup was taken from.
Is my only option to have a cronjob, that copies the backup files to my backupvalidator host?
