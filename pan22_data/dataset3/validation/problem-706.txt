This is side by side with Table 1, the final outcome table.
To do this I created another table in column F,G,H.
Then I have the transaction table which shows date and the menu sold.
I have added one more ingredient say D in this example.
I leave the date blank, assuming they are all the same for now.
Now in D3 put the following formula and drag it across the rows and columns of this table.
Here is what I did to find amount of ingredient A.
If you want for B, you will have to create another table.
It looks like the table that you have created will give you outcome for A.
Drag it down along the column and for each Ingredient, you shall get the amounts consumed.
This gives the Quantity of A used in Foo, Bar & Baz in Row 3.
To keep it simple and accommodate in a single screenshot, all tables are in a single sheet.
The first one shows amount of ingredient each menu uses.
Table 3, 4 & 5 are as what you have in your sheet (Table numbers may vary though)
The final table that I want is showing how much ingredient was used each month.
Since J3:J6 are transposed to match the Array in SUMPRODUCT the entire formula needs to be an Array Formula.
Press CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER from within the formula bar to create an Array Formula.
Similarly on the next row 4 it gives Quantity of B used in the same ingredients.
Now to get Amounts used all you need to do is use SUMPRODUCT
Here is the formula I used to count the amount in H column.
From what I best understand your question, I suggest a slightly different approach which requires you to create a single Helper Table with number of columns = number of Menu items.
The Formula shall now be enclosed in Curly Braces to indicate that it's an Array Formula.
If Month is to be added, formula might get more complex.
Note that here Month is not coming into picture as how you have treated it for now in your example..
