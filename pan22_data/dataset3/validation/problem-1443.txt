3) Sometime in the middle of the night switch each source database to single user mode.
Are there any obvious caveats or holes in my plan?
5) Restore transaction log backup to the new instance databases
We set up mirroring a few days prior to the upgrade date from 2005 to 2012.
I would like to move several databases from one Microsoft SQL Server instance (2014) to another instance (2016) while still in production.
Depending on the amount of downtime you have, I would do the following :
This is how I did my 2005 to 2012 upgrade a few years ago.
If you are running Standard i'm 99% sure mirroring is supported and you can do the same with mirroring.
I think the only requirement is that you need to be running either Enterprise or Standard on both ends.
When you do this across different versions you can only fail over once.
If you are running Enterprise Edition then you can simply set up AlwaysOn to the 2016 server and fail over once.
This way you don't have to worry about taking log backups for the most recent data.
1) Take a full back up of each database that I want to move
6) Turn off old instance and point relevant resources at the new instance
