Like this, but the folder name will be like C:/Users/Jen/Dropbox
An alternate solution is running a backup script at a certain time everyday that copies certain files to the Dropbox folder.
If someone gets into their data centre, all your data belongs to them.
You could even go a step further and do some folder management with timestamping and stuff like that.....
I kinda want to write a script that does that now.
The cloud services I've used (granted, only Evernote and Dropbox, which are both rather awesome) transmit data securely, but store it normally.
Windows knows, and does successfully make every program save as expected, in the Dropbox folder.
If they've got someone untrustworthy on their team, they can be poking around in your data looking for interesting bits.
), but if your data is only being transmitted safely, what happens when it's being stored?
This might not seem like an issue (hey, my cloud service communicates via SSL!
What I have set up on other computers is to move the My Documents location to the My Dropbox folder.
PROTIP: Encrypt anything sensitive you store in the cloud before sending it to the cloud.
Dropbox provides an official add-on to do this, called Dropbox Folder Sync.
