We moved an application to a different server and turned off the site in IIS on the old server.
A friend pointed out that if I take the application pool offline on the old server, and leave the websites up, the sites all return 503 error codes, even if you try to access them using the IP addresses, until the DNS has propagated.
I'm migrating several websites to a new server tonight tonight, from IIS 6 (Windows 2003 server) to IIS 7.5 (Windows 2008 Server), with changing IP addresses, and was worried about web crawlers as well.
We would prefer them to get a 503 error so that they will try again later, which will give the DNS more time to propagate.
You could create a "catch-all" page and add the following asp code:
(I know this is a late post, but I spent hours searching for a solution just like this, so I thought I'd add it here.)
that are trying on the old IP address, so they get a 404 error.
Put this in /robots.txt for as long as you don't want your sites crawled by search engine bots:
This is for my particular store (ASPDotNetStorefront), modify as you see fit.
Is there an easy/straightforward way to do this with IIS6?
It looks like there are still web crawlers (Googlebot, Baidu, etc.)
