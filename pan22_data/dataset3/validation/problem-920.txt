You can configure a custom log format for access logging which will include this information.
However, I need the hostname information for httpd.conf's VirtualHost stuff.
The reason is I have some software that auto-generates some traffic going to my webserver, and I need to know the hostname it is using so that I can correctly setup Apache's httpd.conf file's virtual hosts to receive it correctly.
For example, say the webserver is set up to process incoming traffic for an IP address, but there are several host names the webserver can accept, such as:
Can tcpdump be configured to look into the web traffic and extract this hostname?
Adjust your existing logging directives as needed, but you'll want something like this:
That will write the received HTTP Host header into the start of the line - and if it's blank, then the line will instead start with a space.
Is there any way I can view the hostnames used by incoming traffic that is accepted by my apache webserver?
In all the examples I see, including Apache's access_log file, there's only IP address, not hostnames.
I need to see the hostnames that others are using to enter my webserver successfully.
