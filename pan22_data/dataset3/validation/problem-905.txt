That would probably show as lots of system% in top, but anyway, take a look at vmstat 1 and watch the in and cs columns.
There's one possible thing completely left out from the details as I type this.
Perhaps something triggers lots and lots of context switches and/or interrupts?
Use the output of hdparm -t /dev/sd{a,b,c,d,e,f} to diagnose the issue (this command will take a while).
You're actually using both a physical storage controller that exposes your disks to the Linux kernel (whether or not you're using its built-in RAID capabilities) and software RAID.
Assuming you don't have a hardware RAID controller with lots of memory, then deadline's probably the most sensible option, but try CFQ if you've currently got deadline configured.
Double-check that your storage controller is well-supported and try to replace /dev/sda as quickly as possible.
(I don't see anything here that looks like an LVM device) snapshots kill performance on LVM.
Check your irqbalance is running and distributing interrupts sensibly across physical cores (not hyperthreaded ones).
How have you configured the disks (for ide/data what does hdparm tell you - check the accoustic settings, DMA, readahead and cache)?
Looks like you've checked the obvious things - it's a bit of a puzzler.
Since you see some inordinate slowness on /dev/sda, I'd suspect disk failure or controller failure.
You can't rule out the possibility that your storage controller is poorly-supported.
