I strongly disagree with Chris S's claim that all files/directories should be owned by root.
There are many ways that he could have hidden that code and prevented your logs from seeing what he was doing.
This is why Joomla has the ftp layer, to compensate for this.
Once they get in, they try to run a script from /dev/shm/.something or /tmp that connects to their IRC network, or, acts as a takeover bot on undernet or another competing network.
Once you are sure you have a good, importable dump, make a backup of the site.
There is a reason for the Unix permissions system.
If it's a Linux, try to see which processes are running using lsof (lsof -i tcp:80).
As you said, the person/group resposible for hacking your server left a webserver behind, customized to his needs (also called a Shellbot, usually written in Perl/Python).
The other way is to run Apache with PHP running suPHP, which is what CPanel prefers.
You've got a site that you need to stay online, you lack some of the experience with these situations, and, you just want your site to work.
Create a second site and import the dump to verify it.
If you are on a VPS somewhere, perhaps have them hand you a fresh image and reinstall.
Apache runs as a low-privilege account and must be granted access to particular directories/files in order to write to them.
It's a custom webinterface designed to allow custom commands to be given via easy parameters.
One is to run it as the www-data user, and have the files owned by a non-root username.
It's probably been used to start other, more dangerous, commands too.
However, in a shared server environment, the fact that all files need to be world readable makes config files for other sites on that machine easily read.
Take a dump of your database through Joomla's export function, make sure it is a complete dump.
Since you're not well versed in server security, finding well hidden rootkits, etc on the machine would not be a fun task.
Look for files in the /uploads or /images directory named similar to existing files.
In this case, Apache runs as a low privilege user, but, all PHP requests are handed to a script that changes the ownership to the username that owns the files.
This particular hack usually occurs through a compromised FTP account at which point they are able to execute scripts.
While you can now use Unix permissions to prevent other rogue scripts on the machine to browse your directories, any compromised PHP script is able to be run as your username and as a consequence, modify/deface any of the files owned by your username.
You'll likely find one or two scripts running, perhaps a cron entry to restart it, and, other remote shells hidden throughout your Joomla installation.
First, you'd have to know whether the kernel was exploitable (unless you're running a very recent kernel, the answer here is yes), and whether anything had been affected.
Since you found that code, it also suggests that the 'hacker' using it wasn't very sophisticated.
Delete all files, reinstall Joomla, basic installation, use the existing MySQL connection information - it might believe you are upgrading, in which case allow it to upgrade.
In any case, the task you're faced with is somewhat tricky.
They will usually hide their irc bot in multiple places that aren't web accessible so that you won't stumble across them when you log in, but, will have stashed their remote shells in places so that they can get back in and rerun their script and have it reconnect to their network.
