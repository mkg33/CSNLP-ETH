18.5 versus 19.0 should be fine since 11.5 vs 12.0 is fine for a desktop PC (rule is generally 5% variance).
Original charger: 65W, input: 100-240V, 1.6A, 50-60 Hz, output: 18.5V, 3.5A
However I couldn't find an exact matching charger, I bought a different one.
Current (amps) must be equal or higher on the charger, and the closer they match the hotter (generally speaking) and less efficiently the charger will run.
However, even assuming both of those are OK, it's likely that if you run into issues, your laptop's manufacturer won't cover it under any warranty.
Depending on the laptop's tolerance for voltage variance, 19V is likely within the safe zone (plus or minus 5%, a typical tolerance, gives you a "safe" range between 17.575V and 19.425V).
Without knowing the specs of the laptop in question, the answer is maybe.
The new one I bought: 90W, input: 100-240V, 1.5A, 50-60Hz, output: 19V, 4.74A
It's also possible that the laptop will refuse to charge or only charge at a lower rate if it can't ID the charger (an OEM charger may have a chip in it that allow it to communicate with the laptop that the replacement won't support).
The device will only draw as much current as it needs, so as long as the replacement charger has an amperage rating greater than or equal to the old charger, it should be fine.
My question is; Will there be any problems with new charger?
