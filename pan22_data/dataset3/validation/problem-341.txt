I had to cut out many of the very long lists for post length, but it gives you an idea.
I decided to work on putting together an Arena-style (very basic) text-based RPG as a way to help myself learn Python.
I'm sure there are libraries, shortcuts, and greatly more efficient methods than what I'm using.
(For extra, I plan on utilizing my final code to create a "leaderboard" of randomly-generated characters that fight each other, so pointers in that direction help).
I also want to keep it mostly text and basic, so I'm not looking for something like PyGame, just straightforward stuff.
I'm okay with starting over (there are errors not worth finding, anyway), but I would hugely appreciate anyone knowledgeable looking over my code, giving me a few of the bigger pointers for how to clean up my current methods, and where to look for new ones.
Unfortunately, after about 1,000 lines of pieced-together code, I realize that I've been doing myself a *dis*service by reenforcing poor practices, and by going line-by-line, my inefficiency is multiplying exponentially.
