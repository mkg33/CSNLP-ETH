then we use original VM's backup to restore this VM, the new VM name is server1 too, we ping server1 the network traffic will go to this new VM.
If you want to rename the new VM to server2 and want original VM to use server1, we should rename new VM then restart original VM.
Instead of this method, I just took a backup of the source VM, restored into a new VM, logged on to the new VM (Windows Server), changed the name of the new VM, and then started the source VM.
I have seen various methods of cloning an Azure VM that all require the original VM to be sysprepped and generalized, therefore destroying it.
Yes, you are right, the On-prem environment we use this way to clone VMs.
But in Azure, if we use this method to clone VMs, the private DNS will not work for original VM.
This has worked for many years with VMWare and HyperV too.
All seems to work fine, without the need to destroy the source VM.
For example, if original VM name is server1, we can ping server1 in the same Vnet by default.
So, I think sysprepped and generalized the VM, and use this VM to create an image is a right way.
Are there any issues with this method that I am missing?
