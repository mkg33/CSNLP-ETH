You might want to restart Chrome to make sure, but for me it worked simply with a new tab.
As of now there is no way to change this behavior.
When this was installed, it should have automatically disabled your previous reader, (mine happend to be Adobe Acrobat, but this should work anyway).
If you receive an attachment in Gmail, you can click the ‘View’ link, which will display that file attachment in the Google Docs."
I can't say I've ever seen this, but then again I can't say I've ever tried Chrome on a system without Adobe [Acrobat] Reader installed already... what I can say is that my Chrome recently started opening PDFs with some new thing that seemed to be part of Chrome, though it was listed in the plugin list and could be disabled there, and that disabling both it and Adobe's plugin made Chrome do its "must download to download directory before opening" thing...
I don't really know if I did something to force this behaviour, but I would like to view it as I was before (using Foxit Reader plugin).
Article from Google called: "View files in Google Docs"
If it could be changed, it would be changed at the Gmail settings level which would say something like "Change default behavior of file attachment View button".
The "View" button under Gmail file attachment uses Google Docs viewer.
(You can see how this would help promote Google Docs as a product).
Then locate and disable the plugin called "Chrome PDF Viewer".
Have googled a bit but I can't find how to disable this 'feature'.
The Chrome PDF viewer plugin mentioned by blackmastiff actually comes with chrome and simply displays the file as is.
This is because the "View" button was specifically programmed by Google to use Google Docs viewer.
Then find your Foxit Reader Plugin entry, and re-enable that.
Have you checked your extensions page to make sure you don't have anything that might do that?

(To be totally sure, you should try disabling everything and reload a page with a PDF link.)
To disable Chrome from automatically using the Google Reader, go to "chrome://plugins/".

Some time ago my Chrome started to open PDFs in Google Docs viewer.
