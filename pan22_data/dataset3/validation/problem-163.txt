I'm also guessing that you don't want to expose the adapter to the network.
If you're still wanting to do this, I can think of the below method:
I'm not using windows server, so I have no idea to configure this service.
so you can ssh to the box and forward ports to your ManagementClient.
You best option will probably be using Windows firewall to prevent access to port 3389 on all IPs other than 127.0.0.1.
That would make you take over your own session which would then lock the machine.
Why would you want to only have it listen on 127.0.0.1?
Here is a link how this can be done: www-css.fnal.gov/csi/win-firewall/win-firewall.html
binding to localhost is very common for several services under linux.
Binding the RDP listeners to localhost can also be a cheap way to enable multiple concurrent sessions stemming from a single console session.
I'm not sure if you can bind RDP to listen on only IP.
From there, you'll be able to RDP to the loopback adapter using its link-local address.
I'm guessing you want the localhost functionality, not strictly wanting 127.0.0.1.
