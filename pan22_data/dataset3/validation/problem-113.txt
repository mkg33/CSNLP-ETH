However, I'm not aware of any way to choose that from the GUI.
BUT, the netsh show profile command returns "cost=fixed".
Not sure about other versions, but on Windows 10 Home edition, I can only set a metered connection when logged in as an admin.
The name of the profile is usually your wifi SSID - you can check this using netsh wlan show profiles and check your current settings using netsh wlan show profile name="Your profile name".
In other words, if you don't have admin rights on your user account, you cannot set a metered connection.
The greyed out connection properties shown under a standard user account might be misrepresenting the connection's actual cost setting.
There is also a third option, Variable, "The connection is costed on a per-byte basis."
You need to log in with an administrator account in order to set a WiFi connection to metered.
I logged in as admin and set my connection to metered.
Look under "Cost Settings" and if the Metered connection setting is turned on, the Cost will be set to Fixed, meaning "The use of this connection is unrestricted up to a specific limit."
If the Metered connection setting is turned off, the Cost will be set to Unrestricted, "The connection is unlimited and has unrestricted usage charges and capacity constraints."
You can always go to the Update and Security settings page, hit Advanced Options and there, select (mark) the Defer Upgrades option.
A standard user can check the setting from the command line:
When I am logged in as a non-admin, the metered connection switch is grayed out and turned off.
This will make Windows not download updates for you in the background.
You can use netsh wlan set profileparameter name="Your profile name" cost=Fixed in an elevated promt to change your connection to metered and netsh wlan set profileparameter name="Your profile name" cost=Unrestricted to change it back.
When I view my connection properties from my standard user account, it looks like my connection is still "unmetered" and the toggle is greyed out.
I made a separate non-admin user for myself to use daily for enhanced security.
Note that when you are logged in as a standard user, not only can you not change the setting, but you can't see the setting either; the settings panel will show the "Metered connection" option as off regardless of what the actual setting is.
I can only enable it when logged in as an admin, and unfortunately, it does not retain this setting across other system user accounts.
