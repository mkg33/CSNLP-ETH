The chef documentation is in the process of being cleaned up.

The error message means that there is no cookbook_file method in your class.
Writing an effective library will take some time and for the most part shouldn't be required.
I am looking for a solution of this problem (organize my code, libraries, use resources in classes) or, better, a good Chef documentation as I find the documentation very deficient in clarity and disorganized so that research through it is a pain.
Learning both Ruby and Chef is a lot to swallow in one go.
print_something works fine, but with copy_file I get this error:
There are a bunch of different approaches still competing for best practice.
However, I would suggest you start with Berkshelf.
Module names don't imply Class inheritance, they merely provide isolated namespaces.

It's clear to me that I don't know how to create libraries in Chef or I don't know some basic assumptions.
If you want access to the Chef methods you need to subclass the
