Last time I had this problem the sd card was broken.
I have mistakenly formatted partition as logical, problem solved after converting it to primary partition.
It looked it a little dusty so I used some compressed air on it and now it boots just fine!
I had this problem and checked the answers here, then noticed that my problem was a bad partition structure.
I went thru every post I could find from adapter to test points to cleaning the sd card slot and tried 3 different sd cards from different manufacturers(one being the card it had used since I bought the pi).
Instead of using SD formatter to format the card, I used the Toshiba SD card formatter on my laptop.
I'm a little late to the party but have you checked for dust?
Insert the card in another pc and see if it's accessible.
If is then reformat the sd card with an fresh pi installation.
It always worked great from the time I purchased it.
This time when my pi went down I got red and green constant lights (no green flashing).
I have a Pi set up as a 3d Printer server that didn't boot one day.
Although, a couple of times I had to re-image the SD card.
