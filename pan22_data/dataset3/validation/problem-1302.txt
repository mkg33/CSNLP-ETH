This means that many informations about USB problems on RaspberryPi you can find on the Internet may be outdated right now or will be outdated in very near future.
It's not often but from time to time it happens that some USB device won't work with some USB host while it is working without problems with other USB host (like other PC computer).
There is one RaspberryPi Foundation's employee working full time just on that right now and there are some other volunteers helping.
Problem is - with RasbperryPi, comparing to other USB host, it's much easier to find a device that has problems.
Unfortunately it seems that it just wasn't designed to be used as reagular USB host connecting many complicated USB devices.
The problems where especially visible at the beginnings of RasbperryPi and are being constantly improved over the time.
More patches are available, however, but they are much more intrusive and are not yet considered stable enough to be pushed to the official firmware yet.
USB in general is very complicated bus, with many modes of operations and possible configurations.
There is a lot of ongoing effort to fix all the problems in software, though.
I consider USB host to be the weakest part of the RasbperryPi device.
Using powered (active) Hub solves most of this  problems.
Usb host device in RaspberryPi is not the best one and it has a lot of problems.
That being said, it is unknown if all the problems will ever be fixed.
RaspberryPi does not deliver enough power for some devices.
Good host devices provide a lot of hardware support for many USB bus features while the chip used in RasbperryPi does not.
It seems that the progress is quite good and we already have some fixes in the official firmware.
