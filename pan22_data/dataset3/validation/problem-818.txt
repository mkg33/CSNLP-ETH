You will not see a performance boost with this approach, guaranteed.
The use case, as I undestand, should look like this: I connect from my home computer to the VPS via OpenVPN, and after that all my IPv4 traffic pass through IPv6 (server do the job).
Take a glance at most articles on the 'net about IP6, you'll see it was primarily formed to address the problem of more internet connected devices and therefore less and less IPv4 addresses available to those devices.
The part you're likely missing is a route statement in the OpenVPN config to force it to take all IPv4 traffic.
I suggested to use service like HideMyAss.com, but unfortunately they don't support IPv6.
More detail is beyond the scope of this answer but http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6.
The internet protocol is part of the internet layer of the TCP/IP model, who's cousin is the network layer of the OSI model.
I'm not good at networking, never did things like that, and don't know where to start, and what should I do.
Edit: It seems like there are couple of VPN services that supports IPv6 (it's odd, but the biggest VPN services support only IPv4), and there is none providing 4in6 tunnels.
Bandwidth limitations are part of the physical layer(s) of those models.
My recommendation is to look to your ISP for more bandwidth (whomever provides your uplink, since that's your bottleneck), make sure your network is capable of 1Gbps or better (which means all nics, switches, and network cable also).
The question is: Is there any existing VPN service that will make my dreams come true, and is easy to use, which I could connect over PPTP or OpenVPN (I want to set up connection to VPN in my router settings).
So, I came to the following solution: rent a VPS with IPv6 address, and manually setup 4in6 tunnel.
You might even take a performance hit by adding hops into your route more info.
But unfortunately IPv4 internet connection speed is limited to 1mbps, which is realy sad.
'IPv4' if you will can (theoretically) 'handle' any bandwidth, b/c it's not part of the physical layer(s).
You're (potentially) on the right track with an OpenVPN and VPS type solution.
OpenVPN - because I want to configure VPN connection to server in my router (Asus RT-N16?
So, in order to get a good internet connection I made a plan: connect to the VPN-service over IPv6, and pass all IPv4 traffic through IPv6 tunnel, or something like that, I think you get the idea.
Fortunately I have a native IPv6, and there is no connection speed limit over IPv6.
