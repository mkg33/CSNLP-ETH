Is there a way to make an image of the hard disk so in case of any problems I can restore this image?
Whilst you could use dd on the live filesystem, I suspect if you restored the image, that it probably wouldn't work.
dd if=/dev/sda |ssh user@remotehost "cat > image.bin"
Make sure that you aren't copying virtual filesystems such as /dev or /proc , there should be only empty directories.
), then you can use the dd command to achieve this.
I did use tar to copy live linux system to another computer and there were only minor problems such as stale lock files.
You'd run that on the host whose disk you want to backup and replace /dev/sda with the disk device you want to backup.
On the target system boot off live CD, create partitions and filesystems and extract image.tar from USB or network.
Add compression and other tar switches as appropriate.
Edit: Ooops, missed the subtle mention of SSH in the subject.
To make an exact image of the disk try something like
However, after the target system is up and running, it is best to copy most vital data in a safe way (i.e.
You can use tar together with ssh to copy whole filesystem:
