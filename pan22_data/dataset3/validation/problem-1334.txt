web gui needs to be used only to assign new ticket / mark it with required attributes and close resolved issue.
Basically every manager needs to be able to edit the categories specific to their department and run those reports, without me giving them full administrative access over everything.
if diving into the code is fine - you can extend it a lot, add custom fields and custom actions.
At current I'm dabbling with a self-made form that connects with a mysql database, but I need something that's honestly a bit more professional looking, especially as far as generating reports.
Does anyone have any suggestions on a good way of going about doing this?
you'll curse perl too [ just after you start learning it with rt ].
it quite easily integrates with mail system - up to a point that each mail from client can open new issue and can be answered via regular mail client and yet be logged in the system.
it has quite granular permission management, reports [ i think ] can be genrated by anyone who can just read tickets, queries used for them can be saved and used in the future.
I do have a budget so I don't necessarily have to have free software, although as always, that'd be great.
As an office we need to be able to report how many emails we send and how many/how long we spend on phone support with the public.
aha.. it might not be good looking, report wizard is not easiest tool to use - but it's worth the time spent learning.
issues/events [like phonecall] can be also opened/logged via web gui.
I played around with spiceworks, which seems great for a helpdesk environment, but I need something more flexible as far as categorization and user-permissions.
I'm tasked with creating a phone and email logging database for about 30 people in order to collect some mandated statistics on our support.
Everyone is centralized in a single location and the logging software does not need to be accessible outside of the office (so I'm slightly less concerned with security), but optimally there would be some sort of web interface that people can use from their desks to input what issues they've responded to and what/how long they've spent doing so.
