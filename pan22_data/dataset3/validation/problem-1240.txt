Something I learned as part of our Virtualisation project, moving from a few VMWare Server installs here and there to a proper ESX cluster, is that it is great, but at the high end it means putting more your eggs in fewer baskets... there isn't much wrong with that as such, but it does mean that each one of the baskets needs a lot more care than before.
The number of virtual machines running at any one time varies heavily, depending on the requirements of each VM.
With something like VMWare, hardware compatibility is important and someone like Dell, IBM, HP can offer you that - if you buy a system for ESX you can be sure it will work.
Even if you believe you will save money on the initial purchase price of the hardware then you have to consider what will happen during the lifetime of the system.
You could spend 10grand on a host that fits 50 VMS, but your bottle neck be with your storage device.
Do you think that I am not going to save much money by building myself vs going w/ a dell server etc.
To be honest, I wonder what you hope to achieve by building it yourself.
As far as we are concerned, this was reasonable cost, as it saved us a whole lot of other expenses (air conditioning, rack space, configuration, testing,....).
I think the answer to your question comes down to two other questions:
I've narrowed in on this board: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813151085&cm_re=tyan-_
We have VM servers in operation with 128GB of RAM, several quad core processors and large disk arrays, all based on Dell hardware.
It's one thing to lose one or two services when a VMWare Server with a couple of things on it and quite something else to lose ten services when an ESX server dies or all of them when the shared storage dies.
Right now I have seperate machines running some applications, datamining type stuff and they each have about 1gig ram, 600-1GHz CPU and I'd like to see how many I can run on a server running VMWare Server ESXi.
Seems a bargain and then can load it up with a lot of ram etc.
I am planning on building servers to host the max number of VMs.
