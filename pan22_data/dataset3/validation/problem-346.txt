I've heard that the Internet exchanges packets by packet switching.
Yes you could indeed buy your own routing gear, but that is not your only consideration.
Extend for the whole street and my cheap home router might get stressed.
A: This would be similar to a "Mesh" or "Token Passing" topology.
If I go on holliday then I turn off lights, computers and enything which I can.
You need infrastructure, a simplified ADSL version would look like this:
Finally, if something goes wrong, then you now no longer have one ISP which is serving many people and who can afford technically skilled people.
A: ISP is that "backbone which would be the gateway to the Internet outside", so why to connect to all the neighbor devices when you can reach the ISP itself?
A: ISP is responsible for maintaining network devices, provide fault-tolerance, and fix devices ASAP in case of failure.
And if your other neighbour is connected to you can thus indirectly to me I am now routing for 3 people.
I can probably come up with a few more reasons if I think about this.
Can't your router just be directly connected to your neighbour's routers and their routers connected to their neighbours, all doing the packet switching?
Here's the fun fact, you all technically share the same route back to the ISP.
Q: In that case, only a few would people would need to be connected to some hub or backbone which would be the gateway to the Internet outside of the neighborhood.
Your connection goes to the CO, and then is sent down the line until it reaches a data center.
You would need much more capable devices in each home.
Devices with enough throughput for an area or neighborhood are expensive, so all the neighbors should buy one, which is far more than what ISP spends on devices!
Q: Can't your router just be directly connected to your neighbor's routers and their routers connected to their neighbors, all doing the packet switching?
Technically possible, but economically not sensible,
Then what if a device of the neighbor connected to Internet backbone fails?
My device now has to route both my own data and your data.
Hopefully both your neighbours do not go on vacation in the same period.
In that case, only a few would people would need to be connected to some hub or backbone which would be the gateway to the Internet outside of the neighbourhood.
So why does everyone in the apartement individually connect to the ISP?
But the three stated above are already enough to make this inefficient on a large scale with current technology.
