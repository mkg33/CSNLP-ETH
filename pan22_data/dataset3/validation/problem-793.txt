(Instead, IMAP subfolders are usually mapped to hidden "dot" directories inside the Maildir, so Trash would correspond to Maildir/.Trash/{cur,new,tmp}.)
Looking at the dates, some of those files are as old as 2013.
First of all, Postfix has absolutely nothing to do with IMAP.
So really, Thunderbird or Postfix have a problem on that one?
Why would Thunderbird / Postfix not delete those emails when I empty my Trash folder?
However, if I ignore files that end with ",S" or ",RS", then the total is 362.
Looking in the Maildir/cur folder on my server, I could a total of 853 emails.
I have a postfix server using an IMAP with TLS to retrieve my emails.
It feels rather slow and becomes slower as time passes, even though I try to limit the number of emails I have to just a few hundred (362 at the moment.)
Exactly what I see when Thunderbird starts (it shows me the count in the status bar at the bottom.)
So if you see some messages in the storage but not in Thunderbird, there could be two problems:
At most, it delivers messages to the Maildir directly, or to some LDA, but that's all – your IMAP access is most likely provided by Dovecot, Courier, or Cyrus.
Looking at those emails with ",S" or ",RS" at the end of the filename, they are all spam emails.
Second, messages in Maildir/{cur,new,tmp} are not in "Trash" in the first place – that's your "INBOX" folder.
