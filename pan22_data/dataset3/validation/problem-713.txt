You should familiarize yourself with Linux's filesystem.
Personally, I put pretty much everything (though, I don't use swap) except for /home on an SSD and that is just due to space restrictions.
/proc might make copies of the binaries you load for what it's worthâ€¦).
For example, the proc filesystem (/proc) and the device files (/dev) are created by the OS to look like files; they reside in memory and not on the disk anyway.
You should also enable wear leveling to lessen the impact of this even for many-write situations.
Basically, anything that you are going to read more than you write is a good option because it won't wear on the drive.
As chrisaycock points out, you should look through the Filesystem Layout and think about what works for you.
To answer your question, feel free to put anything that's actually a file on the SSD.
/dev and /proc are virtual filesystems which reside in kernel memory, so the writes shouldn't matter here (I could be completely wrong that the writes don't actually hit the disk, so if someone more knowledgable could weigh in, I would appreciate it.
The swap, for example, is created by the virtual memory system and is not a file, at least as far as you're concerned anyway.
