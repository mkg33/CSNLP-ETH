Being a Linux guy, I'd love to hear how to do this in Windows *
I notice in Windows that the installers for most applications don't always log everything.
How can I track all files installed by an installer so that I may copy those files over to another system?
And if you script your installation then you (or someone else) could do it again in another year ;-)
Screw this up and the data lost might be how to get your paycheck sent out (although it might figure out your severence.)
Not knowing your motivation to move the application, have you considered a P2V process?
The problem is, sometimes installers will fork a process and launch another installer or run a script of some kind... and you'd have to filter through hundreds of thousands of system trace events to find out which are related to your software.
I've got a Windows Server 2003 computer with a payroll application, and a new Server 2008 System that I'm migrating to.
This is all the excuse you need for your boss(es) and you'll be glad you have it when the inevitable "Is this because it's on Server 2008 (x64?)?"
You need to run the installer in order to create the proper registry keys and register the proper DLLs.
Try installing the package again, copy any ODBC connections or config files, see if your application works just the same.
Legacy apps / rescue from old hardware are big P2V targets.
If I had a file list I could simply script the copy.
It will show you all the file access, registry access, and network access for any windows process.
Once you really understand what your application requires in your particular configuration then you can migrate with a bit of confidence.
VMware (or Virtua Box or whatever) is your friend.
Best bet is to call your vendor for support - and if you dont have any, get some now.
