No, firewalls don't habitually drop big DNS queries like that, as far as I'm aware.
Does anybody know if this is enforced by major corporate firewalls?
Google for cisco pix dns edns0 and you'll find a bunch of info on this.
DNS' RFC notes that DNS queries over UDP are limited to 512 bytes.
However, we are not very knowledgeable about common firewall behavior and would like some help.
What you want to look at for your problem is existing implementations of IP over DNS, such as dns2tcp, nstx, or iodine.
This is a classic problem with Cisco Pix firewalls.
For a full treatise on these issues with low end kit see RFC 5625 and ICANN SSAC report SAC035.
Since the typical user of this product (performance engineer) would not have access to firewall's settings, we would like to develop a method that bypasses firewalls with good rates of success.
If on the other you're talking about low end firewalls, SOHO routers, etc, you're quite likely to come unstuck.
Here is an example of a broken DNS at an important IAP in France:
My company develops a product that should communicate between data centers.
DNS packet truncation is something of a speciality of mine...
Besides Alnitak's good summary, see also an excellent tool to test your DNS setup and see if it lets packets > 512 bytes go (as it should).
We thought of tunneling the application data over DNS TXT queries, since it seems that (within the WAN) firewalls tend to let DNS queries pass by.
If you're talking about real, proper, enterprise firewalls you're probably OK, although Cisco PIXes tend to come with a default setting that does limit packets to 512 bytes.
For example http://homepages.tesco.net/J.deBoynePollard/FGA/dns-edns0-and-firewalls.html
Specifically, we are wondering whether the big-brand firewalls block DNS queries over UDP that are longer than 512 bytes.
