My Exchange Mailbox servers(2) are running on Server 2003 R2 and they have Exchange Server 2007 SP2 Rollup 4.
Any recommendations or help would be much appreciated for converting two Exchange 2007 Maibox Servers to VSphere Virtual Servers.
Do not attach the old DBs as that can also cause issues.
While it is likely possible to p2v the servers, there is absolutely no upside to doing so and a hole host of reasons not to.
I have tried more times than I would like to admit with Vcenter Converter and even spent about 7 hours with support from VMWare trying to get it to work unsuccessfully.
After all moves are complete you can remove the old servers.
Add 2 more exchange servers to the environment and move the mailboxes to the new servers.
I am at a point where I would like to make some kind of backup/restore solution work, but not sure how exactly to do that and can't find great documents or help out there to do this type of operation.
Aside from a backup/restore method, I think my only option is to build up new virtual servers from scratch and attach the db's.
Also I don't believe they are clustered as each one has unique mailboxes.
