It can be related to processor overheating (your CPU is fried) but generally it is not.
Some people remove the DIMMs and use the eraser of a normal pencil to erase away the oxidation layer from both sides of each DIMM and the from the connectors.
What they're doing, wittingly or not, is removing that layer of oxidation so the DIMMs can make good contact with the DIMM socket.
If you remove the DIMMs and your body is not at the same ground level as the computer, you could fry the DIMMs and / or other computer components with a discharge of electricity from an otherwise static charge, in which case they'll likely never work again.
For the most part, you'll probably find a layer of oxidation has formed on the memory DIMMs or on the DIMM sockets.
Using a static grounding strap for both the computer and the person working on the computer (grounded to the same ground) will likely prevent static zapping the computer and / or the DIMMs.
If you can SAFELY (unplug the computer first and remove the battery) remove the DIMMs, clean the connectors (not over the computer) and re-insert them into alternate DIMM slots, you may be able to recover the computer.
(If there are two DIMM slots, first try reinserting the DIMMs -- after cleaning -- into the alternate slot.
(If you're about to race over to the computer and try this without reading the rest, at least note which DIMM came out of which slot, ground yourself and the computer and remove all power, including the battery.)
Sometimes you'll find computer technicians report having simply "reseated" the DIMMs (they took the DIMMs out and put them back in again) which sounds kind of useless, especially considering what they've charged you.
If you can't find it within yourself to run down to the electronics store and buy a grounding kit, at least hold on to the metallic frame of the computer while you're performing this operation.
This presumes the computer is in "first-failure" mode, meaning you haven't already taken the computer apart and possibly inflicted some additional damage to it, in which case you may have a multiplicity of problems, all of which need to be resolved before the computer will become operational again.
Frequently, when this happens, the computer is completely unable to even emit an audible error code (a beep).
This operation will likely void any warranty you had, as manufacturers generally deem there is a likelihood of getting eraser filings in the computer, specifically in the DIMM slots, which can prevent a proper connection.
If that doesn't work, return the DIMMs to their original slots.)
There are a lot of things which can completely disable a computer's ability to even emit a beep code but this one is the most common.
