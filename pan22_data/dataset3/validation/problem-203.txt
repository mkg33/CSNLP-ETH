The first thing to do is to quantify your needs and resources - particularly the CPU's in the available systems, and what the VPN is required for.
Using a NAS, it again depends on the NAS, but yes, a lot of them will do an adequate job - but in most cases they use a similar chip to a Router, so doing it on a router is a better idea.
A VPN on a dedicated computer could be a viable solution - but it will consume extra power.
(I do note that in both cases I'm only encrypting traffic to key destinations, but that would be the majority of traffic) - as if your needs are not extremely high, using a decent router is the way to go - Consensus is you should be able to get > 40 megabits over VPN from an ASUS RT-AC68 or better.
Bottom line - if you get a mid-high end router and put dd-wrt or similar on it, and you don't need to push more then 50 megabit of traffic and can use an OpenVPN router, it should be more then adequate.
I use a similar router with VPN at home, and do heavy backups over it.
is patently incorrect - there are any number of x86 boxes with multiple interfaces configured as routers, and they are more then up to pushing anything a typical home environment could throw at it - especially if they have AES-NI on the chip - but this is not a requirement) - hell, once upon a time I ran a whole ISP this way.
Of-course, throw Linux and an extra couple of NICS on it, and its a router.
If you drop more money on it, you can get even more throughput.
I have several offices which I connect using VPNs on an ASUS AC1900 dual band gigabit router.
