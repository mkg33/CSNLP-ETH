If you have a C++ based application that workstations connect to, you might not have a front-end layer.
If you do not use virtual machines or containers and use local storage, you might not have a compute and storage layer.
These four basic resources will power your application or service at every layer of your application.
For example, if you run all of your data off of NFS mounts, the Storage layer would sit beside compute instead of behind it.
This can change depending on how your environment is architected.
If your application uses flat files, you might not have a database layer.
This represents the basic monitoring that can be given by your vendors, software and hardware.
Basically host monitoring tells you that something is fatally wrong now, but application monitoring should be able to predict problems by detecting higher error rate or that requests are taking longer time so you can fix problems before your users notice them.
For any given node, there are 4 basic resources with the following items to monitor:
I like this video: GOTO 2016 • Monitoring Microservices • Tom Wilkie
One of the key ideas (for me at least) is to realize the difference between host monitoring and application monitoring.
This will be architected into up to 5 layers depending on your environment and you will want to monitor them at every layer.
Once 100% coverage is achieved, You can additionally build hooks into your application to report additional health statuses, but by their nature, these will typically be built as a reaction to outages and you would have to work with your internal developers to build these kinds of hooks.
Monitoring these 4 basic resources should catch probably 80% of issues that cause outages however, and then you can start working on the remaining 20%.
You will want to monitor the above 4 basic resources at every layer.
I'm surprised nobody mentioned the four golden signals explicitly as an answer, so I'll add it.
Lifted directly from Google's SRE Book chapter on monitoring distributed systems, it is suggested to at least collect metrics on the "Four Golden Signals":
Use the downvote button to let me know that this answer is not good :) )
Covering these four basic resources at every layer should be your first goal.
(I'm not affiliated with weaveworks or the goto conference in any way, I just like the content and think there are some interesting ideas.
