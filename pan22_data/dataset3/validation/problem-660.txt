The setup should not give any error while installing.
Also I noticed that not only EVE would not work, but GNS3 could not integrate with a VM.
Please run as administrator when you run the setup and turn off antivirus if any.
It is also worthy to note that your build is over a year old - consider updating.
After some troubleshooting I came to the conclusion that it was not Vmware the problem or Gns3, but windows somewhere where my knowledge was not deep enough.
Stay tuned as Workstation 10 may be updated to "officially certify" operation.
Upgrading to VMware Workstation 12 solved it on my Windows 10 box.
I was stuck with this problem for a while so it was somewhere in windows.
That did the trick, Vmware was able to create virtual adapters and I could connect EVE and gns3 VM.
I'm on old Workstation 8 and it still works fine under Win 10 after repair install.
Perhaps the repair install will clear up the old pre-upgrade virtual adapters and they are the problem with creating new network adapters.
I tried the solution mentioned here plus many more things and nothing worked.
Once it booted up my VMs all had their network adapters working and connected.
VMware Workstation 10 does not specifically support Windows 10 by way of the "Supported host operating systems for VMware Workstation" (KB2088579) document provided by VMware.
I had to reinstall windows setting keeping my documents.
I fixed my virtual network adapters by running the VMware Workstation install again and selecting repair.
After a hell lot of effort, I found that  Antivirus is the issue.
Turning vmci0 value to false is not at all a good approach
Running a Windows 10 laptop and VMware workstation 15.5 would not create virtual network adapters.
VMWare Workstation 11 is expected to support Windows 10 as a host OS (citation needed).
