Also the raspberry pi uses the USB2.0 bus for it's network interface, so you are sharing the usb2.0 bus  between the external USB disk and the network.
The speeds rates I get are VERY slow (below 1 Mb/s)..
Now, when I try to copy a file the speed transfers are VERY slow...
More detailed explanation here : http://www.howtoeverything.net/linux/raspberry-pi/performance-issues-when-copying-files-over-network
scp test.avi root@192.168.1.42:/media/maxtor/Movies test.avi 89% 4005MB 918.7KB/s 08:45 ETA
If that doesn't solve your problem, you might want to check this great answer on raspberry pi forum :
In fact, I get faster speeds in downloading a file over the Internet on Wifi, than having a wired file transfer between my Mac and my Rasperry.
The raspberry pi is likly not able to handle more transfer cpu-wise ( having only 100Mbit network limits the raspberry to max 10MB/sek)
Please check the load of the raspberry during a copy process.

If the CPU jumps to 100% and stays there, thats likely the problem.
Try a copy to the internal storage of the pi, if that's substantially faster, there you go.
my networking knowledge/systems is very limited, so i may have used wrong terminology).
