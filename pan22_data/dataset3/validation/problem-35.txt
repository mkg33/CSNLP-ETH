However, you might consider configuring sudo to allow users the kill command in a limited manner.
It cannot be restricted to only kill processes of a specific user.
This will let anyone in the users group run /bin/kill as any other user in the users group, and will not prompt for a password.
In this example I'm assuming that there exists a group named users to which all of the members of your dev group belong.
Group file permissions do not extend to running processes.
The easiest way to do what you want is to create an entry in /etc/sudoers like this:
Remember that you can use the command aliases to shorthand writing out longs lists of apps, and you can also use regular expressions (be careful you don't allow too much)
Granting users to kill processes with sudo will allow them to kill any process.
Depending what your problem is, if you need the users of the dev group to be able to kill all of the processes of a specific type for some other user, then there might be a solution.
I'm pretty sure this is exactly what you were asking for.
You will obviously need to modify this to match your local environment.
This would allow the developers to kill all of the 'perl' processes, for one specific user.
