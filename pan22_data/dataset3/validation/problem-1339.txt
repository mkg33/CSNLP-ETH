Add it to the dock and click it to execute that keystroke.
You can right click on the dock icon and the menu will list all of the applications open windows.
The wanted behaviour can be achieved by replacing the Safari's icon in the dock with the following AppleScript (following NReilingh's example) saved as an Application:
If you want to cycle by clicking a dock icon, you could write an AppleScript to hit that keystroke and put that in the dock right next to Safari.
To complete things you need to edit the script's properties - right click the script app in Finder and select Show Package Contents, then open Info.plist in Contents.
Is there something bigger that you're trying to accomplish with this?
I find it a bit strange that you would think this is necessary or possible completely out of the blue.
command+` is the normal way to cycle through an application's open windows.
Let's say I have Safari active and I want to cycle between its open windows by pressing Safari's dock icon (instead of pressing cmd+>).
Put the above into AppleScript Editor, and save it as an application.
That will focus Safari and cycle through its active windows.
It won't work unless we prevent it from stealing focus, which can be accomplished by right-clicking the app bundle and showing package contents, open Contents/Info.plist, and then add the LSBackgroundOnly key (Application is background only) with a boolean value of 1.
If Safari is not open, it will be opened on the first time, so this works also like the normal Safari icon.
Now you should have an icon in dock that looks like Safari's but with added window cycling with subsequent clicks - if you named the script as Safari, nobody should notice any difference with original.
