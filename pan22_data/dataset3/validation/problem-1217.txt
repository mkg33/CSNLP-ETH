By default, you can only write to /var/run as a user with an effective user ID of 0 (ie as root).
I'll stick with creating a separate /var/run folder for now, however.
Now specify to use /var/run/mydaemon rather than /var/run.
Then change its ownership to the user/group under which you wish to run your process:
I am starting start-stop-daemon and like to write the PID file in /var/run
Instead, as root, create a directory under /var/run:
You can always test this by running a test as the user in question.
touch: cannot touch `/var/run/test.pid': Permission denied
This is for good reasons, so whatever you do, don't go and change the permissions of /var/run...
Probably mess up some other apps, but it seems like it would be another solution.
To avoid putting your program-user in the root group, allow others write access:
I like to avoid putting my-program-user in the root group.
Create a directory /var/run/test/ and then change the permission of this directory to the same user as your program runs. "
Now in your application  change the location of the PID file to /var/run/test/test.pid.
