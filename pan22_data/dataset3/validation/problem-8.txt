Theory of Computation, Logic ( and also Music and Art )
Fundamental Algorithms in Algorithmic Algebra by Chee Yap (available online here).
The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves by Joseph H. Silverman.
The book is a good introduction into mathematics of elliptic as well as a suitable source for an extended insight of elliptic curve cryptography.
I found this a good addition to the next book when learning about ellipc curve cryptography.
I had read this book after it was recommended in my first university computer science course (almost two years ago now) and have since then skimmed through it again for 2 times.
This text covers (fast) integer multiplication, polynomial root finding, integer polynomial factorization, lattice reduction techniques (specifically LLL), elimination theory, Grobner bases and continued fractions, all from an algorithmic perspective.
It introduces the reader to the life and work of 15 very important computer scientists, 8 of whom have won a Turing Award.
Maybe it is not so  usefull in technical sense, but it's a good and funny way to understand hard concepts from Logic and Theory in general.
A new addition to the list is a book "Foundations of Data Science" by Blum, Hopcroft and Kannan: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf
Out of Their Minds really is a must read for all computer scientists or people with a general interest in computer science.
The book is, for me, challenging but covers a broad area of the field of algebraic geometry.
I've got to answer this question, even though it already has 30+ answers.
I found this text indispensable when learning about lattice reduction.
When I was a young student I found this book really exciting.
