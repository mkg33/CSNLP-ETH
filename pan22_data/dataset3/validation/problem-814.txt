It would just be the cost to your users of receiving a text message.
If you have the cell phone number and carrier of your users, each carrier (usually) has a gateway address where you can send an e-mail.
We've worked with Twilio, Clickatell and BulkSMS for the past few years, their coverage and rates vary but they're all easy to integrate with, usually only a few lines of code is enough to get started with their APIs.
Your other option could be to just send e-mails out.
They take care of all of the relationships with the various service providers, which can be a very time consuming process especially if you're looking at delivering messages interationally.
There are a number of companies that have SMS service, allowing you to make an API call to their system and they then deliver the message.
You wouldn't need to worry about any charges other than your own Internet access.
You'd basically just send an e-mail to 5555555555@tmomail.net for a phone number of 555-555-5555 with the carrier of T-Mobile.
The rates depend on what network you're sending to, but typically are between $0.02 and $0.15 per message.
