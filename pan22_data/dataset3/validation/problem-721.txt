Finally, the array is assigned to the Value property.
An alternative approach would be to code the import of the file as a separate sheet.
Not sure about the "faster" thing but you can replace the 31 lines of assignments with a 3 line for loop:
Programming is about automating repetitive tasks, this should also apply to the code you write.
One of the slowest parts of Excel VBA is writing to the grid.
aNew is a poorly named variable that will hold the array that gets written to the sheet.
By reading in the whole text file at once, you can redimension aNew to the right number of rows.
Thus, Excel doesn't have to call the ActiveCell object at each loop.
Whenever you have a lot of data to write you should put that data in an array and write it all at once.
The loops simply fill aNew with the info in the order we want it.
Then by reading in the first line and splitting it, you get the number of columns for aNew (assuming they're all the same number of columns).
Then select used range and copy to where those values have to go.
