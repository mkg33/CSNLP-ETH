The sensor ranges from -55°C to +125°C with a resolution of +/- 0.4°C.
You can useboth variants with your RPI but beware when connecting it to your RPI!
Both will give you the temperature in a 9 bit two's complement format (signum = 1 bit, 8 bit "real data").
It has Linux kernel support so reading the sensor is simply the matter of reading a file.
I should say I'm not very well versed in pulling data off sensors, so any advice on that is really appreciated too.
If you are not afraid of using a soldering iron or a breadboard you could use a LM75 temperature sensor.
Ideally I would like to not have to use a breadboard so I could utilise the GPIO pins directly on the Pi.
Beware that there exist two variants: LM75CIM-3 and LM75CIM-5 which need either 3.3V or 5V.
It only requires three connections to the Pi (one gpio, ground, and 3V3 power) and a 4k7 resistor between the output line and 3V3.
If you search the site for DS18B20 you will find plenty of examples.
Finally you could use the i2c utils from the linux kernel to talk to your sensor and poll data.
I have my Raspberry Pi 2 running Nagios 4 in a small HiFi cabinet which I have converted into a rack of sorts, and would like to monitor the temperature of said rack.
