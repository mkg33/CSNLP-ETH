In my case on the screen I have a black background and white text, but on the paper I've got it inverted, just normal black text on white paper!!!!!!!
The only thing left is to figure it out how to make it default.
To make the color settings persistent, click Set As Default just to the left of the Page Color button.
For Word 2013, the easiest method that I know of is:
It's a not-so-pretty but fast option for many programs that don't supply darkmodes themselves, but sometimes control elements turn invisible because of it.
In Word 2019 it seems to work fine so far, and printed pages are, similar to the color-filter solution, still white with black text.
I would choose the high-contrast mode over the color-filter because it changes background- and font-color somewhat more intelligent, IMHO.
The way it looks can be enhanced a bit in the system settings.
You could use a different windows theme while editing your word/excel documents.
It affected only the viewing of the document; it still printed as expected.
Go to Design ribbon and on the right click PAGE COLOR in Page background section (the most right in my case).
Another possibility is to use Windows' high contrast mode.
There is a inverted contrast accessibility theme that will do just that.
You could in theory write a macro that changed the colors around when printing, and changed them back afterward, and then attach it to the Word document.
Used to be you could activate a mode that gave you white text on a dark blue background, like in the DOS days.
Cause currently if you create a new document, it still opens with white background.
If you run win 10 and office 2016, you might need latest updates installed.
I hunted this thing (black background) for many, many years and, finally  got this.
FYI, it takes less power to display a white screen on a modern LCD, so if that's your concern, leave it the way it is.
