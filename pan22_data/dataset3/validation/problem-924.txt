First, check the batteries or make sure that you have new ones.
Certain toners or network testers mainly high end fluke brand ones will tone through a live patched cable..
place 1 of the clips from your tone generator to the green/white pair and the other clip to the brown wire this will allow you to short out the active port on the switch so you can tone out the cabling without harming the port on the switch.
I think you should test your toner by plugging the generator into a line you know is patched properly and stick the receiver in the proper jack.
I swipe along the underside of the cable jacks (against the copper side) or along the punch panel on the back.
You can trace the cable that is plugged into a switch or server but you must ground the black alligator clip that come off the tone generator.
this will leave you with the green/white pair and the solid brown wire, next remove the shielding from all 3 wires twist the green/ white pair exposed wires together.
Next, you should be swiping along the patch panel and not the switch.
But are great on lines that arent patched into anything at all (fresh install)
Most other toners are not very practical on "live" lines.
take a patch cord cut it into, next remove about 2 inches of the outer shielding to expose the twisted pairs, cut off the blue/white pair, orange/white pairs, and the white wire from the brown/white pair.
