There are two important steps one can take to make life easier.
I have tried this on the desktop viewer and mobile viewer and the problem is the same.
Plus, you can use Remmina on linux machines as a client also.
Remmina has the advantage that it can connect via either VNC or RDP, and uses a tabbed interface if you connect to more than one server.
Go to advanced option > resolution > [select resolution accordingly]
Is there a way of changing the code when the raspberry pi starts up that creates a default window that can be scrolled in VNC viewer?
Change the screen size on your Pi to load properly according to your client machine resolution.
However the automatic server that is created on startup, when no HDMI is attached, is not viewed correctly in VNC viewer.
Only a very small portion of the screen is displayed and I am not able to scroll to other sections of the page.
All Windows machines have an RDP client called Remote Desktop Connection.
If I create a server using ssh with vncserver :1, the resulting virtual window is correct and I am able to scroll to different parts of the screen.
Once you have that working you might want to consider using Remote Desktop Protocol.
However this is no use to me as I would like to access the pi over the VNC cloud so rely on the vncserver that is created at startup.
