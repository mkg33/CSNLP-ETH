Some of the bigger ISP's will look for a PTR record...they will not allow email..
What you really want is for your MTA to pick up the MX record for comcast.net, and not just resolve to comcast.net.
There are A (and MX, too) records for comcast.net.
For instance, what do dig A comcast.net or dig MX comcast.net yield?
It might be legal to not have an A record, but is a good idea too have an A record for the relay.
If the problem is temporary, then you'll have to perform the dig when the problem occurs.
Verizon and Comcast have the tightest rules that I have found.
And, no, it is perfectly legal to not have A records.
I have not had any reports from the business that they are not able to transact email for any reason.
Can anyone shed some light on what this message is telling me?
When mail is rejected, it contains an error message similar to the following:
On my brightmail servers I have made the decision to not accept mail if an A record is not found.
While you can do that, there is no guarantee that you'll get what you're after.
Also, it sounds like you're attempting delivery to the MTA at a server named "comcast.net", but I suspect you really want to attempt delivery to smtp.comcast.net instead.
: Host or domain name not found for name=comcast.net Type=A: Host found but no data record of requested type
I have set up an ISPConfig server to host email for several domains and I am having a problem with mail sent from this server not being delivered to some, but not all, valid domains.
I thought that my domain may have gotten blacklisted, but I didn't find any listings when checked the domain against several BLs.
I'm sure you'll have a bit more luck with that address.
I also use optus looking glass (that is my google term I search for) to check to see what I look like DNS wise from the outside world.
Ensure your domains are set up for reverse lookup, and give it another shot.
I am not sure if it is related to the specific error you are having, but I had a similar issue with Postfix and Comcast related to Reverse DNS lookup.
further they will have a second line of spam filters that will check for an A record.
Lastly...you might get past some very tight servers if you use a proper SPF record.
AFAIK, Type A records are IPv4 addresses and should always exist if a DNS record exists.
