Then, I read somewhere, that you can remove the file .applesetupdone (full command below) in order to trick OSX into thinking that it needs to finalize set-up and it will run you through the process of creating a new admin account when it boots again.
(It is possible that OSX was only able to auto-mount that partition because I had told it to in the custom fstab that I wrote, but I am not sure.)
You do this by holding down the Shift key immediately when you start the Mac, and keep holding it until you see the gray Apple logo on the screen.
After that, I booted into OSX and created a new user (with admin privileges!)
After that, I tried resetting the broken user's home directory, but I wasn't holding my breath that this would work and I was perfectly satisfied with a new working user with access to all of the broken user's files and a mounted partition.
I have no idea if this will help anyone else (probably not), but I'm posting it for posterity.
This is pretty messy but it works and I've got a clean user.
Hopefully DiskUtility should help you fix the disk problem.
I was also amazed that you can get whatever files you want this way from a computer you don't have a password for (assuming the home partition is not encrypted).
First, I started by booting my Linux thumb drive and then mounting the OSX Root partition (for me it was /dev/sda2):
Here's the location and command to remove the setup file:
If this works, you can run DiskUtility once it's fully started in Safe mode.

Instead of booting from Linux, I would start by booting into safe mode.
and set-up that user's home to be a symbolic link to my old home partition.
After a day of messing around and editing fstab with various configurations and symlinking all over the place, after a day of hacking and googling, in short, I discovered a great hack.
This is not exactly a solution, but it's closer than mounting the partition within Linux and then scrabbling all the files I cared about off the drive.
