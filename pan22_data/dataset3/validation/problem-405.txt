As a small software company, we chiefly use Fedora and OpenSuSE but we specifically choose more than one distribution to help prevent us becoming locked to one variant - as our customers use a wide range of distributions and what would like to see distribution specific issues before them!
Our organization builds and tests our software on SLES/SLED and RHEL.
If you're developing software for sale and which you will have to support, having a known reproducible environment is very relevant.
If you're going to roll out an app, and just want to leave it alone and patch security vulnerabilities for 5 years, that's more viable with something like Suse or Red Hat.
In fact your organisation might benefit more from the free alternatives, with their typically more up-to-date packages and vibrant community support.
If our customers choose to run on a free variant, support is best effort at best.
Day-to-day, I think it makes very little difference.
When I came into the company I paid for 2 Ubuntu servers to have support for a year and I haven't even used it once.
If you're a growing organization, sometimes the expensive option is actually the cheaper option.
So basically, what I am saying is, depending on the experience of the people of your organisation.
The lines are blurred with this question though, as you've got to be able to compare distributions such as Centos and RHEL, both of which are built from almost identical packages, just one has commercial support.
In my company we have 6-7 people with A LOT of Debian/Ubuntu experience and we can basically get anything done very quickly.
My system admin screamed for ages to install RedHat but the CEO wanted to keep the IT landscape the same.
As I've seen it, the difference between Centos and RHEL are very small, especially if you don't require the support contract.
Having access to high-quality support and training courses is an advantage in many situations.
That also gives us a broader base of expertise for supporting our software on unexpected platforms (as we'll provide support for any platform the customer pays us to!
