Try increasing the interval...see if there are changes.
I shall suggest that beyond the first or second hop in your traceroutes, there's not much you can do (or make meaningful deductions) with ping and traceroute.
Beyond that the packet loss figures don't really mean anything to your connection with the destination ip.
That means it's the hop between my workstation and my router?
The packetloss at your router will probably be an overloaded router dropping packets where normally an error packet would be generated.
That clearly shows that the packet loss is my ISP's fault, correct?
As for assigning fault based on traceroutes:   I've professionally done senior-level network operations for over a decade, with full access to switches and routers (error counts, traffic levels, cache flows -- all manners of stats and metrics -- giving me visibility well beyond what a simple traceroute could provide, yet determining where packet loss was occurring to a host on a remote network was still an inexact art, mostly because the return path from the other host was obscured:  Unless I had a traceroute back to me from the remote host, I could only guess at how return traffic was getting back to my workstation.
Were your WiFi link lossy to the first hop, it would remain lossy to subsequent hops.
The theoretical example where your first hop has 50% loss, but your second has none is quite unlikely, though covered above...
