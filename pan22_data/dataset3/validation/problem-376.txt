We use their ConCore, but their Aluminum System is also very popular in a lot of datacenters.
(hopefully without getting on some sales droid's mailing list)
I and some other people on Server Fault deal with datacenter environmentals regularly, and might be able to help you.
Can you post pictures of the tiles and stanchions?
Haworth's flooring catalog might be of some help too.
I'm guessing it's a bit to hope for an Identifont for raised floor systems, but are there any methods or resources to identify the panels?
Tate is the most popular vendor of datacenter flooring, and their access flooring catalog would be a good place to start.
I'm managing servers in a 'hand-me-down' computer room, where we have absolutely no documentation about the floor system, and I'm attempting to determine who the manufacturer was so that I can then attempt to find the rating load of the floor and stanchions.
I've found a few places that sell replacement panels where you can send images, but I'm trying to avoid getting on their mailing lists, as we don't actually need new tiles.
Haworth is another popular flooring vendor; we use them in our DR site.
