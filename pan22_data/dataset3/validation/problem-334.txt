In theory, it should be fine, if you separately configure each correctly and keep them updated.
The problem with either approach is that if you've only got one external IP, you're going to have to put both boxes on the same internal network, which means that when someone compromises the external server, they've got root on a machine on your internal network, which means they can (with some effort) see all internal network traffic and look like an internal client, and attack the internal machine(s) at LAN speeds with no firewall in between.
Apache should be running as nobody so it shouldn't have access to your SMB files.
If you could get two external IP's, then the external box doesn't need to be on the wrong side of the firewall, and it would be much safer.
Next best would be to run the externally visible server on a virtual machine hosted on the internally visible server.
The best suggestion I have would be to run the externally visible server and the internal server on two different PC's - get a used or barebones (Atom?)
If either SVN or Apache were compromised, it could provide access to your private data.
I personally think you're crazy for considering this, but to each his/her own...
However, I would still feel slightly uncomfortable about the dual purpose machine.
Each service should handle authentication on its respective ports (SAMBA 137-139, and HTTP 80).
