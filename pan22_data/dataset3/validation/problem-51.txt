The Calculator class could configure CalculatorView with an arbitrary collection of Operator implementations.
and has an apply method to perform some calculation.
it would be better to abstract the calculation logic,
The first contains operators used in calculations,
CalculatorView will not be aware of any of the calculation logic,
but there are some bad ones that stand out, for example in this code:
anOperationPanelNames1 is the most terrible name in the code.
It would be good to optimize make the user interface a bit friendlier.
it will just know that each operation implements Operator,
for example using an Operator interface with an apply method.
and controlled by an action listener implemented inside the view,
the second is more about controlling the application,
It's good that you separated the engine, the view, and the main class that just sets up and runs everything.
Many of the method and variable names are quite good,
b is not great either, spelling out to button would make it a tad more readable, and not terribly long.
