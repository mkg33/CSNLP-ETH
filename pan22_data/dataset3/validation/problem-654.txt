I've set up an Outlook Address Book entry for the sender's email address, and in that Address Book entry I've given useful values for the Full Name, the File As, and the Display As fields.
The sending email address is of the form 0123456789@mms.att.net, and this is what Outlook 2010 displays for the sender's name.
This solution Show senderâ€™s e-mail address as a column in message view solves the problem for the message views in Outlook.
A friend has recently started sending me text messages (from a phone) that I receive as email.
If the e-mail address is always the same (0123456789@mms.att.net) you can create a contact and input the address, then save.
However, Outlook continues to show me only the email address for the sender when I get this kind of message.
Its based on a user defined form which has to be included for every view in Outlook.
I'd like to have the sender's actual name displayed instead.
How can I tell Outlook 2010 that when I get email from 0123456789@mms.att.net, it should be displayed as coming from, say, "Joe TextsTooMuch"?
I find for me I cannot use the solutions offered above at work so instead of "saving" the contact, i "create" it and then it shows me the name just how i want it.
On those messages, both the "From" and "Return-Path" fields contain only the sending email address.)
(That name is not part of the email header on the messages I get.
