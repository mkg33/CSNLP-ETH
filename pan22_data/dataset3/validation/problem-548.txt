It translates virtual memory adresses to actuall physical adresses.
The only performance delay will be if the OS decides to use them because it has filled all the real memory (RAM), in which case you will experience slowness as your system pages to disk.
If you over-allocate, then your system will behave as if it has more RAM, albeit with this performance penalty that disks are slower than actual RAM.
A big table can theoreticaly result in slower translation of the adresses and therefore in slower reading and writing speeds.
Aside from Virtual Memory being slower than RAM another issue is slower i/o speed to the hdd (which is often the bottleneck in performance anyway) and you run the risk of burning through a hdd much faster.
From what I understand, since windows 7 and later, they've gotten good at letting Windows determine the page file size, so I would check the box to do it automatically.
The memory management unit manages the virual memory.
Allocating extra virtual memory should not slow down boot up, because these page files (on most OSes; you didn't specify) are created once and then just sit there until they are used.
The bigger the virtual memory space, the bigger the adress table becomes in which is written, which virtual adress belongs to which physical adress.
