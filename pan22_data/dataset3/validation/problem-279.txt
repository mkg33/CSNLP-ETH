The only way the HDD will be detected is if I restart Windows completely.
I recently purchased a HDD and it works fine except if I go into sleep mode.
After searching I found a solution that worked, well for me at least!
So hook it to the Intel SATA ports and hit Intel's site to grab the latest Matrix Storage Manager/drivers (which have been renamed to the "Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver").
But happy its was a software fix rather than hardware failure.
Check this out from NewEgg's feedback section on the drive:
I have literally tried EVERYTHING to fix this, including:
But, you mention you upgraded the chipset drivers, but
Every time my computers comes out of sleep mode the HDD disappears completely.
The hard drive seems to be OK and not showing any bad sectors.
I have 4 Samsung SSD in RAID 0 and every time computer comes out of sleep one drive is missing and RAID unreadable.. A restart fixes this...
I also tried phoning my HDD's manufacturer (Hitachi) as well and they couldnt provide an answer.
My first thought would be to say it's the drive, as they are notoriously crappy drives.
Here's a direct link to v11.1.0.1006 of the Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver from March of this year.
That board also has two different SATA HDD controllers on it, an Intel Matrix Storage controller, and a JMicron.
After a uninstall there are no problems anymore and all disk ssd working after sleep.
