So, what I'm trying to do is to make notepads' icons always at the right.
Some explanations: I don't want notepads' window itself to be on the far right of the screen.
I don't care if all notepads I open will be moved to the right or just opened ones to be on the right, it doesn't matter, I just open 4 notepads and keep them until I turn off my computer, so I will never close them.
AFAIK the only way to move icons on taskbar is to drag them, so this is a AHK script that does the procedure programmatically:
This is my first question on this site, so please be respectful.
But, I want notepads always to be on the far right of the taskbar.
I'm using windows 8.1 and the latest version of AutoHotkey.
Is there a way to achieve this using autohotkey: I want some windows to be always at the top right of the taskbar no matter how many programs I opened.
So, if I for example open new programs, I want the icon to be automatically moved to the right, so that no icons be after notepads' icon.
I am sure there must be a way because AutoHotkey is very good software and has a lot of enhancements.
No, but instead I want just icon on the taskbar of notepad to be on the far right.
I searched on internet and I didn't find anything useful or similar.
So, No matter how many programs I open, I want on the taskbar always notepads to be on the far right.
