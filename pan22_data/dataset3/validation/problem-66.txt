For example, if you're using the prefork or worker MPMs then you can increase the MaxClients value.
The status vhost is bound to the localhost on your server.
And later forgot that it shouldn't be used for images.
You could try changing to a different MPM, which you can do in the configuration, or tweaking the parameters of your MPM.
Server load is not too high, is there a solution in apache configuration to solve this problem?
Sometimes, probably when load increase, it serves a blank page with 503 service unavailable.
However, unless you're running a really busy website, I'm surprised you're seeing 503 errors at all - is it possible that there's some really slow server-side code that's tying up Apache requests for far too long?
You can try setting up mod_status to get some insight into your server
If so, you might get more mileage improving that than just trying to work around it in Apache.
Upping the limit here on MaxConnPerIP (I set to 20) or removing altogether fixed my problem.
You can find information on the MPMs in the standard Apache documentation.
You can access it with a text mode browser like elinks, or ssh forward that port to your machine.
In the latter case, ThreadsPerChild might also be a useful configuration value to tweak.
If it mentions that you are our of worker processes then that could be your problem.
Seems that someone wanted to limit the use of the 'Downloads' folder.
So, when a page with 16 images on it, all from the Downloads folder, tried to load, the error log shows LOTS of 503 errors.
