Personal experience: Prevent Explorer from Freezing With Large Zip Files on Vista
What you should be even more worried about than the size of the file is having thumbnail-able files that are corrupt.
If the file is corrupt, then Explorer could all but freeze while trying to read it and generate a thumbnail.
This is mainly from offline/network shortcuts where the computer has to run off to all the places they link to, to check if they still exist and cache them so that when you want to use them they appear to be faster to access than they really are.
The only thing that might slow down things a lottle would be loading different icons (icons as in images), but with a semi-newer computer this shouldnt affect you at all.
If you have files for which Explorer is capable of generating a preview or metadata (either directly or through an installed handler/shell-extension), then it could cause the system to be slow since the desktop is always “visible” (even if it’s covered by windows, it still had to be loaded during boot).
Well, if you have a roaming (network) profile that includes your desktop it could make logon/logoff very painful...
For example, a very large video file will cause Explorer to slow down when first loading the desktop (afterwards, it should indeed be cached, so unless you move it around or modify it, it should not cause slow-downs due to re-reads).
This is particularly common with damaged/half-downloaded video files (look up “avi windows freeze”).
I always keep huge files (like dVD images to burn) on my desktop and it doesnt slow down at all.
If the file does not get a thumbnail or preview and is represented by a static icon, then the size is irrelevant; you could have a 50GB file and Explorer won’t even flinch because it doesn’t care.
Actually if you have a very large zipfile on the desktop, it can cause a lot of speed issues.
Shortcuts that don't resolve will then try to resolve each time you drag items/files over the top of them, even if you don't drop them on that shortcut, giving you a small amount of system lag each time.
If you have alot of shortcuts on your desktop it can impact performance on start up.
