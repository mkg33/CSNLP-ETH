If they are not the same, then they are possibly spying on you with a man-in-the-middle attack.
If they are the same, then it is not possible for them to read your encrypted conversations.
Whereby you can actually read MSN messages etc etc.. (however it might be encrypted recently)
If MSN not encrypted, the messages are easily spied.
Using a packet sniffer and a mirrored port on a core switch..
If anyone has ever played with NTOP you can clearly see which IP's/People are using which protocol..
If that is true, the person probably knows what they are doing and they do a simple manipulation of the pack and send it to you and act as a gateway.
The only way you can prevent it is using an encrypted connection, preferably an encryption that uses a pre-shared key.
I use XMPP (Jabber*) as my IM, and the client I use (Gajim*) warns me if the SSL certificate on the server is not what it was expecting.
So... if you network is secure and your PC is secure, where are you insinuating that they would manipulate your packets?
To take it a step further ( havent done this is a while )
* This might be possible with other clients or protocols, I just know for sure with these ones as that's what I use.
The art of watching is not tampering with your computer..
If you checked first at home then at work, you could see if the certificates are the same or not.
Hacker is able to spy messages anywhere on your message route.
