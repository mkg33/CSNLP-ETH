Perhaps you want a second mount just for monitoring?
On clients, I was thinking of making Monit simply look for a specific file in an NFS mount, and if it's accessible, all is well.
The general approach would be (assuming none of the Monit built-in rules are applicable)
On the server, I'd need a PID file, but I can't seem to find a way of getting that created with existing configuration files.
Problem is, if the NFS server does go down, file requests usually hang (perhaps even indefinitely, not sure).
As far as checking the mount goes, take a look at section 4.3.1 at http://nfs.sourceforge.net/nfs-howto/ar01s04.html#mounting_remote_dirs .
Any configuration examples would be greatly appreciated!
If you mount it with the 'soft' option you will get behavior that lets you monitor it, but this should not be used for the actual mount.
I'd like to monitor NFS mounts and the NFS server process using Monit.
Is there a way to do this, or has anyone monitored the server in a different way (checking if port 53 is active, etc).
I'd suspect that they are creating a pid file and sticking it somewhere for future restart or stop operations.
If not, it should be pretty simple to modify them to do so.
