Take for example my very nice Gigabit (note: it's not GigaBYTE) network here are work.
This can account for quite a bit of your available bandwidth.
Big "B" stands for "Byte", little "b" stands for "bit".
Just noting, the Powerline adapters use the little "b" in their spec, as is normal for network connection speed ratings.
The upper- or lower-case B makes a difference of a factor of 8.
Most internet connections and network connections are measured in "Mega-bits per second" while most file transfers are measured in "Mega-Bytes per second".
There are 8 "bits" in each "Byte", hence the factor of 8 thing.
First, make sure you note whether you're getting 3.5 MBps or 3.5 Mbps.
So, all that to say you're probably seeing an OK network speed.
Unless the house is very new, has incredibly good wiring, and there are no other electrical junctions, circuit breakers, or large appliance in the circuit between the devices, you're highly unlikely to get anywhere near 500Mpbs total throughput on your network.
Then there is network overhead: other things the network has to use to keep the connection working right.
Next, while the Powerline adapter may be capable of 500Mbps, what it actual gets is very very dependent on the quality of your home electrical wiring.
Transferring between two servers right next to each other on the same switch, I'm fortunate to be 100MBps actual throughput in file transfer speed, which is pretty good, because these servers are each connected to 4 Gigabit ports on that switch.
