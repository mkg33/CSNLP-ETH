(Even if innocent if it only downloads the twitter logo from twitters site).
Log in (non graphical) and check if no connections.
Almost anything could trigger those, including google and twitter.
Closing a TCP connection look like this (simplified):
That is not to say that you could not be infected somehow, but TIME_WAIT is a state where we once had a link but it is already closed and in the process of being cleaned up.
Do use common sense when clicking on items, do keep your OS and applications up to date
And if I visit a webpage with a link to facebook or twitter that can also open an connectoion to their site.
As for cloudfare: they are a Content delivery network (CND).
Next start your graphical environment (and possible auto starting applications).
All the connection which you show us are already closed.
Try monitoring to find one which is ESTABLISHED, then try to find out which app is using that connection.
If you used a webbrowser (and visited a webpage with the twitter-link icon in it) then this seems perfectly normal.
On windows I noticed the same when firefox was adding suggestions to my searches.
