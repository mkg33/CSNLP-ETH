PROBLEM 2: The same problem, except with the additional constraint that the circuit must pass through a given vertex of the graph.
Nor indeed do I work in the field (but it would still be advantageous as well as personally satisfying if I could get a note in some journal or other).
Is there a non-self-intersecting circuit having an average score greater than a given number?
I was wondering (a) if they're original (b) if so whom should I tell?
I am no expert, but I know the problem is well studied.
It sounds as though your first problem is the computation of the maximum cycle mean.
PROBLEM 1: A complete digraph has its edges labeled with numbers.
Problem 1 is an exercise in CLRS (2nd ed., page 617).
One paper on the subject that is not behind a paywall can be found here.
I don't have easy access to any standard texts that would help me out here.
The "average score" of a circuit (not necessarily a cycle) in the graph is defined as the sum of the numbers along the edges traversed divided by the number of edges in the circuit.
