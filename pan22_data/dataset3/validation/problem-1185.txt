But you will still be sharing Internet bandwidth with all users connected to the network.
A switch will allow you to use full network bandwidth when you are the only one using the bedroom Ethernet run.
You should buy a 5 port switch or at the very least a 5 port hub.
Note: Splitting CAT5 cables works because the protocol only utilizes four of the eight wires in a cable.
That said, you cannot chain splitters to get more drops.
You will hardly notice any slowdown of network speed if you add a person that is only surfing.
If another person adds a device to that switch then the bandwidth will be shared.
Given the resilience of data transmission, and the speed of the networking equipment these days, it shouldn't be an issue.
I've seen this implemented in enterprise environments with cubicles that weren't originally built out with dual data drops in each pod, but had the requirement introduced due to VOIP upgrades.
The splitter at the switch side will utilize two ports, and the splitter at the drop will provide access for up to two computers.
I highly doubt that any performance degradation will be noticeable by a human.
Given how sensitive VOIP can be, and that no issues were present with this solution, I have no reservation in recommending it for you.
