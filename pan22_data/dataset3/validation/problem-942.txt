Winrar has a better interface, and I believe for a while, it was easier to rar things when you were going to transfer it between OS than it was to zip.
Frequently I've had ZIP files become corrupt and not let me get anything out, with RARs I've been able to extract at least some of the data.
I don't think that rar is catching on very much, it always had a niche in some circles but that's all.
I have a suspicion that RAR files are more resistant to damage.
But if someone has some kind of numbers that could prove me right (or wrong) that would be great, so we can put some facts into this question.
And you don't need to use winrar to unpack either, 7zip takes care of most format if you are a windows user.
ZIP can store none of these except plain old simple DOS attributes (read-only, hidden, system).
Additionally RAR supports solid archiving (one compression dictionary for all files) which improves compression ratio if having a lot of small files in the archive.
There are also data redundancy and error correction techniques which can be used to fix broken archives (eg broken by transmission errors or bad sectors).
I think winrar was built to originally be universal or platform independent.
My personal guess of formats popularity would be something more like this:
This issue is resolved with later versions of the format, but you'll still see Windows display error messages when you try to create large archives, even if you're simply trying to compress gigabytes of plain text (which result in tiny files, comparatively).
One big advantage, outside of the users of cough certain classes of users cough, is that ZIP files have traditionally had size limitations -- notably no more than 4GB for the entire archive, and no more than 4GB for any given (uncompressed) file.
I don't think winzip was supported on linux machines until recently.
For instance you can tack a RAR file to the back of a jpg, and both the jpg, and RAR remain readable.
RAR can store file system attributes of NTFS (like streams, full acl permissions, modification/access/etc time, not sure about linux attributes as I prefer tar archives there) and thus makes it a nice complete backup tool with decent compression ability.
