With the eventual blessing & assistance from some of the companies involved, we actually used cracked software to regain some of them.
[I've had it happen to me, with important archived material.]
This is, of course, damned expensive :-) & still no absolute guarantee, the machine will eventually break.
The companies themselves could no longer authorise those particular versions.
This was an audio recording project we needed to get back to for remixing.
In our particular case, we could retrospectively create a VM [Windows XP in this case] however, even with the co-operation of all the companies involved in the project's creation, we still could not get all our relevant software re-authorised.
We partially succeeded - to the satisfaction of the client - but we had to use modern equivalents of some of our 'historic' plugins to try to recreate the original sounds.
Organisationally we came to the conclusion that very special projects need to have the actual machine they were created on also packed & stored alongside the data.
There's an additional issue... if the data is not also in a common format, .txt etc, then you may find when you come to view the unencrypted file in 10 years time, there's no current software that can read it.
The alternative idea of making a VM of that machine at the time also suffers from the same potential outcome - that nothing is capable of running that VM any more.
[I'm not giving any names, nor would I ordinarily condone such methods, but we did work in co-operation with the original companies to achieve this.]
Some of it relied on remote authorisation services that simply no longer exist - on occasion, neither did the originating company.
