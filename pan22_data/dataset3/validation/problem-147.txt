Dose it mean 80% from total core or something between 50% to 100% of total CPU CORE ?
we set the yarn.nodemanager.resource.cpu-vcores to 16
but what is the right value for - yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-vcores ?
This is strictly dependent on the type of workloads running in a cluster, but the general recommendation is that admins set it to be equal to the number of physical cores on the machine.
Requests higher than this won't take effect, and will get capped to this value.
yarn.nodemanager.resource.cpu-vcores: Set to the appropriate number in yarn-site.xml on all the nodes.
After making any setting changes, monitor your cluster/node CPU utilization for a while under load.
If you're not comfortable with that, you could set yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-vcores = 80% * (total CPU cores) * 2.
we have ambari cluster ( version 2.6 ) with 3 workers machine , and each worker machine have 16 CPU CORE ( see pic down ) , while each machine have 32G memory

yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-vcores: This is the maximum allocation for every container request at the Resource Manager, in terms of virtual CPU cores.
