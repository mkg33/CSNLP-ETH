Remot3.it is probably the best service to achieve what you require.
Should the Pi get an instruction it runs it and sends the result back to me via a POST, but uploading it to an SFTP would work too.
You should use TLS to encrypt the sensitive data stream.
The magic to connect in such networks is that connections to the pi are impossible to establish, because of the NAT network, but rather make the Pi connect a server.
Setup a VPN where every Pi connects to or use a HTTP site that the Pi periodicly GETs with instructions should you want to run something.
The second method is setting up a VPN server and make all your Pis connect to it when you're connected too you can easily SSH into the Pi.
Maybe it is worth to use Teamviewer (or something similar).

I went with a HTTP Server and the Pi polling it every 5 minutes for new instructions to run.
I had to do something similiar for a project, where either restricted Wlan or a 3G Stick was used to connect to the internet.
SSH to your Raspberry Pi behind a 3G USB stick modem
Install it on Raspberry Pi and you can access it via SSH from anywhere with internet.
