I'm completely aware that there may be queries that cannot be translated as is because MySQL perhaps does not support some things.
Question: can you give a rough hint about the expected "throughput" you think an expert could be capable of?
Please ignore the required testing of the whole application.
Hint: sense and purpose of such expressions has to be read out of the existing queries because at creation time no one bothered about documenting details of the implementation.
Management now wants to have outlined a migration draft.
Naturally these queries range from very simple INSERTs/SELECTs to rather complex ones with subqueries, multiple JOINs and expressions like that:
What do you think how much time is required to "translate" a single average query and simply manually test it in the target database?
The expert will be a person skilled with MySQL, Oracle and the applications.
Hints to and stories of failed migrations and disastrous problems are welcome.
I'm trying to figure out a rough estimate of time to spend for translating 500 queries.
Don't regard that we have to setup the target schema beforehand.
