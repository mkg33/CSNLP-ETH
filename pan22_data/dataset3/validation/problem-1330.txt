There is an RTS that is based around this concept.
Rez changes the difficulty of the level boss based on how well you did in that level.
Then the AI was setup to run laps all night long slowly tweaking the variables.
In both of the Left 4 Dead games by valve there is an AI director that adapts the level based on how the players behave.
"The Director places enemies and items in varying positions and quantities based upon each player's current situation, status, skill and location" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_4_Dead#AI_Director
However things like how hard to break, when to start, how hard to steer around opponents, when to target opponents vs. focus on driving were all setup as variables.
There is another game that used a similar technology but instead evolved custom weapons based the effectiveness and overall gameplay of the user.
Both of these games were developed as academic pursuits.
Each morning we'd look at the previous nights data, find the ones that had the best lap times/kills and then mutate that again.
Not exactly evolution in the sense you mentioned but still interesting:
The technology behind this is a mix between Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms, called NeuroEvolution.
There are several sports games that track player tendencies and then work to anticipate those choices, not sure if anyone has shipped adaptive AI in a shooter though.
But instead of enemies that evolve, the player trains units which are able to breed, adapt, and evolve.
Not real-time, nor a shooter, but when developing a car combat game we did use an evolutionary process to build the AI.
Enemy cars could see the edges of the track and locations of other vehicles.
This was all then baked into the game, so it didn't learn from playing against the player.
The end result was an AI that could be dumped into any track and be able to compete.
