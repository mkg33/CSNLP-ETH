One interesting note:  If I use SQL STUDIO 2005 from a Windows client machine, I can use the IP address to connect remotely.
Feel free to provide a full example connection string.
I can connect remotely using ODBC drivers from other OSes (e.g.
However, when I connect with the same credentials from a remote Windows machine using "SQL SERVER" as the driver I am told that the system cannot connect.
FYI, I can create an ODBC Data Source using the named instance on the machine actually running the SQL Server (but this is, of course, nothing special -- just proof that it isn't completely hosed).
Previously the solution was only needed to xfer data from SQL Server into a PostGRES or MySQL database on non-Windows machines (due to DBA preference).
I've verified that all of my settings are correct via SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO EXPRESS and SQL SERVER CONFIGURATION MANAGER.
However, now they also want to move the data from the legacy software to MySQL even on Windows.
Having a bit of an issue connecting to SQL SERVER remotely from Windows.
However, on the remote Windows machine, neither IP address nor named instance works.
From the non-windows machines I can use the IP address of the SQL Server just fine.
I've tried creating an ODBC Data Source and I get the same error:
Still, the whole reason I bring this up is because I need to use a software package I've written to connect to SQL Server remotely from Windows machines as well.
