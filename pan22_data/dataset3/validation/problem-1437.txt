Another example uses 27001-27003, 27020-22, 26050 etc.
When deploying a replica set or a sharded cluster (any situation with several mongod's really) - how does one know what port numbers to use?
As a student (so not production deployment) who is just using a single machine, what should I use?
For example, one example uses ports 27010 - 27014.
Up until now I have used all the port no's I've found in examples and tutorials, but there doesnt seem to be any obvious system or way to go about it.
Can more than 1 shardserver be using the same port?
(I am sure this is a naive question as this has not been asked about other places nor addressed in any of the mongodb books I have found, but I want to know.)
The only information I found on the docs of mongodb, was the one of the default ports.
The default ones are only 4 and I probably need atleast 8 mongod's running (for a small sharded cluster with replica sets).
Particularly on a toy system, it makes no practical difference what number port you choose; it works just as well with port 29589 as port 27017.
