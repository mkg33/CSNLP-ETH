Amazon, Gandi and Rackspace also run Xen without such networking problems.
The whole RAID + hypervisor issue needs careful consideration so that you really know what you are getting.
I have run Xen in production environments without any networking trouble.
I will revisit Xen once I have a new server box and see if the problem goes away on that.
As far as I know, Windows does not support paravirtualisation.
The VM hypervisor may manage RAID of the disk(s) and present a single disk view to the VM's.
I found for running Windows VMs that VMware ESXi seems to perform better than Xen.
ESXi will do this for supported hardware RAID controllers.
Also for the VM disks I am using LVM volumes and underneath that software RAID1.
I have now switched to OpenVZ as I'm purely using Linux VMs, and it works pretty good, even though it's technically not really virtualization.
If you want to be 100% sure an external box that is RAID but presents a single SATA / eSATA interface (and thus fools the hypervisor) is probably the most bulletproof.
If you want RAID support, there's a big "but how", because normally the VM will be accessing a large file on a drive somewhere.
I think you should investigate that before looking into more complex solutions.
