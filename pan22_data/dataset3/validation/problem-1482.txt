You also may not want throw in multiplicative factors or additive constants to tweak the data if it doesn't feel right with how you want to progress.
your fomula can be a fraction with things that you want to improve your chances in the numerator and things you want to decrease your chances in the denomenator(this can just be 1 if nothing decreases your chances)
First thing to consider is whether you want success chance to vary with or inversely too your factor for consideration(level, experience, defense, whatever)
If you have a theoretical maximum you could for instance use a logarithmic function to taper off towards some value
Our basic formula so far might look something like chance = strength/level
Finally since this is a percent chance you may want to try and normalize it and convert into a percent.
Depending on how you want things to scale you may want a different type of function.
For this we divide by your best possible values for chance and multiply by 100
This is a confusing, vague question but I'll give it a shot
Suppose we wnat your chance to recruit someone to go down with your level(so it gets more difficult) but to go up with your strength.
chance = 100 * (m * ln(strength/level) + k)/(m * ln(MAX_STRENGTH/MIN_LEVEL) + k)
