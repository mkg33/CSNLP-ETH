but im adding these parameters to any RXXX servers that running CentOS
Also try enabling or disabling HPET in your bios setup and/or grub.conf.
Have you installed all of the relevant Dell custom tools for that machine/OS combination?
dell do say they don't support centOS, i did thier DSET diagnostics and sent to them, they didnt see anything there.
Except for checking that the server's bios and bmc firmware are up to date, I'd contact Dell support and open a case.
They will probably say that CentOS is not a supported OS, but they do support RHEL5 if it was purchased as OEM, and if you can convince them that the kernel messages are hardware related, the case will be escalated to software support.
i dunno if dell solved that in the last firmwares updates.
the fact i've seen those weird OS messages in more than 1 server (one R410 and the other R710) makes me think that maybe there is a conflict problem between the OS and the server
Have a look at http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-16294 for a possible solution.

they even change the motherboard in 2 of our servers
To speed things up, ask them for the diagnostic tools they have for RHEL, run them, and send in the reports gathered.
it is just doesn't make any sense that it will happen on more than 1 server, and even after motherboard replacement
echo options bnx2 disable_msi=1 >> /etc/modprobe.conf
I think it's an IPMI issue where your machine is telling the OS something that it doesn't know how to deal with without the right drivers/tools installed.
The solution to hangs on RHEL5.3 running the Xen Kernel and the bnx2 driver is given as editing /etc/modprobe.conf by adding the line
