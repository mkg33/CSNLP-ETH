Sounds like GmDesk considering how it is described...
I used it all day every day for 2 years, so I know it exists :), but I can not find it.
They also have their own icon in the start bar, so they appear as a separate application.
It will only show the window, no address bar, bookmarks, etc.
I just repaved my box and now I'm looking for this thing again, and I had no idea it would be impossible to find.
It had it's own little red envelope icon, it was a windows app.
It was Chrome in a separate application that launched only gmail, stayed logged in really well, and "felt" like a gmail mail client, with the gmail interface.
I found it while looking through the "this is how you get your company to switch to gmail" documentation that Google provided.
I've spent literally 2 hours looking, searching, googling, etc.
A couple years ago when I switched from Outlook to Gmail (Google Apps), Google provided this awesome little standalone gmail client that was just a single-purpose Chrome install.
Look for "advanced tools" then scroll down to "Google Apps desktop features".
It's a link in the cpanel of your google apps domain.
To make an application shortcut, go to the website you want (in this case Gmail).
Then click on the wrench (options menu)->Tools->Create Application Shortcut.
It launched like a normal application, stayed updated when I updated Chrome.
This essentially tells Chrome to create a shortcut which will launch a browser window which will show the requested webpage.
