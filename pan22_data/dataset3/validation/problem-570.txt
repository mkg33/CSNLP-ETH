The second will work with any VoIP phone configured to process (and strip) the VLAN -- how it gets configured depends on the phone.
I have seen both of the following methods of switch interface configuration for supporting IP Phones.
This naturally allows the use of CDP for QoS (auto-qos).
The first method also works for Avaya phones - only they must have the proper DHCP option strings on the data vlan to know which voice vlan it should try and tag its traffic to afterwards.
The first is the Cisco Wayâ„¢ -- only works with cisco switches and cisco phones, and requires CDP (as that's how the phone gets the voice-vlan information.)
However the former is needed, if you want to use CDP to communicate the voice VLAN to the phone.
Can anyone provide a good pro or con of standardizing on either method or does it just come down to a matter of personal preference which one you should choose to implement?
[They're functionally identical at the ethernet level.]
(which adds spanning-tree portfast and sw mode access automatically when configuring ports)
I prefer the latter, as it allows easy addition of new VLAN and does not introduce new concepts.
Portfast allows the port to go directly into forwarding state when the interface is up - otherwise you're going to be waiting 45 seconds per port!
Otherwise normal behavior is that phone will first boot in data VLAN, then get instruction from DHCP to change VLAN, and then it'll boot again in voice VLAN.
I prefer the first method when using Cisco phones on Cisco switches.
