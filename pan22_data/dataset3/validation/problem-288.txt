The problem with the Unibody MacBooks is that to get to the keyboard you have to take everything else out of the body – hard drive, logic board, pretty much everything – as the only access to the internals is from the bottom of the body.
I have read that cleaning is best done with a high-percentage alcohol but the cleaned components have to be left to dry for at least 24 hours, preferably a few days.
I immediately turned it off and left it to dry out for about 24 hours and all appears to be well, with all the keys functional (I spilt it mainly over the right-side of the keyboard).
However to get rid of the imminent coffee smell I am going to disassemble it to clean up the keyboard.
Since I have to remove most of the internal components to get to the keyboard to clean it, but once this is done the cleaned parts have to be left to dry out, what is the best way to store the rest of the internal components for a few days in order that they don't get damaged?
I had a recent spillage of coffee on my MacBook (aluminium Unibody late-2008 model).
