Only negative is, remember to change the router's IP to something on the existing range or you will have to reset or manually change a machine address to be in its range in order to connect....
When you start using the WAN socket, you are basically using NAT to bridge the two networks together - you can use firewall / incoming rules to help, but it can just be a nightmare... You can always disable NAT, but what I wrote above is by far the easiest solution.
If the router has 3 or more standard ports, the easiest thing you can do is disable DHCP and then plug the two computers plus the uplink to the existing switch straight in to regular sockets.
But once it is set, you shouldn't need to connect.
Ok - getting confused by a few things (it's me, not you (headache!)!
The router is simply being used to add additional ports, but it is also acting as a full router - providing NAT, DHCP etc.
This will allow all computers to communicate just fine and they will appear to be on the same network.
Lastly, I would like to say that obviously, if you are doing anything data/network intensive you may want to upgrade your infrastructure as this link will obviously be a weak point in the network.
