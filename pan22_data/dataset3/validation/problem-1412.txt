in IPv4 you'd usually configure 192.168.1.0/24 as the prefix.
You probably already know the above stuff, but it's worth repeating because it's part of why your setup doesn't work.
(Maybe the Thomson doesn't have a DHCPv6-PD server at all?
Router stacking is not a big problem in IPv6; it could work if the Thomson was able to provide a prefix to the Archer – but it looks like that doesn't happen.
The Archer expects to be talking to your ISP on the WAN side, so it configures its own IP address via SLAAC and tries to obtain a prefix for your LAN using DHCPv6-PD.
Maybe it does, but the prefix it obtained from ISP is too small to sub-delegate any further?)
The main difference with IPv6, though, is that usually these prefixes are global and obtained from the ISP (often delegated via DHCPv6-PD).
(As for "radvd", it's the name of popular SLAAC server software for Linux.)
But it doesn't have the expected result because you connected the WAN port to another router – the Thomson modem isn't just a transparent modem, it's also a router and it already did the exact same thing as the Archer is trying to do.
"Site prefix" is simply the network address for your LAN – e.g.
In short, you're trying to stack two routers, each having its own LAN – Archer thinks it's talking directly to the ISP, but instead it's talking to the Thomson.
