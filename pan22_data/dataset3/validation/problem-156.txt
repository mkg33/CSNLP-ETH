It is written everywhere that ZFS is helpful even if you only have one physical device, because it will tell you about data corruption due to bit decay and such.
RAID with multiple ZFS-managed devices would still be better.
In other words, are there any notable benefits in running ZFS as a filesystem on a single physical device?
As others have mentioned, you can mitigate some of the corruption risk by using the zfs copies= feature.
But with ~4 years of ZFS experience, I've never actually encountered corrupted data.
I don't know that I'd run with a single physical disk, though.
If you set the COPIES property for a ZFS filesystem to a value higher than 1, then a file that is corrupt can be repaired because there is at least one more copy available.

I guess this depends on how the files gets corrupted...
So you would vastly reduce available disk space, but potentially be able to recover from a specific area of corruption.
Sure, I run ZFS in single device arrangements (atop block devices presented hardware RAID controllers, for instance).
