Here's what I've done in the past to make video-only trailers:
Replay with fixed timestep, recorded input and write every frame to a file - since you replay with fixed timestep it doesn't matter how long writing out a frame takes.
For recording your game footage, you could try CamStudio, which is free.
Make your game framerate independent, so you can set it to play with a fixed timestep.
The UI isn't intuitive, but if you spend some time to learn it, you'll also get your hands on a pretty good video editing tool.
After that things like After Effects come in - at least you'll have crisp source material.
Well, if it's framerate independent fraps might be less of a problem as well ;o) Games should be framerate independent anyhow!
You could try Windows Movie Maker, or iMovie if you have a Mac, but the best free video editor I've found is Blender, more widely known as a 3D modeling and animation tool.
As for making the actual trailer, you'll want some video editing software.
Edited to add: yeah, I know, making it framerate independent to play back at a fixed timestep is silly.
I find that it doesn't work with games in full screen mode though, so you'll want to run your game in a window.
That way your source footage is uncompressed and you can decide on quality later without having to sacrifice speed, or having glitches because of a capture program.
There are several expensive commercial options, but if you're looking for something free, your choice is more limited.
Easy way is just save every frame with fixed framerate.
