You may also need to add additional routes for the other RFC 1918 IP address ranges.
You could maybe use a couple of batch files to automate the adding and removing of these settings.
If you have access to the DHCP server on the local lan, try telling it not to issue you a default gateway, by removing the option altogether (not sure if this is possible on windows) or, as a horrible hack, make it issue the gateway address of your wireless interface.
As you mentioned, putting these manual routes in will probably cause you problems if you move your machine around a lot.
But I don't think this will work reliably as long as you keep using DHCP on both networks at the same time.
If I disable the ethernet NIC and run ipconfig /renew then I can use the wireless network, but obviously not the wired.
I have an environment where my work computer needs to be connected to two separate networks.
There's no way to solve this, you have to set something manually, those DHCP servers are just giving you conflicting informations, and this just doesn't work.
If I assign the IP address on the wired NIC manually then it works, however, the next time I plug in to a network anywhere else I will inevitably wonder what's wrong until I remember to change my settings, and then I will have to change them back again.
Looks like you're connecting to two different networks, both of which use DHCP and both of which are handling you a default gateway.
The lab network is just a single machine running Windows Server 2003, and is a domain controller w/ DHCP enabled.
I imagine I need to play with the ROUTE command more but I see that route add requires a destination network, and I want something more along the lines of "route everything on subnet 10.1.x.x through interface A, everything else through interface B."
My "lab" connection is via my ethernet NIC and I use wireless to connect to the outside world.
(I have a separate machine for connecting to the corporate network.)
Make sure the DHCP server does not defaults to the AD controller as a DNS server, remove the DNS server option altogether, or configure it to issue the DNS of your wireless interface too.
You should be able to add a static route for the 10.x.x.x network pointing to your ethernet interface and another 0.0.0.0/0 route pointing to your wireless.
It is also likely that DNS servers may cause problems.
You can specify which default gateway to use with this command:
With default settings I can hit web pages hosted on the wired network but not on the wireless.
The wireless network consists of a basic wireless router connected to a cable modem.
This configuration should allow things to route correctly though.
