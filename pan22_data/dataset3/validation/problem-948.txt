I am trying to move the a shape in front of another shape but it is not allowing me.
I ran into this issue myself and finally figured out how to fix this... select the two objects you want to alter the arrangement for and group them together.
Also, make sure the object is on a layer above the objects you're trying to bring it in front of.
CTRL-] will "Bring it Forward" one step at a time.
Use the Layers palette to unlock any items that you want to move.
There are any number of things that can cause this.
If two items are on different layers, then the item in the bottom layer can't be moved above the current one in that configuration.
Once they are grouped you can bring one of the objects to the 'front' and properly layer them as needed.
Click on the shape and try CTRL-SHIFT-] to "Bring to Front".
You can rearrange the layers, or put them on the same layer and rearrange from there, or create a new layer and put one of the items on that layer so it is above/below everything else.
I would like to know what could be preventing them from not moving in front of another.
