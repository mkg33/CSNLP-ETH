Need clarification regarding selecting a shared file system for our servers .
Also would like to know what other options are available to me.
To use GFS2, cluster services needs to be running as you pointed out.
But our requirement is that GFS2 should be mounted on all the hosts at the same time .
If GFS2 is the file system resource in our cluster , then GFS2 will be mounted on only one host at the same time since it is a HA cluster.
The shared space is from SAN and the servers will write to the shared file system at the same time.
My confusion here is that if I just run the cluster services without creating a cluster will I be able to configure and run GFS.
Looks like we will not be able to achieve this using GFS2.
One option for me is to select GFS , but I think that requires creating a cluster first and since it will be a HA cluster , I think only one server will be able to write to shared file system at the same time .
Also, if I use GFS , can I write to the GFS file system from two servers at the same time.
