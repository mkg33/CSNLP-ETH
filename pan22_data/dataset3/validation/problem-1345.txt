You could try several runs of speedtest.net to the nearest location to the cloud hosted system.
iperf is free/open source, runs on Windows and *NIX, supports TCP and UDP to test bandwidth, latency, jitter, packet loss, etc.
nmap can help with scanning the network to understand it better.
It sounds like Qcheck might be the tool for the job.
If you suspect that latency or packet loss is the reason for bad performance, you might just as well inspect the TCP control flow after a packet capture - if you see slow starts or retransmissions from your side, you know for sure.
Then set up ping plotter to ping the the cloud based system which will give you an idea of packet loss etc.

It has restrictions - it uses ICMP and cannot work end-to-end if the client uses a NAT router, but you should be able to get a bandwidth estimate.
dropped broadband, slow performance in general etc?
You want to analyze the paths being taken in a traceroute , you might find there is a dodgy provider in the middle somewhere dropping lots of packets or a sub-optimal path is being taken.
It's entirely possible they have other issues or a router between them and the remote system is faulty or badly set up.
If the performance is not constantly bad, you might need to use some kind of logging over an extended period of time.
