That makes a big difference in performance, since they also supply paravirtualized drivers for VGA, NIC, etc.
If you expect a lot of disk IO, I would recommend a good (but doesn't have to be expensive) RAID controller and at least two disks (mirrored).
VMware also supports directX 9 (to some degree) if you have recent openGL in the host.
It is free if you already have Windows 7 and runs like a charm.
However, the biggest limiting factor in VM performance is Disk IO.
Now you have two (or more) OS competing for Disk access which can slow things down for disk-IO intensive operations.
Only thing is the latest VMware version in portage is 6.5.
Also make sure you install the VMware tools in the guest.
If you go with this route, use RAID 0 (striping), much faster, because it writes and reads from to multiple disks simultaneously.
I used RAID 0 set up for many years and had been happy, but since I changed to SSD about an year ago, I never looked back!!
Make sure you enable VT-x on the BIOS, since many MB have it disabled by default.
You should invested in SSD (Solid State Drive), much much faster than RAID or anything else at the moment, because it's flash memory; instant access.
It will even map drives corresponding to the ones mapped on the host OS.
I use Gentoo, all compiled with gcc 4.x -march=core2 -mcx16 -O2 -pipe.
Also give the guest 2 CPU cores and at least 2 GB memory.
It can be even slower than a single drive solution, especially low budget ones, because they use CPU to process it.
buy a SSD disk for hundred bucks, move Win 7 and the image there, leave the original HDD for storing your data
You can bump up the resources allocated to the VM as well, since it is really just Microsoft's Virtual PC.
Also I want to point out that RAID can be complex to configure, and many disk manager do not support it.
It isn't the best and has it's limits, so if you plan on doing anything graphically intensive inside the VM then forget it.
Acctually, RAID 1 (mirroring) is for fault torrerance, not for speed.
