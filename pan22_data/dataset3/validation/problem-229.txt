I believe the trigger was disabling the 2 automatically created virtual network adapters before I’d actually opened up a VM.
I too had problems with VMNET0 not working as bridged after upgrading to Windows 10.
after installing VMWare Workstation on a new machine I came across the above error which I’d never seen before – there were no currently-bridged adapters available to bind my virtual network to.
If not, add the service and choose “VMware ridge Protocol” from the next dialogue box.
Removing Kaspersky Internet Security really works (Windows 8.1 + Kaspersky IS 15).
Uninstall your anti-virus software (in case of Kaspersky IS you can keep your license data), reboot, install VMWare Workstation - Profit!
This solved my problems after wasting several days and reading over 100 pages of "why bridged network does not work on VMWare".
Click on your network connections and choose “Open Network and Sharing Center”
After the repair was completed (yes, it showed network drivers being removed/installed) a reboot was required and all is now good.
I was able to resolve this by going to control panel, opening programs and features, right-clicking on VMWare Workstation and selecting the Repair option.
If there are no services to install then it is likely that your install is corrupted and a reinstallation
The long and short of it os that the bridging kernel driver is not running, probably due to the fact that the vmware bridge protocol is not installed on the physical network adapter(s).
Open the properties for your NIC and check whether youhave the VMWare Bridge protocol installed
