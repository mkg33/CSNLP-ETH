I am having trouble with making a Breakout Clone using JavaFX.
This makes it so that the ball changes it's Y velocity anytime it hits the paddle.
There's a few other solutions which may at times be adequate:
The ball bounces "off" the paddle but because it's still inside the paddle it bounces again back into, and again, and again.
The solution is to check the direction and only bounce the ball when it's moving toward the paddle.
I have almost everything working, but I have a problem with the physics of the ball after it bounces off of the paddle.
My code is here for anyone who is interested (it is all one class file, so I figured I would just use a pastebin).
To fix your issue just make it so that the ball's velocity is reversed ONLY when the velocity.y is greater than zero (the ball is moving downwards)
EDIT: If anyone needs a video of what is happening, I will post one.
Instead of working nice and clean after switching around x and y values, the ball will sometimes end up getting stuck inside the paddle and jittering back and forth very rapidly instead of bouncing off.
I used this question to get the physics working with the paddle, but only slightly.
I have tried getting a "future version" of the ball, by checking where it would be on the next frame, but it still ends up doing the same thing.
