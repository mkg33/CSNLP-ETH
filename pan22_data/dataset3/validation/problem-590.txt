You can always verify which are mirrors by a crude manner of comparing the data, for example:
(if you don't get any matches, you may need to increase skip=, as you're not skipping over RAID superblocksl; and if you get same md5sum for more than 2 disks, you may need to increase count=, as you're probably reading and m5summing zeros - to prevent that you should put some data on the raid first, otherwise they might be full of zeroes)
Now we know that sda/sdb is one mirror and sdc/sdd another one.
You may need (depending of your configuration) to adapt this file to reflect changes about our new array (/dev/md4).
Don't skip=0, because the begining of the disk contains different information.
The information there should help you determine which components are each others' mirror.
The "dd" command is reading one time (count=1) one Megabyte (bs=1M) at one Megabyte offset from the disk start (skip=1M).
At this time you have 4 raid 1 arrays with 2TB space on each,
Recent versions of mdadm show this right in the details of the array.
I had the same issue and after googling a while I didn't find a reliable answer.
--run options is usefull because some components are active in another array
NOTE: BE CAREFUL, IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 2 DRIVES WITH THE SAME CHECKSUM YOU ARE PROBABLY COMPARING EMPTY DISKSPACE, CHOOSE ANOTHER OFFSET (skip option).
I think you are talking about a real raid 10 array (1+0 striped mirroring)
It is possible this data is not available while the array is rebuilding though.
Run "mdadm --examine device" on each component device (i.e.
After giving it some thoughts, I figured that the mirrors have the same data and so we could compare some part of it.
In the above case, sdd and sdb can fail together without data loss.
As for the swapping wires around, you don't need to do that - mdadm should create raid with devices as specified on command line in mdadm --create, so you would just specify drives in different order on command line.
