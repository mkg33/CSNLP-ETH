A VPN on one computer should not have any impact on what other users in your house, behind your same firewall, do on the network.
Most likely, what they want is for there to be no other connections active on the computer you will be using for business.
It should have no other routes to the outside world other than through the corporate VPN.
You should not need to do any special configuration on your system to connect.
I know of the existence of programs that allow someone to access a computer remotely, and potentially even see the connections to the router, would putting the work computer on its own VPN protect against that?
In other words, it should not have any connectivity to any other computers or devices in your house.
To be 100% sure, however, any clarification questions should be asked of the folks in charge of the corporate network.
I have a computer in the house that is used for a work from home call center business.
The corporate people will need to tell you how you're needing to connect to the VPN.
Part of their contract is for nothing else to be connected to the network (wired or wifi) during work hours.
Ipsec is common and so is openVPN but they need to tell you what VPN method they're using.
Due to the fact that there are multiple people in this house that still wish to be able to use the internet during these hours we were considering various options for this.
