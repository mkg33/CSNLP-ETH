This will force all traffic to the IMAP server to pass through the wireless network.
Basically, you need to ping imap.googlemail.com to determine the GMail IMAP server IP address:
I used to have a similar issue at my old place of work.
If there is a simpler method I would definitely like to know about it!
I never found an ideal solution to it, but you can set up custom routes to make sure that gmail packets are passed via the wireless network.
This works fairly well in the short term, but the googlemail DNS entry is constantly changed so you will need to re-run the ping and route ADD steps a few times when it stops working but this will lessen over time.
You can test the configuration by running tracert imap.googlemail.com and you should see it go through the wireless gateway.
Say your wireless network default gateway is 192.188.1.254, type the following in a command prompt (which must be 'Run as administrator'):
The -p switch on the route ADD makes it a persistent route which remains after reboot.
You now need to create a route for this in your routing table based on your wireless network default gateway (you can find this by running ipconfig /all or in the network adapter details).
