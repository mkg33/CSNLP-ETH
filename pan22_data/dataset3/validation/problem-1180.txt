Problem: I cannot follow that path to actually get into mysql/bin folder
When you run the command mysql in terminal, essentially you are launching the executable located in the bin directory.
It is possible that you did not install it to /usr/local/mysql/bin.
Question: what is the easiest way to run the MySQL app from the terminal
If you want to go to your mysql/bin directory, try the following command:
If you would like to add the bin directory to your PATH, run the following command:
As long as the proper bin directory is in your PATH, the mysql command should be recognized everywhere.
Using some stackOverFlow suggestions I have used the following commands
The MySQL application binary files should be located in its bin directories.
Note that your PATH is build of several "paths" all separated by ":".
Ensure you have the proper bin directory path, this means finding the actual location of your MySQL installation.
You can even add that to your ~/.bashrc file so that you do not need to run the export command every time you open a new terminal.
