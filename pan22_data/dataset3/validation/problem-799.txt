I set up a kios-mode website like this once and one problem was RAM.
Now i'm experencing performance trouble with the Raspberry pi (B+).
Google Chrome, even though it's pretty big, tends to perform better with those kind of webpages than other smaller browsers, especially if those pages run for a longer time.
A web client using js is a convenient way of delivering content, but not optimal resource wise -- unless of course you are just the server.
Does somebody have tipps on how to improve the performance ?
I doubt that will make any difference in this case, but if you aren't using the RAM, it won't hurt.
It is a scenario that would benefit from multiple cores.
I also overclocked to 1GHZ and gave more ram to the graphics unit.
If you animate that graph, make sure the JavaScript used is not a big library but instead a clean, small script that uses RAM and CPU as efficiently as possible.
You should try hard to leave 50-100 MB+ free on the pi for the OS file cache, loosing that will hurt performance.
Animated charts tend to use CPU/GPU(depending on what kind of chart, how it is implemented and what kind of acceleration the browser supports), but the Script powering the chart could use a lot of RAM, in which case the performance would drop because of the low-memory situation, not the CPU.
If you've tested the same software on another computer and the browser is consuming all the cpu when this happens, then you've probably hit a limit.
You will find plenty of good advise on how to achieve this searching in your favorit search engine.
Of course another Computer with better specs would be the easier choice.
So I'm thinking about making a portable kiosk style webclient on raspberry pi with raspberrian.
The easiest solution, though not the prettiest, was to reload the whole browser or the browser tab so the leaked memory the JS engine produced was freed and could be reused.
The Raspberry Pi is performing pretty slow compared to other computers and depending on how much time you can spend on optimizing your page, it might be worth buying something like a CubieTruck.
Try to measure, what is really needed by the page.
I've a dashboard on the web and want to show it on a screen.
Or would it be a better choise to switch to an other SingleBoard Computer with more GPU / CPU / RAM ?
