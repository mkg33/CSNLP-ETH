2) Configure your circuit for inverted logic such that the closed switch grounds the input (logic 0 = closed logic 1 = open).
I am able to pick up most of the switch inputs - but not all...
That's to allow their use as I2C bus 1 (I2C requires pull-ups for SDA/SCL for proper bus operation).
I do have pull-down resistors installed on my breadboard... and if I move my testing switches to any of the other pins - I can see switch state on / off.
Is there anything else I can check / set / look out for?
GPIO 2 and 3 are special in that they have hard wired 1k8 pull-up resistors to 3V3 fitted on board.
Incidentally, it can be useful to know what language you're using.
I have relays which I want to control them with switch inputs...
you must use pull-down resistors less than about 1k6 in order to overcome these.
For some reason GPIO2 (pin3) and GPIO3 (pin5) always show high...
Hopefully this question isn't too silly on my part... but I am very new to this - so I am very likely missing something obvious :)
I've skipped the obvious questions like: Have you actually specifically configured them as inputs?
With GPIO2 and GPIO3, the switch always shows high - even when the switch is open...
