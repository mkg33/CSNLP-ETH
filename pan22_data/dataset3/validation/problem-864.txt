About a year ago when I was researching how to set up some drives using RAID on a PC I was planning to build, everyone said I would need to purchase a hardware RAID controller, the decent one was around $300 I believe.
I've been using onboard RAID on my motherboard (Intel P55 chipset) and I can tell you from experience with a handful of different intel-based motherboards that that it depends on how you intend to use it.
I'm looking into one for myself right now (replacing my motherboard-based controller) and cross-my-fingers that I can find one that won't have the same rebuild-issues that my Intel controller has.
And I can tell you for certain that you should avoid the Intel-based motherboard RAID solution.
When you get an operating system installed on your computer, these volumes show up as a harddrives.
The hardware-based RAID hides the underlying disks from the OS and you only see the volumes you built.
Whenever your PC bluescreens, reboots unexpectedly, or looses power (in a power outage) or you press the reset button, then the RAID array must rebuild itself entirely.
Then have another set of drives for data be a seperate RAID?
If you have 1-TB drives, this can take 6-8 hours sometimes of the computer acting VERY slow.
I've seen cards for PCI-E 1.0 x1, x4, x8 and others for PCI-E 2.0 x4 or x8.
Usually how RAID's work is you build a 'span' or 'volume' across your disks from some BIOS pre-boot menu system.
that detects and manages the devices and the cross talk to the host computer.
Most intelligent raid controllers are 8x PCIe gen 3 or higher.
The higher-end ones generally have more speed/features/support more drives.
In addition almost every raid above is pinned to the south bridge which depending on a shared max x4 PCIe buss that all of the built in devices share.
Having different RAID's depends on your raid controller.
A true hardware raid has it's own caching memory, Its own processor, and often boots itself into a Linux based o.s.
If it is POSSIBLE to do what question #3 ask, would it make a difference between using a hardware RAID controller or the motherboard built in RAID support?
If you use the Intel-based RAID solutions in a RAID-0 (stripe, no redundancy) it will probably be better, because there will be no rebuilding.
Thanks for any info on this, I have never used a RAID setup but have been dreaming of doing it for YEARS and it's about time I do it!
It's not hardware RAID, so uses a bit more CPU time than you'd expect.
RAID tends to work better when you use matching drives in any particle grouping -- here's a good tool to calculate the space you get from a particular RAID type & number/size of drives.
It is all about the bandwidth of the buss and direct access to memory and throughput from drive to drive.
The fake hardware raid listed above are nothing but masquerade jugglers with a driver engine.
Motherboard RAID controllers are still considered 'hardware' RAID solutions, and usually have dedicated silicon for that purpose.
I am planning on running my OS and all other programs from an SSD drive.
Now when I ask similar questions, people are saying all I will need is a motherboard that has built in RAID support.
And it gets even more complicated when looking for a RAID controller that is SSD-friendly (TRiM support) or has the latest SATA3 (6 gbps) connections and fits in your available slots.
If I have built in support for RAID but "acquire" a nice hardware RAID controller (Highpoint 3510 or Adaptec 5405 raid controller), would there be ANY benefit of using it instead of using the motherboard built in support?
If you're planning to use the onboard RAID to do RAID-5, give up now.
Example, have 2 SSD drives in RAID-0 for programs and OS and then have 3+ more spinning disk in RAID-10or even 2 in RAID-0 for data.
Sometimes this requires special drivers, but I believe that most RAID controllers are usually visible to the modern preinstall-phase of an OS (at least with Windows Vista & 7).
So my PC would have a set of drives for programs, applications that would be 1 RAID.
I will then have regualr old school spinning disk for all data (movies, music, photos, files).
You should note that the Intel RAID seems to be a variety of RAID called "hardware-accelerated".
If my motherboard has built in RAID support, should I use it instead of an aftermarket one?
