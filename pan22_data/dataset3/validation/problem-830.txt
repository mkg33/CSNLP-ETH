This MDA needs to be configured to return an SMTP 4xx status code whenever the mailboxes are unavailable, so the sender will retry later.
The frontend (mail reception) side can be any number and type of MXes.
As a temporary solution on your existing platform, you can set the option -o soft_bounce=yes on your delivery agent, but be warned that this will retry ALL rejected messages.
solved this with a script that will probably need improving:
Would it be easier to create a script that would check if the mail queue is too big and if it is restart postfix with a different config file, for example one that would make it only a backup mx server and relay mail to the other one.
I don't know if posfix even supports something like this, because if the domain is in my_destinations then the delivery is local and can't be through a remote system.
Now I would like postfix to try and send the emails to the secondary mail server if it can't do the delivery locally.
I have a problem when the mail server can't access the shared storage and then the emails start piling up in the mail queue.
The proper solution to such a quandary is to separate mail reception from delivery to mailboxes.
On a machine that has dependable connectivity to the backend mail stores, implement a mail delivery agent (MDA), which can be fed by a postfix instance, but may be any MDA that speaks SMTP or LMTP.
