With 6 drives, you could do that, although you net only half the capacity.
in that case I'd choose neither 5 or 6 but go with R10, yes you lose 1TB over R6 and 2TB over R5 but it'll be faster and can survive three disks going pop.
The only thing that I would add is test your workload under a failure condition.
We primarily use HP servers and HP storage and have had very few disk failures, so I'm happy with RAID5+hotspare or even just RAID5 on less critical systems.
Unfortunately, for some workloads -- especially write-heavy workloads, you may find that the performance hit is severe enough that you aren't buying much.
If I'm wrong and you can quickly recover your data then you may as well go R5 so you get the most available space.
I think RAID 5 vs. 6 (and vs. 10) comes down to performance and how much you trust the brand(s) of drives you use.
Lots of good advice here, particularly from Bart and Chopper3.
If your testing works out, great -- just don't forget to devise and test a backup strategy.
RAID 6 usually gets you a slight performance hit on write compared to RAID 5, since there are two parity stripes to be maintained.
If I'm right then presumably you would struggle to replace the data?
This one's easy - do you want more available disk space or the ability to survive disks failing - it's that simple.
Raid6 has more overhead, so raid5 as such will be faster on the same amount of drives.
On the other hand you might lose the advantage once a disk dies, and the rai5 rebuilds, you are at risk of losing the array if another drives dies during the rebuild.
Good answers, except that no-one has mentioned write performance.
So I'll make some wild assumptions - that you don't care about performance as they're 7.2's and that you do care about available space as they're 1TB disks - you don't mention what type of data you want to store but I'm going to assume it's either just video files or a combination of video and audio.
If I were going to move away from RAID5, I'd probably go with 10 (or 01) to get away from parity calculations altogether.
We haven't used 6, so I've never looked at any specs on just how fast a RAID6 array can be rebuilt vs. RAID5, but I assume 6 will take longer since it has to do 2 parity calculations, not just one.
In your case, you're running raid5 vs 6 on a different amount of spindles, so because of the extra spindle raid6 might be faster.
In theory, RAID6 saves you from a second drive failure while a first failed drive is being rebuilt, but you trade that off against the increased computations needed to generate 2 different parity stripes.
Nonetheless, most find it worthwhile to go with RAID 6.
People usually setup a RAID-5/RAID-6 to buy availability (ie.
