A log delay while using SSH could be also caused by blocked processes and/or cron-jobs misconfiguration, so check them also (i.e.
For example say you want to ssh to "glitch.somewhere.net", in your config file do something like:
One potential gotcha, is to make sure the permissions are set correctly so that ssh doesn't freak out.
Perhaps a bit silly but did you restart the ssh server after making the changes?
From here you can map the host to the numeric ip and it should bypass the DNS lookup altogether.
Also, I'd recommend running ssh in verbose mode (ssh -vvv) to make sure it is hanging where you think it is, but I suspect you're on the right trail.
It disables ipv6 which triggers a bug in some old systems (it's in the openssh faq).
When connecting from an external network, the process was quick, with a two, maybe three, second delay before the password prompt came up.
The key here is that the "HostName" is actually set to a numeric IP rather than a true hostname.
You can insert a ton of options here as describe in the ssh_config man page (man ssh_config).
I had similar problem logging into CentOS/Fedora servers from my Fedora laptop.
You should be able to create your own user level config file in ~/.ssh/config
Second question, are you able to connect to the servers externally or only through the VPN?
First questions, are you connecting via IP Addresses to the servers or via Domain names?
The likely cause of the delay is the VPN and connection speeds, not necessarily the result of an SSH connection.
However, connecting from the internal network, it would take 10-20 seconds to get to the password prompt.
Make sure that ~/.ssh/config permissions are read-only for group/others, write only for user.
