In our case, it was the motherboard watchdog which had a bad temperature sensor.
If it IS the power button, you might be able to unplug it from the motherboard to test it.
I don't see anything in your logs prior to switching to runlevel 0, so it sounds to me like the OS thinks it's being told to shut down correctly (ie.
You need to go further back in your logs, to where you see the shutdown process start and look a bit back from there.
As far as the power button is concerned, there should be a log about that, but you could try stopping acpid and see if it still shuts down.
Go into your motherboard management (BMC, IPMI, iLO, whatever) and check to see if there are any "events" in the logs.
I'm not sure what process would do that on CentOS.
The sensor kept insisting that the motherboard was overheating, so it shut the OS, and therefore the computer, down.
You may be able to see who's on the box if anyone, at the time it's going down.
It could be that the server is overheating and shutting down to protect itself.
Its interesting that it's all being logged as mail.
Another thing you might consider is if you have a remote access card that allows shutdowns.
When first powered on, the computer would run for 20 minutes or so before shutting down, but if you were persistant it would start the shutdown process almost before the OS boot was finished.
I'd expect some sort of error message to explain why it was shutdown.
The chances are slim you would have another admin shutting down your server but it never hurts to check.
You could see who was logged on to it at the time it was shutdown with "last".
The shutdown logs looked similar to yours, like someone had come along and run the 'shutdown' command somewhere.
