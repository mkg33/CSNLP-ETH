You could also install rsync on windows and just do it from there.
The problem is whenever I copy a file locally that is large... winscp tries to access it while it's still being copied.
As a result, it pops up an error saying that the file is in use and it can't copy a file... then it stops keeping directories in sync until someone clicks OK on the modal dialog box!!!
I've searched for an option and surprisingly it doesn't exist.
Since I am looking for a better solution anyway...
Files are never changed remotely so it really just needs to be a one way sync.
Been using it for a few years and it works great for backups and folder synchronizations.
I'd also like it to run as a service or at least an app that automatically enters the sync mode when started.
I was using a feature of winscp which can keep two directories in sync.
I don't care what service it uses for the file transfer part (FTP vs SCP... etc)
If it is the LAN, I might just mount the c$ share on the Linux box using cifs, and then just rsync:
The program that monitors for file changes must run on windows.
I have a windows box that I want to sync with a remote computer.
Changes on the windows box should be reflected on the remote computer.
The winscp solution would be adequate if it just continuously kept trying to copy the file instead of showing an error message.
If your Linux target has rsync on it, you can ssh into it, and use rsync to reverse-mirror your data to it.
