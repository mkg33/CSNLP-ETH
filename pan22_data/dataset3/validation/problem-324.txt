THe other issue I have seen, is if a client has a wired and wireless connection, and the connections are set to Bridge for some reason,  you can get all kinds of wierd IP duplications with some hardware based DHCP servers.
Is it possible to just shut off the Linksys temporarily?
Since the dhcp servers won't know who is given what, you might end up with duplicate IPs.
The issue was traced back to the consultant's laptop creating a second path in the network that messed with the processing of DHCP requests and acknowledgements.
I don't understand exactly why, but it caused issues with other devices plugged into the same power distribution unit.
So, if they are plugged into the same circuit, it is possible you might see something there, but I don't see where the physical location of a Wireless AP would affect a non-wireless device.
If they are both in the same broadcast domain, and are both running dhcp, then when clients request IP addresses you don't know which will answer.
If that is the case, maybe you have some IP conflicts.
Physically, the would not interfere with each other.
Are these hooked into the same network in anyway (wrt54g goes into the same switch as the router, or the router itself)?
My case was a SonicWall Firewall that I was using as a DHCP, and every time this one consultant was is in the office, I'd start getting IP conflict errors all over the network.
Physically located next to each other, I doubt it, unless the Linksys has some hardware malfunctioning in it.
