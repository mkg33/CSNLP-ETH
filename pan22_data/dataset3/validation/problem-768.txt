You would want to consider running a tool to test the various IO patterns (read/write; random/sequential; 8 kb - 1024 kb) depending on your SQL Server's edition and then comparing the results of an HDD with an SSD.
Unfortunately without knowing your usage patterns it is almost impossible to suggest an "ideal" solution.
The article lists various counters to monitor which will provide you with a baseline, from which you can then determine the performance gains if you changes your disks from HDD to SSD.
Plan to monitor these values on your old HDD system and then compare them to the values on your SSD system and compare the values.
SQL Server will read 64 kb of data (that's why you should format your disks with 64kb block size) and depending on the nature of the query in multiples of that: 64 kb, 128 kb, 256 kb, 512 kb and even 1024 kb (Enterprise Edition).
There is a good article on TechNet which is no longer being maintained, but which non-the-less give you an understanding of how IOPS and Disk Saturation can affect SQL Server Disk IO performance.
There is an old recommendation, that write latency for Transaction Log files should be between 1-5 ms (recommended 1 ms) and that read latency for Data files should be between 5-20 ms (recommended 10 ms).
I'm looking to buy an SSD for a SQL Server computer, what benchmarks should I be comparing?
The article goes on to explain that SQL Server will read in multiples of 64 kb which corresponds to an Extent (which itself is 8 x 8pages ; page = 8 kb) Understanding Pages and Extents
