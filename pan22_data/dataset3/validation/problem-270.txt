Vlan W for the wireless clients, that could be a bit more interesting, will you have one SSID for the whole building and guests or will it be multiple SSIDs with one per business?
You can use almost any addressing scheme that makes sense to you, as long as you can summarize each business' block of IPs.
Instead of assigning ranges by floor, assign a unique block for each business.
What would be best practice in terms of creating a network to satisfy three separate businesses located in one building?
Range for devices on first floor:  192.168.2.10-35
If a business spans more than one floor, your scheme will not work.
For a bit more complex business segregation you could also use vrf-lite, but that's a bit more complex though it still requires vlans on the switches and their respective SVIs.
Could I assign each interface on the router as follows:
Vlan Z for the printers, the SVI on the core switch will allow all required business to print to the few printers.
I would recommend not to use the router but instead use a Layer3 switch for better performance routing of the packets between the floor.
The businesses can span all floors that way and secure from each other.
Range for devices on first floor:  192.168.1.10-35
My current plan is a backbone from router which has 4 interfaces going to a switch on each floor located in the server room on each floor, a firewall would separate the router and switch ensuring that each business cant access another businesses devices.
Vlan X for Business 1, it's SVI on the core switch once again has an ACL as required.
Leave the router for the main connection to the ISP.
The building in question has three floors, each floor has 25 workstations and 2 printers.
Range for devices on ground floor: 192.168.0.10-35
Vlan 999 for switch/router/wireless/etc management, it's SVI can be created on the core switch and have an ACL in place to deny/allow access as required.
You can make use of Vlans and separate each business that way.
Vlan Y for Business 2, It's SVI on the core switch also has another ACL.
The building itself has only one external IP address.
The switches placed on each floor need only be access (Layer2) switches only.
