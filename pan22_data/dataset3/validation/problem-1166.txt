However, transferring a 500MB file achieves about 50MB/sec, while a 1GB file achieves about 25MB/sec.
Small files fit in the page cache, thus the test finishes before stuff is on disk.
When I transfer relatively small files (~100MB) between the two drives, I achieve transfer rates that are (better) than expected, in the 300-350MB/sec range.
For the 1 GB file, perhaps you're running into some side-effects of writeback resulting in less throughput than the disks ought to be able to handle.
Finally, when running the command pv < /disk1/output-large.dat > /disk2/test.dat, I initially see excellent transfer speeds, but then the rate drops off to the 1-10MB/sec range, periodically jumping (much) higher.
I know this is not an particularly useful measurement of disk performance as I'm going through pv, but it is consistent performance with my other tests.
You could try the dd options iflag=direct and oflag=direct to bypass the page cache and see how this affects the result.
You can set iflag or oflag to nocache, and retest, this way you'll see a raw, media based speed, not buffer-to-buffer speeds.
Here are some tests I ran that show this behavior:
I'm running a Ubuntu Server 11.04 (amd64) on a machine with 1.6Ghz dual-core CPU, 4GB RAM, and 2x250GB 7200 SATA drives (both 3.0Gb/s and newly formatted from a fresh install).
