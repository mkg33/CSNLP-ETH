This normally requires leaving macros enabled however you can self-sign the macro https://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/selfcert.htm
Change the "Line Spacing" setting to "Single" to create single spacing of lines within paragraphs.
Changing the settings to zero eliminates all spacing between paragraphs.
While replying, right click on the body of the message, go to paragraph and set your desired spacing.
Restart outlook and the new format should be applied to the replies.
Once complete, change macro security to "Notifications for digitally signed macros, all other macros disabled" or other setting you prefer and restart Outlook.
When the notification pops up, you can always allow from the publisher (you) and then you don't have to worry about this again (for this mail profile).
Right Click on the white empty space and click “Paragraph”

Change the "Before" and "After" settings to control the spacing between paragraphs.

The workaround for this to apply to all messages (replies and forwards) is a custom macro or an add-in (probably commercial).
Then click on the 'Set as Default' and select All documents.
Open a message window in Outlook if you haven't already done so.
Click the "Set As Default" button and then select "All Documents Based on the NormalEmail.dotm Template" to apply the new settings to all future messages.
Click inside the part of the window where you compose your messages.
You can find this by going to Outlook Options, then Mail, then Message Format (scroll almost to bottom).
I have Windows 8, and this problem seems to have only come up of late (I did not always have it ... and just found this thread while trying to fix it).
If you've already started a message, highlight the double-spaced message text.
The other answers only work for new messages as the behaviour for replies is to use the existing style.
It now appears to be resolved by UN-clicking "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for appearance of messages."
