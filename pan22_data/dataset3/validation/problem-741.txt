Finally note that you'll need to look at possible privacy issues
That breaks the network and I hope your access point does not even allow it.
Now I would like know that can we configure the Access points with the same MAC address so that when app connects to network it can easily identify which store it is in.
As you mentioned, existing libraries and services already do it this way.
(I don't think it is possible but its a random thought)
I think you should use the same SSIDs (customers automatically login in every store) and use unique MACs to identify the location/area the customer is in.
and local network has their local server which provides product details and other data to the device.
Note: We are using the MAC ID (BSSID) as they are unique and can be accessed easily using some smartphone APIs.
Learn and explore how others did this: Cisco's CMX, Euclid Analytics, Nordstrom.
we have to store all the MAC IDs of all the network equipment's to our DB for detection for that particular store.
All the different SSIDs would need to be configured on the devices that actually use the network for moving bytes.
I am working on a mobile application project which works on a local wireless network located on multiple different geographic locations(some supermarkets).
In that for detection of that particular store for further processing we require MAC ID of that WiFi router, this works fine for a distance, But on vertical mutiple floors lets say 5, its not feasible,So for that we are planning for Access Points to extend it,
Having different SSIDs for different locations would work, but would make the network difficult to use for other purposes than this app.
Your best approach is to store the MAC addresses of all the access points you want to detect.
List of consequtive SSIDs give you the most probable path through the store in 3D.
You must not assign the same MAC address to multiple access points.
