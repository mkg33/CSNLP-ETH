Discovery searches would work for specific things, but the manager would like to be able to browse.
From what I've seen, giving a user read-only permissions on a mailbox doesn't prevent the read/unread status from being modified.
Environment: Exchange 2010 SP1, Outlook 2010 Pro Plus

We have a manager that needs access to a user's live email box without that user knowing about it (suspected wrong doing).
Export the mailbox using the Export-Mailbox PowerShell cmdlet.
Obviously, we could give the manager Full Access permission in Exchange but if the manager accidentally clicks on an unread item or deletes something then it might give it away that they are accessing it.
You could then give the Manager access to the separate mailbox.
We could also just export the mailbox from Exchange, but that wouldn't give the manager any email that comes in after the export (without us continually re-exporting it).
: you're getting an "as is" snapshot of the mailbox, and the person performing the investigation can't be accused of tampering.
Of course, you should (yourself) ensure that your Employee Relations / Human Resources sanction such activities in your employment policy.
Does anyone have any ideas on how to accomplish this?
Also, we can't add the manager as a reviewer to the user's outlook (again, might give it away).
This method is consistent with what an auditor or the CID would require, i.e.
You should place a litigation hold on the user's mailbox.
If you don't want to give the user any rights to the live mailbox, you can setup a Transport rule to Bcc a separate mailbox for any incoming or outgoing mail for that user.
