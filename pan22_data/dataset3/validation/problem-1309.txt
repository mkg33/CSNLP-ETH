See http://www.ratsauce.co.uk/notablog/squid27setup.asp for my walkthrough of configuring SQUID.
You could install a proxy like Squid with authentification to access Internet website.
Use a group policy to set IE to use the proxy server.
A proxy server is the way to go, but only if the users authenticate against it: otherwise it would only report many client connections from the same host, and you wouldn't be able to identify the actual user.
You will have logs with username / url / size for each request and a lot of tools exist to make report base on these logs (look here, sarg is quite good).
I have used the SQUID open source web proxy to deal with this problem.
SQUID doesn't load the server much so you could install it on the terminal server.
You can use a proxy server with domain authentication (like ISA Server) and configure it for users to automatically authenticate against it; otherwise, you need a proxy with its own authentication and a different user account for each one of your users.
