If 100 Mb/s is fast enough for you even the lowest end 5505 is rated to pass traffic at 150Mb/s See here for the model comparison.
if system based firewall or access list on your switch/router is not an option, there is always a choice of a bridging firewall (google this term if needed) that you should be able to build with any *bsd/linux box these days.
Is running a software firewall on the database server acceptable to the client?
Possibly much less complex and if they already talk at 1GB, throughput isn't an issue.
Instead of proposing anoher device, i suggest to debug the problem with the Linksys.
We use Cisco ASA's (active/passive pairs) between our segments, they have worked well.
Second, it's a very basic trick and maybe you already tried that, but have you set EVERY network card involved (on the web server, on the db server, and both nics on the Linksys) to a fixed speed of 1000Mb/s / Full Duplex, instead of "Auto negotiation"?
In my experience it often caused troubles between this kind of device.
So, first of all, i'd disable every trace of bandwidth management on said firewall.
I had this problem once when QoS was the culprit for a lack of performance: the maximum available bandwidth was way below the real throughput available.
