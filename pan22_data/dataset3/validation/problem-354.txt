You've checked all the common candidates for key authentication failure; the next thing I'd be doing is bumping up the logging level on the server and checking out /var/log/auth.log to see what it's reporting differently for the two logins.
Your "authorized_keys" file can have a different name.
If PAM restrictions deny login for a particular account (and you've configured SSH to use PAM) you can get this sort of result, because for password auth the other PAM restrictions aren't checked until after you've entered the password.
Check permissions for the folder .ssh on the server you are trying to login.
If it's not overriden, check permissions for that file, and its directory: it must be readable for the user that you're logging into.
Another thing worth clarifying -- on the account where it asks for the password, if you enter the password does it work and allow you to login?
note that IIRC the documentation discourages this.
Ssh is fussy when it comes to broken permissions and public keys.
If you've got a weak key you'll have to upgrade the ssh packages on the client system and re-generate the keys for the user with the issue.
If so the user that doesn't work may have a weak key.
