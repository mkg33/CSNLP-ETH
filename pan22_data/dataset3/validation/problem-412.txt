There is a option to change the settings by editing the /boot/config.txt file.
Just suggesting it might be the monitor "zooming" to "enhance" your experience.
If you are using a TV, check your "picture" settings.
A few of the options in there are commented out and you can enable them by uncommenting.
Are there any RasPi firmware settings I could modify (or even simple packages I could separately download and install on each image) to automatically zoom the screen out to a more comfortable level?
This helped me with OpenELEC (back to 0% from -4%) but squared up Raspbian to a tile with black borders on the sides as well.
If you want to use the full screen as the output, then disable this overscan option.
On Samsung, say, choose "fit to screen", rather than an aspect ration.
To know further about the configurable options, please visit the following link.
At present every time I load up my RasPi via HDMI the edges of the screen are clipped, making it difficult to see what is being typed at the bottom of the screen and to read output on the left side.
It looks like you want to change the HDMI settings.
When you boot the RPI for the first time, there is an option of 'overscan' on the config screen.
I've been able to set 'Zoom' to -6% System > Settings > Appearance in OpenElec r11791 which is perfect, however I'm unsure how I can carry this over to other images.
