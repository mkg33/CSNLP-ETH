However, this method is problematic if using google apps sync (as I am).
If you organize your inbox by 'conversation' - you can then click on the SUBJECT (which is the highest level of the top of the conversation) and drag it to your folder.
Highlight all the messages by click the top one and shift clicking the bottom one.
I wish they'd implement a stand alone email client so that all the problems of being in a web browser are resolved).
I'm just relieved I finally got a solution - the problem almost drove me out of Outlook to Googles awful web interface (gmail concepts are fantastic - the UI is just awful.
If using Google Apps, the gmail server creates a sent mail label for every message.
2) There is a simpler way to move all messages in a conversation including those in sent and that's what I've just found.
If you then move the folder out of your cached mailbox to another location you won't see the sent items.
You can easily check whether you have succeeded (and this is dependent on your viewing preference) - if you can still see the lighter grey 'sent items' in place of the day/time stamp on each item, it is still in sent items.
If you view the thread as a conversation (which will show the received and sent items) and then bulk select each item (hold cntl down, click on each individually or hold shift down, click on first and last) then move you will get all the items to the folder.
Your sent messages will then be threaded in your inbox and you can just move the entire conversation to wherever you please.
It is smart enough to handle duplicates if you have Outlook set to copy all sent mail to Sent Items but not smart enough to handle the above rule, so you end up with duplicates of every sent message.
Be careful not to just select the 'Subject' as whilst you'll still see the sent items, they're still stored in the sent items folder.
When you drag it over, all parts of the conversation - including sent items, will move.
I've trawled the net for months for a solution and haven't seen this one anywhere.
This issue has driven me nuts for almost a year but today I finally figured out a work around after 4 hours of trying (yes I'm a bit ocd).
1) Create a rule to make a copy of every message that is sent in your inbox and then switch off saving of mail into "Sent Items".
If you now see the day/time stamp, you have succeeded
Sync then copies this to the sent items folder in Outlook.
