You can do a little research into how a transistor works to really understand it, but suffice it to say that the electricity is used to physically alter the atomic arrangement of part of the transistor to allow or block electron flow.
The fan will turn energy into moving air (=kinetic energy), however the moving air will be stopped by friction with the surrounding air, which will turn its kinetic energy into heat.
Your debate makes it sound like when electricity enters a light or motor, all of it is converted to light or kinetic energy, which is not the case.
If you put a computer system drawing 250 watts of power into a sealed room, the net result is the same as putting a 250 watt heater in the room.
Think about a simple electric circuit: a device (any device) attached to a battery.
In fact, all the power input ends up as heat eventually.
Yes yes, a CPU converts a lot of the electricity it absorbs into heat.
I wanted to respond to this comment above " Think about a simple electric circuit: a device (any device) attached to a battery.
Granted its “action” is not nearly as clear or obvious as movement or light, but the energy is still used to do something (and as Ian mentioned, a bunch of heat is created when you push atoms around).
It doesn’t stop at the device; some of it is used to do whatever it is the device does, but the rest continues through the wire, back to the battery (hence the closed circuit)."
However you’re missing the most basic principle of electronics.
An eariler respondent indicated almost everything ends up in heat.
It doesn’t stop at the device; some of it is used to do whatever it is the device does, but the rest continues through the wire, back to the battery (hence the closed circuit).
This comment is correct if we are talking about electrical current; it flows through the circuit (does work aka dissipates heat) and goes back to the battery (or power source).
Ian Boyd had a good start by pointing at a transistor, but did not follow it up with a tangible explanation of what exactly the electricity is used for (the “payoff” of the device, specifically as an analogy to the movement of a fan or light of an LED).
I’ve seen some SEM photos of a CPU gate in action which really helps to visualize things; if I can find one, I’ll add it.
Charge carriers come in through the mains, enter the PSU, then to the CPU where they do their work, create heat in the process, then the rest comes out, back to the PSU, and back out to the mains.
However, the original poster was referring to heat aka energy dissipated.
Heat/energy-dissipitated doesn't go back to the battery.
The same concept applies to light from the monitor etc.
Energy is consumed from the battery and dissipated entirely through heat in the CPU.
We all know that; that’s why we have such crazy cooling devices attached to the CPU now.
So the only logical answer to; How much is lost to heat?
What we consider to be waste heat is just disorganized data and not used for computation.
The current here is actually referring to the flow of electrons.
