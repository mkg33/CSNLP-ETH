The client can send the animation time for given action, which the server will use as a delay for the next turn.
Therefore the question remains: is there an existing solution for such class of problems?
That means the server sends info that a turn for given player has started and the time remaining to take an action.
All players are connected to a central server, which is authoritative.
This leads to problems when client-side animations are involved.
The player should be able to initiate the action within given time, and the next player show start his turn when any animations complete.
Obviously, the server has no notion of animations, but still needs to take them into account and start the next turn at proper time point.
Each action has an associated animation, which takes some time to complete.
The server will have a built-in delay after an action has been taken, before starting the next turn.
I'm working on a project which allows players to take actions in time-limited turns.
The server can simply broadcast action effects without any delay, and go to the next turn.
