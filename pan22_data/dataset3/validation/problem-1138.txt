In short: if you deal with personal data, better ask a lawyer/legal team.
FAR too often in the past said managers just use the user-directory as yet another file store.
We deal with special snowflakes during this interval.
As soon as an account like that gets disabled, anyone sending an appointment to the managed calendars will get unusual bounce messages.
We have pretty strict audit requirements, and are often asked to prove that a user was disabled, and when.
Deleting the account then and there...I'd say it's a matter of policy, but holding off does also have the benefit of "playing it safe" in case there's a mistake or a change of situation.
Two weeks elapse, during which time managers may throw data-retention flags.
This can take a couple of days for the desktop staff to negotiate with the owners of said calendars to get in and make the needed settings.
To deal with this we tend to disable the account when we're told they've left.
We do NOT put that email address on another mailbox if we can at all help it.
Managers complaining that said 20 year veteran of the department was the sole point of contact for a certain critical function, and therefore they need to keep the name around so critical mails don't get bounced, get their hands held.
Under the EU Data Protection Directive some member states (Poland in particular) require to never assign the same user ID to anybody else and at the same time, keep log of who and when had been granted access and when the access was revoked.
There can be a very big problem with deleting computer accounts: law.
We then set a hard delete-date for that account suitably far in the future to make sure that the world knows that Person A is no longer here.
Once they've gone for 6 months then we delete them.
Managers requesting access to emails are given a PST export of the mailbox, and not direct access.
Sometimes that 20 year veteran was the prime secretary support for an area, and therefore was a Delegate of pretty much everyone with a calendar that needs managing.
Move the disabled accounts to their own OU, and update the description with the date they've left (it also comes in handy for letting us disable people who disappear for a prolonged period of time and re-enable them when they come back).
The policy at the university I attended and worked-for is the following:
Managers requesting access to user-directory data are given a CD, not direct access.
Or there's ramification to simply deleting the data and suddenly someone needs access to certain files or information or mail, etc...but that can be handled through other means if you have policies in place to restore old information and whatnot.
The account is eventually rolled out no matter what once they are supposed to have graduated.
We have people that routinely withdraw then return anywhere from a week to six months later.
We changed our procedure instead so that the password is reset to something akin to gibberish and a note is placed into the description field detailing the situation so anyone else editing their user information would know it for reference.
We try to put an Out Of Office rule on the disabled mailbox stating that the person has left and please contact Person B instead.
Temporarily re-enabling the account stops the bounce messages while desktop staff go through and hand-remove the Delegates from all of the mailboxes.
Here at my place of Higher Ed we have a disable and retain for 2 weeks policy.
When we would disable the accounts we had some issue that I can't recall the nature of now...possibly email related?
For us it's just easier to keep parts of the account around for awhile until it's settled that it won't be needed anymore, reduces some effort and headache later on.
The account is then re-disabled and will be subject to the usual 2-week deletion.
At the end of two weeks accounts, user-directories, and mailboxes are purged.
This is one 'feature' of Exchange that I particularly don't like.
