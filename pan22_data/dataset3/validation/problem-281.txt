I tried installing the firefox add-on but it seems it's not compatible with Firefox 5 and I haven't managed to install an older version.
It just hangs there "Switching on..." and eventually times out (6 minutes).
I tried also from a Windows virtual machine using virtualbox, but the VM is so unbelievably slow that I had the time to type this whole message while waiting for Firefox to open and then waiting for logmein.com to load, so I don't think I'll be very productive in a VM.
Check out the FlashAid Firefox extension, which run a Flash plugin cleanup script that gets you the most current version that's most likely to work best and removed everything else (so there aren't collisions).
Since I'm pretty sure the web portion is Flash-based, this might help your issue.
I can log in without problem from my girlfriends laptop (she has Windows 7) but it won't work from my computer (Ubuntu 11.04).
I'm trying to access a remote computer running Windows XP having logmein installed on it.
It might be that logmein has issues with Firefox 5 for whatever arbitrary reason.
