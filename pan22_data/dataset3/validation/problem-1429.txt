Most likely it is an issue with the 128-bit encoding that Windows 7 uses.
You might have a problem with the Server and/or "Computer Browser" services, in which case just restarting those services will solve all your ills.
I had a similar problem, this made it work for me.
XP is not compatible with it and can't decode the folder contents.
Standard, I believe it's set not to be compatible with Windows XP computers...
Ran into the same problem, this solved the problem for me although it might be unsuitable for your environment.
In the Network Sharing Center on Windows 7, you need to put on the compatibility mode for Windows XP.
in the Home or Work profile, set it to allow computers with a lesser encoding to access the shared folders.
this enabled me to find the shared folder, use shared printer on win 7 machine but it does not appear on the list of machines in the Network Places
2) edit HOSTS file on the win XP machine, adding the ip address and the computer name
To solve this, in the Windows 7 computer under Network and Sharing Center.
