For example, when you run a 3D Game, the Nvidia will be used.
Attempted upgrade to anniversary edition v1607 but after update it was in 640x480 resolution because the Intel HD Graphics 520 stopped with error code 43.
There are two graphics chips in Lenovo E460 - the Intel HD Graphics 520 on the i7 CPU and an AMD Radeon R7 M360 which I think kicks in to drive the external HDMI monitor.
From what I've learned on mines (HD 4000 + Nvidia GeForce GT 650M), the Intel drives the internal and external displays (HDMI or VGA) by default.
The Lenovo and Intel sites list slightly earlier version.
My question is why didn't Windows 10 automatically update to these versions?
Drivers that Microsoft or laptop manufactures provide are usually the most stable and compatible drivers.
I'm not sure if AMD has something like that for theirs but you can install it and try.
This doesn't necessary mean the newest drivers which may have less compatibility overall for different types of hardware/software combination.
NOTE: one can't easily find the Intel 20.19.15.4483 driver online.
I've not yet re-tried the anniversary update yet...
The Nvidia software is able to do this automatically or you can actually select it per program basis.
I thought drivers were automatically updated but maybe I'm mistaken.
I then went sniffing around the existing driver versions.
I manually selected the "Update drivers" and the drivers updated to 20.19.15.4483 and 15.201.1101.0 respectively dated 2016.
On the restored system, the Intel and AMD drivers were at 20.19.15.4312 and 15.201.1101.0 dated 2015.

Attempted to update the driver in place but still didn't work so backed out to the earlier edition (nice feature).
You can do the same for the AMD part: http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/mobile?os=Windows%2010%20-%2064
So I can actually force the system to use the Nvidia card for Excel if I wanted to.
New Lenovo E460 running Windows 10 Pro v1511 for a few weeks.
However, I can download the newest, or even beta drivers, from Intel (for my HD 4000) directly from Intel's website.
For example, the last driver my laptop maker provided is dated 2014.
