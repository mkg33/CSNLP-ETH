Citrix Xenserver has workload balancer and Dynamic Memory management feature  with it,which can help in sharing resources.
Is there any kind of tool that makes vm to scale its resources when demand increases.
The hypervisor solution already in place will prioritize resources as they're requested.
You can assign more processors to your vm's then you have physical processors.
There isn't a way to dynamically add processors to a running vm.
As is, it sounds like you have a an application stack that doesn't scale horizontally.
Initially i would like to give every vm a single VCPU,but can scale up to 8 or more by taking cpu from other vms if they are not using it.
Is cloudstack and openstack designed for these kind of purpose or is that just a GUI to manage VMs.
This depends on your application's architecture and ability to scale.
Idle VMs are of a lower priority than more resource-intensive VM's.
CPU Load vary on each vm,somtimes first vm reaches nearly 100% CPU and others under 25% or even less.
Ideally, you could scale with nodes behind a load-balancer of some sort.
So is there a way in which vm can get cpu from other vms when they are not actually using it or utilization is under 25%.Same in the case of RAM also.
As far as adding virtual CPU's as needed, I don't think that will be possible in your setup.
Instead, you should take advantage of over-subscription.Assign the processors now.
i am having a server with 16 virtual core and 24G RAM,using Xen virtualization and ubuntu as dom0 Created 4 VMs (in para mode),each with different applications.
The hypervisor will split the load based on its own internal rules.
