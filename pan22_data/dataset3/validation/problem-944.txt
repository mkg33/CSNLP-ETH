Are there any possible solutions to get current time on commit with oracle ?
As other have asked, it would be helpful to know what business requirements need this functionality.
If I use default value sysdatetime on the column, it uses the current time at insert (which could be significantly different to commit time).
When inserting a row I want to make a column, equal to the current time on commit.
To get an approximate value (+/- 3sec or so) you may use ORA_ROWSCN
When you insert into the table you could set the effective date to something in the future after you know the commit will have occurred.
For example, if you need to know when a certain row started appearing in query results for other sessions (which would only occur on the commit, not the insert), then you could rename your table and add a column that is an effective date.
If I use an on insert trigger, it again uses the time at the insert - not the actual commit.
It has a big defect, it's commiting twice for the same records, so generating almost double redolog for each run.
You must define the table with ROWDEPENDENCIES to have the SCN stored for each row.
You could then create a view named the same as the original table and have it show only rows with effective dates less than sysdate.
