Unless you are proficient with VBA and Office programming, you are likely to struggle.
Maybe a spreadsheet though that is prone to locking issues.
The macro needs to make a connection to somewhere appropriate to store the information.
Having made a suitable connection, it is a matter of getting the data from the read receipt form object and adding a new record to your persistent store.
However, this does work, some while back I wrote a utility this way to record all my incoming and outgoing emails to a noSQL database (CouchDB) so that I could perform analytics on them.
An alternative approach, if you have access to a Linux based mail server, would be to forward all the read receipts to that server and use local scripting to update a database.
As you can see, this is something that goes rather a long way beyond a simple answer here in superuser so I'm not even attempting to provide some code I'm afraid.
First thing to note is that many enterprises turn off the ability to run VBA macro's in Outlook so you need to deal with that.
After that, it is possible to set up an action on incoming email that triggers a macro when the email "form" is a read receipt.
