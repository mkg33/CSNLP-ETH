I also switched the theme to a normal, non-aero theme without any transparency, but that didn't help either.
Look at here: How to disable the keyboard Windows key?
According to this post on Microsoft forums, you cannot De-register and reassign the shortcut keys associated with the Win key.
For example, I use OneNote a lot, but I don't like some of the keystrokes it uses.
For example, you could have it recognize Win+Left as Ctrl+Win+Left, which you would then assign to the task you wanted the original Win+Left to accomplish.
Now, I want to use the global hotkeys win+right, win+left, shift+win+right, etc., for something else, but find that they are already taken by Windows (I believe they are assigned globally to aero-snap or aero-something).
Basic key intercepts and assignments like that are fairly simple.
How can I disable those keys so I can assign them to something else?
I tried adding the NoWinKeys entry in the registry, and so disabled the win+r command, but it didn't work for those other keys!
To open a Quick Note (which I don't use) is Win+N, but to open OneNote itself (which I do use) is Win+Shift+N.
It has a Microsoft Fix it link to disable window key, and another link to enable window key.
The script to reassign Win+N to act as Win+Shift+N is as simple as this: #n::Send #N
I even used Ultimate Windows Tweaker to Disable Aero Shake feature and Disable Aero Snap feature and Disable Aero Peek too - but to no avail.
just download the setup and follow the instructions.
You can use AutoHotkey to intercept each Win+xxx command and reassign a different keystroke to it.
