One method I've used is to select all users within a particular OU.
You can then run this query with something like ldapsearch in Linux to get the mail attribute.
Yes, you can send an email to all users in an Exchange environment.
Right click an OU>select new>Query-Based Distribution Group.
A simple solution might be to mail-enable your Domain Users group, or some other Security group that is shared by all the users and then email that group.
It works for me as I have one OU that contains all of the staff members.
Dynamic Distribution Group are not an option in Exchange 2003
But if not you can find out what your GAL filter is by going to ‘Exchange System Manager’ and then ‘Recipients::All Global Address Lists::Default Global Address List::General Tab’.
Removing: (objectCategory=group)(objectCategory=publicFolder)(objectCategory=msExchDynamicDistributionList) from the query might get you only your human users.
There might be a simple microsoft way of doing this.
You can then modify this ldap query for an attribute that will give you your human only users.
Actually you can create a query based distribution group.
