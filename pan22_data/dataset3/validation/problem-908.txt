The percentage here refers to "percent transparent", so 0% transparent would be opaque.
Finally, set the opaque copy to Fade In, and the semi-transparent copy to Fade Out at the same time.
The effect should hopefully be what you're looking for:
Create a white square (no outline) with transparency of the fill set to an appropriate amount to make the object underneath it appear how you wish, then make that white square "Appear" when you need the transparency, and "Disappear" when you want the transparency to be removed.
Since adding an additional transparency animation (to remove transparency) didn't work for me on PowerPoint 2010, here is my solution.
Initially I would like all objects to be 50% transparent and fade to be fully opaque one by one.
Set the top copy to be ~50% transparent (if it's an autoshape then via Fill / Transparency, or if it's an image then via Color / Washout).
That is, first add the object (say an image), then add another copy of the same on top.
Basically the transparency animation under emphasis does the exact opposite of what I am trying to achieve, which makes an object transparent for emphasis (?).
It is possible to do this by adding a new transparency animation and setting the transparency "Amount" to 0% in the effect options as shown below.
How can I fade-in an object from being half-transparent to fully opaque?
The only way I found to do this was to add two copies of the object.
