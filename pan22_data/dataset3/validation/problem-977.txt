I searched for a solution, but I couldn't find anything.
I created a ".bat" file that contains command below:
You can also click on "Let Chrome run in background" to disable/un-check that option.
Right-click on the Chrome icon and click on "Exit" to stop all Chrome processes.
When Update runs, Windows defender use lot of resource (cpu) for scan the compressed files.
Solution for me was delete all tasks (update) from control panel>Task Scheduler>*
If anyone else is having the same problem, here is my solution.
One way to remove that from automatically running in background in startup is to Open Task Manager -> Startup and see if Chrome is present there.
I haven't tested if this change lasts after a reboot, but you can always stop Chrome completely this way.
After saving bat file, you need to create a shortcut of it and move that shortcut into startup folder.
To completely stop Chrome, go to your System Tray in the bottom right corner of the screen.
(You may need to click the up arrow to see the Chrome icon.)
