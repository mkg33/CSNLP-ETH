A slimy bad guy's name often has 's' noises in them, something that just makes them sound.... icky.
A good character name includes some onomatopoeia, where the name sounds like the item or its effect.
If your world is "generic scifi #35406" your weapons will be generic "Laser Gun."
For some game with fixed equipment, we used wikipedia to find good names: choose a category of animals or plants and select the good latin names you see.
You need a creative person who can name stuff for you.
But it does give the perception of a larger pool of names.
You can try to learn how to be a writer yourself, but if you aren't clever with words then you won't be clever at naming things.
A lazer gun probably has a 'z' sound or something similar.
We also used a lot of different mythologies for weapons and equipments.
Design how the universe your game takes place in works.
You can create lists and combine them to form new names.
But in a general direction, remember: If you want to make an apple pie, first you must create the universe.
This isn't much different than the generation of any other content.
Think of the stereotypical hero with a name like Dash Headstrong... that's a pretty blatant example, but it's the idea I'm trying to get across.
Pick one from each column to make a new gun name and type.
If English isn't your first language make up names in your native language and translate them or get someone to translate them.
Professional playwrights and writers and even designers often spend months on final decisions like this.
Additionally, it's really only the center column that is special, the other columns are just modifiers.
There's lot of good general advice in this thread, but in specific advice, for some solid base material in helping name weapons in a futuristic game, you can do a lot worse than to go buy a copy of GURPS Ultra-Tech and read it cover to cover.
The fastest way to make your game generic is to assume the world is our own world.
Most tools are simply designed to combine existing words.
Another possible option may be to look at a Wiki for the game Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.
It's the spiritual successor to Civ 2 and has seven distinct races that all have distinct sounds to their weaponry and culture.
For the names of things to feel right, they need to fit with the rest of your game.
This is easier than thinking up names in a vacuum.
This can make your job easier, but you would also have to ensure that it's a logical name that's produced.
Once you know that your game takes place in Sanctuary, a world torn apart by the endless battle of Godly Angels and horrific Demons, you can start to get a feel for what your weapons should be.
(An exception would be "electrolasers", which are a very-particular-to-GURPS way to avoid saying "phaser".)
Because it's intended as a genre sourcebook, much of what it contains is workups of well-established science fiction tropes that you need not concern yourself overmuch with stealing, as opposed to concepts specific to the GURPS system or any particular setting.
Like for big armors I think we used the elephant family (Proboscidea) and started browsing from there.
But as someone who comes from a theater/playwriting background, there's a real art to coming up with a good name.
