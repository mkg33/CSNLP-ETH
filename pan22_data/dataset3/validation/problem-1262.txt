Ideally I can also sort and filter like Apache Chainsaw allows for log4j and create my own fields based on regex  (i.e.
Once all of your log files are showing up in Chainsaw as separate tabs, you can collect all events from all tabs in a new tab by defining an expression which matches the events you'd like to see (see Help/Tutorial for documentation on expression syntax).
when there is an error, show me a field that only displays the URL of the error and the HTTP response / file + line that caused the error.
(I know sed awk grep and co, but a GUI is much easier to use and much faster to get started with)
I am developing a rails and scala application that uses MySQL, Redis, MongoDB and memcached on OSX.
It is rather annoying to always have 6 terminals open and go through the logs there, so I was wondering if there is a tool that allows me to launch the programs and then grab the stdout / log to socket (or logfile tail if that is the only output) and aggregate it with prefixes for the origin
If you can set up each of those systems to log to files, you can tail those logs from Chainsaw and aggregate the log entries into a single table.
You can add your own log files to the standard /Applications/Utilities/Console.app
