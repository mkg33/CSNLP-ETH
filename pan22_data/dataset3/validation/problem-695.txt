I am now using the default setting of 9 tags (selectable with super + 1-9), and it can be populated quiet easily.
Instead of virtual desktops you have so called "tags".
I generally have all of my 'distractions' in one desktop and work in the other - that way I can switch between the two easily but not be interrupted when I need to focus.
At home, I only have six desktops (its a dual-monitor setup, unlike work, so I need fewer), and only two of them are one-use-only (one for dealing with video, the other for dealing with images).
It can be fully controlled by keyboard, or you can use a mouse as well.
are started fully automatically (including positioning the windows) using shell scripts.
All the setups with multiple xterms, screen sessions, etc.
I usually use them to separate categories of tasks - all too often I find myself with an IM window open overtop of work, or e-mail popping up while I'm working on an assignment.
Each tag can be attached to multiple windows and you can display any number of tags at the same time.
It can tile your displayed windows to maximize the usage of screen space.
It's a lot like alt-tabbing, except the windows don't need to be coddled so much, and windows don't need to be related (from the program, or whatever) do be handled as a group.
For example, at work, I currently have twelve (assigned to alt-f1 through alt-f12).
Usually I have seperate tags for windows (one for the terminal, one for the browser, one for the mail client, one for the remote terminal, one for emacs etc...), and I can easily select new tags to display by using super+ctrl+1-9.
Version 3 even comes Lua integration, which gives you even more customizability.
These setups probably makes me certifiably insane.
It doesn't come with nice animations like compiz, but it really improves your efficiency.
I am using awesome wm, which takes the virtual desktop metaphor to a next level.
One is for general whatever, and the other three are for whatever projects I happen to be working on.
