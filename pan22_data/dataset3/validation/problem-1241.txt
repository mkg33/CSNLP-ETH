If so, turn it of and check again if songs stop early.
Then I dragged those two songs back into iTunes so they would be reinserted into the library.
These were songs purchased from the iTunes Store, not ripped.
I suspect that these files were corrupted (some meta-information iTunes and the iPod needs) in some way when you ran BPMer.
I deleted the songs from the library, leaving the files where they were (not putting them in the recycle bin).
Files older than 3 months ago, with bitrate 320kpbs doesn't have this problem, so something because of iTunes update afterward?
If the music was imported/ripped from an Audio CD, I would reimport/recreate the mp3 files from the original source.
If that is the case, you can change the stop time in the info box for each song.
of the affected files seemed to be cut off exactly at 3.58 mark.
in iTunes there is an option under preferences (tab 'playback') named 'Crossfade'
If you don't mind losing play counts and ratings, you can re-import your music.
I recently transferred my music to a new computer.
So I deleted them from the LIBRARY, then using audio converter I reformatted them into lower bitrate, and drag them back.
On a hunch, I wondered if something was corrupted in the iTunes library file (which is an XML file).
Maybe your files are not corrupted, and is this related to something completely different.
I have the same problem, and let me tell my solution before sharing my case's specifics.
Ctrl-click->Get Info->Options will show you if these have be changed, perhaps by BPMer.
It was 1) not checked, and 2) it was the correct time for when the song should have stopped.
I was confronted with this when I downloaded a new version of iTunes, even though the setting was not set before.
The same song played correctly to the end on another computer.
I had another song from the same album that also stopped short.
