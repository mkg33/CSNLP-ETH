On the free game, you might also look at how you can charge for it.
If you need something out there to impress these sellers that your company is a good risk, then the free game is going to valuable both as a audience builder AND a resume booster for the company.
A free PC game and a premium Xbox game wouldn't have much crossover.
For a pay game, you may be able to access additional avenues like Steam or other content sellers who will open your game up to a wider audience.
Different enough that you can't really share code or lots of audience between them.
Again, you want to ensure that the audience you build up from the free game would actually be likely and able to purchase your premium offering.
It depends a lot on what the two games are, your distribution channels, and what kind of time/money the team has available.
Making a free game is more appealing if you can enter it in an indie game competition and get free advertising for your website.
(EDIT: Tetrad's excellent answer points to some further ways to monetize the free game, making it both an audience builder and a revenue stream for future game development.)
Ideally, your two game ideas are somewhat similar: close themes, close genres, something.
If everyone involved is doing this as their job, you may need paying work out there now.
It might be better to have a demo of your main game out there instead of a free but unrelated game.
For a free PC game, you're main distribution is going to be your own website.
On the other hand, if the game design thing is a hobby outside of real work, you may be able to use advertising and donation revenue from a free game to help fund work on the premium game.
Just being a contestant gets you exposure beyond your own word of mouth.
On the premium game, could you spend time working on a free demo or shareware version of it?
An additional note on distribution, if you are eligible for any kind of contests or awards with either game, make sure to enter them.
Finally you have to honestly assess your own time.
You won't be "wasting time" making a free game first if you can reuse large chunks of the code and content as the basis for the premium new game.
Can you sell it as a beta on the promise of making it bigger and better in the future?
If you get fans based on your great free racing game, then release a fantasy RPG, there won't be much cross over in the audiences.
(the "Minecraft model" )  Can you sell a premium "HD" version of the free game later?
