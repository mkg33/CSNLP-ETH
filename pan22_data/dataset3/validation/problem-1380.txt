If you don't care about persistent boot configuration, you can simply grab this image and add -bios QEMU_EFI.fd on the command line.
If you do want persistent boot configuration, grab the other image, decompress it, create another empty 64MB file (call it params.bin) and add -pflash QEMU_EFI.img -pflash params.bin to the command line (in that order).
I also tried other machines, but the result remains the same:
Since this is a "generic" virtual platform, you need to specify amount of RAM (-M 1024) and processor model (-cpu cortex-a57) separately.
I am running a Windows machine and I want to emulate a Debian OS with arm64 architecture.
You are probably going to have to add a disk image somehow, but that bit is neither ARM nor firmware specific.
Secondly, unless you are booting a kernel directly, you will need some kind of firmware.
Oh, and the use of -cdrom and -hdX with qemu-system-aarch64 did not exist for -m virt until QEMU 2.3-2.4 somewhere.
You want qemu-system-aarch64, and probably -m virt.
Well, first of all, qemu-system-arm and kzm are both 32-bit.
What does this error message mean and how can I boot an arm architecture on my windows pc correctly?
