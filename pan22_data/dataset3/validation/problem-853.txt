Give me a break, you know you know no one reads past the initial dialogues.
Being a MUD, it had real time combat and was multiplayer.
Also, perhaps introduce a "threatened" mechanic where if one is in a dangerous position, they don't have the option of drinking a potion - or if they drink while "threatened", then they give the opponent a free attack.
These phrases could be weapon dependent, and could lend more of a sense of "in the middle of a changing combat".
Since you and your opponent could only act when your round time timer wasn't going, a good fighter would "stance dance".
As the fight starts you might let the user get in a punch to the head, but the 2nd attack will be blocked if it is another punch to the head.
There was also the concept of round time for your attacks.
Thus when the prompt for action appears, the exact phrase for the 'attack choice' and the phrase for the 'defense choice' will be different each time.
So you could say "The troll is swinging his club at your head..." and have the ... appear incrementally (say 0.5 seconds each).
This should also carry over into combat result descriptions - different random/changing descriptions for hits, misses, weapon types, and amounts of damage.
appears the user hasn't ducked then the club will hit them and you say "The club hit your head, you should have ducked!"
Being a text based system, I would suggest that instead of there being the exact same set of choices every time, that a pool of possible phrases be used for the attack and defense options.
You could be defensive, neutral or offensive, and would change stances during a fight.
The sequence would progress with multiple attack exchanges, and then a prompt with come back up and you could re-evaluate and change your tactics.
If you're going to do something innovative and able to stray from the traditional multi-option combat system.
I was working on a text-based game with a combat engine and I had the best results with system inspired by OGRE BATTLE, if you remember that title for the Super Nintendo.
Ensure that different attacks require different defences, so the player can't just type "block" every time and must instead react to the stimulus (the described attack).
This will also get the user to think a little about their attacks - having some kind of pattern recognition and having the character try to guess the next move would be good too, rather than just disallowing repetition.
Save potions at all cost, or use them at a % threshold?
One of the more memorable things was that it had stances.
Note: this may be long but I promise you it'll be worthwhile
Ultimately it comes down to what Pikalek is saying - it's only interesting if the choices require some thought.
Like you commanding a team, not participating yourself.
You'd have to time things based on your round time and theirs.
Persisting that learning tree would make for very interesting play too :)
however as any other system it has its own pros and cons, here is a list for your convenience:
I'd suggest a text based fighting system, which aren't many out there beside the MUDs (e.g: casting spells or attacks by typing their names), which is a great way to make the game way more engaging.
Do you want to target the enemy that will take the most damage?
Heavier weapons and armor (and less strength, or lack of a haste spell) meant longer round times.
** Read the whole post if you want to know what that is.
Do you want to target the enemies with the lowest health, or the highest?
This could be random, or it could always be based on some circumstance of your choosing.
The goal would be to be in offensive stance whenever you attacked, and to be in defensive stack whenever you got attacked.
Basically, you set the tactics for your team and the combat sequence becomes automatic for a set number of iterations.
In my case, you controlled a party of three and could face up to five enemies at a time.
So, you would have a round time of X seconds, and the thing you were fighting would have a round time of Y.
