Finally, you can go to the inconsistent environment page and choose to terminate it.
Once it's ready, you can go to the application page, click on the Actions button and then select SWAP URLs.
I solved this problem by going to Elastic Beanstack, my app was GRAY status/health, from the app overview I accessed the Actions button and Aborted the current operation.
As mentioned Blue Green deployment is the correct way out of it.
So I went to RDS and restored the database associated with my Elastic Bean environment.
In such cases, you need to go to the current environment page, click on the Actions button, select Clone Environment, and then wait for the clone environment to be created.
In my case I had first deleted the RDS instance, then tried deleting the Environment so Elastic Bean was looking for my RDS instance which it couldn't find.
Rebuilding environment worked for me, but it does incur a downtime if the application is already running.
Usually, there's no way to recover from an invalid state for a given environment.
in my case that happened because i start creating an RDS Database without waiting the creation of environment.
Then I got the health status GREEN, and managed to deploy.
