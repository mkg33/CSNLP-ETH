The access log only logs requests--many DoS attacks don't actually submit HTTP requests.
You can also use netstat to count the connections to port 80, something like this:
I know that this site is in Russian but it's so good and simple to use that I could not help recommending it for your problem.

You may get the data you're looking for from mod_log_forensic but I don't know if people would recommend using this module for day-to-day logging of requests.
How did you determine that your server is under attack?
No, these are requests which Apache sends back to itself to wakeup processes that are listening for new connections.
These are internal requests by the apache parent process to keep child processes alive and to generate new child processes when load dictates new children are required.
The access log represents logging of requests once processing is completed (whether successful or not).
I'm pretty sure this is because I'm using mod_rewrite, in short I'd like apache to log the pre-redirection request instead of the internally redirected request - does anyone know if this is possible?
I use ddosViewer viewer for checking through the logs though there are many of such programs in the web.
I wanted to find the IP which was used for the attack so naturally I went to the access.log only to find hundreds of lines of this:
Those connections haven't any relation with mod_rewrite, and you shouldn't worry about it.
You can probably get what you want out of the RewriteLog but that isn't normally something that would be included in the access log.
Depending upon the type of denial of service attack, you're not going to have much luck getting the IP from the access log.
My site recently came under a DOS attack, which seems to have been mostly fixed by installing mod-evasive (which is fine)
I would recommend to study your access log once again if you want to find attacker.
