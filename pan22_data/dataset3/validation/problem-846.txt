If the new install goes horribly wrong (hardware incompatability, etc), you can just re-apply your old system back from the backup (fast).
Of course, I backup files/folders of the partition which I uses as system drive before formatting it.
When you install the new operating system, mount the image as a virtual drive and start copying your documents, etc.
Vista did the same thing during full install - it leaves everything in place, except for tucking away those four folders out of the way.
If you do a full "clean" install of Windows 7, it will keep everything on your hard drive, except for:
Essentially, I run through each program installed on my system one at a time and note any possible customizations or specific data I need to recover when I do a fresh install.
Is there anything else that should be backed up off hard disk?
to make way for the new clean versions of those folders.
Beside that, encrypted files/folders in other partitions should be backed up in unencrypted format.
All your documents, files, torrents, downloads, e-mails, favorites, rss feeds, Skype conversations, Messenger pics, porn, and application data are stored in there.
I was wondering what files/folders should I backup off my hard disk before I reinstall Windows 7.
I use an older 160 GB SATA hard disk (internal) as backup drive and a newer 320 GB SATA hard disk for OS, and all other files.
I'm a big fan of imaging the whole hard drive so you can't forget anything.
But if you insist on backing something up to external storage, then backup
Some data is more difficult to recover from a backup so you should consider these ahead of time:
With Windows XP (the version that I was using last 8 years), I would need to reinstall XP once every 3/4 months.
