If you pick Nagios, you'll get the basic monitoring of server and network resources for free, and the following plugins should give you most of the rest of what you need:
as for getting your data about backups into zabbix, there are multiple possibilities.
check_file can monitor file size and contents (using regexes), so you can output your backup statistics to a file and monitor them.
This could be done easily with Circonus (http://circonus.com/).
for long term storage & trending one hour averages are computed.
We routinely import metrics like this with the Resmon XML DTD.
The one thing you won't get from Nagios is trending and graphing; I recommend looking at Munin for that, as it's simple to set up and, like Nagios, has stacks of contributed plugins.
setting custom (and very powerful) thresholds is easy - you can write any expression you like, so something like "notify me if more than 3 of these 5 servers did not have a successful backup" is possible.
check_file_ages_in_dirs will tell you whether the backup files exist; here's a blog post I wrote with some basic examples.
Disclosure: I have no commercial interest here, but the owner of The OpenNMS Group, the "commercial services, training and support organization" mentioned above is a friend of mine.
of course, general monitoring of operating systems, applications, snmp and ipmi devices and so on is possible.
extending is easy - any custom command that returns data can be used to gather, store and visualise that data.
For reference, I found on their wiki configuration info to monitor Symantec Backup Exec.
you can read it from files, you can launch custom commands, you can push it from the monitored machine using commandline utility zabbix_sender... and there might be few more possible approaches.
you can also use 6 different severity levels and escalations to achieve flexible notification and alerting.
Rather than writing your own monitoring solution, I strongly recommend that you use an existing tool so that all the basic monitoring and alerting functionality is already implemented.
zabbix has bunlded data storage and visualisation capabilities - all data is stored in a database, and to graph a single metric you do not need any configuration - you just get a graph for it "for free".
The package is completely open source, actively supported and regularly enhanced.
