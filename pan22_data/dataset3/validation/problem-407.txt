All of the kernel boot messages get written there.
The program helps users to print out their bootup messages.
I don't know why they call it the ring buffer, but it's basically a log buffer.
I am running a Debian system, and find the output of the dmesg command very helpful.
dmesg -n levelnumber allows you to change the level of seriousness a message must have to be sent to the consoles in addition to the buffer.
dmesg can also be used to clear the ring buffer itself, and also to change the level at which errors show up in console.
However, the dmesg command is seperate from syslog.
Sometimes, depending on the seriousness of a message, it will be sent to every console in addition to the ring buffer.
It is part of linux utils, and you can use it even if you do not have syslog.
Also, syslog is not available until late(r) in the boot process.
If you are running syslog then all, or most, of these messages will also probably be written to there as well.
Many of those messages go to syslog as well, but not all.
Technically speaking dmesg prints the kernel ring buffer to standard output.
Can somebody explain to me what information is output by the dmesg command?
