Is there any tool that will help me access second machine from the first?
Httptunnel and Httptunnel each let you set up one TCP connection (e.g., ssh) over HTTP.
you can try REALVNC and you can try VPN if you have the ports open
Its client is available on most desktop platforms; the server is available on most unixes.
One running behind an HTTP proxy which only allows http connections to internet.
Con: doesn't work if the proxy is too restrictive (e.g.
See http://www.nocrew.org/software/httptunnel.html or http://http-tunnel.sourceforge.net/
Con: some setup required; the overhead is noticeable in some applications; you need admin rights on both sides.
If you're only interested in ssh, you can tell it to operate via the proxy by using a program such as corkscrew.
(FTP, SSH everything else is not allowed through this network).
I can install any software on both these machines.
Pro: you can use any network protocol transparently (including UDP and streaming).
I would like do do things such as FTP transfer, remote login and so on.
Pro: little setup required; no special server-side setup; no connection overhead.
Second machine is a server with a public IP connected to internet.
Con: you need special software on the server side; expect noticeable overhead; ease of setup and use can vary.
