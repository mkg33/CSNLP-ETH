However, it seems like initdb, the recommended way to create a fresh stable database, actually creates an entire database cluster.
I have a PostgreSQL (9.1) database that somehow got corrupted (there were errors in the Write-Ahead Log) and I'm trying to dump, re-initialize, and restore it to get it back in a stable state.
This seems like a simple, easy question, but I'm very new to PostgreSQL administration and I'm not sure of the best way to do things.
the one I'm trying to restore), I could just connect to the cluster, drop that database, and recreate it from the dump.
But then I wouldn't be running initdb, and maybe that would leave my database cluster in some corrupted state.
Since there's only one user-created database in my cluster (i.e.
Is there a way to drop and restore the data contents of a cluster without deleting all of the logs and configuration settings?
Alternatively, is it OK to just drop and restore the database to recover it from corruption?
In order to run this command, I'd first have to drop my database cluster, but the documentation for the pg_dropcluster command says it removes "all files that belong to a given PostgreSQL cluster; that includes the data directory, the log file, and all configuration files."
