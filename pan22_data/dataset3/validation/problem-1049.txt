I had the same issue, but after removing the stderr redirect from my cron entry (2>@1), I saw aws: command not found in the log.
The default user in todays EC2 instances is ubuntu, and the root folder is that users home folder.
So all I did to fix this was ensure my crontab script also had the aws cli in its path.
But the user's .bash_profile doesn't get used when the user's crontab is executed (at least not in my environment anyway).
We all know that environment path variable $PATH has location of binaries.
When I run this command directly, it runs without any error.
Oddly, this is in fact the way that the AWS cli install documentation tells you to install it.
So below the shebang of my script, I now have PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH.
and add the path in $PATH of crontab by adding below line in the beginning of your script(after shebang).
Not the best, but I had to provide the config directly in my shell/bash script before the AWS client commands.
What you can do is, find the path of awscli binary.
It loops through lines in an include file, backs those paths up to S3, and dumps output to a log file.
I only added the line to the config file after I started seeing the error, thinking this might fix it (even though I'm pretty sure that's where AWS looks by default).
This is because the AWS cli was installed in the user's home folder and I had added a line to my user's .bash_profile to add the AWS cli path to the $PATH.
And it all looks good to me (like I said, it runs fine outside of CRON).
I can see the AWS config file at the specified location.
When I run it through CRON I get an "Unable to locate credentials" error in my output log.
