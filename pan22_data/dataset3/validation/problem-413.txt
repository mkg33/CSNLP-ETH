Blanks precede printable characters in common sorting algorithms.
If you are sorting on grouped rows, try un-grouping the rows and sorting again.
Sounds like those 43 rows each has a column with a leading blank.
The most common reason for data not sorting correctly is due to the leading space ahead of the text.
Go through and find the empty rows and delete them and then try and sort again.
There were no visible filters and it sorted correctly until I added two rows of data.
The text with leading space is sorted at the top in ascending and at the bottom in descending order sort.
Excel's sort function does not always work as expected when rows are grouped together.
I finally went to the Advanced filers dialog box and saw that a range had been entered at some point and it carried over, even though there was no remaining filter.
This just happened to me - sometimes when you cut and paste information there are additional blank rows in the data and when you sort it will only sort to the blank rows.
When I updated the range to include my two additional rows, it sorted correctly.
My data had been copied to a new worksheet, and then at some point copied again.
I believe if I copied the data to another worksheet without the headers, I might solve the problem.
I cannot clear the Advanced filter setting, so have learned to work with it as I add rows.
At that point, unless I sorted from elsewhere in the worksheet instead of from the headers, it missed two rows.
