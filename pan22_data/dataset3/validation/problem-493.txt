I have version Version 79.0.283.0 (Official build) canary (64-bit).
You can click to show outlines and drag to view like in Firefox.
Render view seems better with Tilt 3D than with native 3D View from Web Developer Tools :
Put edge://flags/ in the address bar and enable Developer Tools experiments.
Goto: Developer tool bar [Tool Box Options], "3D View" check box should now show under "Available Toolbox Buttons", make sure this is checked and you are good.
Install that version and rename it (on Mac) to something like firefox-45 to keep the updated version as well.

I know this question is in regards to FireFox, but you can get this feature in Chrome as well (Firefox won't let you insert JS as a bookmark):
You can now enable the 3D view and see the page in 3D and tilt it.
Open the developer tools and press Control+Shift+P and search Experiments and find Enable DOM 3D view.
Firefox 46.0 still can be downloaded here : https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/46.0/
A solution to this is to Google "Firefox 46 download"
Goto: Preferences->General Uncheck "Enable multi-process Firefox Developer Edition"
