The router acts as a wireless router and is linked to two other switches where all the computers in the organization are linked to.
The fiber link terminates on a switch which is then linked to the said router.
1.5 Mbps is nothing for any reasonably modern SOHO gateway box.
FWIW, I used to run Network Operations at a UK ISP.
(Sorry I cant edit the question since it was trasnferred from stack overflow)
Let them test their router and then you'll be able to compare.
Whenever a customer reported this sort of problem, it was almost always unwanted traffic that was the root cause.
If your network performance is that low, chances are some unknown traffic is saturating the link itself.
Most such boxes are designed to cope with 24 Mbps ADSL 2+ lines.
If their router doesn't solve the problem, you'll be able to move on and troubleshoot other pieces.
You're spending money on a serious internet connection, you should invest money in the hardware at your end of the line.
They're simply not designed to take heavy usage – and that means a lot of bandwidth.
However, considering your ISP is offering to let you test a router for a couple of weeks, you have nothing to lose.
It really depends on what specific router model you have, but I have used quite a few Linksys consumer routers (WRT54G, WRT54GL) and they can handle at least ~4Mbps bidirectional under heavy load.
A saturated link will also cause high ping times - by all means also post those ping results here too.
