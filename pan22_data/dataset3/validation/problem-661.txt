My coworkers and I totaly fail to see how this could happen.
They have a (security) limitation that prevents us from plugging a switch or router to any ethernet jack they have available.
They experienced major network failure and received logs of "duplicate ips, duplicate macs" and such and the whole plant came to a grinding halt.
Now since we do need more than one jack, we asked them to lift that restriction for us.
Of course we are accused of being responsible for this mess.
It also could have disrupted traffic, depending on which version of STP is in use, by causing an STP topology recalculation when you plugged in your switch.
We need to plug various devices on their internal network.
It  may very well have also introduced a switch loop in to their network.
This might not be a real question, my apologies, but I'm pretty sure it will make your doomsday scenario enjoyment work a little.
The only way it could be you or your co workers is:
Sounds like could have added problems mentioned already.
Depending on the STP configuration on your switch (if it was configured for STP) and their switches, it could have caused their switches to see your switch as the STP root bridge or as a designated bridge, disrupting the normal packet flow as implemented and designed by your client.
Do you have any idea of why a single switch can crash a whole network?
If they have the security you say they do this wouldnt not have happend by plugging in a switch.
My company act as a contractor for a larger company.
Can you attach link of switch or model you brought in?
I agree with a few of the answers: It could have been caused by STP.
Sounds like Spanning Tree perhaps - but if you literally just uplinked a switch using a single port, that isn't supposed to happen.
Otherwise I cannot see how you caused an entire network to fail.
When we arrived on site, we plugged a single switch (very basic stuff) to the jack, and then the whole world came to an end.
If the switch you plugged into the network was managed, and also happened to have same static IP address assigned to it as a backbone switch.
