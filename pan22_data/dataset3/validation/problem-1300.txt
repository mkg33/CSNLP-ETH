If PI is not a way to go, I am looking for a replacement system, any suggestions are welcome.
I need to achieve at least 15 frames per second with calculations taking place, 25 frames per second would be optimal.
Althrough the camera works correctly in 640x480 resolution, I am getting at most 3 FPS with a simple program that just captures the frames and does nothing with them (not even display them).
I currently own a Raspberry PI revision A coupled with Microsoft LifeCam VX-500.
PI is fully updated, using raspberian, newest opencv (downloaded week ago), compiled fine, just very slow.
When I apply LK optical flow calculations, one frame takes around 640ms to process.

I do not exactly know why this is so slow, on one hand a bunch of USB issues are reported with PI that would slow down frame grabbing from the camera, on the other hand many say the PI's CPU is simply too slow in floating point operations that it is practically unusable to do image processing.
I need to write a program that does some LK optical flow calculations on an USB webcam feed using OpenCV.
