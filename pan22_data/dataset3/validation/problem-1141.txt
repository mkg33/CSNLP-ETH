I can confirm that none of the above suggestions are working on my CentOS system at home either - not a single one.
It must be some configuration with my ISP, since I haven't got a configurable firewall at my end here.
Then I tried the same on a fresh Amazon instance running CentOS 6.4, and even with the default configuration, I can send mail without problems.
Have you modified your /etc/mail.rc to set the smtp address?
Installing complications like sendmail are NOT necessary for what Jakub is trying to do.
after which sending mail as described above works like a charm.
Postfix is on the right track, but unless gmail thinks you're at least remotely legit (e.g.
I usually wrap the sendEmail perl script with my own shell script for Gmail:

No setting up self signed certs are needed (as per sendmail) and in my experience, it just works!
A perl script that is easily configured to send via whatever SMTP server you can get to -- I use it to send through Gmail accounts all the time, but it also works for ordinary SMTP over TCP on port 25, etc.
You're not a spammer) getting your mail delivered is pretty unlikely.

Try installing postfix & set the mydestination in configuration file even it should work with sendmail.
The process is a bit involved to post here, but the simplest way I have found of achieving this (and having your mail delivered) is to set up postfix as a relay, using your own gmail account as a transport.
