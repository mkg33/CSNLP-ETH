It then restores your session from the image it saved to disk when you put it to sleep in the first place.
Next, I would update the drivers for your chipset from the chipset manufacturer.
There are also some settings you can play about with in Windows.
It sounds as though your computer is in fact failing to resume from sleep (which is why you're seeing the BIOS screen).
Go to "Control Panel", "Power Settings", Select "Change when the computer sleeps" from the left hand side box, then "Change Advanced Power Settings".
Make sure your Windows is patched to the latest service pack, and if that doesn't help try setting your BIOS options to try the various different ACPI sleep modes.
For your motherboard, the GigaByte GA-965P-DS4 rev 1.0, the latest BIOS version appears to be F12.
To determine your current BIOS version, drop to a command prompt and run wmic bios get smbiosbiosversion or you can run Get-WmiObject win32_bios in PowerShell or you can run msinfo32.exe and look at the BIOS Version/Date field.
(Win7 does much cleverer things with sleep than previous versions.)
Unfortunately suspend and resume have always been pretty flaky, and you may find that your motherboard just doesn't support it that well.
Sleep states often are flaky, and they are often improved in BIOS updates.
You can try turning off "USB settings" / "USB Selective Suspend", as your motherboard may not support this.
What is happening is that your computer tries to restore from sleep, fails, and then reboots itself.
Based on your mobo specs, that appears to be these drivers.
The first thing I would do is make sure your BIOS is up-to-date.
You could also try setting "Sleep" / "Allow hybrid sleep" to off, or if all else fails, set "Sleep" / "Sleep After" to never and "Sleep / Hibernate After" to an appropriate time, and force your machine to hibernate rather than sleep.
