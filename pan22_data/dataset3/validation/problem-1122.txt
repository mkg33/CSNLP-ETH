If your virtualized environment doesn't allow to mount that format natively,
I converted it to ISO, but unfortunately that breaks the copy-protection on the image, which the MDF format presumably retains, so I'm prevented from running the software after installation.
I have the CD-ROM image in MDF + MDS format (which I believe is an uncommon format created by Alcohol 120%).
It may be needed to copy even the read only sectors and to check if there were sectors of different (special) sizes...
The ideal solution here would be to somehow mount the image in its original format and map the drive so VirtualBox can mount it (it doesn't support MDF + MDS natively, clearly).
 If it doesn't work (and it is a working image), then we have to deduce that the hardware emulation layer introduced by the virtualization is not accurate enough to deal with Alchool 120% and the "special sectors"...(with a pun: Alcohol 120% run less then 100%).
you may try more way to convert the image in a more common format, e.g.
If the image was correctly done you can install Alchool 120% in the guest system (in the virtualized Windows XP) and mount your image from there.
If with one of the previous solutions the image works, it means that the image was correctly done and you can start to search for other program/options in order to convert it in a format that VirtualBox can mount.
You need to put particularly attention doing a byte for byte copy and not a simple copy of the data.
I'm trying to run an old piece of software in a VirtualBox VM running Windows XP.
The problem is retaining the copy-protection, held in the MDS file.
