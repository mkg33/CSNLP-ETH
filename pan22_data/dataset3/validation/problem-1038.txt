Be mindful that someone could always have a bad recommendation or have mal-intent.
This is generally for identification of the malware or problem, and then the forum users generally recommend third party tools to fix the identified problem.
I am trying to clean my computer but before i post there i just want to ask some approval from you guys.
Most of the tools on sites like this are information gathering tools, looking for installed applications, running applications and weird startup items.
If that is testament to Bleeping Computer's software then you should have no worries.
I am worried that they might install another malicious program in one of their links.
That said, BleepingComputer is reputable enough, but the advice is given by individuals.
I was lurking to this section http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/f/22/virus-trojan-spyware-and-malware-removal-logs/ and they always ask you to install something but users there seem to solve their problem with no issues.
I have used AdwCleaner from Bleeping Computer and it is a truly excellent piece of software, that has gotten rid of toolbar addons (such as the Babylon toolbar) that other software had failed to remove.
