If you manually point all the domains to localhost, and had the tunnel established, wouldn't:
You can then add domains that it should or shouldn't use the proxy for.
You can create a shortcut on your desktop that runs
You probably should look into using a VPN instead of just ssh for this problem.
Perhaps you could force the private domains to use the 'proxy' by simply editing the host configuration on your local system.
It's designed for exactly this purpose, but is, of course, specific to firefox.
For other services (for example vnc) you can use tsocks to make it use your tunnel.
Make sure that you configure the proxy settings in this new profile.
The request should still be for the same domain, so the proxy server should respond correctly.
The no-remote command allows you to run multiple instances of firefox simultaneously.
The easiest way would be to add the ssh command that connects to the server to your  ~/.bash_profile
Which is really a port forward to the internal network proxy server.
Try setting up SOCKS-proxy with ssh (ssh -D <portnumber> publicsshserver.university.fi) and configure your browser to use 127.0.0.1 and <portnumber> as proxy.
This way, whenever you want to any university resource, just open this alternate firefox profile.
Then create a separate profile in firefox that uses this proxy setting by doing
FoxyProxy (http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/) solves the automatic proxy selection problem.
