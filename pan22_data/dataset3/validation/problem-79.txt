Company storage of mp3s is not a good idea even if you don't have any SLA on the data and it could disappear at any time since it could lead to legal issues (can you be certain that NONE of the mp3s are copyrighted?).
Windows 2003 has File Server Resource Manager that allows you to set quotas, file screens, etc...
Assuming that your client computers have plenty of drive space, use Group Policy to redirect the My Music profile folder to a local path (such as its default location, or something like "C:\Local\Music".
No one seems to be mentioning the legal side of things here.
Whatever you do, you are going to need management support for it.
IT can rarely set its own policies without this support (especially if your policy affects management - like if they are also storing mp3s on the server...)  Users generally get upset when things stop working the way they always have as well so you are going to need to communicate with them BEFORE you make any changes too.
If they're downloading it on their company PC, you have some bigger issues.
I LMAO when I read "A company that bans me from storing music on my work PC sucks.
If they're plugging in their portable MP3 players, that has to stop: there's no reason why they need to setup iTunes or whatever and have their personal library on their own machines.
Depending on your file server, you may be able to exclude certain file types from being stored at all, and you can usually exclude certain file types from backups as well depending on the backup software.
Regardless, you'll need to get buy-in/support from senior management, but I've had no issues implementing the following policy on my customer's offices:
Helpdesk tickets regarding music will be openly mocked.
For whatever my 2 cents is worth, I definitely get both of the arguments being made here.
Again, this is a small chance, but it is still there.
Any CIO worth his/her salt will ban MP3 storage on corporate PCs or servers.
Your IT dept cannot afford to manage it - your company cannot afford to moderate/police it - even acknowledging its existence is dodgy.
I've tried to split the difference in my own environment -- I redirect their My Music folders to a local share, and I make it clear that while users are more than welcome to listen to (and store) music on their workstations, this is an activity that we ALLOW, not SUPPORT.
There are huge copyright infringement issues surrounding storing MP3s on corporate servers.
Once this setting is in effect, users won't have to do anything special to get Windows Media Player or iTunes to rip to that local directory.
