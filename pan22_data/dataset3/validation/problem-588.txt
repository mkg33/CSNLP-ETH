So putting /etc/alternatives into the path might fix the actions package manager that is broken in this sense.
Now /usr/bin/some-binary can be a symlink to /etc/alternatives/some-binary and update-alternatives However, a distribution's package manager might assume it has control over /usr/bin/some-binary.
If this situation arises, my approach would be to manually repair the problem caused by the package manager, where it places an actual binary instead of a symlink, and then file a bug asking for it to be fixed.
Any distribution that implements alternatives and also provides a package manager, should provide a package manager that respects alternatives, otherwise it would be considered broken.
Is the best solution to have /etc/alternatives early in the PATH environment variable?
/etc/alternatives is intended to provide a facility to conveniently install and use multiple versions of a single software package (e.g.
It is difficult to see if this would have unintended consequences in this type of environment.
Are there alternatives (sic) for managing this tension in a way that means it is easy to choose the version you want without breaking the ability to use the versions available package manager?
