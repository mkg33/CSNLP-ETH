All SSDs will suffer from this problem at one point or another unless HyperFast is used to optimize the solid state drive.
However, this is useless on an SSD which has constant access time for any sector.
SSDs can only write so many times to the drive as they have a finite number of writes that they can perform.
SSDs start out really fast and then quickly start to lose their speed and over time become subject to corruption.
Small free spaces scattered across the SSD cause the file system to write a file in fragmented pieces to those small available free spaces.
This doubles the wear and tear and can cause major issues.
They therefore recommend using their product called Diskeeper.Accoding to the company:
The principle issue is write speed degradation due to free space fragmentation.
Diskeeper with HyperFast keeps your system running as fast as when you purchased it, by optimizing the free space on your SSD.
As the SSD approaches its limit, more fragmentation and write errors occur, causing SSD slows.
You will not get any performance increase by defragging an SSD, but it will have an impact on data-recovery.
Manually running a full defragmentation is something you should not do, but if you have volume snapshots are enabled, windows 8/10 will defrag the SSD once per month:
Therefore, like I said at the start, it depends on what is stored on the drive, how important the files are, how likely you are to need to perform data-recovery, and how frequently the files are changed (frequent deletions and copies will lead to fragmentation faster as well as eat up more write cycles).
By doing so, it degrades write performance by as much as 80% to the solid state drive.
Defragmenting just causes extra writes on a disk (SSDs have a limited number of writes due to their design)
Due to the doubling effect of needing to read and erase before it can write again, SSDs undergo twice as much use.
Defragging will lower the live expectancy of your drive by performing unnecessary passes over a drive with a limited life-span.
Defragmenting puts your sectors near each other which is helpful for a disk that spins around.
SSDs require that old data be erased before new data is written over it, rather than just writing over the old information like with hard drives.
Write performance decreases proportionately as free space fragmentation increases.
Flash drives, memory cards, and SSDs use tricks like wear-leveling and TRIM to extend the life of the media, but defragmentation tends to cause a large number of writes, which will cause it wear out all the faster.
On the one hand, flash-memory has a limited number of write cycles, so doing a lot of writing will eventually wear it out.
so keeping your files in a contiguous state (e.g., by defragmenting) will greatly increase the chances of recovery.
The HyperFast feature, included with Diskeeper 12 specifically solves these issues by intelligently eliminating performanceâ€“degrading free space fragmentation which can promote random rather than the more efficient sequential writes to occur.
On the other hand, fragmented files are infinitely harder to recover when accidentally deleted, hit by a virus, etc.
This technology along with the IntelliWrite Technology promotes the more efficient and beneficial sequential writes to occur rather than random writes.
