So, if we take that product number to the HP PartsSurfer we find that the main board is only listed as a System board (motherboard) - UMA architecture, which isn't really helpful and is a very strong indication it is customised and/or proprietary to HP, but we can see that the motherboards HP Part number is 516294-001.
This still isn't really helpful in general; probably the only thing it really helps with is if you happen to need a replacement for the motherboard, but such is the nature of the custom/proprietary motherboards used in laptops / netbooks / etc.
