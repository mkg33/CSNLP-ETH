Link Local addresses are purely used in an ad-hoc way for computers to network without a network infrastructure.
Check if "Client Isolation" is turned on in the wireless router (if it has this option).
hope i'm wrong because then I could get higher speeds.
The only way I know of to make it work is to either have an IPv6 enabled DHCP server, use other link-local compatible devices or manually assigning an IPv6 address.
The local network / internet access is complicated.
This option is also sometimes called "AP isolation" or "Privacy Separator".
at the moment limited to 54mbs when router is providing 300mbs
In addition, to rule out anything silly / restrictions on your machine (I have seen a few drivers cause this), you can check it hasn't been disabled in your registry:
Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters\ and look for an entry called DisabledComponents and make sure it is a 32-bit Dword and set to 0.
Since IPv6 just isn't used much at all on the desktop in the PC world, a lot of manufacturers haven't done the testing they need to in this area.
Many wireless routers automatically block all contact between wireless units.
but many threads on the web seem to claim that IP6 only works on  a LAN and not a WLAN.
If you do not see it, try creating it in order to reset restrictions, then restart your computer.
Based on your comments, I think the reason you are seeing the message you are seeing is because there are no other Windows Vista or Windows 7 machines on your network (or any other machines designed for link local IPv6).
If it's already up to date, it could be a regression and you can actually try an older driver.
Sounds like it could be a bug in the driver for your wireless card.
