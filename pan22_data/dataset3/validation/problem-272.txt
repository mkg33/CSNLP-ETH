Get a sympathetic business nearby (same building?)
Eventually the solution they found was to port their numbers to a VoIP provider and got internet from another vendor.
I'm not sure if you are asking for DR advice in your situation or a more permanent solution.
If you must have a wireline, traditional phone, service you will have limited options as most options are likely tied to the same Verizon CO.
So when local PRIs are down, we run off this DR system and customers/etc.
However, for DR, I would HIGHLY recommend Telecom Recovery
Outbound calling is still limited to cell phones (or internal desk to desk on the existing PBX), but that's cool with us.
You setup people's cell phones, home phones, remote office lines, etc.
I don't remember if they went with a fiber or wireless vendor (something like FiberTower) for last mile broadband connection.
At this time VoIP quality issues are the result of poor LAN or Last Mile connections.
If your workforce is more mobile look into a cloud provider who can connect calls directly without requiring calls to route though your network first.
Make sure you have a good profile on how your users use phones.
Our local provider has failover (either automatic or we can force manual) to send our DID 100 blocks to multiple 888 numbers at Telecom Recovery that are tied into a software PBX that allows for automatated attendant, fax, conference calling, hunt groups, etc.
I worked with someone who lost their T1 due to Sandy, and they eventually canceled their contract because of the Central Office rebuild/repair.
User complains are also the result of change in workflows and how they interface with the phones.
and then tell the software PBX where to route the calls.
(NOTE:  not trying to push product, they have just done a great job for us and this might help others)
