and the icing on the cake, due to me forgetting I had changed a script I use to sign in to fix something, I did all this as root.
Copy the following script, paste it on your console to generate fixpermission script
Run stat -c '%A %a %n' /* to show your proper directory and their permission as restored.
i am still signed in as root, and not the whole system was changed, so I do have some control over the system.
I am aware of the potential risks of missing a file, but would prefer recovery to reinstall despite them.
Rule #1: If you are not comfortable with command lines, do not run any command as root.
Since then I have physically disconnected the server from the internet.
I do not have backups of most of the system (poor choice I know).
Unlike in the questions "Recovering from chmod -R -777 /" and "What to do after 'chmod -R 777 /'?"
I believe a script could fix it if it restored the permissions of the filesystem based on data from the package manager, but i do not know how I would go about doing this.
Running rm -rf / as root will result in a disaster!.
in  my panic i posted to ubuntu forum by mistake, im reposting in the correct place (i think)
The above will create a script named fixpermission and run it by ./fixpermission if not already invoked.
comment from LasVegasCoder from the other forum i posted to by mistake:
I also ^C d out of the command within one second to minimize damage.
If you've ran chmod -R 777 / as root, follow these steps to restore it back:
Running chmod -R 777 / as root will break your system.
If this is not possible, how would I save the data from the server to reinstall the OS?
Example: Your directory permission structure should look similar to the following:
