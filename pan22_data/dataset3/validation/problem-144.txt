I've been reading for some time what the reason is that most of DDR2 rams are labeled "works on AMD only".
To be positive, you would need to contact Gigabyte.
So theoretically, even if it's extended info is not compatible, it should fallback to JEDEC and at least boot up.
If the PC Bios doesn't understand EPP or XMP it will fallback to the JEDEC info.
I figured out that reason is that most of these "cheap" RAM modules are high density, which are supported only by few intel chipsets.
On Intel it's called XMB and on AMD chipsets it's called EPP.
To be called DDR2 Ram, the ram chip needs to have an SPD chip containing JEDEC information which identifies the RAM Module to Bios.

Is there a way to figure out whether my motherboard support this or not, before I buy it?
But, it's no guarantee because of memory timings, another complication; i.e.
