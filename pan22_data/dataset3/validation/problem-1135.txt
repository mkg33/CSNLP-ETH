Because of their small size many electronics components are very sensitive to even minor electrical irregularities (this can happen when large A/C motors nearby are turned on/off etc.
If it was a RAID 0 implementation then certainly when a single drive fails you'll lose the array and all of the data with it.
Without additional information (that your host probably won't give you), it's not possible to say definitely one way or the other, but anyone who's worked with a lot of RAID arrays has had experiences where a whole  array was lost or crashed when it shouldn't have.
Sorry, I have nothing specific to point you at, but yes, it can happen.
Since the drive is connected to the controller via copper wires, and often in servers many drives share a cable connection to ease installation and reduce clutter, this can easily disrupt or even permanently destroy any number of adjacent components.
This has very little to do with pricing by the way.
And if a failed HDD directly routes 12 Volts from the power supply to the SATA connector because something shorted out, your RAID controller will be fried, no matter how many figures the price tag had.
and the power supply is a little on the cheap side).
Not as part of the RAID spec, of course, it is definitely a bug.
I've had many HDD failures where not the mechanics failed, but the electronics making up the communications interface.
Enter UREs ( Unrecoverable Read Error) and controller faults and firmware bugs and the like.
It's not supposed to happen, but it certainly can.
It's not what usually happens, but it's definitely not unheard of in my experience.
It is true that expensive controllers and drives MAY use parts that are more tolerant to abnormal conditions or have better shielding, and that with budget components you are more likely to get sub-standard parts.
When the drive's internal power converters or capacitors (energy storage buffers) burn out the electrical signals generated at the HDD's external connectors can and will move way out of specification.
But I have regularly found identical capacitors on a $50 drive and a $500 drive.
(And, by the way, RAID4 isn't a very commonly used RAID level, but should withstand the loss of any drive.
I have seen firmware bugs take out the whole RAID when a disk goes bad, or when it starts reporting imminent failure.
