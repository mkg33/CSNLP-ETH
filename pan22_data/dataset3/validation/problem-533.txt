Morphing didn't work fine either, because the content of the first slide would obviously disappear and not move upwards out of the visibile area.
If everything is lined up properly, once the animation has played, the slide transition will be invisible.
You can of course use the push transition, but then you'd need the specific element at the bottom of the first slide and the top of the second, and while moving one would see that you have it twice.
As if it was a big canvas, and the camera would slide downwards.
Add animation to the blue box so that it moves to the top of the slide, and apply the same animation to all the content of slide 1.
Hope you get my question, and sry if its solution is obvious, I'm quite new to PowerPoint.
Copy the content of slide 2 onto slide 1 and move it down so that the blue box from slide 2 overlaps the one on slide 1, then delete it (but keep the rest of the content)
is there a way to implement a transition between to slides that pushes the next slide in from the bottom, but keeps the lowest part of the first slide at the top of the second one?
