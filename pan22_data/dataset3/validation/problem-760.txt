One way would be to use a USB-Ethernet adapter, plug the USB-Ethernet in both computers and connect like that.
i know this is an old thread, but maybe someone will find this information useful.
This is especially useful if your computer dosen't have an ethernet port.
Unlike USB 2.0, the new standard will allow for two host devices to be connected directly with a USB 3.0 crossover cable.
You can buy one here: http://www.staples.com/Belkin-B2B048-USB-30-to-Gigabit-Ethernet-Card/product_IM1QU4388
A USB 3.0 crossover cable  may be purchased online or at a few major Computer retailers.
The review (update) on the product is recent with a date of 7/2/2015.

This crossover cable is designed for debugging and host-to-host applications and will not cause damage if plugged into a USB 2.0 port.
This cable omits the Vbus, D+ and D- wires (USB2.0 data and voltage) and cross-routes the SuperSpeed transmit and receive connections.
The USB cable also functions as a sort of virtual KVM connection as well although it can be quite buggy at times.
Quite a versatile product and it should suffice many users who needs easy data transfer over usb.
I know this is an old post, but I stumbled upon the USB 3.0 Wormhole Switch Cable, Super Speed Transfer Cable JUC500 from Amazon.com.
They provide chinish app for that but in Linux, you can use my patch to use it as virtual ethernet card.
I went through the reviews of the product and discovered that a user has successfully transferred data files in excess of 1.1Gbps to 1.4Gbps between two PCs containing SSDs.
This new cable features the typical Type-A connectors on each end but with a new internal wiring.
But you can write own driver to transfer any data: you simply write to USB EP0 and read from USB EP0 on the other side.
