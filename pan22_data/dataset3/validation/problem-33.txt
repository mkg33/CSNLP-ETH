The "@" means that the file has "extended attributes" associated with it.
If you do "ls -@ -l", you can see what attributes there are for each file.
It seems like if you look at the extra attributes with "-l" and then remove them with "-d" it'll probably do what you want.

These will let you see the value of those extended options.
Practice this in a temporary directory somewhere first though and make sure it works  ;)
You can also do something like "xattr -l pgsql.so" to dump the attributes for a particular file.
Typically they're stuff like old-school FinderInfo, text encoding info, or the "quarantine" info that gives you the "This file was downloaded from the web, are you sure you want to open it?"
Off the top of my head, I think is has something to do with the file having extended attributes available.
If the file or directory has extended attributes, the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '@' character.
FWIW, ACL info can be set using the same chmod(1) utility you are probably already aware of.
There doesn't appear to be an easy way from the command line to do anything with extended attributes.
Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended security information (such as an access control list), the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '+' character.
So if you see a file with an "@" when you do an ls, try doing this:
