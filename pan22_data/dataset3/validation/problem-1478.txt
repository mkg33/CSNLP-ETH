When using a Kubernetes LoadBalancer or Ingress, is the normal NodePort used as the underlying connection point?
I ask because in reading about kubernetes, I have found some sources that have almost implied that NodePort is somehow unreliable ("if you don't need your services to be available all the time"), and if NodePort is the mechanism underlying other load balancer implementations, then it should be safe to use, given an understanding of its particularities.
The longer answer is that NodePorts are great for debugging and development but have some issues in production:
However, I believe a NodePort and ClusterIP are generally created.
However, NodePorts do provide some nice flexibility (from Kubernetes documentation):
does the external-to-kubernetes load balancer implementation (used even when Ingress is in play) communicate with the Service in the cluster via NodePort or is there some other "magic" way that is used?
Technically it depends on the cloud network for LoadBalancers (e.g.
The short answer is yes, they are safe to use if you know what you are doing.
Google Compute Engine does not technically require this although one may be created).
