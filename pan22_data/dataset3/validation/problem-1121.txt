This feature is not handled by the Group Policy engine -- it dates back to the earliest days of Windows NT.
Is there any way to manually force it to sync and map the drive like you can with gpupdate?
If the server, share, or folder cannot be accessed, it will not be mapped.
What is the process that occurs when that drive is mapped?
On DOS and classic Windows (3.x, 9x, ME) clients, it would always map to the root of the share, not any specified subdirectory.
It is processed by the same codepaths that handle legacy logon scripts.
Specifically, how does the drive map on the users computer?
In a 2012 R2 environment, how does mapping a home folder via Active Directory using the "Connect:" box on the profile tab work?
It has the same failure modes as NET USE: If there is a local device using the drive letter, it will not be mapped.
I've been Googling for a while now and can't find anything on it, so any knowledge you can share would be greatly appreciated.
As far as I know, there is no way to "refresh" it, short of logging back off and on again.
I'm not referencing or concerned about GPO, this is only for AD mapping.
The UNC path provided is mapped to the drive letter given, very similar to a NET USE x: \\server\share\path\to\subdir command.
