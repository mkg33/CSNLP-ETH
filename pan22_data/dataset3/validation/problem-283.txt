I have this nagging feeling in the back of my mind that one of these days (likely soon), I'm going to run into something that i won't be able to figure out and i'll have days worth of downtime.
hours looking into the problem, I still can't get sendmail or postfix to work.
 I want to be a Drupal expert, not a Ubuntu expert
Just the other day, for example, I realized that one of my domains wasn't sending emails.
Apologies if this post feels like its been covered elsewhere, but I don't think it has.
That's really the heart of my problem:  I spend way too much time learning Ubuntu's ins-and-outs, and not nearly enough time working on Drupal.
With the exception of the lightening fast Linode, all of the shared hosts are absolutely sloooow.
There are going to be lots of people who read this saying - "just learn Ubuntu like a real developer".
To date, I've tried:  Joyent, Media Temple, Bluehost, Hostgator, and finally Linode.
So here goes:   Is there a web host out there anywhere that offers the speed of Linode, but will let me focus on Drupal instead of sys-admin-ing?
But when I work full-time and try and develop some of these sites in my evenings and weekends, I'm really feeling like the sys-admin stuff gets in the way.
The reason for switching are likely obvious to everyone: speed.
While I'v grown addicted to the speed of Linode, I really don't feel like its where I should be.
