If the headset paired correctly, you will now see it in the list of playback devices (Mine actually shows up as 2 separate devices.
For listening to normal audio, we want the "Headphones" device.)
After it's connected, right-click one last time and select "Set as Default Device".
Right-click on it ("headphones LG HBS750..") and click "connect" (make sure headset is powered on first!).
I know this a really old topic, but hopefully this will help someone in the future..
As the above answer states, first turn off the Bluetooth function on your phone (or any other device your headset may be connected to).
After you pair the headset with your PC/Laptop, right-click on the speaker icon on your taskbar, then click "playback devices".
Right-click anywhere within the list of devices and make sure that "show disconnected devices" and "show disabled devices" are both 'checked'.
Make sure your computer and headphone volumes are turned up and hopefully, you are good to go!
One shows as "Headset" and the other "Headphones".
