Having recovered a DC from a Ghost image, it's possible but there can be wrinkles if replication has continued with "current" version of the DC that you wish to restore.
As replication continues, the USN continues to be incremented and restoring the ghost image results in the DC reporting lower USN and it will be out of sync with the up-to-date DCs.
Renaming domains has been possible since Windows Server 2003 was introduced (as opposed to Windows 2000, which explicitly stated domain names were not changeable).
Or easier still just ignore your domain name, end users never need interact with it.
Type the following command to designate the new name as the primary computer name, and then press ENTER key:
Here is the link to the technical guide for renaming a domain, its 19 pages log.
The procedure is a bit complex and involves using command-line tools (rendom.exe) and editing XML configuration files, but it can be done and works quite well.
Aside form the "member of domain" section in Windows it is irrelevant what your Domain is called - simply creating a new DNS zone and adding the new domain name to Exchange will do the trick.
At the command prompt, type the following command to remove the old domain
Honestly if its that important, I'd EXMerge the mailboxs out then rebuilt the DC/Exchange server from new.
Now, renaming a domain with Exchange is a bit more tricky.
There are ways around this but adding Exchange into the mix likely adds even more wrinkles.
4.After the computer restarts, open a Command Prompt.
I'd personally not worry about it if its not really required.
just adding a related caution on ghost and DCs but can't comment in line with the ghosting discussion due to rep:
We can rename both domain/domain controller by using netdom tool
there's a discussion of this issue and possible ways to correct it:
Renaming your domain will take you far longer than migrating/creating to a new domain name.
