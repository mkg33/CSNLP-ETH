Also, the way you presended the Postfix config is wrong.
They even could evaluate to whom they provide service this time and opt to not give meaningful answers to those who they consider as spammers.
For example, Spamhouse provides service according to their policies, which state some limits for how many queries per hour, per month and so on you can make.
first answer was "there is a spammer", but 8 minutes later answer was "there is nothing special".
This is what Postfix developers require in their mailing list and there are reasons to do so.
The exact rbl reply would have been also logged there.
Probably, you'd send this log directly to Spamhouse and they could speak for themselves.
It is hard to say exactly without seeing detailed debug level 2 where Postfix logs query information for each statement in each XXX_restriction option.
You should always give complete output from the "postconf" command.
From what I see it looks like Spamhouse has answered differently second time.
If you have access do DNS server query logs which is set to resolve your mail server's dns queries, you might find some clues there.
