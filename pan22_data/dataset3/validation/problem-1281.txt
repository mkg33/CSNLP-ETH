DNS has to be setup flawlessly and you have to enable Open Directory on the 10.8 Server.
The second option might be better so as to keep from overloading your server when many users are online at the same time.
Once network accounts are configured, there are two options when a user logs in to their network account for the first time: connect to the network Home folder over the network OR mobile sync.
In my office, we have 10 iMacs that are used by freelance graphic designers.
If you are willing to setup network accounts on the Mountain Lion server and your network infrastructure is fast enough to support it (ideally gigabit ethernet) that would be a good solution as every user will be able to login to access their home folder via the network account.
You can view Apple's (limited) documentation here:
Our company email is set up using Google Apps and we like to have this set up with Apple's default mail client rather than using the web interface.
My question is: Is there a way for a user to log on to any iMac on the network and straight away be able to pick up their email in Apple Mail without the need for Mail to rebuild the database?
Staff come and go so people will switch around and use different machines.

However, this is very eaasy for me to say and not so easy to implement.
We also have a Mountain Lion server in our office that we want to use for network login.
