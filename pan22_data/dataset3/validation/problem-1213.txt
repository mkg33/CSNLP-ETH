I had very basic knowledge of VB but it's been more than a decade since I used the language so I'm rather lost.
Anyway, I have the following function that I use to append a row to another table.
So, my question is, is there a way to loop through a range of rows like a For or ForEach loop while checking a value in a certain column along the way so that I can make this piece of code shorter/more efficient in VBA?
I'm working on another Excel project and, this time, I dipped my feet into VBA macros for the first time.
I tried to use the resources in the answer that @mcalex provided but I couldn't get it to work - that's mainly because of my lack of experience, though.
However, this may change in the future and I'd like my code to be ready for that without the need to add or remove an IF statement.
Fortunately, I found a few articles about VBA and tables that helped me figure up an answer for myself.
I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels the same way...
Basically, I check a certain cell within a row if it is empty and, if it isn't, I run another function to add the values in that row to a new row in a table.
It works flawlessly but I'm not comfortable with how inelegant it looks:
