It's amazing that the default Windows 7 print option doesn't have a print actual size functionality.
It printed out pretty nicely, plus I could print two images on the same page to save paper.
However, like I said, I was happy with the images and using Word was a quick way of doing it, especially when you may not be able to just install applications on the computer u want to print from.
Here is a practical solution of the problem... Go to PSD file take canvas of A4 size.
A loooong time ago :-) there was Ulead PhotoImpact which has a FANTASTIC print interface: when you press print it brings up a kind of preview page with rulers on either side of the page (similar to Word) and you can literally drag the image around as you please and the printout will look exactly as you see it there.
Didn't try GIMP but I imagine maybe the quality could be better (?).
I had a similar problem, but was printing to PDF, so the option of having a small image on a large piece of paper didn't work.
Those shopkeepers do never never have any computer knowledge.
Because practically many laptop or PC users do not keep printers at home.
Paint.net unfortunately didn't work, but OpenOffice is also free.
It also had tick boxes on top of the page to centre vertically or horizontally and scale up or down the image but whatever you did, the printout looked exactly as what you see on screen, simply brilliant!
Another way to accomplish printing at a desired size is the program IfranView - it's also another program, which is a downside, but it's a lot lighter weight than GIMP, and there's a way to specify the size right in the print dialog.
Now you will get A4 size print which has 10 centimeter by 8 centimeter.. image.
What I ended up doing was just cutting and pasting it into Word and then adjusting the image to the right size.
So I opened it in Open Office Draw (ODG format) and exported from there to a custom PDF size.
I suppose, if you are wise enough, use maximum space of A4 size paper by copy paste image at the maximum...so that you can get multiple images thus can save money per image.
Then copy whatever xyz size of JPEG image suppose your jpeg image size is 10 centimeter by 8 centimeter.. then at the back groud fill up any light color.
