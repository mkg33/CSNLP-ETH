I feel obligated to point out that there are too many things the rasterizer needs to know the facing of the polygon it is drawing for your use or non-use of gl_FrontFacing in the fragment shader to have any affect on the operation of the pipeline.
I highly suggest you take a look at the PDF diagram here, which shows all of the stages and inputs/outputs for the OpenGL graphics pipeline.
OpenGL actually uses the polygon's winding (after projection) and compares it with the front-face you established (Clockwise or Counter-Clockwise).
Keep in mind no cross-product is necessary to determine whether a polygon is front or back-facing (GL does not compute or use a triangle normal for this process).
This is a far simpler process than you expected, and it only has to be done once per-primitive, since all polygons in OpenGL are planar.
If you look carefully at the rasterizer part of the diagram, you will see that polygons must always first go through facing determination.
This is used for polygon mode, culling, stencil testing, and in older versions of GL, lighting.
