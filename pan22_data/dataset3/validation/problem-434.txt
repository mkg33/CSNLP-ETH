1) Will the CPUs use similar amounts of energy when at low utilization?
3) Would that achieve a similar power consumption to the i5-7500T?
Take into consideration that under most conditions, the NAS processor is loafing, so actual power conumption would be well below maximum dissipation.
performing as many operations per second as possible.
the same number of operations/second, it is likely that the actual dissipation would be very similar for the two devices.
See Passmark Sotware's benchmarks and calculated electrical costs for the two processors.
Energy consumption is given for maximum dissipation, i.e.
Since the CPU's have similar architecture, under the same load, i.e.
If you'd like to test the actual load on the NAS, try testing with the  Intel NAS Performance Toolkit.
Of course, the i5-7500 is capable of performing faster than the T variant.
I'm upgrading my aging NAS hardware to something more recent, and I've decided that I will either buy an i5-7500 (3.4 base, 3.8 boost, 65W) or an i5-7500T  (2.7 base, 3.3 boost, 35W).
Given that the two CPUs are so similar in price, I don't want to miss out on potential performance, but right now I am more keenly interested in lower energy consumption.
