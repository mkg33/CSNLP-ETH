I implemented a similar setup on my own home network for guest wi-fi access, using it to limit how much of my bandwidth they can consume (I've got more than one friend who doesn't understand the concept of download caps...) and even shutting it down completely when necessary (I had a problem once where a friend, thinking he was being helpful, provided the WPA password to a neighbor who also did not respect bandwidth caps).
It also allows you to regulate access to other resources within your own network, e.g.
If you have your kids' systems in the same subnet as your main LAN, there really shouldn't be a difference in terms of what local resources they can access, however it does give you the control over their WAN access that you want.
This gives you the advantage of shutting down your kids' internet access during the scheduled times.
Of course, you could put them in a different subnet, allowing you to more easily use firewalls to gain fine-grained control over what local resources they can and cannot access.
(Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't DD-WRT allow you to define exemptions to the schedule, so you could allow them access to local resources even when their WAN is otherwise shut off?)
