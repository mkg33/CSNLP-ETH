RAID 1 - one punch in the face, especially if you were using a hardware controller and thought you could just take a drive out and grab the data easily...because, hey, it's just a mirror, right?
Raid 0(zero means nothing) so no raid: raid with striping and no redundancy
RAID 5+ - Cheap, poor performance for small random writes (4x), 10+ hour expansions, risky rebuilds, not suitable for hypervisors
0, 1 and 5 become natural, 6 is just 5 with an extra disk.
RAID 10 - Good performance for twice the price, quick expansions, rebuilds are straight disk-disk copies
Everyone seems to know RAID 5, so you just need to remember that RAID 6 is an extra parity drive.

I remember them in order by the number of punches in the face a failure of any particular level equates to:
(RAID 6 doesn't really exist, BTW, it's also sometimes called RAID-DP for Dual Parity)
RAID 5 - five punches in the face when it fails, especially when your Adaptec controller says "no arrays detected"....or a second drive fails during a rebuild.
RAID 6 - six punches in the face when it fails, because you had two dang parity drives and thought you were really uber safe....until your Adaptec controller said "no arrays detected".
RAID 2 to 4 aren't really worth remembering although RAID 4 is what NetApp uses.
RAID 0 - Best performance, poor availability, only suitable for temporary files
Raid 5: is striping for fast access and parity for redundancy
RAID 0 - zero punches in the face, because you were expecting it and had full backups.
People seem to mostly confuse 0 and 1, but it's pretty easy to remember that RAID 0 provides zero help when you lose a disk.
