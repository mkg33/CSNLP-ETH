The CNAME entries for ghs.googlehosted.com only need to be set up for the main domain, they will not work for the aliases.
Since the mail function will use Google's own servers, you do not need a DKIM signature.
This is fine, since the sole reason you have those is so that you can go to mail.mydomain.com to log in to Google Apps.
