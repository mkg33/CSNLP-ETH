However, I've failed to find any configuration panel under KDE ubuntu 14.04 to do the job, and the standard im-config utility seems broken.
I finally succeeded by creating a file ~/.xinputrc that contains a single line:
Changing the input method as PutzKipa explains actually fixes the problem.
I use Ubuntu 18.10 and had trouble in a particular app (Intellij Idea).
To simulate keystrokes, I tried the xdotool (apt install xdotool) and the xte (apt install xautomation).
Note: if you specify false as the command, the combination will not work at all.
However, we can specify the path to the script as the command, in which we will simulate pressing the same key combination.
If you remove your ~/.xinputrc, then im-config can  list the input methods available, even if it fails to select one.
Running into this problem on Ubuntu 18.04, I've tried all suggestion above, but unfortunately none of them worked.
In my case, myapp.sh was idea.sh, and I added the line inside the file:
But, probably, someone will come up with a better and more stable solution.
However, xte turned out to be more flexible for me.
Set the XMODIFIERS to an empty string before running your application:
XMODIFIERS apparently changes the way xim and ibus works, and when it's cleared, it disables the CTRL-SHIFT-U combo, allowing it to filter into the current app.
Go to Language Support on System Settings and change the Keyboard input method system to none
In this askUbuntu answer, Kayvan Tehrani shows a setting that works for me in that setting.
This chooses xim as the input method (ibus is the default).
I tested this in PhpStorm 2018.2 EAP Build #PS-182.3458.35 and I can say that it works, but with some caveats:
In general, if you do not often use this combination, then this solution may suit you.
The basic idea is this: in the system settings you can specify the command that is started by the Ctrl+Shift+U key combination.
I noticed however that no matter what config I tried, the ibus daemon was running everytime after I had rebooted.
