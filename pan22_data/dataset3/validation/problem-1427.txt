If you are looking to effectively 'remove' those ports from the computer (and you need USB at all), AND if you are willing to modify the computer, may I suggest 2 part epoxy?
The strength of these settings will be as strong as your Windows policy and group settings.
However, you can follow the below link to Microsoft's recommended solution:
Both of the above can be set via a registry entry or a policy file.
This is often a good compromise, as it allows users to read data off a USB device - like photos from a camera, but prevents them from copying your corporate database onto their memory stick.
In all cases I think you will just end up creating more work for your self.
The only other solution I can think of is to place the actual PC in a locked cabinet with just the cables for the keyboard, mouse, and monitor coming out.
If you cannot trust your users that far, then take away their PCs and set up a thin client systems connecting back to something like a Citrix server running all your apps.
Hot Melt glue is a bit less permanent, but still pretty effective.
Cover the connector with epoxy and no one is ever plugging anything in there again.
I prefer to train the users as to what is acceptable and what is not acceptable.
It's probably not advisable to attempt to disable USB entirely, as things like keyboards and mice generally require USB these days.
Assuming you still need USB ports for keyboard/mouse, you're going to have to leave a port or two uncovered.

You can also prevent booting from a USB stick in the BIOS, as has already been mentioned.
If the users have administrative rights to their PCs, they can override anything you do to prevent this.
