If you prefer a command-line solution, you can use this to list RDP sessions:
I recall that in the past I solved this by logging on to some other machine in the same domain and then going to some admin tool which I cannot recall.
Also keep in mind that even though the remote server is not letting you RDP in normally, you can still hijack the console remotely:
We use Windows "Remote Desktop" to log into server machines.
Now, the cause is obvious (2 other people are logged on right now!).
Also, terminal services licenses are reasonably inexpensive.
To RDP to the Console of your remote server: from your client PC, open the CMD prompt and type:  MSTSC /ADMIN   (or if you are using an older RDP client, use MSTSC /CONSOLE)
Note that terminal services licensing was on the honor system last time I checked (ie, the Windows Server doesn't actually check your license keys, it just takes your word for it that you have however many you tell it you have), but that's neither here nor there.
If you switch to licensed mode, you can tell the server how many licenses you have, and it'll accept up to that many connections.
At the moment, I am getting the following error message:
To reset a session, look for the relevant session ID in the "ID" column of the output from the above command, then use:
You can also log via console using rdp and boot the users.
This will allow you to remote logon to the console (and if necessary boot off anyone currently logged onto the console) - then you can use the Terminal Services Manager or Reset Session commands to boot off other RDP users...
From there I could see who was logged in and remotely terminate their session (assuming I had sufficient privileges) -- thereby freeing up one of the connections.
You can use Terminal Services Manager under Administrative Tools.
