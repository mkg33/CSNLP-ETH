Connecting to Exchange counts as a logon, and you can configure your domain to lock accounts out after a certain number of failed attempts.
That should stop a brute force attack against the password.
For example, your public facing one might only accept mail sent to valid addresses on your domain.
You also have the option to enforce complex passwords for all accounts, to mitigate against dictionary attacks.
You could also have further protection by having all your incoming mail come in via a spam filtering service, and only accept external SMTP connections from the service providers servers.
If not, then you can just remove email config from that account, and then no-one will be able to send mail as that user, because it's not mail-enabled.
You don't say if this account should be able to send mail or not.
You can configure different SMTP connectors to accept incoming mail in different ways depending on how it is configured.
Your internal one is there for your internal mail clients to send mail, and only accepts from a valid user, computer, or internal IP addresses, or all of the above.
