You also need to end the CNAME with a dot, like so:
Also note that the RFC says that you should have between two and five nameservers and they should be as separated as possible (different networks, different continents, different service providers, etc.)
It seems above discussion you have did all configuration.I have doubt on the zone file's owner and group.Please check It should be "named"
Your current config has NS records but the targets of those NS records don't have A records.
But from looking at your pwd in your prompt the zone file is:
You are pointing www.elfoip.net to elfoip.net but elfoip.net does not exist.
terminates the hostname so it stops at www.elfoip.net
This type of error may end up working for some people (who just use the glue IPs) and fail for others who only use the glue to find the authoritative servers.
You can take this with a grain of salt but running just one nameserver on a single VPS is likely to cause more downtime than a more widely distributed setup.
Without the period at the end bind makes the host www.elfoip.net.elfoip.net So the .
Also you need to add an A record so bind knows what the elfoip.net ip is supposed to be
