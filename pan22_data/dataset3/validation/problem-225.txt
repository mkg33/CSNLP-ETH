In such a case you will you will see the icon alone (with only a small ») without need to click anything, right-click will work also correctly, though the icon will not be expandable.
Now in the tree view on the right side of the Explorer window right click Favorites and select "Add current location to Favorites".
You can also disable the toolbar Text and Title when the taskbar is not locked (by right-clicking on left toolbar separator).
Occasionally I need to access the recycle bin, but having to re-enable the icon just to open it, is annoying.
I usually create Desktop toolbar on taskbar (right-click on empty taskbar space, Toolbars, Desktop) with the smallest possible size (you can change the toolbar size when the taskbar is not locked).
Open Windows Explorer, type Recycle Bin in the address bar and press enter to open the recycle bin.
Then you can change the size of the toolbar to see only one icon, and rearrange the icons to see only Recycle Bin.
I usually remove all the icons from the desktop, even the recycle bin.
How else can I access the recycle bin without using the desktop icon?
Create a shortcut to the recycle bin (re-enable the icon on the desktop if you have to, you can disable it again after the shortcut is created) and drop the shortcut into the start menu somewhere convenient.
This way you are always able to access the Recycle Bin from Explorer without having to have its icon on your desktop, with no registry key edits or virtual shell folder text files required.
I was hoping I could use the windows search bar built into the start menu but typing "recycle" or "recycle bin", but that returns nothing.
When I press », I have access to expandable Recycle Bin with appropriate icon (empty or full), with all right-click options like Empty Recycle Bin (the same applies also to My Computer and the Manage option).
The Recycle Bin will now appear as a icon under your Windows Explorer Favorites tree node.
