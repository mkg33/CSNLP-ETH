Does anyone out there know the answer (even better if you can point me to a clear explanation on VMWare's website...)
Because ESXi does not have a built in management console, you need a program, of some sort, to connect to the ESXi hosts to "manage" them.
Much is made of the fact that VMWare's ESXi hypervisor is "free"
And yes you can Create/Delete/Modify and power cycle your VM's from there too.
The link is included on that webpage that your ESXi box is running.
For a free license (of which you may request a key that only requires you having an account) you can do all management operations (Create VMs, Modify VMs settings, Power VMs on and off.
By "manage" I mean, start, stop, install, reboot and backup vms.
Failing that, without licensing something from VMWare, is there any tool that will let you manage your hosts after the 60 day evaluation period of vSphere ends?
I have not found a straightforward explanation of this on VMWare's web site.
The interface is very similar to the ESXi 5.5's vSphere Client, but with some additions.
Starting with ESXi 6 vSphere Client is no longer required.
If you install the free ESXi on a host and connect to it via a web browser, you are prompted to download vSphere to manage the host.
When you install it you are continuously reminded that you have only 60 days to evaluate vSphere.
As best I can tell, you can install the hypervisor on a host for "free".
My question is this:  Is there a completely free management tool for ESXi hosts that enables one to:
Yes that client tool, VMware vSphere Client, is free and runs on a Windows computer.
You can upload and download to your datastores from there, thus allowing you to backup or restore a VM that has been shutdown.
