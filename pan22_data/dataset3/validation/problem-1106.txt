I have an Excel spreadsheet (above, with screenshot).
I want it to display the data in column N, but I can't figure out how to either:
Sum together the counts of A and Bor get counts for Combined that don't take the 0 rows into account.
The other way to handle this is to add columns in your data source so that no filtering is required.
Since you only want to count non-zero rows in Combined, add a column called "combined count" with a formula like =if($D2<>0,1,0).
The other pivot table uses Report Filter to display only non-zero rows for your count and sum of the C column.
To do it this way, you need two pivot tables because once you filter out a row with Report Filter, it won't display anywhere on that pivot table.
Then add another column to your data called "C count" with a formula like =if($E2<>0,1,0).
There are three columns of data, A, B, and C. A fourth column, Combined, simply contains a formula that SUMs A and B (=SUM(B2:C2), etc).
I want the pivottable to display value columns for:
One pivot table uses the Combined column in the Report Filter to display only non-zero rows for your count and sum of Combined.
Then in the pivot table, sum the "combined count" column to get the count of non-zero rows in Combined column.
Similarly, you'll be able to sum this column in the pivot table to get the count on non-zero rows in C. The other value columns will work normally.
