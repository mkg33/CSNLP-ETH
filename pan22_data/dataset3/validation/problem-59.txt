Everything works fine but the VPN is meant for just myself and so the Raspberry Pi is unused for a long time every day.
I have found some articles saying that the RPI use no power at all and I should just leave it on BUT because I'm a enthusiastic RPI user this have turned to be a challenge in which I need the community to help me to finish it.
The only real solutions are for those running on batteries/solar power.
I have a ongoing VPN project where I have installed OpenVPN on my Raspberry Pi.
So to prevent this power-waste I need to make my Raspberry Pi sleep when it isn't being used and to wake up when a VPN connection is requested (LAN signal).
This also adds the problem of detecting potential use.
The only way you can save more is to remove power.
You don't say which Pi, but the later models reduce clock when not used.
The circuitry to control power will cost more than the power in 10 years of use, so this would actually result in waste.
You will find a few similar questions, but no solutions.
