My knowledge doesn't really cover details like the differences between engines like MyISAM, InnoDB etc or character sets like utf8/16/32, latin 5/7/etc.
Not sure if it matters, but I tend to create and manipulate my tables with phpmyadmin, I use apache as web server and it all runs on Linux.
This is for a intranet site, consider the content to be somewhat like a blog (and no, I don't want wordpress or something similar at this point).
Would be cool if someone with experience could give me a little head start and point me in the right direction.
I'm using Mariadb as my server and I know bits of SQL.
Also, is there an advantage in storing articles in multiple data rows (equivalent of different pages) to make things a little faster, or would you store a whole article in a single data row.
Sorry for my noobish question, I know the information is all out on the internet but it would take me quite a long time to research and get a grip on everything.
I'm trying to create a database that has to contain articles in different languages.
I do know that the character set has importance, I guess what I'm looking for is an all-encompassing character set and an engine that best deals with this type of content.
