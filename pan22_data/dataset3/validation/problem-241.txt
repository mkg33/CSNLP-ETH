Obviously the latter is more suited to the task, but neither should do any harm.
I thought of removing the keys one by one with the keyboard still attached to the laptop but that seems tedious and some of the plastic might break.
My concern is that the ribbon cable connector will get damaged, rendering it unusable when I reconnect it my laptop.
Instead of water, why not go to your local pharmacy and get isopropyl alcohol - its quite cheap and evaporates quickly.
I wasn't sure to try and rinse it in water after removing it, but gave it a shot after reading that someone else also had the same idea as well the concern for further damage.
I believe this is designed for cleaning electronic components.
Two products I recommend will clean grease, oil, etc: "Brake clean" aerosol products, and "Electronics cleaner" aerosol.
After rinsing it and getting it nice and clean, I used high presure air coming out of a vacuum for more than 5 minutes so the water could come out from all the nooks and crannies and after making sure that it was all dried up, put it back on the laptop and all is working ok.
Had the same problem like you but with an Envy dv7 keyboard and milkshake.
both contain a good deal of alcohol and evaporate quickly without leaving residue.
My laptop is HP Pavillion dv6t-7000 CTO Quad Edition.
It has dried and many of the keys are sticky and difficult to use.
As a side note, none of the milkshake got past the bottom of the keyboard so the other components of the laptop were not affected.
Assuming I've detached the keyboard from the laptop, is it safe to wash it with water?
