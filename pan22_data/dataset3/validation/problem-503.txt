Our file cache hit % has increased from 5% to 33%, so this definately helps a lot.
We had this in our web.config for the site (despite not running any managed code on the site)
We're running a Win 2008 R2 server with IIS 7.5 for serving image files.
However the IIS frequently completely flushes the cache (seen by using Perfmon)
Not sure why kernel caching causes this behaviour, but I can live with the slight overhead of caching in usermode.
I've included a screenshot of the perfmon graph where you can clearly see the issue.
After changing this to false the IIS stopped doing these full flushes.
It still flushes some files regurlarly, but it's no longer a complete flush (around 50k files stay in cache)
It's not application pool recycling, it's not because the TTL has expired, so now I'm at a loss :-(
(Note: I'm aware I could maybe detect it by attaching a debugger to the process, but that's not an option because it's a production server, and it cannot handle the slowdown a debugger would cause)
Is there anywhere I can see WHY it's doing these flushes ?
Thought I'd add this as an answer to help others with similar issues.
It's only used for static content, and file caching has been set up to cache files for 10 minutes.
