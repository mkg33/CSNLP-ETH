The next thing you'll want to do since you need an account, or accounts, for these 3rd party apps to communicate/authenticate through AD with would be to create an MSA, or managed service account.
I'd say only you, but I know sometimes there are circumstances where you have to have others that get these rights; rarely, but it does happen.
What I like to do, and have done, is create a new OU in ADUC for these service accounts so they are easily managed and can have certain things like GPOs (Group Policy Objects if you're not aware are ways to manage mass number of computers/users) applied to them much easier if needed.
What I would recommend as the first thing to do would be to open the Domain Admin, Enterprise Admin, and Schema Admin groups in Active Directory.
Another good thing about MSAs is that you can create what are called Service Administrators (effectively people in AD with permissions to manage these MSA accounts) who can have delegate control over these accounts.
This could be good for you as this person doesn't need to have domain admin rights and in the long run could save you time as they are able to manage the MSA accounts which leaves you more time for more important sysadmin stuff.
The command for creating one of these accounts is simply Add-ADComputerServiceAccount.
Avoid giving any non admin user/account admin rights at all costs.
Opening these groups up will let you select a tab called Members to truly see how many people are in each group.
Whatever other options you want to create this user with can be found here.
Here is a screenshot of the Domain Admin properties for reference:
I have used these accounts and I can say that I think when it comes down to it that they are superior to just using a regular user account in AD.
First, when you say 40 admin level accounts I'm going to assume you mean Domain Admin.
For a list of best practices for the MSA see this post directly from the MS Directory Services Team.
You can create and manage these MSAs through Windows PowerShell but make sure you're on at least version 2 of PowerShell.
40 of these type of accounts is dangerous for so many reasons that I'm sure you can already guess.
The three I named (domain admin, enterprise admin, and schema admin) are the most important and allow the most control over your domain/forest so you want to make sure that only you as a sysadmin and maybe a select FEW others that are either admins themselves or that you trust have these rights.
