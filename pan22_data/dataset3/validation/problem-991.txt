What you are saying means that the computer and graphics card will run on that PSU, but unless you meet that minimum system requirement there will likely be issues like I described AND a good graphics card needs a special connector from the PSU for that extra power.
Also pay attention to how much voltage is needed on those PSU rails too.
I speak from experience with my own computer when I started building my first one.
Some of those graphics cards have special power needs like a 6 pin connector (some require an 8 pin connection) from the PSU and only PSUs with higher Watts (500 and up) provide that from what I've seen.
When upgrading a graphics card I would use 500 W PSU as a minimum.
Before you buy always check to see what connection and power the graphics card needs and what connections and power your PSU provides.
If your PSU doesn't supply enough power then your computer may have subtle problems as a result like distorted graphics, computer turning off, and poor fan speed which may cause overheating.
