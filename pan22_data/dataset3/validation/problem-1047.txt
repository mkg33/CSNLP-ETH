Also, in the above example there is no authentication data since I am performing the test from localhost, which allows all mail without authentication required.
This problem does not occur when using an unencrypted connection.
I've replaced the email addresses and organisation tree with garbage data in the above output, since it is irrelevant as I do not have this same issue when using regular SMTP.
Initially, Exim appears to be working as expected, I am able to securely connect to the mail server and authenticate myself, but just after I enter the recipient section in the SMTP session, the connection is dropped.
As you can see in the above output, Exim seems to break during/after issuing the string "RENEGOTIATING".
Everything works fine when using regular unencrypted SMTP; it's only when trying to use encrypted SMTP that things go pear-shaped.
I should also note that I am using a self-signed certificate generated using OpenSSL.
Since the output I receive during the SMTP session is not much help, I've also tried running Exim in debug +all mode.
For the sake of brevity, I won't post the complete SMTP transaction since the entire session is quite normal, up until the point where I specify the recipient address.
This is the exact snippet of Exim debug data that I get once I've typed in the recipient address and pressed enter:
I'm in the process of converting an existing mail server to support encrypted SMTP for our clients, but I've run into this brick wall with very little useful log data to help me forward.
The above transaction occurs regardless of whether I attempt the connection from localhost or from an external source.
