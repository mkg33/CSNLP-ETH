While this can be very convenient (null-routing all AS32934 prefixes), not everyone has BGP knowledge and one can just look at the prefixes announced by Facebook on HurricaneElectric's website.
Using a public BGP looking glass or a direct bgp feed to your router, it's possible to know what are those ranges by looking at the routes that have AS32934 (Facebook Autonomous system number) in the path.
Beware though, if Facebook uses a CDN like Akamai, the addresses of the servers (reverse proxies/caches) might be in the CDN's ip address ranges, not in Facebook's.
However, this list should be manually updated as Facebook can add new prefixes.
Using this list, it's really easy to block Facebook using a simple access-list on the router.
As Facebook is now using ipv6 as well, you should also add an ipv6 access-list on the FastEthernet0/0 interface with the few network announced if your network is ipv6-enabled.
Where did you get that list of IP addresses for Facebook?
I suspect facebook simply added some new IP address space.
Port forwarding or lack thereof should have no effect that I can think of on your inbound access list.
Facebook is operating their own network, hence announcing their address ranges to other networks (i.e.
