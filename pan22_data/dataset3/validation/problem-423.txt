The boot sequence starts with the bios, and once it has checked out the hardware, it will look for a bootable disk - be it usb, hard disk, cd.
As I understand it is absolutely clean, no OS in it, it is just from the box, from the store.
When push on the power button to turn the computer on, starts the BIOS first and check if all required haredware components are ok (RAM, CPU, etc.).
I've just installed a brand new hard drive in my Dell Inspiron laptop.
Normally there should start the software bootloader (the first programm that starts when a medium gets booted) to load the partion with the OS.
There is also no file system that has to be finalized in existance.
Before the OS is loaded, the power button works as a normal on off switch.
Then the BIOS is looking for the next bootable data medium like a HDD (it all depents what boot order you have set in the BIOS) and try to load it.
Even if there was one, it wouldn't be opened if there is nothing to open the filesystem.
My question is, can I turn on my laptop with this clean HDD?
It's safe to turn off by hitting the power switch normally.
But in your case where is no bootloader, partions or operating system installed you simply get an error-message like these:
There will be an error - No OS found/no bootable image found/depends on your BIOS.
I know I can insert a USB with Windows OS, or Ubuntu OS and the OS will try to install itself.
As no programs and no OS is running, there's nothing to save and prepare for exiting.
Usually you can turn off the laptop by pushing the power button.
To turn the computer off, you usually just need to push the Power-button again!
If it doesn't find one, it will simply stop and report there is nothing to boot.
But what if I do not insert a USB with an OS and turn on a laptop?
A shutdown saves data to the hard disk, then turns off the computer with an ACPI-request.
When there is no OS installed, the laptop will get stuck at a screen saying something like "no operating system found", because nothing is installed that could start up.
