making sure the terminal has relevant permissions to both create/read/write to sockets.
Should I install eclipse/netbeans IDE on server machine and then run the code forever?
Tomcat is a perfect solution for Java code, but there are plenty of others out there that may be better for your specific application.
The alternatives to Tomcat are Glassfish, Wildfly/JBoss.
Or is there any application like tomcat/xampp which will run my server code like Java/other web application.
You should do your own research first, then come here when you have specific questions.
But if this is just a lightweight socket-based program this could be more than you need and you may well be able to just use Java SE and run the compiled '.jar' from the command line like so:
How do I deploy this application so that I can request from anywhere from any app (assume the app has permission).
It is reasonable question but may well be poorly asked.
Depending on your deployment and code-base, you'll need to find a translation mechanism between the web service and the app.
First off, your question lacks any research effort as this is a very common thing done on many, many websites.
I have written server-socket Java application (not a web application) and I have a server running on Linux machine.
Its Java code so you run it on a Java enable web-server right.... nothing else will understand the code.
