When you know without visual feedback what you want to repeat, this [Ctrl-]Space mapping saves another few keystrokes:
I made the RepeatLast.vim plugin to provide this functionality with 5\.
As a matter of fact, I wouldn't recomment remapping any of vim's default mappings.
I wouldn't recommend remapping C-N and C-P, since they are autocompletion mappings, and often plugins use them.
It works by enabling macro recording all the time.
It would be great if Vim could provide access to recent keystrokes internally.
Remembering to hit q before performing something you will want to repeat is preferable.
Again expanding on mapping your commands to be repeated:
To expand on @ldigas' comment about record and macros, here is a simple breakdown.
If you wish to have some opeations which you use often at your disposal, try recording it in a register and then playing it (":help record"), or making it a  function and then calling the function (if you do wish, I guess the call to function could be made as C-N or C-P ...)
If you are having some  problems with repeat command with some plugins, try the repeat.vim plugin.
Once you have your macro, you can replay it by using @w (assuming you used w), and it will roll through the actions you recorded.
But it was the only way I found possible to perform multiple repeats retrospectively.
