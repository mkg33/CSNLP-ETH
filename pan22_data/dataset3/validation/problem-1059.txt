(Note what another poster said about time-based resource monitoring, like CPU usage or disk throughput, being inaccurate from within a VM, however.)
Well memory is fairly straightforward, just use the usual tools (free, vmstat, top or gnome-system-monitor if you fancy).
With a database server, you need to add more RAM when your application profiling suggests that your disk cache isn't big enough to perform well.
If you ask you VPS provider they may well have some form of web or API based mechanism for you to query your VPS stats directly from their own management tools, again depending on what code they're using themselves and whether they choose to offer this.
There's no way to tell from any single measurement taken out of context.
With a web server, you need to add more RAM when disk swapping starts to negatively impact performance.
CPU is a different thing as inherently no VM can ever truly self-report on true CPU usage, not without effectly being handed the externally gained stats via whatever vm integration tools your hypervisor of choice provides anyway.
In terms of overall performance monitoring, there's a number of host-level tools that are popular -- Nagios is probably overkill, but Munin or PCP is probably a good fit for your needs.
How can I track the performances of each website, and somehow to know when I need to upgrade RAM (I'm progressively adding more and more websites).
