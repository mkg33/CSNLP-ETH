This will let you enter the name of your web server, and after connecting will show IIS Manager in the tree structure on the left.
my XP computers were on home network and behind a router.
Thankfully, there is authentication involved here -- it's just that normally you don't see it because it uses your active directory domain credentials.
You don't even need any software installed - just right click on your "My Computer" icon and choose "manage".
Does it mean that computers on the same LAN network or even computers on outside of my LAN network(on the internet) can administer my IIS on my XP via IIS manager remotely without setting up or anything?
I used to install and use IIS 5.1 on my XP pro and install and use IIS 6.0 on XP pro 64bit edtion for a little while.
I looked for everywhere for the information and they all say you can do that, but it doesn't say any password protection or security issue for that.... and I was wondering if computers other than my local XP which running IIS on can administer access remotely to my IIS if they know my IP address?
But when I was using IIS I didn't know that remote computers can administer my IIS on XP... and it worries me a little.
Also, remote desktop is not enabled by default on Windows XP, though it is common for administrators to turn it on by default on all workstations via group policy so that they can connect when they need to.
Also If I install IIS 5.1 on xp, remote desktop / remote desktop web connection are also enabled by default?
If anybody reply and explain to me I would really really appreciate it!
I read that I can access and administer IIS on XP from remote computers by using IIS manager.
When the management console opens, right click on the computer name and choose "connect to another computer".
