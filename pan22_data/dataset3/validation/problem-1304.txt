That is the best route, it is almost like an apprenticeship.
You learn a lot of details, internals, emergency situations, etc.
In order to become a "good" DBA, the only thing that matters the most is Experience.
I dare say it is the same if you want to be a "web" DBA it is similar but I have no personal experience of that.
So picking up ShellScript would be a great idea to.
The thing with being a "serious" DBA (and by that I mean, you are a person responsible for meeting a defined SLA on a system handling physical goods or other people's money) is that it is very difficult to get the job without already having had the job for 5 years - experience is everything in this game, a reputation as a safe pair of hands who isn't going to panic and make a bad situation worse, and has the maturity to weigh up commercial and technical considerations.
That is what makes DBAs different from developers - that we need to make decisions in real time - and from sysadmins - that we are only one step removed from the cash that flows through the business, personal details of customers, stock levels in the warehouse, etc, so we are much more business-focussed.
Something else, in order to be a good DBA one should have, linux skills also as network basics skills.
I moved into teaching DBA and Performance and Tuning classes, eventually leaving teaching and becoming part of their Professional Services.
I had exposure to engineering and help desk within the company, as well as doing interesting things with customers.
I think there is two points of view in order to become a DBA
The usual way in is that you are either a developer or a sysadmin with an interest in databases who gets involved with DBA work, fills in when other DBAs are unavailable, and gradually work your way sideways into the job.
I was a C Programmer who joined Sybase many years ago as an instructor for their Open Client/Open Server courses.
While Sybase isn't around much anymore, Microsoft SQL Server (and, in theory, most RDBMS) are similar.
