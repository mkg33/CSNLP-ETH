Obviously I'd need to go through and set them all up on the different locations/networks, I'm not expecting it to magically know where I am and what I'm doing.
It gets tricky if you want some of the instances to be Windows 7 and some Windows XP.
Windows allows you to separate the partition the BIOS boots from (confusingly called the "system partition") from the partition containing the operating system (confusingly called the "boot partition").
(We can't advise you about that, check the license yourself or consult a lawyer.)
This may not be the correct place to post this; if that's the case, just let me know and point me in the right direction please!
Another potential problem is licensing, you might need a separate Windows license for each instance.
I am needing to have multiple installations so that I can, for example, plug the box in to the network at one location, boot in to that location's partition, and have full access to everything I would normally need to do on a computer that has already been set up on that network.
Have one OS, install your favorite VM environment on it (as you're a beginner and running Windows, one of VMWare's free offerings seems like the obvious choice) and boot up an appropriate VM as needed.
Then, when I go to the next client, I would be able to do the same thing, with the new location's partition, and have all of those network settings, drive mappings, etc., available there.
It would be like I'm carrying around a computer that is configured for each place I need to go in one little box, instead of having to have multiple computers or having to reconfigure all the settings and such every time I go to another client.
The "easier way to do this" that you haven't heard of is commonly called  virtualization.
If you convert the disk to dynamic, you can have lots of partitions; I don't think there's a hard limit.
I'm thinking of building a box that needs to be lightweight and portable, and would need to be able to boot multiple installations of windows.
This means (at least in principle) that you can have as many different instances of Windows as you can have partitions.
Or is there an easier way to do this that I haven't learned of?
