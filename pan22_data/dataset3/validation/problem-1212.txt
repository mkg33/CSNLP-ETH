For user and computer objects you need to use ADMT to migrate there accounts.
For your original question you can create a script to replicate the OU structure from your old domain (this is also a good opportunity to improve on that structure if you think it is incorrect).
The computers will need to be on the network when you use ADMT as it will connect to them translate there security from old domain to new domain and then move the computer.
This is a very involved process depending on the number of users, computers, servers and services you have that interact with your current AD.
By using ADMT you will be able to migrate the users and computers to the new domain and retain the original SIDs, as well as the new one given out by your new domain.
That is just from the top of my head I am sure there is more you will need to do.
AD uses SIDs to identify each object and associate rights and profiles etc with that object.
I have a situation here that requires me to transfer all the OU, User and Computer Accounts to another domain, which is from Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 Standard.
If you are looking at a large number of users, computers and services I would hire in contractors to do this for you.
This way when they move to the new domain they will not lose access to file shares and services that are in there old world.
You will need a trust in place between the 2 domains for this to work at all.
