I even sold the setup to the new tenant when I moved out!
To use them as multiple access points, just make sure they are all set to broadcast the same SSID (wireless network name) and have the same security type and password.
I was looking at something like this for assistance but not exactly sure..
I am pretty well educated when it comes to internet and routers as far as port forwarding, but this is a little out of my element..
Like he said, disable DHCP and NAT, ignore the WAN/ADSL port and they will act just like a normal ethernet switch.
Looking for single network wifi.. basically extending the range throughout
However, most consurmer grade wifi routers don't come with this out of the box, but custom firmware such as DD-WRT can often add this functionality if your router is supported.
To do this, disable DHCP and NAT and let the comcast router do the DHCP and routing on the network.
Im pretty sure they are still showing their original wireless connection names on my pc, but i want them all to just run off the one wifi connection.
Once each one is set to an address that you know won't interfere with other devices (i.e.
What you need to do is configure all your wireless routers that you have cabled up throughout the house as Access Points instead of routers.
I don't think that port forawrding is going to unify all of your networks under one universal wifi network, which seems like what you are trying to do.
Typically this is handled by wifi repeaters which pickup an already present 'master' signal and push it futher out.
You can give each AP its own unique SSD so it is clear where it is located so you know which one you want depending on where you are (ie, nw_ap, sw_ap).
It's a bit of a faff because you're not really using the routers like they are designed to be used, but I've had a system like that working in a previous house for over a year.
They will probably all need a static IP address set because they are more than just a switch.

I am running 50 ft cat5 cables to them throughout the house and have them powered on and connected.
This way your wireless devices will jump between them automatically and you will experience a seamless connection.
Some wireless routers have repeating modes built into them, but it must be enabled first and pointed at the preferred network you want to repeat.
The modem that is initially hooked to the coax cable is also a router.. an Apple extreme n router is hooked to the comcast modem/router.. Linksys g router hooked to the Apple extreme and a netgear n router is hooked to the linksys.
make sure it's out of the main router's DHCP range and not the same as any other static IP in use on your network), you can plug them all together using the normal LAN ports.
It would also be advisable to set each AP's IP address manually outside of the DHCP range and set it as a reserved on the comcast router for its respective AP's MAC address (ie, keep 192.168.0.2-5 as your APs and start DHCP at 192.168.0.50).
I have comcast 50mb internet and 3 other routers that I am trying to connect throughout my duplex house.
RedGrittyBrick's comment is correct, and I have done this in the past myself.
