If you really want to know that much, just open up Wireshark (or any packet sniffer) and check on what they're doing.
I could just block their Mac Address but frankly that would be less fun.
You can use nmap to scan your wireless network, it will give a lot of useful information:
Well I've just found a PC that isn't one of mine on the network and I'd like to get more info about, such as what OS it is (this would give me a better understanding of which neighbour it is).
How can I go about this, I can't use 3rd party software as I don't have access to the PC as it's my neighbours.
And is it possible to message them (something like netsend, though I'm pretty sure the computer is not XP as it shows up on network Map)
Well i can't put a password on my wifi, because everytime I do that the connection drops every 5 minutes or so on all wired and wireless PCs.
So how do I find out more info using their ip address (or Mac address)?
I'm not happy about it but I keep a check of all the computers that connect to it
