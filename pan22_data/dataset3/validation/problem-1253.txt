However, it just shows up as a weird square with a question mark in it on another coworker's computer, kind of like this: [?].
The way to find it depends on Word version, but it can be found in Word settings.
Check out the font substitution information in Word in the other computer.
It looks fine on my computer with Word 2007 on Windows 7, a coworker's Word 2010 on Mac OS X 10.7, and coworker friend's Word 2007 on Windows XP.
It is possible that for some odd reason, Word is using a font substitution table that maps Calibri to a font that lacks U+200A (like Arial).
It has hairline spaces (unicode character 0x200A I think).
Since this coworker is the one in charge of publishing our documents as reports, I need to figure out how to fix it.
It sounds like the other coworker is using a computer without the Calibri font â€“ either because it has old software and never had that font, or because it was removed for some odd reason.
I have a Word DOCX file that uses the Calibri font.
Without further information (like description of the software versions used and whether Calibri is installed), this remains a mystery.
However, even in that case, Word should automatically switch to using another font that has U+200A HAIR SPACE, such as Arial Unicode MS.
