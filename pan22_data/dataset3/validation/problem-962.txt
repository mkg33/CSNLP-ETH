Looks like all the computers are not sharing folders.
There is a linux firewall and proxy for the internet in a separated machine.
I got access to the network and to the main admin account.
I think it's pretty obvious how they did it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UqEg1cFqig
If auditing is enabled you could probably find SOMETHING in the security logs of the computer that was accessed.
The problem is that someone apparently could get access to a coordinator PC where the exams were prepared and copied the file.
click add, type in "users" and then check read data, or just check everything in the successful field.
You could also enable detailed logging on the linux firewall (this is more proprietary) and cross reference the file accesses with the firewall logs to see what IP might be causing the issue.
Anytime anyone does anything that fulfills that access criteria there will be a log of the activity in the logs.
Of course that's not the end-all either since they could be going through a few proxies themselves.
I got a call today from a friend asking for help, it is not my area, he is from a school, it is a big institution.
They have 2 windows 2003 server sp 1, one for MS Sql and the other is Domain controller.
If they want to try to catch them later on, they need to enable audit logs.
To do that, right click on the drive, folder, or even the file you want to audit, select properties, advanced settings, auditing tab.
This doesn't mean that this person is the person leaking the data, however, as it's possible someone was able to compromise a password in the environment.
There are antivirus working, a good blocking of websites.
So from this you will be able to determine which security principal accessed the file at which time.
