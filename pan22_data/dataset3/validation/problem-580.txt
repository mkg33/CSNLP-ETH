The basic thing to be concerned with is just making sure the people who connect to your guest network are trust worthy.
Even if they don't have direct access to shared network resources, they might still do things on your wifi that you won't want them to.
I'm not sure which routers are affected and the extent of those concerns though.
Step one, "going forward" is to change your wireless password.
Anything that is open or shared on your network would be visible to someone with your password, and that also exposes you to a variety of port-scanning attacks, etc.
Default settings on various OSes vary over time and are often not as restrictive as is generally considered good practice.
In MOST cases, you should be safe, but I have read that there are some security concerns over poorly designed guest networks on some routers.
In a non-dense environment (if you are not physically near the house, you would not get signal, and you'd be at the house or noticeably out of place if you were sitting there connecting to the WiFi) I run an open guest network (no password) with client isolation (so guests cannot access/attack other guests) - in a more dense/apartment-type situation I use a guest password.
Most off the shelf routers with built-in guest networks are designed to let you give someone basic internet access without having to give them open access to your entire network.
So they can get to Google and stuff without being able to browse your networks shared files or devices.
Or if it feels necessary, you can turn off your guest network when those users leave.
This will make sure that they only have access to the guest network while you're present.
Your wireless password "type" should be WPA or WPA2 at minimum - "WEP" is outdated and very easily crackable.
