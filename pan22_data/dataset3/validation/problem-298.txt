Most of where Windows is expecting programs and components of programs to be is stored in the registry.
So you have Windows components too that have had the rug pulled out from under them.
Unless you have deep knowledge of every location in the registry to change, which is impossible as many Windows applications don't document this information, you have "pulled the rug out from under" many of these applications.
Honestly, backing up your data and reinstalling Windows from scratch is probably going to be the quickest way to get back to a fully functional and reliable system.
You can bet registry entries involved with these programs are not documented.
I'm not sure what these programs do when their expected components are missing, they could make other changes which might be the cause of the effects you are experiencing.
If you are running out of drive space, typically you can tell programs during installation to install to an external drive.
Some Windows components, such as the .NET framework and other programs have things in C:\Program Files and C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared.
To "move" a program, generally you have to uninstall and then reinstall it.
