When the number of users of my webapp increase (10,000+/day), the load goes up to 1.00 and sometimes 2.00.
The first thing you need to do is figure out if this is having any impact to your application you're serving.
I'm not sure what control you have over the disk configuration in your environment, but it does seem like that's your bottleneck.
Monitor disk I/O operations and the sizes of the disk I/O operations.
Please let me know if you need any other info about my server setup.
It's the number of processes that are waiting for resources.
When you're seeing this what does top say about your iowait?
A load of less than the number of cpu's you have is normally considered good.
I also have munin installed and it appears that these numbers are roughly accurate for the entire day (there are no major spikes in either statistic).
Using the "top" command, I see that the CPU usage is near 1% almost all of the time, and it only uses about 500 MB of the 2 GB memory total (almost all for apache processes).
This makes sense logically, but I cannot find where the bottleneck is coming from.
If it is not CPU or memory that is the problem, than what should I monitor and/or optimize to prepare for larger traffic?
(I don't know what to improve since I don't know the cause of the load!)
I have a Rackspace cloud server running Ubuntu with 2GB memory that is being used as an application server (the html & php files are loaded from this server and the mysql database is on another server in the same datacenter).
