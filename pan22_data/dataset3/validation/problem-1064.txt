I am currently self-taught and I don't know if the code screams that.

I tend minimalist on comments (preferring to put effort into naming and refactoring instead).
With more power to control multiple applications at once, you've never had so much control.

Note: The reason I put the JS at the end, was just in case it took time to load all the html and css would have loaded and the visitor would have something to see.
    document.getElementById("minute").innerHTML = minutes + "<h3>Expire</h3>";
    setTimeout("changeImg()", time);// the amount of time before the function run if statment

My main concern is there a common practice that I did not apply, I am looking into a career change and want to include this in a portfolio for a jr position.
I tried to keep the code simple and straight forward adding comments and spacing everything to be readable.
There are some slight variations in style but many conventions are well-established such as always putting a space before {.

It's not cheating to have your editor format your code for you.
   var countDownDate = new Date("Nov 5, 2020 15:37:25").getTime();
   window.onload = changeImg; //when sites loads run script
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css" />
  font-size: calc( 26px + (24 - 26) * (100vw - 400px) / (800 - 400) );
   images[0] = 'image_1.png'; //image array starting image
   var days = Math.floor(distance / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
Be particularly strict about your indentation (everything inside setInterval needs one more) and don't mix tabs and spaces (such as the align-self lines).
     <img id="imagess" src="#" alt="HAL Phone Icon" >
   var hours = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
    } else{ // if var is more the array length set it back to 0 to start the slide again
Consistently formatting your code will help it look professional.
    document.getElementById("sec").innerHTML = seconds + "<h3>Expire</h3>";
    if(i < images.length-1){ //if var i is less then the length of the array add one, length -1 because array list start with 0 and ends with 2.
     // Find the distance between now and the count down date
    document.getElementById("day").innerHTML = days + "<h3>Expire</h3>";
   <div class="call"> <!--call to action container -->
