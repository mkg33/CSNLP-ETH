We will likely use plastic covers to protect the keyboard from dirt/ink/grease.
The terminal will have the standard tower/monitor/keyboard/mouse and possibly a printer down the road.
We are considering adding a computer terminal to the press room, but are curious whether the hardware will be corroded too quickly to make it a viable solution.
The printing process utilizes inks with a pungent ammonia fume (I think it's used as a transfer medium).
Based on articles about computer cleaning, I know that ammonia is not recommended due to its corrosive tendencies, especially to monitors.
They will be able to tell you what the effects would be.
The press room is well ventilated, and though the fumes are strong they are still low enough to provide a safe work environment for us humans.
However, this doesnt necessarily mean there is ammonia, or significant quantities.
Will the ammonia fumes passing through the ventilation of the computer damage the internal components?
The best course of action is to talk to the ink manufacturer.
Is this physical environment not recommended at all, or will the effects be nominal enough to make do?
However, that seems to relate to direct contact in liquid form, not contact in gaseous form.
At my company we have recently started printing film for use in our flexible packaging conversion operations.
