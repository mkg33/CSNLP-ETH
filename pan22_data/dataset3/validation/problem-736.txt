Changing the system language includes switching the keyboard layout, however).
I believe word actually tracks the regions in which you use the different keyboard layouts and will switch between them automatically.
For example, if you type an english sentence, it should use the english dictionary for spell checking, and then if you go down a few lines, switch the language to Croatian, and type a sentence, then Word will mark this second region as Croatian, and try to use the Croatian dictionary, Croatian grammer rules, etc.
(Note, Shift+Alt changes the active system language, not simply the keyboard layout.
If you switch back to Excel, Windows will switch the language back to english.
I do know for a fact that the Windows remembers which language is active in a given application: If you set the language to Croatian in Word, switch to Excel, change the language to English, and then switch back to Word, Windows will switch the language back to Croatian.
If you click back into the english region of your document, the system should switch back to english automatically.
