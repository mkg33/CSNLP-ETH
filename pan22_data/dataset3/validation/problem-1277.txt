Files will be inaccessible (unless you use undelete software) when you remove a partition, they are also inaccessible when the partition is severely damaged or shrinked in an incorrect way.
Linux supports reading and writing NTFS and FAT, thus it is able to tell how much space on each windows or other ntfs partition is used.
Under normal conditions, shrinking a partition or adding a partition after another just keeps your files.
But of course this depends on the tool you are using.
Of course always something bad can happen, eg if you are moving a partition and have a power failure the results might be bad.
Under normal circumstances there is nothing to worry about.
GParted is quite save, and I think parted can only resize partitions if you have resized the filesystem on it beforehand.
Unless you manually change the partition size (which would make the file references invalid as they are outside the partition boundary) it is not possible to do this with the usual partition shrinking software, you are pretty safe when using them.
