You can fix that by changing the flow to an if else one
in my eyes, in the case of deciding between two options, the short form of the if statement can be used to make it clear:
Is there a way I could change these into a loop and it still work?
I have many lines of code that - to me - look very odd, and I would like to condense, but I don't exactly know how.
What is so special about the if(random.nextInt(50) == 26) condition?
You may wish to consider some data classes to keep the players and their scores together, possibly including their teams as well, to keep things a bit cleaner.
now, I assume that the logic was meant that rndteam should be assigned the name of either team1 or team2 but the code actually allows for both if statements to be false and the value will then be an empty String.
Try to avoid removing letters from variable names just to shorten them, lest they lose their meaning.
All of the if-statements combined just look bad, and aren't very efficient.
Once you have a number of variables with similar names, such as t?p?score, you should consider changing these to arrays (a 2D one would make sense in your case), which you can then iterate over in a loop to reduce the repetition.
A method called hangOver tells me absolutely nothing about what it does, and you should consider a different name.
