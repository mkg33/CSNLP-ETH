Your frequency is set either to high or too low depending on your TV.
Therefore,calibrating your monitors to be the same will only hide the problem for you.
When choosing colors, you must realize that the users who will see those colors will have even more diverse monitors.
Having them both on 7500K gets them close to begin with, then I tweaked the red-blue-green and contrast/brightness settings to make them match... rather than comparing them to each other, though, I would recommend tweaking them both to match the same picture or calibration chart.
That can be an ongoing process until you get them matched up, especially if you're also calibrating a good printer to print the same colors they are displaying (ICC Profiles should get you close, then you can tweak to match your paper).
Otherwise what all settings do I need to change manually on the second monitor to make it appear as it does on the laptop?
Most monitors have different presets in their menus for different temperatures Kelvin, too.
The colors appear entirely different on the new monitor than they do on my laptop.
soft white is usually in the 2700K to 3000K range; bright white 3300K to 4500K; daylight bulbs usually run from 5400K to 6500K.
Is there no software solution that finds how the settings of one of the monitor is and puts that to the second one?
The NEC CRT I'm using right now has presets for 9300K, 7500K, 6500K, 5000K and 3900K.

Try adjusting the colour settings on your monitor (not in your computer).
Some LCD monitors have really bad colours, I had one too.
Usually monitors have a color 'temperature' adjustment, much the way a temperature Kelvin given on light bulbs typically refers to their color, not how hot they get.
If you do a web search for color calibration charts you should find sites that cater to both monitor AND printer calibration.
If it doesn't help, then you probably need a new monitor.
When you are selecting colors etc, to be included in a website design, it totally freaks me out.
Go to advance settings of the display, click on monitor and change your refresh rate to 50Hertz.
The NEC LCD next to it has presets for 9300K, 8200K and 7500K.
