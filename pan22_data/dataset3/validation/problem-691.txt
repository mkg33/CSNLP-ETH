The line of code with the comment is the one that converts our coefficients into a slope/intercept pair for the line:
The result of classifying three blobs is shown in this screenshot:
I'm following Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido, and in Chapter 2 a demonstration of applying LinearSVC() is given.
where the term in front of x is the slope and -intercept/coef_1 is the intercept.
In the documentation on LinearSVC, the coef_ and intercept_ are just called "attributes" but don't point to any indicator that coef_0 is the slope and coef_1 is the negative of some overall scaling.
How can I look up the interpretation of the output coefficients of this model and others similar to it in Scikit-learn without relying on examples in books and StackOverflow?
And the authors walk us through how to draw the lines:
My question is how are we supposed to know how to interpret the model fit output in order to draw the three lines?
The three blobs are obviously correctly classified, as depicted by the colored output.
