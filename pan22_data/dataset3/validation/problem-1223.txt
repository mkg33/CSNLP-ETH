I couldn't rememeber so I did some searching and found this link.
My broom closet box is an Atom (fanless design, so less chance for failure) that has gained more and more harddisks as my storage requirements expanded -- but it still uses only a third of the power of my desktop machine, saving me 250 EUR/year.
a) those file systems that don't write directly to the disk
Use a separate low-power box in a separate room for background tasks and only power up your main machine when you use it.
The harddisks are in a RAID6 with hot-swap bays, so I can handle disk failures easily, and the desktop runs a weekly backup to the storage array.
c) don't listen, you don't need an SSD, especially for a linux box for downloads.
Depending on your flavor or linux it may be helpful
b) get a good hdd, google SPCR and look at their silent hdd list
If it is grinding, you may have a bigger problem :)
My NAS is 4x WD caviar green, they are barely audible although they're running 24/7 due to downloads.
The power savings offset the initial investment within a year.
There is a setting somewhere that allows you to click a box to "spin down HDDs when not in use" I know on Ubuntu 10-10 its in preferences somewhere.
