Question : How files transfer could be slow and normal at the same time ?
When data file, fake file created by dd, have low transfer rate.
Each time, zip file or iso file have normal transfer rate.
Transfer with cygwin from windows computer on another VLAN using mount point : transfer rate is 7-10 Mb/s for A and 55 Mb/s for B
That mean, if you try from another time at different days and hours, you will get the same result.
This transfert rate is permanent for type of file.
B) You can have a normal transfer rate, 50-70 Mb/s
Unfortunately, it works normaly now without anybody to tell us what happen between when it dont and now.
Wireshark show that slow transfer A is done with SMB2 protocol and normal transfer B is done with NetBios/NBSS protocol
From another computer with same or other windows version (windows 2012 server by example), same result.
Transfer with winscp from windows computer on another VLAN : transfer rate is 26 Mb/s for both type of file
And because my tests show SCP (SSH) the transfer rate is normal (same for all files types) I oriented my search to the top protocols of the OSI model
Research Track : Suppose that this can be related to the host layer of the OSI model
One client get a strange behaviour : From a windows 7, by opening explorer.exe and transfering one file of 1Gb (zip, iso, data, created with dd command, etc ...) from a LAN share (see configuration below) using UNC path you can have 2 differents behaviors depending of the file.
Transfer from another linux on another VLAN : transfer rate is 42 Mb/s for both type of file
Transfer initiated from : Windows 7 computer on VLAN computer
Source : NSD share (samba from IBM GPFS) on VLAN server
The share : It's an IBM Spectrum Scale (new GPFS name) shared by NSD server with NFS and SMB enable on a specific VLAN server
Transfer with cygwin from windows computer on another VLAN using SCP (ssh) : transfer rate is 47-53 Mb/s for both type of file
I use remote login, and i have'nt the possibility to test everything.
If you try with another user account, same result.
Destination : Windows 7 computer on VLAN computer (the one used to initialize)
As client use wireshark and tell to me he observe this :
