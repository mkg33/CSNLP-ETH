If you want to create a formula in another column, remember that in excel the digits represent the date and the decimals represent time, so something like =int(a1) in the cell b1 would give you the date as a number, then use the short date or date/time format to get what you want.

If you are asking to to just display the date information then you can use the short date format which basically hides the time portion.
Excel stores date & time values as floating point values where the integer portion is the date and the fraction is the time.
Therefore the shown method can be used to set ZERO for display purpose only.
Meaning the result would be (MM/DD/YYYY 00:00:00 AM/PM).
I would like to suggest one tricky method to set the Time to ZERO, in Date TimeStamp Cell/Range of Cells.
Excel converts the Time part into ZERO in Date TimeStamp Cell/Cells.
I have a column for dates with different time values in the format (MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss AM/PM).
I want to change the time values to zero for the entire column without changing the date value.
To get the date-only value, use the trunc function to drop the fractional part.
I had previously done this in an extremely simple way but now I have forgotten how.
