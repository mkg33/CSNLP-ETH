The drawback is that you have to select the email inbox folder for each email account.
Which makes it look like a bug instead of expected behavior.
And maybe you also need to create email rules again if you were using them.
Normally it shows something like: "john\Inbox in data filel C:\Users\John\Documents\Outlook Files\outlook.pst".
Than simply choose "Change Folder" again, en select the folder of your old existing pst file, in this case "john\Inbox" and it works!
Also want to add that Microsoft should really do something about PST's.
Which seems to work correctly, but when performing a Send/Receive, Outlook will show a "0x8004010F" error for each email account.
But at least you don't have to manually create new accounts back again.
The number of complaints and waisted time by Outlook users is just plain stupid.
After moving it, Outlook asks for the new location.
The solution is to create a new Outlook Data File, then select an Outlook folder (not a filesystem directoy but an Outlook inbox folder) of that new pst file, press OK. Than suddenly, Outlook does show the folder for "Selected account deliveres new messages to the following location".
After trying multiple solutions, the solution that I found here works for me (Outlook 2013):
But for completeness of this Superuser website, I'll describe it a bit here.
So for this solution, a new PST is temporary created, but it isn't even used/deleted/renamed/moved, it's just there temporary to make Outlook happy, and then you can simply use your old PST again and delete the temporary PST file.
Your problem may not exactly match mine, but if you do see the "0x8004010F" error, than the following solution may help.
The whole email and account backup process is really a big fuckup, an ugly problem that exists for years over multiple Outlook versions.
When you go to the accounts tab/window in Outlook, you'll see that the "Selected account deliveres new messages to the following location" is empty.
I wanted to move an existing PST file to a different location/drive.
