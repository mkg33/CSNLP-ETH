I have some application which are offering a book to read.
I have total of 18k records of user read paragraphs.
Users normally read some paragraphs of it only (it contains +6000 paragraphs).
Using SVD algorithm for matrix factoize gives a semi random predictions.
From there, you would know what people like and then algorithmically choose the n-grams that person is most interested in and find the paragraphs that correspond to those n-grams.
You would have to come up with a metadata set of each paragraph and then create a content-based recommendation system based on that metadata.
Can you suggest me how to produce suggestions related to each user ?
As for the metadata set, you could use something like n-grams to "summarize" each paragraph and then have an index for each.
Looking for users, it seems that a user is reading semi random set (i.e.
it is hard to specify common topics for a single user readings)
You could also do a community-based recommendation system if you have extensive user data.
