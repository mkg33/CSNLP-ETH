Yes you can just disconnect the power, and it won't harm anything.
This would avoid the need to physically disconnect them.
I've got a computer with two IDE hard drives in it which are rather noisy and I don't use them all the time so I'd like to disconnect them when I'm not using them but the data cables are difficult to connect and disconnect, so can I just disconnect the power?
Is it OK to leave an internal hard drive's data cable connected to the computer motherboard but disconnect the power cable?
Or will this damage the hard drive and/or the motherboard?
Having said that, depending on your operating system, you should be able to configure the power saving features to shut down drives when not in use.
If the power cable is disconnected for only one of two IDE drives on the same data cable, you could run into issues with termination (depending which drive is where relative to the cable), but as long as both are powered down, the BIOS won't even detect them.
You'd probably find that a new SATA drive would be much quieter.
I've done this in the past and it doesn't cause any problems.
