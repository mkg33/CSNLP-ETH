So, I just created a "Miscellaneous" group and threw all my stray icons in there.
This can be caused by any full screen application such as games, or by the addition / removal of multiple monitors.
I tested this by unplugging my monitor, moving an icon (without changing the grid feature) and plugging my monitor back in.
I then unplugged my monitor and found that icon to move to where I originally moved it to, so I turned the grid feature off, plugged in my monitor and then turned the grid feature back on and found the icon to stay in its new position.
I don't know how well this will work for your games (worst off you just need to leave the grid feature off) but it will hopefully solve turning monitors on and off.
The fix is easy, permanent, and requires no additional software.
Unfortunately they do not currently maintain the position of ungrouped icons (I've already put in a request for that feature).
It memorizes the positions of icons for various screen resolutions and restores them automatically or on demand.
I found something that works for me and hopefully it will work for others too.
I know of three utilities to address this problem.
When the screen resolution changes, Explorer will automatically move icons that would otherwise be off-screen.
Right-click on the desktop and select "Personalize".
Iconoid - a useful tool to save & restore desktop icon positions and with more features.
You may need to move some icons at the bottom of your screen so they are visible on the lower resolution setups, as windows will no longer do this for you.
It is available free from http://www.sillysot.com/ For your described problem, this is the most likely direct solution
I have an application I use (fences) which allows me to group all my icons.
Unfortunately, they seem to have discontinued support of their utility library and it seems to be difficult or impossible to buy.
Use it to organize your icons as you wish within groups and Fences will see that they stay put.
It has many additional features that I have found useful, too.
WinTidy - a PC Magazine utility that I used for many years.
I don't like this solution, but it's the best one I can come up with since windows will not properly restore icons or allow me to turn that "feature" off.
Using the steps above, this should allow you to unplug/turn-off monitors and replug/turn-on monitors without your icons moving all over the place.
I noticed with this, however, that it's save-file-like and you will need to redo the steps if you want to move icons around.
I observed that the icon returned to its original position on my desktop as it was before I moved it and the rest of my icons stayed in the same spot.
It is well-maintained and runs on all versions of Windows.
"I changed my monitor and now half my files are gone!")
I already had most of my desktop icons grouped with this application and noticed that they restore properly.
But you may be able to find it from a 3rd-party source.
Then select "Themes", then "Desktop icon settings", and UN-check .. "Allow themes to change desktop icons", Apply.
