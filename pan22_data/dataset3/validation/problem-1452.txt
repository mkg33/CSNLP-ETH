If yes, you can restore the volume header and then use recovery utilites on the mounted volume.
Place the drive in question as the slave and boot from another drive.
They take advantage of the fact that a hard drive never really writes over the same exact spot twice (a digital 1 on a hard drive is a length of space on the disk with a magnetic polarity associated as a "1").
The problem is that you've got an encrypted partition there.
So when the head comes over that spot again, it never/rarely overlaps perfectly.
If you can't find a way to decrypt the remaining data, then you're never going to recover it, I fear.
I would try TestDisk, which is included on SystemRescueCD, though I'm not sure how well it handles partial encrypted partitions.
Basically they look for magic numbers and then try to figure out where the rest of the file is).
An alternative to this is to run from a live-cd (get the same effect).
I would highly recommend putting the drive in question into a master/slave configuration if possible.
A lot of these tools can still read overwritten sectors and recompile them (with or without help).
Since you're running in ext3 partition, you will have to use a linux data recovery tool.
I am not familiar with many but I'm sure some research on google will yield satisfactory results.
I'd shoot an e-mail to the encryption developers and see if there's some way to decrypt the remaining data.
If the overwritten partition were not encrypted, I'd say to try a recovery tool that hunts through the data looking for files (I've not got any specific recommendations, but I've previously used tools that would just search the raw data for anything that might be a jpeg or a word doc and recover them that way.
If you could do that, then you can fall back to normal data recovery tools.
Which means that there's very little for a tool to go on in trying to find anything in the mess.
