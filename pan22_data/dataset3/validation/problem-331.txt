I do not know of such an extension myself, but a small search, made me find this one:
Then toggle the js console(esc), and type the following code in the console:
Though, extensions can request access to your history data.
If you come across this topic from google, there is an easier way to delete multiple items now.
Type the url you want to remove in the history tab as in the screenshot below, toggle the developer console(mac: opt+cms+i) and select the <iron-list element.

Put it into the chrome browser console one the history FRAME page.
No, that is currently not supported by Chrome itself.
So it would be possible for an extension to fulfill your needs.
Then, call the function removeItemsofQuery, and input the term you want to search for and remove as the argument.
Click on delete, and repeat until the list is empty or chrome gives a strange error.
document.getElementById("remove-selected").click()
If Fabricio's code doesn't work for you I found that this code is working and additionally clicking the "remove selected" button for me so the only thing i have to do is to click confirmation dialog.
document.querySelectorAll('.entry-box input[type="checkbox"]').forEach(function(input) {
document.getElementById("remove-selected").disabled = false
