The current tools that we have are ok at best, and I was wondering if there was anything else out there to handle the problem.
The traders demand that we only have one mouse and one keyboard for the entire installation.
For multi-monitor setups, Ultramon provides a taskbar for each monitor.
Winsplit Revolution provides some great keyboard shortcuts for arranging windows and moving them from monitor to monitor.
I use it at home to share a keyboard and mouse between my linux and windows boxes.
I have 4 monitors on 2 machines (2 and 2) and on windows I use Input Director.
One keyboard and mouse to control multiple machines, mouse pointers move smoothly from one window to another, and it allows all sorts of monitor arrangements.
I move my mouse cursor to the left side of the screen on my windows machine and it appears on the right side of the screen on my Linux box.
We're a trading shop, so we've got users running two(or more machines) with at least two monitors connected to each machine.
For multi-machine setups, Synergy is the way to go.
No extra hardware needed if the two (or more) machines are networked.
I think Synergy might be what you are looking for.
