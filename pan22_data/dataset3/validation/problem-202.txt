If you meant URL, there is no definite URL for all servers, but if userdirs are enabled, you can access the website using http://ip.ad.dr.ess/~username.
You can add your ip address and domain to hosts file of your system and connect server using your domain.
Call it in a browser; such as http://www.yourdomainname.com/path.php et voila, your absolute path:
You can add a newline to hosts file contains ip address and domain as space seperated.
So web server will serve your virtualhost instead of default virtualhost.
So probably there isn't any path like http://ip.ad.dr.ss/~yoursite.
Web servers use "Host" header of requests to detect virtualhosts.
I don't understand how you think the path to your website is related to your DNS not resolving or how knowing it is going to help.
The IP is unlikely to change, but in the event of an IP change of the server your website is put on, you can get the IP by running:
For the time being you can add an entry to your hosts file but you should really be working on the DNS.
Copy and paste this into a .php file (path.php or something) and upload it to your server.
To retrieve the IP address, you should look in the documentation of your webhost.
