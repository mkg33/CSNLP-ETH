This setting can be changed in BIOS and should carry a label like SATA mode or something.
For me the problem was that the system drive was having some inconsistencies, which required chkdsk to be run on it.
If your USB and network card issues on the Ubuntu live CD are intermittent in nature I'd say your motherboard is kicking the bucket.
And usually the problem is always with c(hidden recovery partition) but sometimes it is really the end for the disk, if HDAT says after let's say hour of testing media not present than get a new disk and save your important disk data with testdisk(it's free and it is on hiren you can easily find how to use it on internet.
Try using the hard drive in ATA mode instead of AHCI mode.
You may try booting into your system with a Windows PE disk and renaming those files so the drivers don't load on next boot and see where you get.

Went to all the sites trying to solve the problem.
You can extract the CLASSPNP.SYS file from Windows DVD using procedure described in this article on your ubuntu:
But windows could not run chkdsk, as chkdsk required to lock system drive.
I noticed eubakup.sys and EUBKMON.SYS which aren't "standard" Windows drivers.
You cannot run chkdsk after OS has been loaded, causing the deadlock.
Then rename old file and put the new one in its place.
You used Hirenboot only to test or what there's very good tool that will probably help you with your problem, the problem is in hard disk and the bad sector not releasing the file crucial to boot windows chkdsk /r might help but , i highly suggest to run the HDAT tool that's on hirenboot and leave it to scan with first option after the scan finishes if you see B  .....B .....B than it is the disk 100% but you have a chance to login to windows after that, .
The only time I've really experienced this issue is when the jumpers on my IDE drives (I put Windows 7 on an old P4 as an experiment) were set to cable select.
