If you can stretch to a 1080p screen then the problems go away, but of course it would be (much) cheaper to buy a new monitor.
Obviously, playing pc games on it could be quite a ride if trying to sit as close to it as before (keyboard+mouse games) - that's about the only problem I can think of.
Try to get one with a standard native HD resolution so you can easily set the PC at the native resolution as well - to avoid scaling artefacts.
As Dani said, "Typical 32" LCD has 1366 x 766 resolution".
I've seen 27-32" HDTV LCD's that were passable for reading text on, especially when switching to 120 DPI in the display settings.
The nearest is probably 1360x768 and you can end up with aliasing that makes text look terrible.
While it is great for movies and gaming, it's pretty terrible for reading text smaller than the standard fonts in Windows Media Center's interface (games with text that I actually need to read aren't pleasant either, like Civ4).
If the PC is already an HTPC why not have it connected directly to such a device?
Typical 32" LCD has 1366 x 766 resolution, and wouldn't be comfortable for daily work.
It might lack some features or sharpness (or do way too much post-processing) for it to be comfortable for professional use but for playing games, watching videos and some surfing - definitely usable.
If you use a DVI to HDMI cable you may find your PC will offer 1:1 pixel mapping to something like 1360x768 with blank strips at the edges of the screen.
Televisions and monitors have different characteristics, such as brightness, reflectivity, resolution, price, etc.
As long as you use an LCD with a square pixel aspect, sure - no problem at all.
The problem is that few video cards support this resolution.
The biggest problem I see, is that typical TV has almost no vertical tilt, so you cannot just put it on the table an use it as a really big monitor.
My cheapo 32" TV insists on scaling the display to fit the screen even through DVI and while it's usable, you wouldn't want to work on it for long.
