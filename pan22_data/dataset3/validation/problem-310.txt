You can try console which is a nice small freeware that does a great job.
I don't think you can customise CMD the way you describe in your comment to Moab's answer.
On Windows, the console formatting has to be done explicitly by the program.
It is therefore better to get used to their idiosyncrasies, than to fight to fit either one to the mindset of the other.
Running cmd.exe /t:12 will create a command prompt window with a blue background and green text.
This pretty much means that coloring (and formatting in general) can be controlled by the user, even when the original program had no provision for that, by simply using strings which contain ANSI escapes.
You can't do that because the way the Windows console works is fundamentally different from the Linux terminal.
Each character cell is comprised of two 16-bit codes: a Unicode character and a style word (mainly color information).
The program has to use the low-level API output functions to set the style information, otherwise all characters use the default style (gray on black).
On Linux the coloring is done using ANSI escape sequences.
If it's relevant, there are alternatives to Windows' CMD.
The moral of the story I guess is that Windows and Linux are two completely different operating systems.
