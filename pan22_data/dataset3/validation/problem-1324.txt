If someone attempts to access the web interface on br0 through eth1 it will succeed.
I am attempting to set up a semi-transparent bridge.
would DROP connections to br0 when they came in via eth0 (or reverse and ACCEPT there, depends on your other rules)
What I also want is to have the "green zone" accessible to a web interface for the bridge that will display all results of the IDS and other network monitoring tools.
So: eth0=lan1 eth1=lan2 br0=briges both + has an IP that should be accessible by eth1 only - right?
My biggest problem I feel is if I attempt to block anything from eth0 to br0 this will drop the bridge all together.
The entire network would be on the same subset however anything coming from eth0 to eth1 would be accepted.
Everything that's forwarded is handled by other chains, so if it's across the bridge it won't be affected.
The only time anything would be drop is if the eth0 attempted to access br0.
For iptables and birdges use the physdev module in iptables
I say semi because I want it to act as a transparent tap for all traffic moving through both sides of the bridge.
