Why not use gpg locally to encrypt the dumps to yourself?

Then you can transfer them over HTTP, or over FTP, or post them on usenet, or do as you please, without imperiling your security (well, you probably shouldn't post them to alt.binaries).
I'd do the decryption at home if the need ever arose.
It maybe a workaround, but it should accomplish the goal.
If you do this, don't forget to turn off ASCII-armouring for gpg, otherwise your backup file will get 30% bigger than it should be.
I do that with my colo'ed box's backups, and can then happily store them on my colo's online storage, without endangering myself.
Since you're already running apache, why not create a separated VirtualHost, a self-signed certificate and add basic auth to the directory where the database dumps are located?
That should allow you to securely download database dump files faster.
My colo'ed box doesn't need my private key, either - only the public one, to encrypt to.
