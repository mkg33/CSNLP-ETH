Now I can simply write shprop myfile.wtv in the command prompt to show its property dialog.
Surely, in 2013, Windows Explorer can open a directory with a few hundreds of files in it?
For instance, I wrote this simple Delphi program (and put the EXE in the System32 folder):
It's not a big deal, since I still can manage the files from within Windows Media Center, or using the command prompt, but it is annoying.
Of course I can write a small Win32 application calling ShellExecuteEx with the properties verb, but that's 'overkill', isn't it?
When I try to open this folder in Windows Explorer, the RAM usage goes to 100 %, and the entire computer freezes until I eventually manage to close the folder, one way or another.
Indeed, sometimes I want to watch the metadata associated with a movie without starting Media Center.
(Which is quite a feat, since Windows 7 usually is very stable.)
In my "Recorded TV" library, in which I store the movies that Windows Media Center record from my TV tuner card, I have about 400 movies (.dvr-ms and .wtv files), almost 2.4 TB of data.
A partial workaround is to make sure all the features one needs can be accessed through the command promt.
