After spending several hours trying various free programs to recover my folders and files from my Windows XP NTFS disk that has the isolated I/O error, I finally found Partition Recovery 3.7, by DiskInternals.
It works very reliably, but costs $100 USD (for the NTFS version).
It's very easy to use even without the Wizard that guides you through the recovery process.
I've used it to successfully recover files even after someone reformatted their hard drive.
The program has many other features that I didn't need to use.
An apparently independent review of this product is available.
It recovers both existing and deleted files, although I could easily choose to ignore the deleted files.
Sorry this sounds like an advertisement, but I'm really impressed with how well it worked.
I have no idea how it fares as compared with RecoverMyFiles.
It can save the recovered folders and/or files in a folder on any drive, including destination folders accessed by file sharing across a local network (LAN) on another computer's disk drive, FTP, and other methods.
The free versions of these programs show you information about the recovered files, but don't allow you to save them.
The free version will tell you if your files can be recovered, and the paid version is well worth the $70 to actually recover your data.
I'd say that price is well worth it if you really need your disk (or a single partition) recovered.
Whereas some recovery tools will recover files but scramble all the filenames, RecoverMyFiles can usually also recover the filenames.
