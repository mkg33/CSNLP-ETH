There are a few forensic programs that are relatively inexpensive but if you continue doing this you may want to look at a full blown eDiscovery suite and save yourself time and frustration.
I just completed a similar search through my Exchange using Sherpa Software's Discovery Attender.
I've only had experience with much older (and free) versions of Copernic Desktop Search, so I can't confirm whether "Drag and drop results" or "Export result list" would solve your problem, but it may be worth investigating.
I'm not sure what the best method from a server standpoint would be.
Worked through 10GB mailboxes in several hours, with more than 15 search terms.
In Copernic Desktop Search's feature list, it says:
Depending on the legal software they use I would give them PSTs that way they can create load files or review them natively.
I am not to up to date on programs like Concordance and Summation but I don't think they can view EDB files plus a smaller culled PST would be a lot easier to work with.
For my mailbox searching and indexing, I use Xobni, however given the size of the mailbox it may not be the optimal solution.
They have a trial version available that will search PST or mail store, advanced terms, and export to individual emails or PST with index.
