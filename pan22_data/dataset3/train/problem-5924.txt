Normally the operating system will need rebooting to apply patches long before either application will require it.
When you restart MySQL, all cached pages are freed and you need some time to warm up caches.
that doesn't perform proper internal housekeeping, such as closing file handles when they are no longer required.
Both Apache and MySQL are known to be very stable (unless you're running an alpha or beta version) and can run for years without issue.
MySQL uses lots of memory to cache data pages and indexes.
On highly loaded sites database restart could cause performance problems.
Your site is not heavily loaded (150k hits/week gives only 1req/4s), so MySQL restart should not cause big problems.
While not being the same as a memory leak the symptoms are the same.
You should avoid restarting MySQL whenever possible for performance reasons.
Memory leaks are the most common reason but there may be others, such as poorly written software (all too common!)
In order to understand when a system or service needs to be rebooted you first need to understand why.
