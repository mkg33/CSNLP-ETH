This looks encouraging, though I have not yet tried it:
The IIS logs only record querystring and header information without any POST data.
How does this differ from the other option offered here, with code in the global.asax.cs?
In either IIS6 or 7, you can use Application_BeginRequest in global.asax and create your own logging of POST data.
While I appreciate that this is an old question, I found this code gave me exactly what I needed, a text file with the complete request headers and the response, put it into your global.asax.cs:
This will create a text file for each and every request (including images) so be careful where you use it.
That would only work for ASP.NET page requests, not other pages IIS might process (php, cgi, jsp, cfml).
Try this in your web.config file to trace everything
If you're using IIS7, you can enabled Failed Request Tracing for status code 200.
That will record all of the data and you can select which type of data to include.

Or, in IIS7, you can write a HTTP Module with your own custom logging.
Try enabling the following in your IIS log settings:
The link I shared is to a module that one could enable in IIS for any site (or at the server level) to process for any type of request.
