She's not even sure about one of these messages' sender address... Just that it should 'look like an architect/contractor address'...
If so, how can I do it without letting her know I've done it?
I know how to use "Message Tracking" but it doesn't let me look at message content--just when it was delivered.
We use a 2003 Small Business Server with as many default-settings as I can muster, but one of our remote users recently complained that she was expecting a couple emails with some large attachments (...some time in the last 10 days).
I realize that--at some point--she's just screwed, but what do you think?
She says she's getting other emails, and as usual, the SBS "Failed Mail" folder only contains emails from wealthy, deposed African princes (not Qaddafi...yet).
This is my first question, so please be gentle... :-)
I've always avoided learning how to get into the mailboxes of other people, but after 5 years of annoying problems like this one, I'm starting to care less about the privacy of the sheep.
My primary job is to develop software, but my CS degree clearly makes me an expert on all things IT, right?
I'm a department of one for a small engineering company.
