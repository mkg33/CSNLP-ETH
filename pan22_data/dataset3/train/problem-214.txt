While nirsoft utility and Process Explorer work, i think they are meant for advanced users.
The only recourse I've found is either shutting down the system or using Sysinternal's sync tool to flush all the filesystem buffers and just yank the cord.
Disk write caching allows file transfers to and from removable disks to appear to go faster by actually occuring in the background and during system idle times.
After trying many tools i settled for Unlocker which helps in the scenarios where Windows complains about locked files etc.
For a quick get out if the way solution Unlocker works.
SuperFetch allows windows to use temporary storage as additional "RAM", moving the disk cache off the system drive.
Also, depending on your Windows version, there may be default apps using the drive.
When I do a "dirty" pull, I'll immediately reattach, run chkdsk, and be able to eject the drive normally afterwards.
No tool I've found is able to even display what resource is being held, and Process Explorer doesn't show any open handles to the device or any of its files.
ProcMon by Sysinternals would allow you to watch all file and registry activity and allows you to filter only those entries referencing your thumbdrive.
If Win7, check if SuperFetch is enabled on your USB thumb drives.
As per a prior answer, it's probably a good idea to make sure that the USB stick is set to be optimized for quick removal.
I see this randomly on NTFS-formatted external drives (both HD and Flash).
Even when they are set to "Optimize for Quick Removal" in Device Manager, something in the system (probably the filesystem driver) is holding onto something that it shouldn't.
In the Event Viewer (checked on windows 10) -> Windows Logs -> System - you can see what happened.
You can get it at http://www.filehippo.com/download_unlocker/.
This may be a more thorough way to telling each and every process that is using your drive.
