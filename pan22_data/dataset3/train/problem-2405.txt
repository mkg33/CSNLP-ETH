I'm using Cherokee as well and serve Wordpress (php fastcgi), Django (uWSGI) and Ruby on Rails (spawn-fgci) based projects on a cheap Rackspacecloud Server.
On top of that the administration has never been easier.
I'm running Cherokee since June on an Ubuntu dedicated server hosting my Web site called http://www.vehicall.com (mainly PERL scripts and JavaScript): it's quite fantastic for both speed and reliability points of vue !
So far it has been working flawlessly along with memcached with 25-50k requests per day, which is not very high but I am working on a multiple locations and CDN project that is going to be 250k+ request per day and Cherokee will most likely be our main http server.
Server issues are resolved quickly, support is superior!
I am using Cherokee as main http server in two servers for more than a year (php fcgi, recently php-fpm).
It works perfect, I never had a Cherokee-related issue.
I have many Cherokee installation as well, mostly with Wordpress and Drupal but lately I installed one with Django.
