: Sorry if my English is not perfect, I am working on it.
If anybody could help me with this I would be very grateful.
It seems to work, I can now add users and find them into Active Directory.
As I said, BES is installed on a VM under Windows 2008R2.
I have tried every single configuration for the SMTP Server, I enabled the LDAP routing and gave him the parameters of the Exchange Server.
However, according to the Administration Guide, it is apparently possible to activate it over an entreprise Wi-Fi network.
I did not find any thread anywhere with somebody who has down this before...
To do this, an SMTP service need to be configured, and will be use by the Blackberry Router.
I have been trying to get Blackberry Entreprise Server 5.0 running on my Windows 2008 VM.
I never had to deal with SMTP server and I am really not familiar with the concepts.
I checked with nslookup if I can resolve it, it works...
On the BES's VM, I installed an SMTP Server with IIS6, then I tried to send a message manually via telnet.
The next step for me would be to assign a device to a user, this device do not have any data plan.
The message is added to the queue but is never received in the mailbox of the receiver... On the event viewer of the VM I have an error message: "SMTP was unable to connect to an LDAP server".
I have an Exchange Server with AD on a server under Windows 2008R2.
