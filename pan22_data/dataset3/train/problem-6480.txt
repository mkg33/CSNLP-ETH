If your environment has the default MTU of 1500, and you introduce a device that has an MTU of 1460, this will slow down your network because all packets flowing through the device will be fragmented; when the 1500 packet hits the device with MTU of 1460 it will fragment the packet into two packets and transmit it.
Validate your findings and verify units; Megabit/sec and Megabyte or Kilobit and Kilobyte are not the same.

Throughput is conditional and depended on both host and network device settings.
When the window (setting in windows saying how much data to collect before it asks for validation/acknowledgement of receipt) fills up another set of acknowledgements are sent to start the next flow of data.
The significant variables in throughput are: Latency, Packet Size, and Retransmissions (quality).
With throughput defined as the amount of data transferred from point A to point B in a period of time.
If you have Jumbo frames enabled and your MTU is 9220 you will get much higher throughput, 5 times higher.
Each payload is larger even though the packet has the same latency.
TCP Basics:  TCP connections establish a session with a SYN, the receiving machine sends and ACK, Then data flows.
Use the Mathis Equation as a guide for what you could expect with the given data points for your network.
