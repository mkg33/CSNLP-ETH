Hi guys i just got a alfa AWUS036AC wireless adapter and i have been trying to get it to work with kali.
the adapter is not detected by kali and i can't connect to the internet with it however i have another wifi adapter that works fine with it.
Googling 0bda:8812 kali finds this thread which explains how to install the additional driver manually from the git repo.
This is the error message i get when i try to install the driver for it that i downloaded from the website.
The adapter came with a driver disc but when i go to open it file manager closes and all my desktop icons disappear.
More googling finds that under Ubuntu, there's now a DKMS package for it called rtl8812au-dkms.
So googling 0bda:8812 finds it's an RTL8812au chip which is (currently) not directly supported and needs an additional driver.
The trick to google for hardware support is to use the vendor and product ID (also shown by lsusb).
Manufacturers usually don't provide Linux drivers on the included driver disk.
This is what it says in 'dmesg' when i plug in the adapter.
Kali and Ubuntu are both based on Debian, so there's a chance Kali also has a similar package (or will have it in the near future).
Next i downloaded the driver from the website but it won't install.
