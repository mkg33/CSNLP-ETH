All of the hold downs are different depending on what socket you have, but not matter what, you need to remove them both.
Once you have done all that, put the heatsink and fan back on the CPU, tighten down the hold downs, plug the fan back in, and you should be set to go!
The same principles apply for a notebook, but it is harder to get to everything, and usually require removing the motherboard.
If you open the side of the tower you will see a 80mm fan on your motherboard.
That "goop" is called thermal paste, and is available at any local computer store or usually RadioShack.
There should be a (usually silver) block of metal underneath it.
You do not need to remove it, but you do need to clean the "goop" off of it with a lint-free cloth and some rubbing alcohol.
While you have your heatsink and fan removed, take it outside and blow it out with an air compressor or canned air.
Usually it is only a couple of plastic tabs or four screws that hold the fan to the heatsink.
Again - a local computer repair store or RadioShack.
Obviously power down the computer before attempting anything below.
You just want to squeeze a pea-sized amount on top of the middle of your CPU before you put your heatsink and fan back on.
