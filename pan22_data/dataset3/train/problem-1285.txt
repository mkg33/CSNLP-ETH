Post the code in question next time and it can be analyzed.
It would still be possible for an attacker to read all your files (for example, your database credentials).
You'll most likely be stuck with the manual clean-up unless they (and you OK) a restore a recent, clean copy.
You then need to chown each users files to be owned by their own user, and chmod then 755.  suPHP will run each users code as their own user, which will prevent this type of attack.
If you aren't the operator of this server, there's very little you can do.
In the meantime, you should ensure all of your applications and system libraries are up to date with the latest security patches.
However, this will only stop your files from being modified.
Then, all it takes is one vulnerable script by any customer on the machine, and everyone is essentially hacked.
Unless you can convince your host to change to suPHP or similar, I would strongly suggest looking for another host ASAP.
You can try chomodding everything to 755, and making sure the owner of everything is your user instead of 'apache' or 'nobody'.
I've seen this happen numerous times and typically when it was in all files it was executed via a web-based file management.
Needless to say, since you haven't gotten a response from the host yet I'd begin looking for a new company.
If you are the host, rebuild apache (with easyapache), and enable the suPHP option.
I'd still look into moving to another company based off of their slow response.
What likely happened is the server was running every users code under the same user (probably 'apache' or 'httpd').
Are you running the shared hosting environment, or are you a customer?
It sounds like your sites have been victim to a worm which is injecting HTML/code into your files.
It is either being injected via SQL injection to a database for your website or it was upload/exploited via an online File Mananger.
