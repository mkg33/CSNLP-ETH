route add 10.2.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.5.5.1 (where 10.5.5.1 is the gateway IP to the 10.2.2.0 network).
You'd also have to set it up the other way around as well!
Much Unix lore still talks about "gateways" for what more acuurately is "router".
Router A has two networks, Port A 10.5.5.1/24 and Port B 10.2.2.2/24
The reason is to prevent packages to be ping-pong for ever, for example, if router A routes package to router B, while router B routes the same package to router A.
And this is independent from internal/external routers.
route add 10.5.5.0 255.255.255.0 10.2.2.2  (where 10.2.2.2 is the gateway IP to the 10.5.5.0 network).
But the Internet protocols are ubiquous today, so true gateways are far in between).
You could do that, but you must specify the route from host to gateway must go through the internal router
Every time when an IP packet passes a router/gateway hop count is decremented.
Can the gateway be the next next hop, if there is an internal router in the private network?
The original Internet people talked about "gateway", a term the OSI people took to mean something else, and named that thing a "router".
BTW, this is the way how traceroute command  works.
Router B has two networks, Port A 10.2.2.1/24 and Port B 10.2.2.1/24
The packet is 'killed' then hop count equals to zero.
To set it up correctly, you would have to create routes like this:
now lets say you connect Port B of Router A to Port B of Router B, You would be able to "see" Router A from Router B with no problems, however, Router B cannot see the network 10.5.5.1 on Router A by default.
