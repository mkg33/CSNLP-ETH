You need to configure your client as a RP in ADFS.
Since my web app is on another server also on another domain, my client will have to specify that the claims made from my server are trusted.
is in a different domain and therefore not domain joined, you will not be able to use IWA.
Before we were connecting our app directly to the ad using LDAPS.
I suggest reviewing https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh873308(v=vs.110).aspx which shows how wif is used in a scenario like this.
Thanks in advance, im kind of more lost than before the beginning of my search.
You will need on your server (relying party) some middleware like wif or owin to consume incoming token and code your app to be claims aware.
My Client is now using ADFS and want to close the LDAPS "gateway"
I'm creating a web application that will be used by users that are included in an Active Directory.
Client will be the identity provider ad fs who validates credentials.
they will install ad fs and create a relying party that points to your app.
How you configure it depends on the protocol you want to use.
If you want to use a proxy, that's installed on domaina.
You really should look for developers guidance in stackoverflow than the it pro view on serverfault.
I can't use the integrated visual studio tool to connect to ADFS because I have a mixed authentification (Database and ADFS)
The ADFS will be on the same domainController as the AD.
