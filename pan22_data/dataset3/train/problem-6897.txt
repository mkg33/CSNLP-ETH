Since you cannot remove/uninstall the Hyper-V switch through
Determine which network switch is the Hyper-V Switch, right click and uninstall it.
Had to roll back to 10240, at least roll back worked like a charm.
and right click on your primary network adapter, hit properties, and uncheck the "Hyper-V Extensible Virtual Switch".
However, rejoice, as now that the device has been manually removed you can now remove the virtual switch from the Virtual Switch Manager without error.
The only choice left is to open the device manager.
After doing so, you should see the other checkboxes populate automatically, if it doesn't for some reason, go through them and check what you need.
Since we manually removed the adapter, the Virtual Switch Manager did NOT restore the switch to its original settings.
After uninstalling the switch from the device manager, the record will still be left in your Hyper-V Manager's Virtual Switch Manager.
note: I used 10586.14 to upgrade but a colleague could solve this way with 10586.3 (original RTM of v1511).
Now, when configuring a Hyper-V Switch, the actual physical adapter is set as a Hyper-V Extensible Switch.
DISCLAIMER: YOU WILL MOST LIKELY LOSE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY ON THE HOST PC/SERVER UNTIL THE FINAL STEP

In this list you will find the Hyper-V Switch, but it will most likely NOT have the name you gave it.
...and on my PC, I couldn't even remove Hyper-V, after reboot: failed to ocnfigure.. undoing changes.
Hit OK, confirm the notice that will say you may experience network interruption, and you are back to having internet on your PC/Server and are now able to Re-create your Virtual Switch for your Hyper-V Virtual Machines.
Bummer, since win8.1 - win10 10240 upgrade was fine :(
