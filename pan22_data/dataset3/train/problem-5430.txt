Any pointers would be super helpful since my brain is fried reading/trying vector and matrix rotations.
I have a fiddle with what I'm working on here https://jsfiddle.net/2v4ezmaz/2/
My brain is thinking of it as needing to reset the rotation back to its default then apply Z rotation and apply the Y rotation, but that can't be right.
So I'm new to working with a 3D space and not sure how to fix my problem, I basically have a turret that rotates along its Z axis, and pitches along it's Y but after rotating 180 on the Z axis the turret points down as I completely understand despite being unexpected.
So the question is, how do I make it rotate like it does in blender where the barrel end stays pointing up while rotating the z?
I need to use quaternions but I can't logically see what needs to happen.
After lots of reading it's all to do with cross vectors since the .rotation property is euler angles which I think is my problem.
After reading http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/07/Linear-algebra-for-game-developers-part-4 I'm sure my answer is there somewhere but I cant think what the code needs to be to do what i want.
