Tracing the execution of nautilus shows that the slowness is due to a combination of two factors:
It fixed my problem, along with the problem of Chrome not opening files correctly after they download.
You can do this in "System -> Preferences -> Assistive Technologies".
Thunar is much faster at loading directory listings and more stable for copying files from my NTFS usb hard drive to ext4, though with large sets of files it seems to have trouble like Nautilus.
Try using an alternative file manager such as Thunar.
I had one network drive as a bookmark ... this might have been the reason why nautilus was taking several seconds to load.

If you have xfce installed in a Gnome system and you're never using it, remove exo-utils
To fix it delete all your bookmarks, restart and then add back the ones you can't live without.
Using strace I realised that nautilus was stating lots of files for every view.
I think nautilus is trying to pre-cache these bookmarks.
It also helped me enormously to turn off "Assistive Technologies".
You'll have to log out and back in for the latter change to take effect.
Even files that were not in directory I was browsing during the trace.
In the "Preview" tab under "Edit -> Preferences", try switching all the options to "Never".
I finally figured out what is making nautilus so slow: bookmarks.
