So I put a hub (10/100Mbit) behind the WAN connection and connected a laptop with wireshark on it.
I have a 100 Mbit WAN connection and want to check the load on it for a week.
Enable SNMP on the WAN device and use MRTG or cacti to get a graph of the traffic.
Don't use wireshark, you're getting way too much detail (unless you need that detail).
While you certainly can monitor all traffic flows with Wireshark you'll be stuck reconstructing all of those flows to get any type of aggregate usage data.
Here is now my question - can i print a report or graph with the dump i create?
If the WAN device doesn't support SNMP, then by all means use the hub and the laptop to get to the data.
I'd agree with @kce and @wolfgangsz that wireshark isn't the best tool for the job, but as you've already got the data then I'd suggest looking at the wiki page for Wireshark and picking one of the tools from there.
Or can i put the wireshark in a special measure mode ;-) so it doesnt capture the whole packages and just read the load?
If you are unsure on how to use MRTG, put a comment here and I'll provide more detail.
As others have stated in their answers, Wireshark is not really the tool for the job.
