Apache is able to forward .php requests to the fcgi proxy and PHP executes correctly.
Any suggestions for simulating a standard mod_php setup but actually proxying through fcgi?
Since this is the only post or article I was able to find that helped me to adequately solve the issue, I wanted to add my solution to the mix.
I am migrating my server to use mod_proxy_fcgi and php-fpm instead of mod_php.
My ErrorDocument rule isn't invoked, and DirectoryIndex index.php  index.html doesn't fall back to index.html.
message , this fixed my issue and allowed me to setup a 404 page :
Or you can wait for Apache 2.4.10, which should include the module.
You'll need a recent Apache 2.4 (RedHat back ported that to 2.4.6)
I had precisely the same problem as ide and spent far longer trying to solve this than I had hoped.
However, the Apache documentation does not recommend RewriteRule: "This is because this flag triggers the use of the default worker, which does not handle connection pooling."
To solve the 301 redirects (#2), I'll simply leverage the error handler to issue redirects.
Ideally, I think I'd either like to use ProxyPass in a FilesMatch block (currently unsupported), or define a new handler that proxies through fcgi and use it to handle .php requests, similar to what mod_php does.
Unfortunately, Apache forwards all .php requests to the proxy, even when the file doesn't exist.
I had same issue when file did not existed was showing "File not found."

I was able to fix these problems with mod_rewrite:
