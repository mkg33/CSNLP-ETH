I can navigate to the address in my browser and up pops the web GUI from that machine.
On one machine I created an IP alias using the following commands from http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialNetworking.html#NETWORKALIASING (edit to fit my network):
Google only shows me how to create an alias, not really how the aliasing works.
Since the IP is set manually, without DHCP, you just have to know it's there; its not until that IP traverses the gateway to the outside Internet that the router adds it to the "Active Clients" list.
My question is: how does the router see the aliased IP?
So on my other machine I manually entered a static IP to test if it was just that static IPs don't show up -- In theory they should right?
You would have to port forward to this address and connect from the outside for it to show.
I checked the router to see if the IP address was registered as a static IP or whatever to the same hostname.
To get to the Internet, you have to pass the gateway which logs clients.
On my Win7 host machine, I have two VMs which I test network/server stuff.
