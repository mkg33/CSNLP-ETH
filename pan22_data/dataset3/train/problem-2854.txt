Make sure your Bluetooth speaker is all charged up and ready to go, then switch it on.
It should connect to the device, shown by a few information bars on the connection strength – if it then suddenly disconnects straight afterwards, you may need to right-click on it again and hit Connect.
Follow this up by installing the Raspberry Pi Bluetooth software and the excellent Blueman Bluetooth manager:
It’s best to start by making sure your version of Raspbian Jessie (this won’t work on Wheezy) is up to date.
If you want to check whether the speaker is actually looking, you could always find out if a mobile phone or tablet is able to see it.
Don’t pair with it, though, as that might cause problems in the future.

Test it out by playing a video on YouTube; it may work straight away like this!
Open up Blueman by going to the program menu, Preferences, and Bluetooth Manager.
I believe Google is upgrading the chromecast to alow it to recieve bluetooth audio.
As long as the speaker is still trying to sync, clicking Search should make it show up in the interface.
You may need to reboot after this, but you’ll probably be fine to carry on to the next step.
If there’s a syncing button or sequence for it to start searching to pair with devices, press it/do it and head back to the Raspberry Pi.
If this is the case, it’s best to install some extra software to try to get it working.
Depending on how your Pi is set up, the Bluetooth audio might not work at step 3.
Open up the terminal again and install PulseAudio and its Bluetooth module:
While Bluetooth is on the Raspberry Pi 3, you need to install a few bits of software to make sure it works properly.
There's a Debian installation that works under Raspbian.
