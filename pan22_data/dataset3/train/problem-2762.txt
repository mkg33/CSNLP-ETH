Thank you for all your suggestions, apparently all I ever need is ipconfig /flushdns
You can also watch tcpdump to see what is happening to your traffic when you try to connect to these sites:
Davidgo is right this is a most likely a MTU issue ; either your local machine has wrong MTU settings or there is a mismatch in MTUs in your connection to the internet meaning one of the network devices is not broadcasting on the same MTU; inquire with your ISP for the correct MTU settings(it varies according to country,standards and the ISP's infra) then make sure all the devices in your local network are using the the same MTU as provided by the ISP
