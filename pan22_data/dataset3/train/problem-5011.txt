So I dug a little deeper and found a systemd socket config file for Docker:
When I look at the docker.service configuration file, I get the impression Docker is only listening on a file descriptor (--host=fd://).
However, when I check the listening ports via netstat, I see the following:
I'm reading through the systemd configurations for Docker on CoreOS trying to figure out how the TCP port for Docker (port 2375) gets enabled.
This seems to be what's providing the listening service at port 2375 (the default Docker port), because when I stop it (using systemctl stop docker-tcp.socket) and restart the Docker service (using systemctl restart docker.service), port 2375 no longer shows up in netstat.
So, my question is this... does the docker-tcp.socket config actually enable the local TCP interface as a --host option to Docker, or does Docker by default listen on the local TCP interface when fd:// is specified a a --host option, or is the docker-tcp.socket config somehow setting up a mapping from 0.0.0.0:2375 to /var/run/docker.sock at the OS level?
