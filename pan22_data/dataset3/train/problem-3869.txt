This is really problematic because I like to run other audio programs while I'm working in Bitwig and/or watch tutorial videos on Youtube.
Is there a solution or work around that anyone can think of?
I run a DAW (digital audio workstation) and everything I am reading tells me I want to use the ASIO driver to minimize latency and maximize performance.
Tech involved: Windows 10, Bitwig Studio 2, ASIO driver, DJM-900 (used as Audio interface running the speakers)
When I click the "Activate Audio Engine" I get the same error message.
I haven't found too much on this issue but I read something about the AISO driver taking up the entire sound card, if that makes any sense.
In order to get Bitwig to play audio I need to close the browser or iTunes or whatever and then I can activate the audio driver in Bitwig but now I'm back to where I was ie one application at a time.
If I want to say watch a video I need to close Bitwig, close my browser (this is if the browser was already opened on the video), re-launch the browser and then I can watch the video with audio.
I am running into a problem on my computer running Windows 10 that I never encountered before on OS X.
The other driver options are JACK(which doesn't seem to work at all) and Windows WASAPI driver (which does allow other applications to play audio while running Bitwig)
If I then try to open Bitwig (with the video playing) Bitwig opes and shows this message: "ASIOStart returned error code: Not present."
When I set Bitwig's "Audio Model" to ASIO I experience this issue:
I can not play audio from any other applications while I am using Bitwig.
