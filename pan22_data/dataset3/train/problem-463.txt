SourceForge is a great place for the code repository, version control, bug tracking, etc.
I picked them because they have trivially easy wordpress.
On top of that, there are some hosting companies around that specialise in hosting wordpress, or at least, can set up wordpress for you easily.
I would use something like sourceforge (www.sf.net) that just builds and hosts the site for you, and is meant for software projects.
For hosting an open source project, something like SourceForge or CodePlex seem like natural candidates to me.
2- Go to DreamHost, setup hosting for your domain, and so the one-click install of WordPress.
If you're looking for quick and dirty you might want to set up a website in a hosted service.
If not, you can look at something like the Google Sites.
As a coder, you might find it easier than a wysiwyg editor.
There's a learning and administration cost to using your own non-hosted portal site.
Were I in your shoes, I would get the project itself into SourceForge, then setup a site using WordPress.
But it is probably not what you want in terms of discussion, promotion, etc.
There are different ways to approach it, like creating your own portal site similar to Metadot or Zope.
Otherwise sites using Metadot will let you edit things with a WYSIWYG interface, although personally I've had some issues with an upgrade that killed some PERL dependencies in Metadot and I've never personally admin'ed a site with ZOPE, but there's plenty of books out there on it.
OR, you could simply sign up for a blog at wordpress.com, and host the code on launchpad or similar :)
Finally, if your project gets fairly big, setup a StackExchange site for it!
The question there is whether you want to take the responsibility for hosting it yourself or not.
If you want something more personal; you said that you have written an application, solearning basic HTML with an 'in a nutshell' book and some basic web framework like Django probably won't take as long as you may think.
WordPress is an open source content management system, and it is easy to get started yet very powerful.
You want a simple CMS for the "word-like" editing.
--> Note: I like DreamHost, but there are tons of hosting companies.
