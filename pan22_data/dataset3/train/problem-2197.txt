You can verify that by going to your /var/log/secure on the node1 server.
I generated a key-pair (without password) with ssh-key-gen on my local machine.
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
PS: In fact this part of a script to autoconfigure access from the master to the node1 because I will install Openshift and it needs to access to node with ssh to configure it.
As ssh-copy-id did not work I did the thing manually.
Then I uploaded the the private key on my remote master (created ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
You are most likely getting that error because of the command missing the key.
I think this error is coming from the fact that I am not using the key.
I am currently trying to access to a remote host (let's say node1) using ssh from another (master).
Once this is configured, all you need to do is ssh node1 going forward.
However I would like to be able to connect just by typing  ssh user@node1
So I was able to connect to node1 from master by typing
Then I went to my node1 and added the public key in the authorized_key
