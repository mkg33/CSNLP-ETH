WINS is used primarily for using NetBIOS names between subnets.
Exchange 2000 and 2003 do need WINS in larger organizations with multiple subnets.
You'll need to update shortcuts and links to reflect these changes.
You should check with each software vendor to ensure their application will work wihtout WINS.
For example, \server1\share\file.txt would be accessed by \server1.example.com\share\file.txt.
Of course you'll need to test and communicate these changes to end-users.
Most organizations running Windows Server 2003 or 2008 networks do not need WINS, except for legacy applications (as you have asked about).
Also, if you are using shares or accessing device by the NetBIOS name and you are disabling NetBIOS from your network, you will need to access devices and shares using the FQDN.
Microsoft's best practice is to move away from WINS and NetBIOS entirely.
If you do not have multiple subnets, then you do not need WINS, as your Domain controllers will manage the names properly.
It is possible in some cases to resolve naming issues by setting default DNS suffix on client machines (best practice: set through DHCP), which appends the dns suffix to any single-name queries.
