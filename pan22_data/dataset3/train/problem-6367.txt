the same statement, run from SSMS has been running for 7 minutes..
Have you compared the execution plans from both servers?
Then open a new query window, press CTRL + D (to ensure results output to grid) and run your query again.
it is possible (but not likely) that when you return the results on the server you are starving the server for resources because of the need to display all the results in SSMS.
I've seen 45 minute queries before, but never anything in the realms of something as simple as "select col1 from table".
I have noticed the same thing, it seems to be a SSMS issue....
Have you checked to see if you have any blocking, or resource waits on your production server?
same machine, same DB, same code, one run from c# project, the other run from SSMS, there must be a bug or issue with SSMS
this statement, run from code, executed in 5 seconds..
ALTER TABLE xxx ADD XID_New BIGINT NOT NULL CONSTRAINT DF_xxx DEFAULT 0
Even 60 seconds should retrieve hundreds of thousands of records in that time.
In SSMS on the server go to Tools->Options->Query Results->SQL Server->Results to Grid.
That said, I've no idea why this might be acting like that, but I would look into your indexes on your tables to see if they're appropriate, or if they even exist, and then run the query optimiser to get its opinion.
Have you tried querying your production server locally, when the results slow down?
ALTER TABLE xxx ADD XID_New BIGINT NOT NULL CONSTRAINT DF_xxx DEFAULT 0
