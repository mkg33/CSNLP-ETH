additional non-existing screens, but only one displayed content.
My laptop has intel HD4600 which after upgrading to Win 10 was not willing to use more than one screen.
Right click anywhere on your screen and select "Graphic Properties".
For a Lenovo T530 using Intel HD Graphics 4000 and Nvidia NVS 5400M, upgrading to Intel Driver 15.33.39.4276 (released 9/19/2015) did NOT solve multi-monitor issues.
However, notebook display and two external screens work fine as soon as I deactivate the Intel graphics card in device manager.
The current installed Win10 driver was 154028.4501 with release date of Aug 12, 2016.
When the Intel HD Graphics Control Panel comes up click the "Display" tab.
Right under Intel HD Graphics Control Panel is a "Display" with a dropdown arrow.
Besides the two external monitors, it detected 4 (four!)
I downgraded the driver to the previous version (release date of 17th June, 2016) and every thing is fine.
Click the dropdown and select "Multiple Displays".
Intel Graphics control does only show my notebook display in the drop down-list under "Display".
I am really happy to have an NVidia graphics card built in, otherwise I could not use external screens under Windows 10 as it seems...
