And you can create self-extracting zip executables, in case the recipient doesn't know what to do with a .tar or .gz file.
Locate the file or folder that you want to compress.
Right-click the file or folder, point to Send to, and then click Compressed (zipped) folder.
I would recommend you get 7zip and RTFM as to how to use it on the command line.
The files are small, so compression rate and size do not play any role.
But I am not shure about that because I always used WinZip and/or Winrar (not free).
I think Windows itself can allready unpack zip-files.
I am working in the Windows 7 and prefer to do the mentioned operation from the command line.
I just one to have an easy way to put 10 files into one and then easily to extract these 10 files.
It is inconvenient for me all 10 files and it will be inconvenient for the receiver to download all 10 files (it can be annoying to do the same operation 10 times).
In the directory, where I have my 10 files, I have many other files which I would not like to include into the archive.
Put the 10 files you want to archive in a new directory (for example "zip"), make right-click on the folder and select "zip".
Info-Zip is one free one that I've use quite a bit.
A new compressed file is created in the same location.
With 7zip you can create a .tar archive, .zip, or a .7z archive.
I would like to put all 10 files into one files (I think it can be done as archive).
He needs to install Freezip or an other archive-manager that can handle zip.
