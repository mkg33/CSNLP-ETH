that $A$ is a NFA without $\epsilon$-transitions recognizing $L_k$.
It can be seen that if two words of $L_i$ have a different set of letters, then they cannot lead to the same state starting from $q_0$.
It follows that the number of states at level $i$ is at least $\binom{|\Sigma|}{i}$, and thus the total number of states is at least $\sum_{i = 0}^{k} \binom{|\Sigma|}{i} = O(|\Sigma|^k)$.

The following paper reports on an implementation of the Kameda-Weiner algorithm for computing a minimal NFA, as well on an approach using a SAT solver.

I don't know whether the implementation is available, but perhaps you can contact the authors about this.
Reducing Nondeterministic Finite Automata with SAT Solvers.
There is an elementary argument showing that a minimal NFA must have $O(|\Sigma|^k)$ states, so I guess the standard construction is essentially optimal.
