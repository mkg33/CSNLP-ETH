...in the end, if you did it that way you'd be storing the player's current level.
As experience is earned, you can add the percentage amount of experience to the player's current XP percentage.
The RPG I worked on stored both the level as well as the current percentage to next level, instead of just a raw XP amount on the player.
We did this so that if we ever wanted to change the values in the experience tables, the player wouldn't see a sudden drop or rise in level.
For instance, imagine your player has 1000 XP, which is enough to make him 50% through 3rd level.
If we were to suddenly make it so that 1000 XP is actually only 90% through 1st level, the next time the player plays the game you would need to level the character back down to 1st level.
Most RPGs are actually designed so that the amount of experience given for an encounter is easily converted to this percentage.
If the percentage is ever greater than 100%, increment the level of the player, subtract 100% away from the experience, and for the extra amount over 100% give them something like:
