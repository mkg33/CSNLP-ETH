You can workaround this bug by doing system level mounting, just add the drive to /etc/fstab:
This usually auto-mounts at /media/backups (since "backups" is the partition label for the single partition on the drive.)
When I'm logged in, it's always mounted and visible, but when the background process is running, it sometimes isn't.
I have a cron-scheduled backup task, that writes to a USB drive.
If you're not in the mood to hand-edit your /etc/fstab file, I'd suggest trying out PySDM to define the rules for mounting your external drive on a regular basis.
you can get the UUID of the partition using blkid:
It's always physically connected, but on a fairly regular basis, the mount point isn't there.
It can be installed by installing the "pysdm" package in Synaptic, or by searching the Ubuntu Software Center for "pysdm".
Once installed, it is available under the System --> Administration --> Storage Device Manager..
(It's a SATA drive stuck in an external dock that is connected to my machine via USB.)
I'm not sure, but I think the mounting is done by userland (that is, it's mounted only after you log in).
