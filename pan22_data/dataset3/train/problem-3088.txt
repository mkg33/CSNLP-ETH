Clone HDD to another by this software super easy: HDDRawCopy1.10Portable.exe and free
Just remember to mark partition as active because snapshot only copy data
In that case, you must make the new partition on the device at least 10GB larger than the original image size (uncompressed).
I just did this, and I'll be honest - Win7 installed so quickly on the SSD, I kind of enjoyed the fresh install.
It allows you to restore to any partition size granted that the new partition is at least as large as the original image.
For windows 10 you can use: snapshot.exe and then use USB windows 10 installer then run repair options and its done.
Is no easy way, spend like 4 hours try to copy windows 7 to another HDD nothing is free, everything from google is paid and not working
Windows 7's built-in backup feature makes this very easy, as long as you have another (third) drive to store the backup on.
I'm not sure how happy the windows drivers will be with a straight up copy - the reinstall may involve the least amount of time investment.
Note, that sometimes it will refuse to restore to a different partition size or new hard drive/SSD.

I just did this this weekend, and it worked perfectly.
Acronis True Image Home can do exactly what you ask.
There is a free trial of Backup Exec System recovery Symantec BU Exec Home Page.
Symantec Backup Exec System Recovery or GHOST will do this as well.
Some SSD vendores have a tool for their drives for just this scenario.
