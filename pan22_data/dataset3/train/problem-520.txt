If you can start with a fresh image, I highly recommend them.
When trying to build the VMware tools in my Ubuntu 9.10 64 bit guest on a VMware Server 2.0.2 host with Debian 5 I'm getting strange errors like:
Older VMware products that do not support these newer distros will often have trouble compiling the VMware Tools against the newer kernels.
http://chrysaor.info have done a bunch of work to create various Ubunutu VMWare Images that you can simply install and run.
I googled half the Internet but couldn't come to a solution.
The kernel headers can change a bunch and the source VMware ships for the various Tools modules doesn't change unless you upgrade to a new version.
While googling I read something about a bug in this kernel tree.
Try the vmware tools package from a later version of VMweare (player 3 for example) Server 2.02 isn't supported with Ubuntu 9.10
They also have scripts to build and install VMTools onto Ubuntu: http://chrysaor.info/?page=faq but do not seem to have a script for 9.10 available.
Why not just use open-vm-tools and open-vm-source?
Ubuntu and VMWare do not, in my experience, play well together.
None of the kernel modules seems to build correctly.
