You can then leave the administrative account out of the security-filtered group.
When you need to access the drive, you will need to switch users (log in to Windows with your unrestricted administrative credentials).
You can launch explorer.exe as a separate user, but it requires making some registry changes.
You can apply group policy on a per-user (or per-group) basis in a standalone environment, but it is more difficult.
By setting the same policy under User Configuration instead, you can apply the policy to a group of users (using security filtering), including your non-administrative account.
The following solution works in a domain environment and does not require the use of any third-party utilities.
NOTE: The above is written for domain environments, where the policy can be applied per-user using domain group policy management.
Setting the Removable Storage Access policy under Computer Configuration applies the policy to the whole computer.
