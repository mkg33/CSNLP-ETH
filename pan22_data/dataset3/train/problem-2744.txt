So, How can I determine which mac address I must take on PC2?

What I'm trying to say is: How can I know which interface I use to send traffic from PC1 to PC2 ?
The user @Mark Wagner has tried to help me, and he wrote the following explanation:
But I don't understand how to calculate the xor function.
According to the above example (I send traffic from PC1 to PC2 using eth1 on PC1 and eth2 on PC2).
Thus, following the example above, if I disable eth1 on PC2, traffic will being sent, even though there is an interface disabled.
My main question is: How can I select an active slave or other to send traffic from a peer to other peer?
 * Hash for the output device based upon layer 2 data
(This formula was extracted from bonding.txt - see the quotation below, at the end)
My previous message (closed message): http://goo.gl/aJqQ2
And I know the hash function (I'd like to thank the user @Mark Wagner)
On each computer, I have installed two NIC's (Network cards).
(source MAC XOR destination MAC) modulo slave count
But, my problem starts here, due to I can't understand how the kernel selects an interface or other.
Sometimes , I notice that all traffic is placed on the same slave (for example, from PC1 to PC2, all traffic will be placed on eth2 of PC2 {MAC = 62:25:BC:06:59:E9} from eth1 of PC1{MAC = 62:25:BC:06:4F:A6}).
Assuming the defaults, the MAC addr of your bonds are PC1: 62:25:BC:06:4F:A6 and PC2: 62:25:BC:06:5A:1B.
At my private lab, I have 2 computers (PC1 and PC2, running linux/ubuntu) with 4 NIC's.
But, what policy must I follow to select the properly MAC Address (eth1 or eth2)?
I'm trying to understand the operation of all modes (Mode 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).
I understand how all modes work, except the mode 2(balance-xor) and 4(802.3ad).
So, I will try rewrite the question, explaining all details.
It does not matter whether the interface eth1 on PC2 is up or down.
I'm trying to understand how to select the properly mac address, when I use bonding, in the mode 2 (Balance XOR - default option layer2).
static int bond_xmit_hash_policy_l2(struct sk_buff *skb, int count)
So, when the driver bonding is loaded, I can see 3 interfaces (bond0, eth1 and eth2) on each PC (eth1 and eth2 are slaves).
A few days ago, I wrote a question here, but that question was ambiguous.
