Pay for RHEL or if you know what you're doing or don't care, use CentOS because it's as close a production OS for Oracle as you'll get without buying RHEL.
I finally gave up and switched to RedHat and had it up and running in one day.
Is this for development or personal use or for production?
You may be better off biting the bullet and installing on RHEL or CentOS (not Fedora Core) because RHEL is supported and CentOS is known to work, being derived from RHEL sources.
Nothing against Ubuntu but Oracle is a finicky beast an it is best not to stray too far from the supported platforms especially if this is a production setup.
If you don't need it, don't use it because it's a severe pain for a neophyte to manage.
I spent about a week last fall pulling my hair out trying to get Oracle 10g installed on Ubuntu.
People run Oracle for two reasons - either they need the reliability and features of Oracle, or they're running it because someone else told them to (vendor, administrator, client, etc.)
As a note... last time I installed Oracle, it depended on some binary packages that were 32bit, so I had to install the ia32-libs package ( aptitude install ia32-libs ) , for it to work...
Do a google search for some keywords in this space - there's quite a good chance you will come up with relevant documents.
I like Ubuntu too, but it's the wrong platform in this case.
There are quite a few oracle-on-linux HOWTO documents on the web.
If you do need it, you obviously have deep pockets - don't waste your time trying to get Oracle running on a desktop OS.
Again, while Ubuntu LTS may work nicely for 90% of your infrastructure, Oracle is very demanding - deviate from supported configurations at your peril.
I'd review the release notes for Oracle to see if Ubuntu is supported, but further, I'd ask yourself why you want Oracle on Ubuntu.
