And I rather not use third party program that hasn't released update since more than 3 years... pretty dangerous if the security isn't improved.
If you are just looking for basic functionality those will work just fine.
We've used it for years and I think our developers find it works well for them.
It's a good tool, you just have to create a connection (ip, port, databasename, and so on...) And you can interact with your database, you can do almost anything (if you're connected as root), a very complete tool.
But it's not as friendly as phpmyadmin, but still better (well, at least for me.)
I don't want to give our developers access to our production SQL Servers so a web based solution is ideal for us.
Typically you wouldn't want to expose your Microsoft SQL Servers to the public net.
The web interfaces that you found will probably do the trick, but without providing access to some of the newer features.
The nice thing about SQL Server is that anything you can do in SSMS you can do in T/SQL so if the web interface you have doesn't provide functionality you can still manage and use those features using T/SQL.
You would normally connect via VPN then use SQL Server Management Studio to connect.
As mrdenny says, there is no default web interface for mssql.
I think it's crazy that there's not a official web based tool like phpMyadmin for MSSQL.
I find it strange that it's not been mentioned here.
