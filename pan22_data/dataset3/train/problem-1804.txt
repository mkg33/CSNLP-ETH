Unfortunately, the drive is slowing down to a crawl whenever there are writes to it (e.g.
I have a 2009 first-generation 64 GB SSD drive (manufacturer: G.Skill) that acts as my boot disk for Windows 7.
I've installed new applications and media on another hard drive, but the OS is on the SSD.
If you want to you could use an ubuntu livecd and dd to do it although clonezilla or ghost will probably be easier.
I suspect the SSD is wearing down, so I would like to duplicate its entire contents, including its "bootability" (boot sector?)
Depending on how you do the cloning you may end up with a partition the same size as your original disk rather than filling the new one, if you do an ubuntu livecd comes with an application called gparted that will let you grow the partition to fill the drive.
Just clone the drive, and it will be exactly like the old one (but bigger) if its of the same type.
If you have problems booting from the cloned disk you might need to run the windows 7 startup repair from the install DVD.
There are various bits of software that will let you clone your drive, clonezilla or ghost are examples.
