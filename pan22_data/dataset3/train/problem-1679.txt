The relation is partial if we exclude the "undefined" functions, that is the functions which "loop" for some well-formed input.
Finally, the field of constructive mathematics has seen the appearance of related notions, in particular the Set Theory of Bishop involves describing a set by giving both elements and an explicit equality relation, which must be an equivalence.
Another way to see these models are as a (very) special case of the simplicial set models of Homotopy Type Theory.
In that framework, types are interpreted as (a generalization of), sets with relations, and relations between those relations, etc.
At the lowest level, we simply have the PER models.
It's natural to expect some principles of constructive mathematics make their way into type theory.
Since every function in the polymorphic calculus is computable, it's natural to interpret a type by a set of numbers which represent the computable functions of that type.
Furthermore, it's tempting to identify functions with the same extensional behavior, thus leading to an equivalence relation.
Another possible answer different from Andrej's is the given by the example of the $\omega$-set model of polymorphism.
