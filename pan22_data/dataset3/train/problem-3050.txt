The appliance VM is set up to use VLAN12, which is the same VLAN as my PC, unfortunately when the VM tries to ping anything outside itself, I get a "destination host unreachable".
If it was copied make sure the MAC address wasn't copied from one VM to the other inadvertently.
I don't have those options in VMWare - just the VLAN options.
I've read a lot of people having issues with Ubuntu (which I believe is what the appliance is based on), VMware and the network problem but the solution tends to be "switch to bridged mode."
Also, was your Virtual Appliance copied from another VM or installed from an OVF template?
I have a VMWare ESXi cluster running many Windows and Linux VMs perfectly.
I have installed the Turnkey Linux Redmine appliance, and am having a lot of trouble getting the networking to work properly.
Before boot machine, look at network options in wmvare, and experiment set to NAT or bridget, in my case that always solve problems with download appliances
I know you've stated that the pinging from your linux server to your PC on the same subnet isn't possible but that seems bizzare.. A couple of things to check and post back:
This is the same when I try to ping the VM from my PC.
Can anyone shed any light on this or point me in the right direction?
I know you may well have done all this already but it may possible shed some light on it.
