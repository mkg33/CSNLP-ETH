If the game does not need to use the windows registry the game may work.
Whilst these virtual machines do not use all of the resources from your main PC, these old games do not have very high recommended specifications so these virtual machines should be plenty powerful enough.
If not you can try VMWare and install your own copy of windows XP onto that.
If you have Windows 7 Professional (or ultimate) you can install Microsofts XP Mode which gives you a XP virtual machine.
I have had the same problem with some old games in the past that just refuse to install to 64 bit windows no matter what.
Modern machines are strong enough to be able to run 2D graphics on VMs.
In regards to Zr40's comment about 16 bit installers, before running on a Virtual Machine you could try and open the installer or any data files that are on the disk in an archiver (7-zip or winrar).
The way I decided to solve this was to run a virtual machine inside Windows.
You may be able to extract the game files directly and then try and run them.
Just install the games on there and full screen the virtual machine.
