The code that I'm trying to execute at the moment is fairly simple:
I'm working on a game for mobile platforms (Android at the moment, in the future it should be available for iOS and WinPhone) and I want to trigger a certain method when the game is un-paused.
But this behavior differs on each platform and you cannot safely rely on it.
This behavior should be consistent on all the platforms.
Sometimes it's called when the application is put in (or comes back from) the background too (user hits Home button for example).
OnApplicationPause(bool state) is called when the user pauses and unpauses the game, normally by hitting the Pause button found in your game (which you need to implement the functionality for - by setting Time.timeScale = 0).
For this I'm trying to use OnApplicationPause(bool paused) method (when the "paused" variable is false), but the process is not working as expected.
In order to be safe I believe it's best to implement both functions.
The idea of this code is to add a certain number of coins if the player watches an advert (the number of coins is calculated by the ad provider).
OnApplicationFocus(bool state) is called when the app goes into (or comes from) background, usually because the user hits the Home button, and/or switches to another application.
