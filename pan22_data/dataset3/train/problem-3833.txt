If it is high scalability you're after though you should be looking at Left Hand instead of the iSCSI MSA (or P2000 as they are now called)
If you’re looking for absolute performance then the only way is the 8Gb fibre.
If you're going to have no more than 4 nodes in your cluster, then SAS is the way to go - it outperforms iSCSI hands down and nears Fibre channel performance levels for half the price.
The CONs are that if you need to scale out beyond 4 nodes then you won't have redundant connections to the MSA's controllers and then 8 nodes is the absolute physical limit.
To my knowledge there aren't that many SAS switches available and some of them may need special settings to allow sharing of LUNs to multiple hosts simultaneously which might be needed for certain setups like a clustered file system.
It costs less as you don't need any switching and this also means you’ve less interconnects so les potential faults.
I'm on my way to setup a 2 nodes hyperv cluster with an HP P2000 SAN.
iSCSI is the more scalable approach if you plan on growing to substantially more hosts as you use regular ethernet growing principles for scaling.
