I need that Windows Server, it's 2 months I contacted support but they didn't fix the downloader program :(
I did censor part of the file name to avoid people download the file without a license (I own one from MSDN Academy)
Should the Alias directive override the ProxyPass?
I read lots of articles telling it's difficult or almost impossible to break them, while I contacted MSDN but they didn't solve the problem yet.
Unfortunately, these are compressed/encrypted in the SDC format.
So I wanted to try some kind of a man-in-the-middle attack to my computer using my server.
Unfortunately, the ISO image of Windows Server 2008 on their servers is misnamed.
By using Wireshark, I found that the downloader erroneously tries to download a file that starts with iita_windows_....
I can't try a warez because I think the license won't match the edition.
Guessing the downloader was wrong, I tried to wget the file that starts with ita_windows and got a copy on my server.
The following is my current Apache virtual host configuration
I have a problem with MSDN Academy that they didn't solve.
I altered hosts file on my Windows machine to point to my server with Apache 2 with mod_proxy.
