Can you comment on why this is a very important matter to you?
Not sure how intense your professor is going to make either course, but assuming it's the hardest possible introductory course, it would be better to take linear algebra before statistics.
If you're talking about a first-semester stats course and a first-semester linear algebra course, you'll be fine either way.
Candidate in ML and honestly (my opinion, but it is an opinion-based question) I don't think it should be.
A lot of statistical operations require fundamental linear algebra concepts.
Statistics involves transforming data in a way that makes sense but you learn the fundamentals of transformation in linear algebra.
But if your stats course is just about p-values and superficial hypothesis testings, and your linear algebra course is just direct applications like row-reducing matrices, then it doesn't really make a difference which you take first.
You need to be able to understand abstract notions like vector spaces and fields to know when your data is in the correct range, you need to be able to understand what operations are linear and what are non-linear so you don't apply a wrong operation on something, and you need to most importantly be able to understand linearity and non-linearity because that is the basis of a lot of statistical methods.
