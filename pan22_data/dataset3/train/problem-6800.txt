The menu bar wouldn't have to be changed though, just like you wouldn't have to enable auto-raise.

Since ALL OS X utilities out there that promise "focus follows mouse" do autoraise, I think Steve Yegge is sadly right.
There should be no problem with doing focus-follows-mouse without autoraise across all applications, as the Terminal example and command-click prove, but you'd need to inject code into running applications via mach_inject or similar.
Any click that doesn't hit a button raises the window.
It wasn't mentioned here yet, but OS X has click-through — if you hold ⌘, it's possible to click most items in background windows.
It should be noted that Leopard introduced "Scrolling Focus Follows Mouse," where you can scroll via the mouse scroll wheel or a trackpad gesture on any window that the mouse is over.
Having said that, Zooom/2 does what you want, in addition to providing equivalents to the open-source window manager features for ctrl+click moving & resizing of windows.
Another caveat is that it activates Finder whenever you move the mouse over the desktop, so you'll pretty much have to add Finder to the ignore list.
Steve Yegge over at his blog claims that focus follow mouse with no autoraise isn't going to happen on OS X anytime soon:
You'd essentially write an "input manager" that redirects the keystrokes/clicks any time the mouse enters a textbox/button.
But as was mentioned in the comments: not without auto-raise, which just makes it unusable.
The fundamental problem with sloppy focus on the Mac is that the menu bar is always associated with the currently focused application; if you had sloppy focus, accessing the menu bar for a specific application would be supremely difficult.
This is a great feature that, while not full Focus-Follows-Mouse, proves that some aspects of it can be done in OS X.
