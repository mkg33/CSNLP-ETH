I'm not too concerned by what mechanism (if any) this is achieved, but am interested really in whether it's even possible.
b) Can then determine somehow whether the wake was due to WOL or not
There is a possibility the sensor could miss it, but it should work.

This is sort of a two-fold question, where I want to know if I can:
You would need another always on device to constantly monitor the wire for the WOL packet.
I'm looking for a way (programmatically or otherwise) to determine if my machine was woken up by WOL or not (let's say, a Ubuntu Server box).
To determine if your machine has woken up, you can test if you can reach it, as you would with any other machine to see if it's there:
I have never used one, but there exists at least the possibility that a switch loaded with a linux firmware might be able to do it.
The device would have to be always on and scanning the network connection.
Another computer running a tool in promiscuous mode setup to search for the WOL packet should in theory be able to catch it.
that is, the magic packet, the ethernet card and the BIOS, occurs before the operating system is even booted.
While there might be some network device out there that could do I don't know about it.
As whether you can be able to know if your machine has been started by WOL or not, that is not possible, as all the communication between the elements involved in WOL.
a) Hook something that'll hear about being woken up when the machine comes out of sleep and
Maybe if there was some file that logged wake up/sleep times, I could write a small program that looped and occasionally checked the file for changes, but don't know what i'd need to do to figure out of it was WOL or not (or if such a file exists).
