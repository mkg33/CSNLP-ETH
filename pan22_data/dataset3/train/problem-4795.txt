to send emails to an address (support@mycompany.com?)
Obviously you can roll your own, but there are many others.
We use Kayako eSupport http://www.kayako.com/solutions/esupport/ which does everything we need it to.
It's cheap, robust, and best of all, hosted by someone else.
FogBugz is another one w/email support, but again, likely to developer focused for you, but nice.
In that case take a look at the ticketing systems out there.
We've used it successfully at my workplace for years for everything from IT support to employment application management.
We are currently using OnTime, but we don't like it, and it's too developer focused.
What you are describing sounds like workflow to me.
Three are many good systems including K2 (Commercial) and Jboss (open source).
Not a ton of help, but I'd say you're not looking for an "Enterprise EMail..." but rather a ticketing system w/integrated email support.
To follow up on WaldenL's ticketing system suggestion, Request Tracker (http://bestpractical.com/rt/) is a very nice open source ticketing system.
The biggest let down we tend to have with it is reporting statistics on how the CSR's are spending their time on tickets.
