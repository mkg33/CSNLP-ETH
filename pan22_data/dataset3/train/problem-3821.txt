So the first card drawn would animate from 100,100 to 200,200 and change it's state to Filled
Let's say the tableau starts at 200,200 and can have 6 cards in them.
My question therefore is -- how do I make the computer know where to put cards drawn from a deck of cards to a tableau?
My current thoughts are that we fill the tableau "empty" card objects at set X/Y co-ordinates so that I know without having to do too much programming where the cards should go to.
But I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it because of screen sizes, etc.
How do I know where the cards are going to appear on screen within the tableau?
The only issue is I'm not sure how I can figure out where the cards drawn from the top deck go to.
But I'm still unsure if using hard number co-ordinates is really the best way forward, especially if the screen sizes change; or even if there's a better way to animate cards from a draw pile to a tableau.
I've never written card games before and am currently coding up a simple card game, I have a deck of cards and they need to be shuffled (done) and then draw from the top deck into a tableau (centre of table) from which the user(s) can pick from.
A card width is 50, and the distance between them is 20
