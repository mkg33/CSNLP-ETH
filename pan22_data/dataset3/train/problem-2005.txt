Compose an email, type the persons name (or part of their name) in the "To", and just hit send anyway.
One think to keep in mind, is that when moving people between machines, don't forget to copy the name cache over (NK2 file located in appdata\microsoft\outlook) so they don't have to repopulate it.
The NK2 file format is undocumented but some have reverse engineered it, there is a discussion of it here
It means that you won't know if it's going to work right until you hit send, but it should still work.
I migrated our system from GroupWise to Exchange about 5 months ago.
Use CTRL + K to quickly check a partial name against the default address book; otherwise, just use Outlook for a week or so and the name cache will fill up with your contacts.
Get ready to find a lot of little things that you say "But in Groupwise that was easy..." I miss it.
Addresses you've used before that are in cache are instantly translated to their correct format, but addresses that have never been used often don't appear to be checked right until sending (especially for a large address book).
What DLux said, plus you can create a new email select everyone from the address book, then DON'T send the email, this should put the entire address book in the cache.
Outlook will then attempt to resolve it to a Global Address Book entry on sending.
