More seriously, many things can cause a file corruption.
If this happens again, just sign back in and your bookmarks, cookies, extensions, etc.
This procedure is covered in Windows 7 Help and Support under "Recover lost or deleted files" in the section "To restore a file or folder to a previous state".
If all of this doesn't work, you can start over by closing Chrome and deleting the Chrome folder.

It may come from a power failure during a write (even if you didn't notice it, you computer may not even rebooted), or a software bug in google chrome causing it to write garbage to its files.
You can try restoring an earlier version if necessary.
I did every combination in CCleaner's settings (trial and error) and checking other options will not cause that error.
It could also be an NMR Spectrometer operating too close to your computer (well, depending on where you work, but it happened to a friend of mine and I couldn't resist) .
If you sign in via Chrome and sync everything, it doesn't really matter.
If so, then that error might happen again UNLESS you UNCHECK these under CCleaner's application tab, under Google Chrome "Internet History" and "Last Download Location".
