The only thing that help is kill -9 (and I hate running that command)
Centos is my preferred distro but for important components such as bind I wouldn't even consider using the repositories, as they can be quite out of date.
The version of BIND that you are running seems to be susceptible the remote denial of service recently advertised in CVE-2009-0696.
What I'd like is to understand what happened there, it bugs me because having my domain name server down is critical.
Make sure you're logged in to the machine so you can restart BIND if it crashes :-)
There is some output indicating that the service is still "running" and deleting /var/lock/subsys/named or the pid file won't help.
Exploits are available in the wild and your frequent crashes may relate to this.
I know this isn't strictly in line with the question, but on a security note you should identify whether you need the features of bind or whether you could get away with one of the alternatives.
Named/BIND is crashing every few days, usually I have few tools that take care of such crash and restart the service but lately they can't really restart it.
Bind is an old, massive, and complicated program, that never the less excels at what it does but is also quite labyrinthine.
I suggest you do likewise and compile from source.
I'd advise you to upgrade as soon as you can and then see if the problem persists.
Complexity is the enemy of security, depending on your needs and the size of your managed domain you may nbe better off with one of the other available options.
What's odd is that when I try to manually restart I get this error:
Djbdns is significantly more secure, and powerdns and maradns aren't far behind.
If you want to confirm that your BIND instance isn't vulnerable to the recent DoS vulnerability, try running this exploit code against your server.
Looking at my /var/log/messages don't give me much clues about what happened there.
Long term it's more maintainable and predictable that way.
