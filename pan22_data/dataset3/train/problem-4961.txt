A lot of applications depend on Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable.
It is possible that you have installed such an application and since removed it, such that they are no longer necessary, but it's not a good idea to remove them.
I'm not sure if these drivers require the framework, but I would guess they do.
Except for the User-mode driver framework, none of those programmers are necessary or have any value by themselves.
The User-Mode Driver Framework is also pretty important, as it allows some drivers to run in "user mode" (by providing an API for the kernal instead of the driver having direct access), which helps protect the system if they fail.
However, all of them are likely necessary for the correct operation of at least one other non-Microsoft program on your system.
Generally, unless you have a real pressing need to remove them they are unlikely to do any harm nor damage performance and I would recommend keeping them.
There are other parts included with these but they are all related.
They are all frameworks, so in theory you don't need them but software that requires a certain framework will not run without it installed.
@firedfly has already mentioned the Visual C++ Redistributable (and yes, I agree that you really should really keep this one).
Similarly, the Sync Framework Runtime works on the same priciples, but again for a different set of software.
The XNA Framework is used in the construction of some games (XNA being a game development studio / toolset), so without the redistributable you will be unable to run games that requires this.
