Is there any way to insert this as the BODY of an email (not an attachment), where the images and text are decent quality and hyperlinks still work (text & links are on-top of images, so I can't separate them).
Also, if it matters, Microsoft Outlook will be used to send the actual email out and a large number of the recipients (but not all of them) will be using Outlook to receive it.
Plus I'd like a solution that my computer-illiterate friend could use in the future when sending out new issues without my help.
Drag your cursor over the whole PDF before letting go.
Select all of the objects in the document with Ctrl-A and Group them together.
Anyone know if it is even possible to do this while preserving links and keeping the text on top of images, in a way that will work across different platforms?
You will need to do font size corrections in all likelihood.
CLick new and then >more blank page sizes> select tabloid landscape> now do what you have to and you can directly save as .jpeg
We also tried converting to PDF (which looked great), then converting that to HTML using Adobe Acrobat, but again that looked really messed up.
Zoom in on the PDF and use the take a snapshot feature.
We tried Publisher's built in "Save and Send" ("Send Current Page"), but that completely messed up the layout and images.
This will prevent anything moving in relation to anything else and should preserve the hyperlinks and the quality of fonts and images.
You cant do this if youre using a standard template in publisher.
I'm helping a friend create a single-page email newsletter for their work and they have a great design in MS Publisher.
When the image is captured, paste it into the publisher file.
Now you have one solid "picture" to send that will not break up.
I considered something like creating an image of the newsletter and adding an image map, but email clients don't seem to be able to consistently render them.
