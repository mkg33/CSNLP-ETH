The purpose of it all is to fit 'surround cameras' to my car.
One way i was thinking, was to use the task scheduler to run a task every minute to wake up the PC if it's on AC power.
So the tablet option would only work if it can drive the 7" display and lots of webcams through a powered hub.
Each time they restart the computer starts and my camera app runs.
The OS for the laptop would be anything from win XP to 8, whatever is needed.
The laptop will not be having a battery (built in) or UPS attached.
In my particular scenario, power losses will be frequent and the laptop has to wake up whenever the power returns.
The app will probably be made in .net as i'm quite familiar with that.
(in the real scenarion it would restart from off).
I would like to set up my laptop, an Asus netbook w/o the "resume previous power state" feature my dell desktop has, to turn on when AC power is restored after a power loss.
The scenario is a computer with several webcams attached and a 7" usb powered touchscreen display.
I tried a task that starts at a time and then repeats every minute, (since run every minute wasnt an option in task scheduler), and that didn't wake up the computer from sleep.
So, each time the user turns the car off, the computer powers off.
I'm not limited to a laptop only, if neeeeed be, i could use a tablet (win rt or pro).
