Sounds like you're planning on changing your nameservers at the same time?
In practice, people misconfigure things and tools break.
After all, that's the whole point of the TTL being configurable.
That's why you may need to provide instructions to your users to clear their local cache if things don't work right.
Modern computers and browsers are pretty reliable at obeying TTLs with DNS, but you need to understand the entire chain for the best results.
In theory, setting the domain's TTL to something low and waiting for that change to take place, then changing the IP, should result in a near-transparent migration.
Inevitably your old address will be cached and used for a long time -- mostly by bots.
I would highly recommend you update the DNS at your current provider before changing DNS, or change your nameservers 7 days before you change the website IP.
Due to the way nameservers are discovered, they take a lot longer to update than a regular record - often times around 24 hours or longer.
