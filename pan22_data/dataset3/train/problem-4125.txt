Is this an ASP or ASP.NET web site (or even anything else)?
While this is happening - I can connect to the server via remote desktop and the site loads fine from the live url when running a browser on the server locally.
Today the site has been unavailable remotely a few (4?)
We've looked at the iis logs quickly and we don't see any traffic out of the ordinary - no traffic spikes, etc.
If you visit any page on the site - nothing is ever returned and eventually the request times out.
What happens if you ask a static HTML page, or an image?
We made the new site live yesterday - its getting more traffic than in beta but not that much - resource utilization on the server and speed are fine.
Anything strange in Application and System Windows logs?
Other computers on the same network can't access the website either.
Other websites on the server continiue to function fine the entire time (using the same instance of iis, different app pools).
Other than not serving content - the server seems to behave normally - scheduled jobs in our custom job system continue to run, etc.
