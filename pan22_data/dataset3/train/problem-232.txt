You might try in safe mode to set the display driver to a generic type.
I haven't looked at Windows 98 in a while, so this may be incorrect...
If it works, you should be able to copy any files that you need from the renamed folders.
Booting in safe mode uses the Windows generic display driver, and apparently that works.
If you haven't kept the installation CD, you might still be able to find the driver on google.
You can try using Autoruns when in Safe Mode and see if there's anything that doesn't belong.
Then reboot and see if it recreates a new profile.
I'm more scared that you're still run 98, though, personally :)
It works for me with PSTools from Sysinternals, using pslist to get the process list and psexec to execute pslist on the remote system:
-accepteula accepts automatically the license agreement that is displayed when you run for the 1st time one of the tools.
The conclusion is that something broke the video driver, so it needs re-installing.
-c will copy the executable to execute (here pslist.exe) on the remote system.
Try finding the user profile that is loaded at startup, and renaming the folder to profile_old.
You said you tried Safe Mode, but the Networking edition can be a useful diagnostic.
Anyway, check all the display options, whatever they may be on Win98.
Does this also happen if you boot into Safe Mode with Networking?
