Not to make any calls — I don't have service for it — just to see if I could get it working and what apps it might be able to use.
I'm not sure a linux distro would fit into a cell phone,and even if it did,i don't think the phone would have the capabilities of actually running the system
You're going to also need to work out what processor the phone uses, and if there's a port for it, and how to get the OS in there.
I don't really expect to find anything useful, but I thought it might be worth asking about.
I have a Motorola L6 cell phone that I'm no longer using, including pc connector cable, and just for the fun of it I was wondering if it were possible to install linux on the phone.
You can check http://forum.motofan.ru/index.php?showtopic=117307 (in Russian), but a generic distro will never support these phones, because they need custom loader, custom kernel and a lot of not yet written drivers.
Its one of those 'if you need to ask, its probably going to be really hard to do' things.
Not trivially, i think - most phones have fairly locked down hardware, and reflashing the OS might require a mix of hardware and software hacking.
