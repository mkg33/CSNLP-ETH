What you want to do is modify all your xyz values by a wave based on the values of phi and dt, this will make it change from top to bottom of your hemisphere plus animate over time.
First thing you need is a delta Time (dt) to govern how fast the animation will run, and this generates the wave.
In this example note that x,y and z are all multiplied by the same value.
Second thing you will need is a scale value that you can tweak to make the animation look as good as it can.
dt is expressed in seconds, a typical frame taking 0.033 to draw.
phi ranges from 0 at the top of your hemisphere where you don't want any animation and gets bigger the lower it goes which will make the peristaltic wave larger at the bottom.
So what you want is a contraction and expansion of the sides in a peristaltic motion to make it look like it's pushing itself.
I haven't tried this but the idea should work, it's similar to a cheap waving flag simulation.
Both sets of your xyz values in the original code would be modified like this each loop.
Scale is needed to tune how big the wave is, a subjective measure of what looks good.
