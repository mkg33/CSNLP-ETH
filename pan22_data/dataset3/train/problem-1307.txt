I downloaded a lot lately and streamed videos, but nothing illegal or malicious.
My network is shared by two PCs and two mobile devices.
If you would like you could try acquring a new ip address.
Fact of the matter, websites are putting in anti-robot and human verification as a matter course and are applying the checks to everyone, not just you.
All connected devices are neither infected nor have illegal software installed.
I checked my IP address on different websites and most of them say it is suspicious or has negative reputation.
Their aims are to make ad money, trick you into downloading trojan infested binaries or fishing.
They'll do it to make sure no automated account signups happen, wallpaper websites will do a check every 20 downloads to ensure that they're not being auto downloaded by some robot, even Virus Total will check if you're human.
They basically take advantage of common keywords used in google to attract visitors.
I am not completely sure but the IP might have been used previously or being used for sending abusive or malicious emails.
I've never head of a website rating a home user's IP as suspicious.
Lately many websites ask if I'm a robot and let my answer a chapta.
Assuming you are on windows you could do that in cmd prompt with:
There are alot of fake security websites out there, feeding people all sorts of misinformation or robot gathered/auto generated information.
If you're really concerned about it, take your laptop to the library and browse the websites that are giving you checks.
The pages are  literally engineered to give you fake content based on the keyword you used.
Further information: I often use private mode of firefox.
