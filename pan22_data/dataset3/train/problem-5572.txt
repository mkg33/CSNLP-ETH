This has the added benefit that you don't need to use different programs to record and edit.
Mute sounds from all other applications except the one you want to hear/record
This will includes all audio source that active at that time.
I highly recommend it even when you requested a Windows alternative, I would consider some kind of boot system or separate device for this type of action.
You then need to change the audio device (the second drop-down) to something appropriate - this will vary - you may need to select a loopback device, or you may to just use the same device as with regular recording - some trial and error is needed.
On Mac systems a small developer, Rogue Amoeba, created an app named Audio Hijack.
A normal recording software will records system wide audio, this is achieved by calling Windows WSAPI API loopback device.
In the Audacity device toolbar (the third toolbar from the top in the default layout) you need to change the audio host (the first drop-down) to "Windows WSAPI".
Recently a company called D3DGear has developed a technology to record audio just from one process, it will not include background audios from other process.
This basically requires recording audio from a process instead of system wide audio.
You can check D3DGear to see details of their audio technologies.
Which is an application with the sole purpose of recording other applications audio sources.
The easiest an quickest way I found was to follow the instructions in this article and use the Audacity audio editing software to record the WSAPI software device.
Press record in Audacity, then play the audio in the application you want to record and you should see the waveform appear in Audacity as it records.
