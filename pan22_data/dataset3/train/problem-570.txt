It's probably a better idea to play around with the jail settings for particular hack attempts in fail2ban until you achieve a good compromise.
Also in fail2ban how to do allow HTTP requests from a certain IP so these dont get banned as our developers will be making lots of strange requests under the /var/www/dev folder that will show file not exists, etc.
At the moment I'm getting a lot of ssh attacks but fail2ban are banning and then unbanning these.
I would advise to be very careful about permanent bans, this can backfire in unexpected ways (such as valid requests and hack attempts coming from the same public IP, because the real source is behind a masquerading firewall, e.g.
You can add an IP/network to the fail2ban whitelist to accomplish just that (the second part, I mean).
As for the first part, I saw this workaround mentioned on the fail2ban wiki:
I think you will need to use a combination of fail2ban (for temporary bans) and denyhosts (for permanent bans).
Edit the ignoreip parameter on your jail.conf (probably on /etc/fail2ban).
I've recently installed fail2ban as a way of keeping one of our web servers secure from SSH attacks and HTTP attacks.
Is they a way to permanently ban these IP's due to the level of attacks.
