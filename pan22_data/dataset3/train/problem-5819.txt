It can get ugly pretty fast if you try to enforce data-typing at a data level even with fixed columns but varying lengths.
There's huge drawbacks to this from a relational perspective though.
The only other way I can suggest is using something like a key-value store.
I don't think you can really do what you want in SSIS - partially because it will expect your Excel format to be fixed.
You're dealing with unstructured data here I'm afraid and honestly, I feel your pain.
Even if you get it fixed, with SSIS and Excel - you'll have problems with how it guesses the metadata types for columns based on a sample of the data in the sheet - with the Excel provider, you only have 2 choices for text data for example - NVARCHAR(255) and NVARCHAR(MAX).
You might also want to consider non-SQL Server alternatives that can take unstructured data and search on it as well.
As such, I think you'll need to embrace the unstructured nature of the data and store it as such - storing it as an XML/JSON data types and converting the data from the spreadsheet and letting the MVC application parse the XML.
