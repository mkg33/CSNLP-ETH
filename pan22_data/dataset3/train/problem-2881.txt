Whether it uses it or not depends on other factors (primarily do you have enough free ram on the host to support the guests requests).
VMware Server has a setting to define if you want all VM memory to fit in physical RAM, or allow some of them to be swapped; it's in the host settings.
When you set a number for how much ram you want to allocate this is the maximum amount of ram that server will ever use.
Unless you're using ESX and making VM resource reservations your VM will not be given any more physical memory than is being used, i.e.
If you have a virtual machine with 2GB of memory without a reservation, it creates a 2GB .vswp file when it is powered on.
If you have more RAM than you're using, you can safely set it to only use RAM; you will then not be able to power on more VMs if there's not enough available physical memory, of course.
You need to allocate the RAM usage from properties of VM.
If you make reservations for your virtual machine's that are equal to the amount of RAM assigned to them, swapping and page sharing does not occur.
Second you can give a vm watever you want but vmware will is only going to report what the guest actually uses.
if you give your VM 4GB but only ever address 1GB then only 1GB of physical memory is taken up.
If you do not set reservations, ESX host creates a .vswp file equal to the difference between the amount of physical memory assigned to the virtual machine and the reservation it has.
I'm not sure where the 50% figure comes from but if that VM's vmware-vmx process is only using 100MB then that's all that's being used.
