I would suggest as a starting point, that you get some sheets of clean paper and structure what you want to happen.
If these criteria are all true, then you can start the "play with desk lamp" subroutine,
You need to set a clear process tree and for each subroutine, such as "pick up desk lamp and wave it around for 5 seconds", you need to set what criteria needs to be forfilled by your AI before this event is begun, such as
Your phrasing on the question is vague, at best, so you need to clarify things in your plan down to boolean (true/false) values for a computer to understand.
Overall I would suggest you need to really clarify the behaviours and routines you want to create, and what would cause them and enable them.
What would be a minimal length of a directon (It can look meaningless of the scale of your random walk is gameworld millimetres rather than metres, for example).
Then once all these "factors" are set out clearly in your mind and in your plan, you can work on coding each one, one by one, until you have a full behaviour setup.
Which objects, what is the criteria for interactions - proximity?
