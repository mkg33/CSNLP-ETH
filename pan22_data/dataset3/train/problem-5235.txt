Under Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels, click Edit, and change
Excel is nothing if not flexible, if you know how to work it.
The middle right chart shows how to modify the vertical error bars.
This basically says take the range that starts where column A contains the min value in cell E1 and that ends where column A contains the max value in cell E2.
If Excel applies a date format to the axis labels, change back to a numeric format.
INDEX(Sheet1!$A$2:$A$237,MATCH(Sheet1!$E$2,Sheet1!$A$2:$A$237))
Here is the top part of a worksheet with the numbers 0 through 235 in column A and the probability of that many sixes being thrown in 235 tosses of a fair die in column B.
Click on Formulas tab > Name Manager, select "counts" to populate the formula in Refers To at the bottom of the dialog, and make sure the range you want is highlighted in the sheet.
The top right chart shows the distribution with the X axis scaled as desired.
Change the values in cells E1 or E2, and the chart will change to reflect the new min and max.
The screenshot below shows the top of the worksheet with the data in columns A and B and a sequence of charts.
On the Formulas tab of the Ribbon, click Define Name, enter the name "counts", give it a scope of the active worksheet (I kept the default name Sheet1), and enter this formula:
which means take the range that is zero rows below and one row to the right of counts.
=INDEX(Sheet1!$A$2:$A$237,MATCH(Sheet1!$E$1,Sheet1!$A$2:$A$237)):
The Min and Max of the first column are given in E1 and E2, along with the initial chart of the data.
Now right click on the chart and choose Select Data from the pop-up menu.
Choose the Minus direction, no end caps, and percentage, entering 100% as the percentage to show.
Now select the series listed in the left box and click Edit.
We'll define a couple of dynamic range names (what Excel calls "Names").
In the Name Manager dialog, click New, enter the name "probs", and enter the much simpler formula
Select the vertical error bars and press Ctrl+1 (numeral one) to format them.
Choose 1/22/1900 (day 22) for the axis minimum and 2/26/1900 (day 57) for the axis maximum.
Select the horizontal error bars and press Delete (bottom left chart).
Format the XY series so it uses no markers, as well as no lines (bottom right chart).
Error bars have been added to the middle left chart.
Finally, select the vertical error bars and format them to use a colored line, with a thicker width.
