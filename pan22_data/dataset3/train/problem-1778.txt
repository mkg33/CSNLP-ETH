I am creating a separate Excel file for each MSWord file.
In fact, I think Windows did this for me as recently as last week, albeit on a different computer.
That assumes you can write to the default location, which I believe I can.
I am opening a bunch of MSWord files one at a time, copying data tables therein, pasting the data into Excel and saving the Excel files as comma delimited text files.
In excel under options for save remove the default location then it will always go the the last open or saved location
It occurred to me that if there is no way to ask Windows to re-use the last path, perhaps the most efficient thing to do is simply save the comma-delimited files in the default location that Windows does offer, then copy and paste all files at once from there to the desired location after finishing the file creation process.
The path to the folder containing the saved comma-delimited files is quite long, something like this:
In the past Windows seemed to remember the last used path, saving a lot of tedious key-strokes.
I am using Microsoft Office 2010 and Windows 7 on a Dell PC.
Every time I open Excel and save a new comma-delimited file I have to re-navigate the entire path (c:\users\me\aa\bb\cc\dd\ee).
Can I apply a setting in Windows somewhere asking it to offer the last used path as a default when saving files so I do not have to re-navigate the entire directory structure to save each new comma-delimited file?
