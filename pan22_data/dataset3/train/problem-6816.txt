DHCP requests were issued but the printer never replied on the offered address.
Connecting via a crossover cable and capturing the traffic with Wireshark, the observed hardware address was not the same as that on the label.
It was now possible to connect to that address over the cable and configure the Axis print server.
This built-in print server has its MAC address printed on a label on the unit, howvever according to an IBM manual it is possible to change the hardware ID via a menu on the console.
The control panel on this printer doesn't have any network configuration menu that I could find, nor could I print out a network configuration page.
The 4247-003 model seems to be the first 4247 with the option of built-in ethernet support, (previous versions could use an external print server connected via the parallel port and requiring its own power supply).
This reset the MAC address to the value on the label, as well as changing the IP configuration to a previous (static) configuration.
