I know it requires external power, and it's not something I want to cart around.
I've been looking at the Linksys WET610N, but it's just too big.
I'm in a situation to need a wireless bridge because I have a MacBook Pro with an unfortunate problem.
And no, it's not under warranty and the price of the repair would be better put towards a new computer, which I can't afford at the moment.
Are there any low(er) profile wireless bridge devices that connect to the computer in a similar manner that Wireless USB dongles do?
I'm envisioning a very specific type of wireless networking bridge, one that might not yet exist, or might be built out of unobtainum silicon.
Are there any low(er) profile wireless bridge devices that use USB for power so I don't have to be tethered to a wall socket.
We have wireless adapters that fit as small USB dongle, so why does a converter have to add so much size?
When the laptop heats up, the airport child-card shorts out and will not work again until the computer is rebooted.
Meaning, they have the connector port, and stick out another 3 or so inches (in this case, out of both the USB port and the Ethernet port), with presumably some kind of flexible cable connecting the two halves.
And really, given the reason (heat), this also means that I should probably leave it alone for a while to let it cool down, otherwise I get less than 30 minutes of wireless use post-reboot.
