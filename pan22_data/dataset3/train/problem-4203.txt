As David Schwartz points out in his answer, it was mostly used as a cop-out for any problems you had with software running on a non-IBM "PC".
From Wikipedia's entry on "IBM PC Compatible" computers:
This mostly became a problem for software that was using Assembly to directly access hardware addresses, CPU registers, (etc.)
that were standard on the original IBM PC, but may not be implemented identically in the "clone".
If it didn't work on your computer, then they could simply say that since it worked on an IBM PC and didn't work on your computer, it must be your computer's fault since they said they required a 100% compatible computer.
The idea was simply that this meant the software developer was never at fault.
Since IBM PC's were more expensive than the many "PC Clones", they were NOT what the general populace was buying, so they really only had to fully support people with IBM's (usually companies with money.
In addition to that, there was the fact that not all "PC Clones" of that era (early-mid 80's) were 100% compatible hardware-wise.
