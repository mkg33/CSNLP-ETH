I was moving our 2 instances to a different size VM, however, when I rebooted they did not come back up.
Apparently this is a bad idea for virtualised environments as I can break.
One thing that does seem to have happened is a kernel update during the move (from 4.1.5 to 4.4.0), but I've manually renerted to the old kernel, but the new problems remain.
If you have compiled from source please verify these settings with your previous ubuntu machines.The symopsis are like this;
We are running HAProxy 1.6.1 on Debian 8 virtual machines.
I guess you must have installed haproxy and copied the haproxy.cfg file in the new two instances.Please check that the user haproxy(service useron OS) is present there?
The problem turned out to be the fact that I used the CPU=native option in my original compilation.
CFLAGS  = -O2 -march=native -g -fno-strict-aliasing
Same thing if I try to check the config with -c -f (though I don't think this is a config issue).
Check haproxy status and also try to run command without ./.
