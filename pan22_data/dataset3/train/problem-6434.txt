However, what you could do is pass the entire link as a parameter and have it parsed by the batch file itself to extract the bit of interest.
I have a script which generates an Email with information based on the computer it was just run on.
Longer parameters may require using an environmental variable.
That depends on what kind of data is in the parameters being passed.
Now if you deciphered any of that, Congratulations.
Just some pseudo-code examples to show how it is done.
If it is simple text data, less than 256 characters, you can do so on the command line.
What I need to know is, is this possible (to run a batch script with parameters from a link) and if so could anyone provide information on this.
Without seeing the format of your link it's not really possible to say yes or no.
In the Email there is also a link to another batch file (which runs an exe) that I would only need sometimes, said batch file needs to be executed via the link with a parameter which changes based on information pulled from the first script.
