This way you can copy and paste the number easily.
Or you could choose one number that is common with all the cells and replace it with a letter that isn't already present.
You might be able to solve the issue with these two steps:
1,000,000,000,000,006 to 1,000,000,000,000,015 show as 1,000,000,000,000,010
Copy paste into Excel remove duplicates and sort before copying and pasting back in Word where you replace the letter back to the common number for example:
Which is what you would expect with the midpoint rounding down.
When you need to calculate with them, then it becomes difficult because Excel has only 15 siginificant digits.
If you enter 999,999,999,999,999 in a cell and add 1 to it in the cell below it correctly shows 1,000,000,000,000,000, but try to add another 1 and you get 1,000,000,000,000,000 again.
You can correctly store the 15 most significant digits of an integer in Excel (my version is Excel 2010).
1,000,000,000,000,016 to 1,000,000,000,000,025 show as 1,000,000,000,000,020
2) Use FORMULA>TEXT>CONCATENATE to combine the columns into one column and you should get your desired result.
1,000,000,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000,005 show as 1,000,000,000,000,000
1) Seperate the numbers into as many columns as necessary.
When you don't need to calculate with these numbers, you can treat them as text, see the other answers.
I had the same issue with barcodes that I was pulling from a database, the solution that worked best for me is to pass the number to excel as a formula that displays text.
For example, instead of passing just the barcode, I was passing ="barcode" so that excel interprets as a string a shows the whole number without any other characters as in the ' solution.
In any case that you need to do so for running numbers like serial numbers for example, seperate the numbers and run them down in GENERAL format first, then combine.
