You can use it to copy data to a slave and start replication in one command.

Then it automatically starts replication of the master on those slaves.
In simple case it can be just bash script, that locks the master DB, copies table files to the new slave, restore position and start the replication.
Then it distributes the dump file to all slaves and initializes replication on each slave.

I am looking for something that will help us to create a lot of mysql slaves connected to the specified master, let's say kind of mass-replication.
If there are any existing solution for this purpose.
It gives a shell script (see end of the post) where you simply enter in variables:
It is optimized for a big number of slaves because it locks and exports the master dump and log position only once.
From you knowledge if something described above exists?

I wrote this blog post which explains how to create the bash script to automate Master-Slave replication on MySQL:
