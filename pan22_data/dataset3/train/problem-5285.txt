As best I can tell,  the drive letters A & B have been reserved for backwards compatibility.
Trying to build a consensus answer here, please vote or edit as you see appropriate.
To remove an existing drive letter on a drive, on a partition, or on a volume, follow these steps:
Considering XP was around when floppy's were the thing, it is still the mainstream OS even though it is around 8-9 years old.
A lot of software still assumes that drive c:\ is present and persistent.
While the idea of drive letters is becoming deprecated, keeping a hard drive available on drive c: is still a good idea.
Even though A: and B: are not in use, disk manager will not let you select either of those drive letters for your main boot partition.
I think it falls under the "if it ain't broke...".
So I guess I'm not that surprised that A and B are still skipped.
I didn't have the heart to tell him about windows system variables (like windir and systemdrive).
I remember someone at high school saying that they installed their windows instance on D: instead of C: so he couldn't get attacked or get viruses.
A and B are no longer used so perhaps it is time for those folks at MS to jiggle the handle so to speak.
I don't see any real advantage to changing the conventions and it would break a few old (some would say obsolete) assumptions.
Other than drive C: there is no guarantee that a drive letter will be present, permanent or writable.
Before you modify drive-letter assignments, note the following items:
It may be an archaic standard but drives A: and B: are reserved for removable disks.
