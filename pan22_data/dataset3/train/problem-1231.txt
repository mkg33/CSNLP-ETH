Also, I seem to get much better performance on the 72.227.xxx.xxx range than 24.193.xxx.xxx - I can only speculate that perhaps a different set of routers/switches is handling each range?
The IP is leased to a MAC Address for approximately 72 hours.
Why does Time Warner change the IP range depending on which device I plug in, and how does the cable modem know that a different type of device has been connected to the cable modem?
It would be interesting to see what happens if you plugged a Linksys router in.
Basically, TWC does look at the Mac address of the device that connects, but they don't care what type of device it is.
If I plug my MacBook directly into the cable modem via Ethernet and restart it, I get an IP address in the 72.227.xxx.xxx range.
Who knows why they do it but they can determine what device you are plugging in (or have a reasonable guess at least) by the MAC address which does trace back to a hardware manufacturer/maker and certainly assign an IP address based off that.
Okay, I got an answer from a Time Warner rep on the DSL Reports forums.
I currently have Time Warner Cable Wideband Internet service.
I unplugged the AirPort for a few days and then plugged it back in and got a 72.227.xxx.xxx range IP.
When I plugged in my MacBook TWC saw a new MAC address and assigned it a 72.227.xxx.xxx range IP because it was available in the IP pool owned by TWC.
If I plug my AirPort Extreme router into the cable modem via Ethernet and restart it, I get an IP in the 24.193.xxx.xxx range.
My AirPort router had been given the range 24.193.xxx.xxx address based on it's MAC.
When I switched back to the AirPort, TWC saw its MAC and said "Oh Hai!
and gave me the 24.193.xxx.xxx address again because it had not been released yet.
