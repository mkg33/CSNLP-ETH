At this point you can test already if the windows system is able to boot from the copied partion.
EaseUS Partition Master Free can do this, and is a reliable free tool which can resize partitions on-the-fly, while running Windows, without any need to reboot.

I can't use the Windows snipping tool with a context menu open (and my keyboard lacks a print screen button), but believe me when I say that the extend button is greyed out when right clicking the Windows 8 partition.
What will I have to do in order to extend the partition with the remaining 140GB on the drive?
the comands fdisk, dd and ntfresize to do the job manually:
Download Partition Wizard boot able .ISO image then burn it to a CD and boot it.
The data of the old windows partion is still unchanged (just invisible) and could be re-created easily with fdisk.

I've been through probably a hundred separate Google search results, every single one explaining how to "right click the volume and click extend".
The extend button is greyed out: that's because the Volume that you are trying to resize is a system partition which is in use so you can not do a change on it,
