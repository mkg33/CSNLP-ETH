If disabling/enabling resolves the problem, I'd be inclined to just use that button if you have one (out of some amount of laziness and lack of desire to waste my time on what is more than likely a driver bug).
Sometimes additional tools to manage the wireles networks collide, like Lenovos "Access Connections" and Windows' own WLAN (and like fixed IP) control.
You may have an incompatible network protocol or filter
I had some issues having a fixed IP assigned in my interface settings (windows) and wanted to do some DHCP with the Lenovo tool...
3rd party firewalls and vpn client software have been reported as causing this problem.
So check what tool to use for managing your wireless networks.
make sure to check the device manager, there is often an option under the properties of the specific device to " turn off device to save power"
You're using Windows 8 preview, so it could very well be some issue with the driver not working under this new, unfinished OS.
Check the Connection Properties for your wireless adapter and disable any interesting filters or protocol stacks.
Most laptops I've seen have a button on the keyboard for enabling/disabling wireless so you don't have to do it through your OS.
This option will turn the network device off during sleep etc and can have problems when the machine fires up, seen it multiple times.
