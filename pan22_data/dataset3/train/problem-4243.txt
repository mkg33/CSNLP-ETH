I've used lots of both the WD and Seagate drives you mention and have found nothing to complain about whatsoever, I'm not damning the Samsung ones though, I've just not used them.
You are using RAID to solve the redundancy issue, so get the drives that will meet your performance needs (which appear to be minimal) and be done with it.
If you are really concerned, buy a couple extras so that 4 years from now when the model is discontinued, you have a spare if one goes bad.
Unless you like spending more money on your drives, just get one of the cheaper options.
If I were you, I'd buy the cheapest 1TB drives I could find on newegg...drives just don't fail that often, and even if it does, you are building a RAID array to solve for that problem.
And some RAID controllers could fail the whole RAID.
These are all RAID type drives, which among with better build qaulity link text means that the drive time out to retry reading bad blocks is about 15 seconds, versus up to 2 minutes for a regular desktop drive.
The price of a drive does not necessarily correlate to reliability.
In the consumer market, price and reliability are not really related at all.
Heck, at the prices listed, you could probably get twice the number of drives for the same cost and have spares on hand.
Oh and I love Adaptec controllers - I'm sure there are cheaper and more functional ones out there but they're the 'old reliable' ones I choose.
I've also spoken to our Western Digital rep and he confirmed all of that, in addition to saying that they don't expect desktop drives when used in a RAID or 24x7 to survive for more than 18 months; the desktop drives are just meant to last less.
This can cause a drive in a RAID config to lockup the whole RAID for up to minutes.
