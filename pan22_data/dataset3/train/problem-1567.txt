I tried everything I could think of and read on the net but nothing worked until I did the manual print head alignment.
Try cleaning the printing head with alcohol or distilled water.
If you still get white paper only, your printer has a hardware problem.
The functions from the Canon drivers will probably not help you.
If you have any problems with the shop you bought it from, contact Canon Support via their website.
As it is new, use its warranty and demand repairs.
First step is to ensure that you have well installed the latest driver for the printer, downloaded from the Canon Support website.
This is something that should be done on a new printer or when any of the ink cartridges are replaced.
Secondly, right-click the printer's entry in the Printers applet, and select Properties.
Go to the Maintenance tab and execute all the tests and maintenance functions, starting with Nozzle Check.
My Canon MX882 would print test pages ok but everything else came out blank even though it sounded like it was printing.
If this doesn't resolve your problem, the printer has a hardware problem.
Try to print the printers build-in test page (see manual).
