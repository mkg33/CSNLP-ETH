On the other hand, the firewall is still capable of having rules that result in blocking the VPN traffic itself (regardless of what the VPN traffic is), if configured to do so (which would mean that your VPN wouldn't work) -- so you do need to be mindful of your firewall rules in that respect.
For instance, if a firewall is configured to block all incoming connections destined for the internal machine, that traffic will not be blocked by the firewall if it's encapsulated in the VPN, for the simple reason that the traffic, from the firewall's perspective, looks like the VPN traffic.
So I shot them them and email and got the following response:
For maximum lulz, they're both wrong -- and both right.
A VPN will allow traffic that might otherwise have been blocked by an intermediate firewall to pass, simply because the traffic doesn't look like any that the firewall rules are designed to block.
I've been looking at VPN providers lately and I noticed that Vypyr VPN provides a firewall for an extra monthly charge.
Also, firewalls at the VPN endpoints can affect traffic, because they can see the traffic as it comes out of the VPN tunnel and becomes regular traffic.
So I would have thought that the OS firewall applies but the router can't see any of the packets.
is wrong, at least for intuitive understanding of "bypass": what you get is a network interface on your computer that appears to be directly connected to their network.
I suspect Vypyr's firewall service is something that filters traffic before it enters the VPN and travels to your endpoint, saving you the cost of having to carry that traffic only to drop it at your end.
HMA is another provider I was looking at, and I noticed that they have no mention of a firewall.
