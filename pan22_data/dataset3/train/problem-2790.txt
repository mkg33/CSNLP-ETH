I'm looking for the same kind of thing: a quick way to use a real keyboard (for mostly email) on my mobile phone, without buying another piece of hardware.
I made a preliminary effort to compile it, but it won't work against BlueZ v4.
I want to make my laptop announce itself as a bluetooth keyboard or/and a bluetooth mouse.
I assume this is what Marko was referring to (another answer).
This little piece of code claims to do what you want.
is able to make a laptop act as a BT HID device to connect to a PS3.
As far as i remember bluetooth devices implement a set of profiles, in order to act as a remote keyboard your laptop should appears as implementing the HID profile.
It would be nice to be able to connect the computer to my phone or my media computer using bluetooth.
I probably won't get further just now, since my bluetooth stack is currently messed up in Linux, but do post here if you manage to compile it.
It would probably require hacking the bluetooth driver of your laptop to enable such fonctionnality.
However, the Ubuntu repositories have some packages for backwards compatibility with BlueZ 3, which gives me some hope.
This would involve implementing the HID Device profile as opposed to the HID Host profile that most Bluetooth stacks implement.
