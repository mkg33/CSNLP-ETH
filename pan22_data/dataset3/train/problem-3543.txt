Your main risk, I imagine would be dislodging keys (although if it doesn't get swallowed in a vacuum cleaner you can normally clip them back).
However moving the laptop on a certain day could also move that crumb over to short things out.
I am skeptical of a hairdryers ability to dislodge that much gunk due to the low pressure.
As others have mentioned the electronics in a keyboard are minimal, and physical switches are very big and robust (from a static handling pov) compared to other electronic components.
I have (fully knowing the risks) used an air compressor ON MOTHERBOARDS multiple times without issue - I did on occasion even do it at a gas station - and never had an issue.
In fairness I live in a humid climate so the risk here is more of water damage - but I've never had an issue.
Unless you have some high-end keyboard I doubt there will be an issue.
Maybe give it one more shake after the air dryer is off before reconnecting & you should be fine.
I imagine it'd be safe for external keyboards in general.
Its not "safe" from the POV if damaging a keyboard, but it is fairly low risk - especially considering how cheap replacement keyboards are.
My advice: disconnect the keyboard or power-off the laptop, shake it while it's turned upside down, & have away at a COLD air dryer.
They sit on top of sensitive circuit boards & its possible a big crumb could short things out.
