(You can probably do the same thing in Windows 7 by disabling/re-enabling the USB/FireWire/SATA device in Device Manager, but it's kind of a pain.)
(If the device is self-powered, its behavior depends on the device itself, in response to the comments above.)
In Windows XP, the "Safely Remove" feature would completely turn off power to the associated USB port.
As a side note, many external HDDs, such as mine, do not have a power switch.
Otherwise, the HDD just goes into standby or sleep mode.
Use the following command to add the global setting value:
In Windows Vista and above, this feature has been intentionally removed:
I believe the procedure on Macs is slightly different, and you can just re-mount it in software.
But this too would require that the drive doesn't get shut off when you eject the disk.
However, the drive itself doesn't actually turn off, even though it may appear to be (no spinning, no sound, no lights).
This is how you can enable it per device VID&PID or globally:
I've tested this on Firewire and eSATA drives (well, the same drive but using those 2 different connectors), and the behavior on my Seagate drive is to simply unmount the drive, causing the external drive to behave as if the data cable had been disconnectedâ€”the HDD's light begins to dim and then turns off.
This is so that the standard re-mounting procedure in Windows (disconnecting and reconnecting the Firewire/eSATA cable) will allow the drive to be re-mounted.
The only way to actually turn off its power is to disconnect the power cable.
And the way to turn it on is to simply plug the power cable in.
