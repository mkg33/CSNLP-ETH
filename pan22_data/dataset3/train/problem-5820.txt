Alternatively to placing the module in the ss, you could put it in your Personal.xlsb.
The answer posted by @Ƭᴇcʜιᴇ007 is an excellent one with one exception that others have commented on:  the Beep method relies on your onboard (and sometimes disabled) speaker within the computer and doesn't use your speakers, so you may hear nothing.
You can change the sound by changing sound_Up to another item from the SoundType enumeration (list) in the code below such as sound_Complete or sound_Notify.
It uses your normal computer speakers instead of the onboard and often disabled speaker accessed with the Beep method.
I'd like to divert my attention from the screen and get something done at my desk, but be alerted for when the calculation is finished.
This would enable you to have the "beep" available to any ss.
If there were less content involved I would have posted a comment instead.
Here's what I use to play a sound with VBA on Windows.
To run it, either modify the Quick Access Toolbar or insert a button/shape to click in your ss and assign the macro to it.
