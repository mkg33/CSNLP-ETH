If your ESP had an EFI\ubuntu directory, then Ubuntu was installed in EFI mode, and by deleting that directory, you rendered Ubuntu unbootable, at least until you repair it.
Confusingly, though, most UEFI-based computers also support a BIOS/legacy boot mode and so can boot from emergency disks and the like intended for BIOS-based computers.
As a first step to recovery, I recommend you locate a Windows 8 recovery disc and use it to repair your installation.
The MBR contains no boot code, just a protective partition that helps to identify the disk as using the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning system.
Under EFI, the firmware reads boot loader files in the EFI System Partition (ESP).
First, in an EFI-mode installation (which your Windows almost certainly uses and Ubuntu probably used), the MBR is irrelevant to the boot process.
The second disk you mentioned may be booting in this way, but your description is unclear on this point.
At that point, you'll need to restore Ubuntu to bootability.
I'm not fully conversant in the Windows bootrec and bcdboot tools, so I'm not entirely sure what those commands did.
This will probably get Windows up and running again, but Ubuntu will probably remain unbootable.
