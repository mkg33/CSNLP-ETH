How do I enable LDAP users to be able to log-in to the CentOS servers, and also be able to change their LDAP passwords from the CentOS clients?
I have been trying to get the users on the LDAP server to get authenticated over centOS 6 clients, but, the client will not accept the passwords of the LDAP users.
I have followed the tutorial mentioned on this link
for the client config, i followed the steps mentioned by Mr. Adrian, in his post on here
After conducting a lot of research, i finally was able to get LDAP installed on CentOS, and make it as my Central Authentication Server.
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state new -m tcp -p tcp --dport 389 -j ACCEPT
cp /usr/share/openldap-servers/DB_CONFIG.example /var/lib/ldap/DB_CONFIG
