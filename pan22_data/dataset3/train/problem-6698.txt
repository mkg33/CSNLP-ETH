the security logs of the two domain controllers of my network are flooded by security events id 4624 and 4634 and to a lesser extent, 4672.
Of course these products often offer additional capabilities such as alerting, normalizing, correlation, archiving and more.
you can create a specific log for a software product and redirect its events to that log), but the security log is pretty much immutable.
If this is really bothersome to you, then you will probably need to invest into some sort of log monitoring solution, which would allow you to store events in a database, a remote syslog server or even a text file.
One such product which focuses on Windows is EventSentry, but there are many more - including free & open source ones.
For example, with EventSentry you could review events while easily / automatically filtering out noise from these events, or even store 4624 in a separate database altogether.
Reading from the internet such a behavior is quite common, and not necessarily means an underlying issue / problem.
I'd like to say to windows server: do not write event id 4624 and 4634 to the security log but, instead, write it to a new log file, used for those events only.
While Windows allows filtering, you cannot divert certain events based on ID to a different log.
However, such a flood undermines the usefulness of a log: too much information, no information.
In such a way I would not lower the security (audit abilities) of the system, but I would improve the information carried by the modified security log.
It is to some extent possible to divert certain event sources to their own event log (e.g.
