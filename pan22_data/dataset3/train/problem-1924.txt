Sysadmin-ing (I made this word up) is kinda a type of 'general medicine'.
I suggest a drill in the ways you suggested yours:
But as I said, after step 6 you are pretty much dealing with a non-standard problem, and there's when the sysadmin skills shine.
Minor changes on the hosts files, corrupted or incorrect passwd or shadow, you name it, and see if the candidates could solve the problem in a logical way in good time.
One good way to train sysadmins is to generate break-and-fix sessions.
Like, if you reach step 5 on the web site down scenario, where to go from there.
You have to be strong with the OS, hardware,  network, security and sometimes with development (you need at least to understand the languages you are working with).
I did it once to test new applicants for a job: they had to put the server up from scratch (so you can check their grasp on installing/partitioning), configure servers and services, do a little basic hardening.
I agree with your drills idea, but I think that they maybe should go a little deeper.
