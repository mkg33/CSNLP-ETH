Might have some errors there but its the general idea.
The only way I was able to create ports first was with VBS and then use printui after the fact:
I've found some ways of scripting printer creation on Windows print servers using WMI, but it looks like WMI doesn't support clustered print servers (or clustered servers at all).
How can I completely script printer creation (including TCP printing ports!)
It creates what is essentially a cab file full of XML that can backup and restore printer setups between servers.

I don't know if this will work in a cluster enviornment, but there is the good old printbrm.exe tool.
The scripts in C:\Windows\System32\Printing_Admin_Scripts are useless because, they are not cluster-aware and end up creating the printers on the active cluster node (just like using WMI).
This might let you do a simple backup, modify the XML to add what you need and let you do a restore to your cluster.
I suggest exporting out a printer or two to see how it is "supposed" to look.
The only tool I found that was able to work on a clustered print server is printui.exe (shortcut for rundll32 printui.dll, PrintUIEntry), but it can't create TCP printing ports: it can only add printers if the port already exists.
on a clustered Windows Server 2008 R2 print server?
