Under most *nixes when using OpenSSL, it doesn't matter what machine you generate the CSR (or certificate) from, since it's just an x.509-encoded text file.
However, the certificate (using the CSR) can still be generated anywhere, since it's just a text file that's imported.)
Installing a certificate is typically as simple as copying the cert/key files onto the machine and pointing the configuration at them.
As you can migrate keys and certificates from one server to another there is no hardware dependency, e.g.
I'm not a Windows guy, but my understanding is that the tool that generates the CSR has to be run on the machine the certificate will be used for - certificates are stored as funny pkcs12-encoded files somewhere.
With Apache I've even pasted both into the same file for convenience.
As they have their own header (it's basically encoded ascii-gobbledigoop) information, you just need to provide this filename to apache as both the SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile.
Both are required, our certification company offered unlimited download for the certificate.
