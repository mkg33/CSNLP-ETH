If all you really want is NAS, I say go for it, it will completely meet your needs.
It isn't going to work how you expect, it will require much more configuration and it doesn't support "home" user features.
I have a 1TB drive backing up six computers, which is pretty near capacity so I'm not able to do much in the way of shared files, but it's easier to remember that shared documents are on the server instead of trying to remember which shared docs folder on which computer has the file I need.
I'm running WHS specifically for the automatic backup.
It is made to be an enterprise level NAS -- that's all.
OpenFiler is a great product, but I would highly not recommend it for the average home user.
The first time was not fun (had to isolate the workstation and server on their own dedicated network with a spare router), but the second time worked like a charm.
That is not to say you can't install software on FreeNAS, you can, but that doesn't align with the goals of the FreeNAS project.
If you want more of a server and NAS type of deal where you can install some more software and have it act as more than a NAS, I'd probably go with WHS.
There are also other free NAS solutions, but really OpenFiler and FreeNAS seem to be the best.
I haven't seen another solution that is smart enough to back up files once that exist on multiple machines.
