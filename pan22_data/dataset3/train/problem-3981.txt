Once I reset the point size to 10, I could enter text.
My table span was over 4 pages with only 1 page being affected.
Also I preview my pages at 50 % to only focus on the columns and this help me realize when I had clicked the column that had the problem it highlighted the following page.
If encountering this problem in Word 2016 - known issue after installing KB 3213656 (August 8) or KB 4011039 (September 5).
I put the cursor in the column I was having trouble inserting text and right clicked and under Table Properties check the column size.
If you merge vertical cells in a table, the cell content disappears, and you can’t select the merged cell.
Follow the steps below on how to uninstall an update on Windows 10:
For some reason the font in that cell had re-sized itself to 0.5 (just for that cell!).
I did this on several pages and realized that the one I could not edit had sizes for the columns on that page, but the other ones were dithered at a whole size of 10.1.
As a workaround, you can uninstall both KBs and your tables will return to normal.
The problem with my file was that Word had arbitrarily set the point size to 0.5 in all the empty cells.
We anticipate releasing the fix for this issue in the next monthly update, tentatively scheduled for October 3, 2017.
This issue occurs only for those who receive Office 2016 updates using Windows Installer technology (MSI).
After installing the August 8, 2017, update for Word 2016 (KB3213656) or the September 5, 2017, update for Word 2016 (KB4011039), you may encounter the following issues:
If you open an existing document that has a table with merged cells, the cells will appear to be blank.
Click in the area of the cell and increase font size.
I had the same issue, it was a form to fill out but looks like the cells were restricted.
I turned on the paragraph marker and notice I had a hard return at the top of the page with the problem column, so I deleted it and at the bottom of that page I place a page break to move the border row back to the top of the next page.
If you have a Click-to-Run edition of Office, such as Office 365 Personal, you won’t encounter this issue.
