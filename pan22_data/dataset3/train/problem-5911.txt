I do the same with the error logs, checking carefully for some strange behaviour.
So I start to check the ganglia metrics to see what happened.
So I'm pretty sure the problem was a sudden increment of the requests to the apache web server.
I checked manually the apache logs, filtering the traffic minutes before and after the restart.
Yesterday my web sites were down for a short time.
But I don't know how this happened, if this was an attack, some nasty bug, a problem in the application, or something else I don't know.
It was clear that one minute before I restarted apache, the number of requests to the web server was very high, surpassing the limits of Apache and blocking other requests.
I logged on my server and my first reaction was restart the apache web server.
Was it wrong restart the web server as the first measure to solve the problem?
I also analyze the logs with some tools (awstats, bots script, etc) with similar results.
What will you do if something similar happens in your web server?
