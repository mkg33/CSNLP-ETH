I could make a rather long post, detailing all the possibilities causing this, or I could give you an extremely useful link that walks one through the entire process.

Try "Weighted round robin" and fire at least 2 requests then check whether your servers receive the requests or not.
My server affinity is set to Client affinity, Use host name, ignore subdomain
Could someone tell my if i am rigth or not but ARR suppose to load balance the request even on all my farm server if i configure it to do that rigth ?
If you find that you cannot solve your problem with the steps listed in this article then feel free to respond with what problems still plague you.
I configure my routing to load balance request even to my iis server, but when i look worker process in my farm server, only one server receive all the request and the other server is idle.
My load balance configuration is Weigthed total traffic,(even distribution).
I use Application request routing in my farm environnement.
