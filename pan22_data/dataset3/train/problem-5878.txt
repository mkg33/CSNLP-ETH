If I provide the company with the static IP that my ISP assigned me, will I be able to log in through any one of those machines?
Your ADSL router will be using NAT to assign all the machines on your local network a private IP address range.
You will also most likely need to forward the Remote Desktop port (3389) to the machine you need to control.
Or will I need some special set up on either a machine or the router, to make it all work?
The IP address your ISP gave you is the one your company will see, and the one they will need to configure.
The company I work for wants to set me up with Remote Desktop access to one of their servers.
If you don't know your public IP address, you can visit whatismyip.com and suffer their advertising, or you can ask Wolfram|Alpha the question: "what is my ip?"
My ISP has assigned me a static IP address; however at home I have multiple machines sharing the Internet through an ADSL modem/wireless router.
Because of this you will need to configure your router to forward port 3389 to the machine you want to Remote Desktop to.
A helpfull website to correctly determine where you appear to be coming from (your IP address) to other people - ie websites etc is WhatismyIP
Because you are running a NAT router, any of the computers sharing that IP address will be able to connect.
