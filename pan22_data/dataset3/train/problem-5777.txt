I hope this may help, and if not, at least you can check it off.
Again, this problem may have to do with permissions.
I wanted to note that another problem, although it may be totally unrelated, is that after fixing this error, another error came from it.

Try a valid DB user and see if that gets you where you are trying to go.
Ubuntu can be quite deterministic in the way you have to allow permissions.
Giving full access to read, write, and execute to PHP5 recursively fixed my problem.

It wasn't auto activated for me (Wasted a good hour on this).
The username and password being requested are most likely for the DB, not for anything apache related.
