One possibility could be to use an ssd as a cache for slower media.
- One 256 GB SSD drive for system and source code.
If you can live with a 256 GB, then one SSD would work great for you.
Also take into consideration that most SSDs will run much hotter than even a pair of regular drives when pushed hard - so make sure you have good air clearance capabilities built into your machine (unless you don't intend to push them very hard anyway).
As you're comparing an SSD to an array of drives, consider "Single Point of failure" as one of the cons, too.
I seldom see any huge speed improvements using SSD or multiple 10-15krpm raid0 drives for "linking and compiling large builds"... switching to an even faster CPU on the other hand will give a lot more gain.
Unluckily as far as i know no windows file systems can do that.
I'd reserve the SSD for OS and application files instead, this will speed up the user response time in bloated IDEs like Visual Studio by a lot... but adding in a single low-fi 500 GB temp drive would be almost free - code and generators doesn't take much space but, the built binaries and generated intermediates can take a lot of space and modern 7k2rpm SATA drives will handle linking and building just fine.
- Two 1 TB SATA drives connected into RAID0 for video files and other stuff.
