Regardless: Best bet is a failing drive since day 1, and since you ran in a mirror the array succesfully covered for this.
Since it moved the controller off the normal AHCI setting you also will have to adjust to read the HDD SMART parameters.
However I never used IRST since it is the worst of both worlds, no performance advantage or extra ports gained from HW RAID, nor the full flexibility of software RAID.
The advantage to this is that is is more portable (read: easier to recover if a failure occurs) and it leaves your SATA controllers in its normal mode.
I would assume that iRST would install a control panel item or status program.
Now from some assumptions and background to your actual questions:
Which is also part of the driver and softwaqre package I am sadly (or not so sadly?)
Unless you hid or disabled it some message should have been available.
Which means you have been running a mirror in a degraded state.
This should have been reported but the drivers (IRST is software RAID handled by the OS and drivers; not in hardware).
If it was always affully slow then one of the original drives was probably faulty since the beginning.
Any SMART tools should be able to communicate with the disk.
So I have no idea how loud windows will complain if the array gives errors.
Then add both harddisks and use windows software RAID, which is not the same as irst, to combine both drives to a mirror.
