This is how my registry looks (I wasn't sure it would work with the wild cards but it seems to work for me):
I also did not have to 'Unblock' any files and read probably all the same treads you did and no one had this solution which I thought was odd.
Most articles I read tell you to set the MaxAllowedZone to '1' which means that local machine zone and intranet zone are allowed but '4' allows access for 'all' zones.
The user may have not closed the original file or something like that.
As an additional note, weirdly the "UrlAllowList" key was required to make this work on another PC but not my test one.
It's probably not required at all but when I added it, it fixed the problem.
I suggest try the least and test it, then add if needed.
There are apparently different levels of authentication for the HTMLHelp MaxAllowedZone registry.
Another method that worked was mapping the path to the network locally by using mklink /d (symbolic linking in Windows 7 or newer) but mapping a network drive letter (Z: for testing) did not work.
