Always thought they're nice and after the new release of the latest macbooks it made me realize I won't have a good portable replacement for at least 4 more years.
The more I think about it, the only thing that would ever change is the mother board and CPU, then I could simply plug in all the other things, like ram and hook up the fans to it again right?
I'm currently using a mid 2010 macbook pro 17 inch and have been using a mac since 2008.
Work purposes meaning video and photoshop editing.
I'm looking at spending 1-1.5k on a computer/parts.
I'm thinking of offloading the heavy duty stuff onto a desktop.
I'm a programmer and coding software doesn't require any power at all really...
does it seem reasonable for me to buy a tower and toss parts at it?
That way when a newer CPU comes around, I can swap out the cpu's?
So my cost of upgrading would be a CPU and not an entire computer?
What's 400-500 vs a whole nother 1.5k to have "the best", AND I'd have the latest USB, thunderbolt etc plugs that are the current speeds right?
AND I'd get the added benefit of being able to swap out graphic cards if I ever (never) want to play a game or something like that.
