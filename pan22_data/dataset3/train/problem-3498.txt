In this case it does not appear that you will be modifying the voltage, so there is little risk that the RAM or other system components will be damaged, as long as the system cooling is sufficient to the task.
Generally speaking, over-clocking RAM frequency simply requires CPU and RAM is able to operate at that frequency, and that the Board supports an SPD/XMP profile that supports the new frequency.
This is not telling you that you have to use overclocking.
I've found that DDR3 1333MHz should work with that CPU and the board supports up to 8GB of them.
I'm going to upgrade RAM in a dated desktop computer with ASRock G41C-GS R2.0 board and Intel Q9400 CPU.
Since your CPU and RAM support 1333MHz, and the motherboard supports the OC required per the documentation (pg 6), it shoudl work fine, but observe the CPU and system temperature after making your change, to ensure everything is thermally stable.
Is it just that the overclocking jumper needs to be set or are there some other risks?
It is informing you that is will work if you choose to use the overclocking mode (or if you are already using it).
One thing to be extra cautious about when overclocking RAM, is Voltage.
found on the p. 8 of the user manual (see link above) though.
