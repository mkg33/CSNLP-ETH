The difference between an IP and a DNS name is that the IP specifies the servers location, while the DNS name allows you to specify the service itself.
If you merge two companies and need their networks to become one, you'd better hope their networks were configured using identifiers and not locators.
There may be some webservers that have multiple sites on them that share the same IP and port for traffic so that DNS is how the different sites are used.
So the underlying implementation can change, the servers can move around without the user noticing it.
You say www.google.com, because you know google does search, but you don't know where on the earth the server is located you end up taking to in the end, all that is abstracted away from you thanks to DNS.
The same thing isn't possible with IP addresses as IP addresses are alocated to specific companies and are nothing that you can take with you.
If I register a domain name with godaddy and don't like godaddy anymore I can go to another provider and keep my domain name.
Not for long, as one of the first things to do would be to implement a DNS-like service to workaround all the trouble that a lack of DNS would produce.
The big win that you get by DNS isn't so much that an DNS name is easier to remember, but that you have an layer of abstraction between the service and its implementation.
In a sense DNS is a very basic form of a content addressesable network, in that you say what you want, but not how to get there.
Without DNS hyperlinks to other webpages would for example break way to easily, so that the world wide web wouldn't be able to function properly.
Here is a good reason for keeping locators (IPs) and identifiers (domain names) separate: RFC 5887.
