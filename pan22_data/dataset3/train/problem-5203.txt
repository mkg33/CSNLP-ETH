I'm trying to calculate the the cheapest solution for the smallest server serving continuously 24/7 for the whole year (that's what Webfaction does with my blogs) giving me a fixed address with third level domains to connect to.
While they serve pages OK I found using the WordPress admin interface unbearably slow and ended up moving most of them to another provider.
It is not very powerful, but for as low as $100 / year I can run a couple of blogs and do all my experimentations on a server and the support is excellent.
Can anyone with a bit of experience in using Amazon Services confirm this rough calculation or point me to what is missing / wrong?
I'm interested in Amazon Ec2 because if some of my pet projects happen to gain a bit of popularity (or, simply, it requires more power) it seems it can scale well and because some application would need a 64bit server that Webfaction does not provide.
Amazon Web Services is not exactly the cheapest provider, it starts making sense when you start integrating their different services.
I've found EC2 Micro instances to be unusable for WordPress.
I currently run a couple of very small sites on a Webfaction VPS.
You could still use a VPS providor like Linode for 120$ a year.
