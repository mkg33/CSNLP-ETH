Like I said, I'm really new to this, but I do enjoy attempting to make these servers and learning how they work, so it's not like making this webserver is a project for a class, It's just assisting me in testing stuff for another class and possibly other websites later on down the road.
I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 desktop edition with a LAMP server
I get it and go to a browser on a different machine and type that IP in.
Now, for fare warning, I'm no ubuntu dominator, I'm pretty newb.
I'm not sure, and this is where I was hoping I could get some help.
You don't have permission to access /html.html on this server."
It may be down for maintenance or configured incorrectly.
The website encountered an error while retrieving http://my_server_ip/phpinfo.php.
By the way, I followed a tutorial on changing the www folder (apache) from /var/www to home/"user"/www.
I get the "index of/" page, where I can browse the website I'm making.
Anyway, I've attempted to build a webserver to to test php and what not for a site I'm building.
Now lets say I'm working on my desktop and open up an FTP and drag and drop something into there, go to the IP in the browser again and try to open it.
Anyway, anyone who decides to help, thanks so much, I'd really appreciate it.
I can't recall how I did that, but it's there and my ftp goes to the home/"user"/www folder.
Although it could have to do with something else, I'm not 100% sure..
I'm sure I set the permissions to let everyone open and view the files, but maybe I didn't?
By the way, I built this in VMware, so it's virtual, over a network, so I can access stuff from anywhere.
But, lets say I make it on the server itself, and try, bam, magic it works.
I go into the terminal, and do ifconfig to find my IP.
I was wondering if I could get some help with FTP, atleast I'm pretty sure it has to do with FTP.
