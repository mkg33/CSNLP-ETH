I haven't used it as a two-way sync, but as a one way push all my files to a fileshare as a backup, and for this purpose it works quite well inside a scheduled task.
i could do with a product that can give you finer control and automatic sync on connection or constant sync on changes.
I use robocopy inside batch files, and it works quite well.
I believe the CLI will allow for automating and scheduling actions.
You just run it and setup the sync's you'd like to do, and then you can set up a scheduled task that references the syncs to run at specified times.
I personally use SyncToy v2 from microsoft and it is great for keeping my laptop in sync with my home pc.
Mostly, I need something like this to keep files synced between a mobile device and a desktop PC - the simplest case would be keeping a digital camera and c:\photos\ synced up.
I think for my needs, i require something scriptable to give me finer control.
However, you are limitted to what scheduled tasks can offer you, I always scheduled lunch time when my laptop was likely docked and I wasn't using it.
Using my netbook i also managed to get it to push files instead of fetching which was weird.
Live Mesh is the successor to Live Sync mentioned previously.
Not sure it is "Enterprise Grade", in that I don't believe there is a standardized way to control it (i.e group policy).
I find it quite adequate but very narrow in cofiguration.
Though it's still in beta, it's definitely worth a look.
i got it working on windows 7 but i am yet to test it on the RC version.
I beleive their are options to do proper two-way sync.
If it works as advertised, this would solve quite a few issues for me.
