Azure firewall is a product for your transit VNet to secure traffic to Azure, across subscriptions and VNets.
Look at the diagrams in the documentation and decide what meets your design.

I've been trying to understand the difference between a Azure firewall (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-firewall/) and the features offered by NSGs/network security groups (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview).
From my perspective, we can manage the in- & outbound traffic based via the network security groups.
The only benefit of the firewall, I see, is that it can be used as a single point for managing traffic rules.
But I don't see the cost of the firewall being worth just reducing the management of this.
In our designed landscape, we currently have around 5~10 virtual networks within our subscription.
I use NSG to limit access within a vNET and Azure Firewall to limit access to a vNET from the outside.
Each of these has it's own network security group at the moment.
I think I'm missing something painstakingly obvious in the picture about the difference between what a Azure firewall does, and how a network security group operate.
There are some good detailed explanation in the docs articles
These networks contain a variety of Azure products(web apps, vms, exposed to only trusted locations, exposed to the internet, ...).
Azure security groups is a feature of VNet that describe firewall rules on the subnets in Azure.
