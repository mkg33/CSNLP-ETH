Considering that hard drives today come in the terabyte range for entry-level home systems, yes, I'd say that 21 gig is small potatoes.
As for your question of reducing disk use, you can either find a compression program for OS X (which I'd not recommend) to crunch space, or you can delete things you know you don't need and be vigilant in your application data caching/storage/program installations.
If you really need Windows and OS X for your work, I'd suggest a trip to the Apple Store and get a larger SSD drive or buy a decent one online and do the work yourself if you don't have Applecare.
Because only you can answer if you need what you have installed.
You'll be glad to have the extra space rather than trying to shoehorn it in.
But with only 64 gig of space, you're going to be cramped with two operating systems on the drive.
As time goes by, SSD's will get less costly and more capacity.
One of the tradeoffs with SSD's today is capacity; you get blazing speed but lower capacity, unless you want to pay a LOT more money.
As for the size of your installation, are you talking about JUST OSX?
Use a tool like Disk Inventory X to see what is taking up your disk space.
