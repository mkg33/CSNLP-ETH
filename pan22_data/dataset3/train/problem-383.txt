Your best option would be to get new media from MS.  As your OEM refuses to fulfill their obligations.
I just need a way to get XP back onto these systems.
Unfortunately, you need an OEM Windows XP Professional disc in order to activate using your product keys.
In my experience the latest OEM Dell XP disc downloaded from a popular nautically themed torrent site works a treat!
get new stock OEM media and use that already legit licence.
Officially Only an actual OEM, that resells, can use those licences.
Truthfully, you rightfully own a licence and paying for a new one is wrong on principle alone.
The Dell disc looks for Dell hardware, if it is present it installs without entering a serial.
I need to reinstall XP and all I have access to are the MSDN copies of XP.
I found a page on Dell's website where they would send you a free copy of a reinstall disk for what ever system.
Since Dell preinstalled Windows for you, those workstations have OEM product keys.
You already own those workstations, and their respective XP OEM licences.
MS has a whole page devoted to how DIYers, hobbyists and home users CANNOT use OEM licences and comply with their copyright.
This change in terms is somewhat new, but still applicable for newly sold/packaged software.
There are a number of routes that you can take in order to get an OEM disc.

It makes absolutely no sense IMO, to purchase another OEM Licence.
I feel no need to unconditionally support MS in anyway, I use GNU/Linux.
I tried to do that but I just got an email saying the system is too old (~5 years).
If you feel self-righteous enough, and I would, go to the `bay.
Either way, I wouldn't feel bad Locating new media for software I'm legally licensed.
SO, for whatever your reason, if it is important be 100%.
Anyone who believes that buying an OEM licence for this purpose relives you of any copyright violations, is very mistaken.
