If I overclocked my motherboard's chipset, will I experience a significant improvement in graphics?
Of cause, the graphics performance is terrible (12.5fps at best), but I was still surprised that my integrated graphics chipset can actually run a Crysis game at this amount of FPS.
Many games are responding slowly, including Team Fortress 2 at low graphics settings.
This question doesn't have to be aimed at improving performance in games necessarily; it'd be quite nice to receive a significant graphical boost 'across the board'.
My BIOS offers an option to overclock the Nvidia chipset.
My motherboard is the Asrock N68C-GS FX, and have a AMD FX4100 CPU with 4GB DDR3 1066MHZ RAM.
To my surprise, the only game that does not behave in this way is Crysis Wars (and quite possibly Crysis 1, too).
My AMD Radeon HD 5830 recently broke (overheated because the fan stopped working), and I am currently attempting to run games on integrated graphics, on my chipset.
I do not have the money at the moment to purchase a new graphics card (XFX are refusing to RMA my broken graphics card, claiming it was my fault the fan broke when it was not [the card is still within warranty]), and this question has been in my head for a few days now.
