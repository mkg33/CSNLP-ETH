To enable ssh at startup, backup boot.rc on the boot partition on the SD image and replace it with boot_enable_ssh.rc
It takes about 20 to 30 minutes to install a minimum Raspbian installation and then you're good to go.
They have an excellent installation manual in the README.md.
After performing the steps described in it, I was able to SSH from my Windows 10 laptop to my Raspberry PI with user pi and password raspberry.
I took the Micro SD card out of the Pi that would not let me connect, and put it in a USB reader on one of the working Pis.
Since I had some other Pis that I could connect to, I cheated.
Unzip the latest stable release onto it and insert the SD-card into your Raspberry Pi.
Took the card out after unmounting it, booted the Pi, then the SSH port was opened and accessible.
You might want to give the raspbian-ua-netinst a try: you can find it by clicking here It's the minimal Raspbian unattended netinstaller for Raspberry Pi Models 1B, 1B+ and 2B.
There are some options that allow you to install additional packages and stuff during the initial install.
I don't know about your router, but you may be able to configure it to reserve a fixed IP address for the MAC address of your Pi.
Works on Debian, I'm sure on other systemd style systems as well.
I then mounted it to a test folder (sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/test), then chroot /mnt/test to treat it as the new shell.
