I have 2 Windows Server 2003 boxes that sit idle, for the most part, on weekends.
Granted that the DNS client process is going to be responsible for any DNS related traffic relevant to Yahoo, which isn't going to tell you the "why" of it, but filtering for HTTP and HTTPS should allow you to see what other processes may be trying to connect to Yahoo.
Is there a way that I can find out which program or service running is making these requests?
Yet when I look at my router's DNS logs, both machine's are making many requests for www.yahoo.com when there's nobody using the machine.
The requests happen at a rate of slightly more than 1/minute.
NetMon will list each process responsible for it's corresponding network traffic, which should allow you to track it down.
None of the programs that run in perpetuity make any requests to Yahoo that I know of.
You'll need to enable certain debugging in the Windows DNS server in order to gather who is making the request:
You might also need to use Wireshark or Netmon to capture the packets in order to fully understand what is happening.
