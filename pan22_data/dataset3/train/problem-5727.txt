A quick Google search of {lang} visualization can help you with this.
I think it is not very efficient, for example, i can not zoom or scroll.
For example, Python has Bokeh, Pandas, and Seaborn.
I have a time series data set that I need to manually label them for supervised learning.
I want to ask is there any tool that i can visualize the data, and manipulate the data at the same time please.
Bokeh is for interactive visualizations which can help with digging deeper into the visualizations.
The visualizations in Tableau can be made easily -you can also interact with the graphs in various ways (like zoom in zoom out) and it doesn't require high-level coding skills.
I'm not sure it's what you need, but for data mining without a single line of code (it works with widgets that you drag and drop), orange is definitely the way to go.
Tableau Public version is a freeware in which you can connect to basic data sources such as excel, csv etc.
You can also learn some Tableau basics from here: https://www.tableau.com/learn/training
Download it from there official website: https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/
What I am doing now is using excel to plot, and when I see the pattern that I want, I hover over the data on the plot, read its index, then mark the data accordingly on the data.
Are there any python based data visualization toolkit?
