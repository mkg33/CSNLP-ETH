Note that you are always able to connect from your own computer to your own computer.
I know about "Listen *:80" but this is not a solution in this particular case.
Create a file named /Library/LaunchDaemons/ipfw.plist with the following content:
Now you can try to connect from another computer to your own and check that connection is blocked.
The only thing I could imagine if to use OS X firewall to block incoming requests to Apache on those interfaces.
You may want to go for slightly different set of rules (like block all but allow "lo0" interface) if you use a USB modem.
I need it to listen on all network interfaces except en0 and en1 (basically, listen on lo and vnicX from Parallels).
But I could not find any working examples and could not make such rules myself.
After reading the OS X security guide, I used ipfw.
Create a file named /etc/ipfw.conf with the following content:
They're in Settings -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall.
The problem: I have a local Apache instance on my Macbook Pro.
