When it prompts me to choose the user I type in pi.
Boot the os either ideally with no internet and begin by adding a new user
There are many options but the bare minimum here would be
I installed Raspbian Jessie this time, not NOOBS, I introduced a modified version of @leviataint 's code, changed my Pi's password, and finally managed to SSH using the Pi username.

you want to configure and allow ssh connections either from the gui menu, adding the ssh file to the sd card before boot or using
Your machine is likely already compromised in the worst case and will be after not to long in the best case.
You should also consider either, changing the default pi users password to something long and secure (my suggestion) or deleting the pi account entirely.
BTW I have already placed a file named ssh in the boot partition of my Pi so that it automatically boots with ssh on.
But the above should be the bare minimum to securing your raspberry pi and only allowing access to you, not everyone.
Ideally you might look at ssh keys for access instead
Under root or pi add your username and permissions
To begin first of all you should NOT be using a the pi while connected to the internet with open ssh ports and default credentials allowed, this is madness.
I have tried typing in raspberry as the password, resetting the password with sudo passwd and trying with that password but nothing works.
I'm trying to access my RPi 3 via Putty from a Windows 10 laptop.
now you want to edit the sshd config file to deny certain users and allow others
Reformat the sd card and reboot the pi ideally with a screen and keyboard, or if thats not possible then i would suggest doing the following quickly.
