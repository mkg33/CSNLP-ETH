I attempted to use hlookup, but only found it useful for filling a single cell, dragging the formula didn't carry too well for me.
One easy way to resolve it is to have the columns refer back to the first page with offset.
I have a datasheet that has many columns that may change positions.
Any ideas on ways to perform this using functions in excel?
OFFSET(Sheet1!$A$2,0,MATCH(A$1,Sheet1!$A$1:$Q$1,0)-1,499,)
To make it easier to use I want to create a second sheet that keeps the columns in a specified order.
As you fill the formula down, the ROW() acts as an offset to look at the next column on your table.
But in another instance of sheet 1 they may appear as
Assuming these variable data on Sheet1, in A1:Q499, then on Sheet 2, I would put this in cell B2:
I'd rather not use a macro unless absolutely necessary.
I want my second sheet to specify that the first row is 'id', second is 'name', etc.
For extra fancy, you could put cell protection in Sheet2, A1:Q1 that only allows values from a list, and use Sheet1 A1:q1 as that list.
I can count on the column titles remaining the same, so I want to copy columns based on their title, or rather the first cell in the column matches a string.
