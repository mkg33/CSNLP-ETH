nginx itself for static content and single nginx can't just handle them all.
But i can't find any information with regard to how well it's for serving very big amount of static content.
I can make nodejs apps to serve static content but as i understand due to it's single threaded nature of nodejs it would be inefficient as well.
As i understand this way it's pretty easy to scale a website for serving dynamic content (all you need to do is to spawn multiple nodejs apps) and nginx is serving static content.
My understanding is that nginx is well-suited for serving static content.
I guess i can spawn multiple nginx instances but it seems to me it would be inefficient.
So do you have any thoughts on how to manage nginx for big amount of static content?
Let's say i use nginx as a web server and node.js as an application server then i can set up nginx as reverse proxy and load balancer so it gives me the ability to spawn multiple node.js instances (for example under reverse proxy i can have let's say 5 running node.js apps).
