The server is hosted on Media Temple, and I am waiting for their assistance but I am not sure how  long it will take.
Long story short, I deleted this file thinking it was a file I had just created with a similar name for PCI compliance.
(I guess I can't choose this as an answer just yet.
I am still unsure what information is lost in doing so however.
From  what I've read, if you cannot restore the file yourself you must repair plesk either by reinstalling the same version or  upgrading.
Luckily for me my hosting provider (Media Temple) was able to recover the file from their backups in a timely manner, fully resolving the issue.
If anyone has a more detailed answer with a way to restore plesk to working condition WITHOUT using a backup, I will transfer correct answer to you!)
The symptoms of removing the file are: Plesk, FTP, MySQL, SSH all work fine, your subscriptions are visible, site files are still intact - but you get the default CentOS server page on any domain pointing to your server.
