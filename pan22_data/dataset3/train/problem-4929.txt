I think you want high availability for your application, expecting it as a vm to failover to the other hyper-V in case of hardware/host issue.
I would try reduce the number of assigned CPUs for that VM, go as low as 4 then 8 and compare your results.
Virtualization is used to share hardware resources between virtual host that can't/don't use efficiently these resources.
You are nearly using all available resource with just one VM.
-check again with fewer CPU if the gap is still that bad
My only assumption here is that hosts expect a higher number of guests with smaller CPU assignments versus 1 or 2 hosts.
Except if your application is not able to work in Failover/cluster mode (or can't pay license), i suggest to switch to these models instead of virtualization.
But if I start Prime95 in this machine the vCPU counters are all at 100% - the Host idles by 3%.
I've seen this on many virtual systems, the assignment of a large number of virtual cores reduces the actual cpu availability.
Each of them has two 16 Core AMD CPU's, eight 16GB DDR3 ECC RAM modules, 10 HDD's in HW-Raid 6.
Using virtualization often means to loss between 5 to 10% of hardware resources due to virtualization overhead.
Logically, the result of the prime-number-test needs ~12 times longer than the host itself.
One VM has 24 vCPU's and 80GB RAM (as well Windows Server 2012).
we have a windows server 2012 enviroment with two hyper-v servers.
