Sounds like using HTTPS rather than SFTP would be the way to go.
Is there an SFTP server that has "copy on access" such that if the box in the DMZ were to be compromised, no actual data resided on that box?
Jscape has an SFTP reverse proxy that should do what you want.
However, we don't want to maintain the data on server as it would then reside in the DMZ.
We are investigating solutions to the following problem:
I am envisioning an SFTP Proxy or SFTP passthrough.
We have external (Internet) users who need access to sensitive information.
They will find out about the proxy but if you use basic auth they won't be able to access the data.
See http://www.jscape.com/reverseproxy/index.html.
If a user compromises the DMZ server and gets a shell they won't have access to the data.
You could use netfilter http://kreiger.linuxgods.com/kiki/?Port+forwarding+with+netfilter , fwtk http://sourceforge.net/projects/openfwtk/ , or even SSH port forwarding.
We could offer it to them via SFTP which would offer a secure transport method.
BTW it is easy enough to make a SFTP proxy if you don't need any features beyond port forwarding.
Globalscape EFT server with the DMZ gateway does exactly what you are asking for
Run an HTTP proxy on a DMZ server and keep the data on an internal web server.
