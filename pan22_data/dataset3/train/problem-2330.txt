Since you don't have spare parts to test this yourself, take it to a shop that does, and can swap out some of these things.
That's why a lot of machine fall over when installing the OS because for the rest of their life they just do light tasks like word processing.
but the first port of call would be to see how much wattage your system is running, and get a SOLID and over powered PSU for you machine, and see if clears that up.
I'd certainly swap the out for a higher wattage psu and see if the makes the system more stable.
Motherboards over cheaper quality can't sustain 100% cpu or bus/memory utilisation.
This may indicate a hairline fracture in the motherboard itself.
try using an external video card, as sometimes a built graphics can be cause these type's of problems.
which drags the tracks apart and cause a short/break.
Is the motherboard properly grounded, make sure it is, also while the machine is running trying applying small amount of pressure to different area's of the motherboard (not any electrical tracks) and see if this causes a reboot.
Physically inspect the motherboard and the cap's to see if there is any bulging or leaking.
In fact any damage you can see on might be relevant.
Also try adding a filtering UPS , you may be getting power spikes from the laundrette next door ;-)
if you can get the dmesg and /var/logs before and after the crash this may show some clues...what kind of server is this?
Motherboard could have a dodgy capacitor or dry joint somewhere.
don't do this if you don't know what your doing, but seeing as you built the machine yourself, i assume you know how not to electrocute yourself.
It's always the last thing you test, is where the problem is always found :-)))
