- it's pricey, but they were early to the game and from my experience provide good service.
They filter traffic for you, and then redirect it to your backend.
These types of services can be quite expensive, and unless you have the cash to absorb it, the script kiddies can just increase their fire-power quickly by increasing the attack into the multi-gbps zone, which will cost you quite a bit.
Most of these tend to require you to have it running before you encounter problems, as they work by analysing patterns in traffic.
I've never used such services but it depends on the types of attacks you're getting.
My question is: do anybody have experience with such service?
I have experience with Verisign's DDoS Mitigation Services.
So, it adds some small time overhead, but let you site be alive even under DDoS.
So we thinking about using some  external DDoS protections service.
But our DC is not ready to provide good quality of protection.
first of all, I understand that it's better to have DDoS protections on data center level.
If they are exploiting an application or protocol then I would handle that with configuration changes on your end.
I have googled several, like (sorry can not post many links):
If they're purely bandwidth style attacks and just filling up your pipe, the only way to go is to hire a service like them or to distribute your servers across many pipes and data centers.
The general idea, is that you are changing DNS to point on DDoS protection service.
