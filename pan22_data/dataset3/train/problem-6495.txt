If someone please could explain that problem better, I would mark his answer as correct solution.
But unfortunately I can't find the source any more.
But it's cumbersome to ping -4 raspberrypi every time, to find out it's IP address.
SMB1.0/CIFS file sharing support (client) is enabled in Windows 10
I have set up SMB shares on my Raspberry Pi and connect to it via it's hostname \\raspberrypi\shared
Seems I've found an answer myself after months of searching.
I remember reading something about Windows adding the domain name to the hostname during samba authentication, which is wrong in this case and leads to the described problem.
I remember having the same problem with a Windows 8.1 machine.
If I use raspberrypi.local instead of just raspberrypi as the host name, the Windows machine has no problems with authentication.
However if I use the IP address of the raspberry Pi instead of it's hostname there is no problem connecting: \\192.168.0.112\shared
which is working correctly with my Windows 7 machine.
Is there something different in smb client of Windows 10 compared to Windows 7?
But the Windows 10 machine refuses to connect, telling that the user or password is incorrect.
