For example, I could have a NFS share with IP 1 dedicated to ESXI server and workstations using SMBA with IP 2.
Whereas with manual load sharing, you'll still only get 0.5Gbps per server, because they both must use the same physical link.
In a single switch environment, LACP will offer redundancy should one of your aggregated NIC's fail.
Bandwidth should not be the only consideration - also consider redundancy.
As for which method will provide more throughput, if I understand your scenario correctly, then link aggregation will only really increase throughput when multiple clients attempt to maximize their bandwidth with the server at the same time, whereas manual load sharing only really increases throughput when there are different clients using each service at the same time.
This redundancy increases if you have multiple stacked switches and connect each LACP link to a different switch.
So which of these two scenarios do you think will be more common in your environment?
If bandwidth is the only consideration, hence the question, I would like to know which would provide more throughput?
But if you want to ensure that your NFS and SMB shares are both guaranteed at least 1Gbps each, then manual load sharing might be the way to go).
By manual load sharing I mean NICs on file server have different IPs and shares are mounted via different IPs.
By reading this ESXi link It seems better to do manual load sharing.
Should this happen while doing manual load sharing then whichever service was bound to the failed NIC will also fail.
with LACP you could have 2 servers accessing an NFS share at 1Gbps each.
Given my switch is configured hash using src and dest ip and port.
I have a file server with multiple NICs  (1Gbps) consumed by some different kinds of client.
