The closest I've seen for things like this is Puppet for Linux and WSUS for Windows, but I have had numerous complaints about the way WSUS works and I haven't run Puppet personally.
For Solaris, PCA is a script that will use your login to SunSolve to search patches based on a patch reference released from Sun (patchdiag.xref).
You can use PCA with a proxy which can have your patchset already on it.
Use that and a consistent patchdiag.xref and you can get everything the same.
I don't think I've heard of such a program, or at least an open source one.
I'm not sure how you'd resolve dependencies and such.
I believe you can get a win-get for windows that is like apt-get...not sure if it will help point you in the right direction
There are some applications commercially available for Windows that will handle updating various packages but even then there's a list of what they support.
Only meeting part of your critera, but Big Fix Enterprise could be an answer.
Are you talking about for a program you're developing, or just managing updates on workstations period, or...?
Otherwise you have to create packages that get transferred to clients.
The script can report on patches to install, download them, and even install them.
I think it can be used to have a patch server that other machines connect to, but I haven't gotten that far with it yet!
