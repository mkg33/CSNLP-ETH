But we need to be able to check out code from the internet over ssh.
You just don't have and don't want to open up a port on the actual server.
Once finished you can commit your changes back to the server.
I am presuming the machine with the SVN server has a connection to the network and can browse the internet.
We have our svn server on a machine not accessible from the internet.
If not port forwarding, whats the most secure way of doing this, if there is any?
Given that we can do port forwarding on a machine accessible from the internet, whats the best way to set this up?
For this you will need to setup VPN and forward the ports on the router to the VPN server.
I would use VPN to get onto the network you should then be able to update your local SVN files to their newest revisions so you can view/work on them.
Then view/work on the files off the RDP machine.You will need to forward port 3389 or another port if you use a non standard RDP port which will increase security.
you could RDP to a workstation that has the files on them.
