Phone Sheet has Employee Caller id, date, and the duration of calls.
I tried using the data model to combine all the sheet using a composite key for all the 3 different ids, but instead of making it more complex, I want to use the sumifs function to do the same thing, in a more basic manner.
You could do away with the schedule sheet as it appears to be redundant.
Email Sheet has Employee Email id, date, and the time spent on each email.
Schedule Sheet has Employee id, time spent on the phone, and time spent on email.
Master Sheet has the date, team leader, Employee name, Employee Caller if(from Phone Sheet), Employee Email id(from Email Email id), and Employee if(from Phone Sheet).
Then just do a pivot on this new table to get your master sheet.
I'm working on a team project where I've been asked to combine data from multiple worksheets(with different attributes), and put them inside a Master Sheet.
But if you are allowed to restructure your sheets, it seems like you could merge the phone and email sheet into one.
You then add two columns 1) for the employee name and 2) phone/or email.
