You would pipe a list of mailboxes to that command, include only the folder you want, then push those messages to your SPAM recipient mailbox OR you could output them directly into a PST file using the same command.

PS: If would be possible to modify the Full Access mode, this should be better.
Then your next stop is this command:  http://linux.die.net/man/1/readpst (which I haven't used but seems like what you need) to make the data in the PST readable by SPAMAssassin.
Get-Mailbox | New-MailboxExportRequest -IncludeFolders "Junk E-Mail" -FilePath \servername\folder\JunkMail.PST
I've created a "spam crawler" account with full access to all mailboxes in an Exchange 2013 environment to get messages in the junk folder to feed the Bayesian filtering running on SpamAssassin in a Linux Anti-spam machine.
So to get things more secure I would like to restrict connections with this account only from the Linux machine.
After that runs, you'll want to clean up the ExportRequests:
I just need to download the Spam messages, so reading permissions is sufficient.
This account does not have a mailbox, but have permissions to access other mailboxes.
Okay, turns out I was thinking of the wrong command (sorry about that).
(Note:  this has to be a UNC, local folder won't help.)
