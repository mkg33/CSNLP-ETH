The only times I ran into this error were when the server/workstation somehow "lost" its link with the domain.
maybe restart the workstation service on the app server!
Re-forcing domain membership did the trick (netdom /resetpwd).
On the net you will find that its usually a problem with an AV but since you don't run any... maybe another kernel-mode app like a backup software ?
If that fails, recycling the Workstation Service can avoid a reboot, but it's almost as drastic.
Can you access other network shares (from the RDP session to the app server) when the problem arises ?
We have made change in Application to access another server to using IP address as we have static IP network.
For serverland applications, recycling the Application Pool for that service works.
You should also sniff CIFS network traffic when the problem arises to see what happens.
If that is not allowing to resolve the name and after rebooting your app server it would allow to access.
Could you give more details on the software installed on the apps server ?
For userland applications, force-closing the connection to the remote server and reopening it will bring it back, though you may have to try a couple of times before it gets its act together.
I had same issue when some workstation user complain that they were not able to access application stored in another server, we had done the same by trying to access with server-ip that would worked but not with name so we have checked DNS.
I've had cases like this before, though not with an EMC back end.
Have you checked event logs on the DC for the faulty app server ?
