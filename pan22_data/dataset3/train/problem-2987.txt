An example (but not necessarily absolute definition) of something that would be acceptable, would be a command that gets and displays the current PID followed by another command (if not same) that shows the Integrity Level for that PID.
Commands which rely on the implications of a given output (e.g.
Solutions should be compatible down to Windows 7 Pro SP0.
Most methods I've seen rely on non-native tools, third-party software, or proxy indicators which may not necessarily be reliable or compatible across all systems.
I'm trying to find a way to authoritatively show whether a command prompt is running elevated or not, from the command prompt (CMD.exe), on a stock Windows installation.
: assuming the session is elevated if you can run certain commands, or determining elevation status based on the window's title bar) are not acceptable for this purpose.
Though these systems do have PowerShell, it is not an option for this purpose.
I'm looking for something more along the lines of getting the system itself to explicitly state that the current session is elevated, or to show via command line that the current process is being run at an Integrity Level of High.
