Nevertheless, you can play it using a program like VLC which doesn't need the keys, since it is able to circumvent the encryption.
If you want a program that will copy the disc to the hard drive and also remove the copy protection so that you can burn it to a new unprotected disc, MacTheRipper will do that, but it looks like it hasn't been updated in a while.
So if you burn a new disc with this image it will not play on a standard DVD player.
As mentioned in other answers you can use Disk Utility or dd to create an ISO image of the original disc.
This will save you a lot of disk space compared to storing the MPEG-2 content that is used on DVD-Video discs.
However, it will not preserve the DVD menus, and if you want to burn a DVD that you can play on a standard DVD player then you would have to convert it back to MPEG-2.
Just create a new image and select “DVD/CD Master”.
For storing on your hard drive you might find it more useful to transcode the content to unencrypted H.264 using Handbrake.
Don't forget asr, the Apple Software Restore command-line utility: it can operate like a raw copy program like dd, but it has more bells and whistles.
- Apple adds the extension .cdr but you can rename the file to end in .iso and it will work as a standard ISO.
I found you can also create a disk image using disk utility.
Not least, it will work directly with volume pathnames, as dd won't.
Among its many features is the ability to make disc images:
I'm normally a command-line person myself, and the built-in Disk Utility works pretty well also, but I recently stumbled across another good and free alternative called Burn.
Anyone know how this effects any drm protection on disks?
But if the disc is copy protected, it contains decryption keys in the lead-in area of the disc which cannot be read directly, and are not part of the ISO image.
