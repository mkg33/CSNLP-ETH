As I'm using virtual domains, there would be a different folder for each user@domain, and not a general quarantine.
Using maildrop you can have a default system wide config which will check the headers and filter spam into the correct location, with something like this in /etc/maildroprc:
I wouldn't rely 100% on amavisd for dropping mail thought to be spam; I would only mark the subject somehow and still deliver
There are several options to accomplish this, and they all largely depend on the delivery agent you are using to do the final delivery to a user's virtual mailbox.
Using amavisd-new, I'm successfully marking multiple headers and accurately reporting most spam.
I guess I want it to function like gmail or yahoo mail do today, automatically moving suspected SPAM into a junk folder.
change the mailbox location depending on your local setup.
So false negatives could be placed there and the system would learn from that.
I'm not sure if postfix, amavis or policyd is the right place to begin.
A wholly different approach, given that either your mail volume is low or you have access to some serious hardware, would be to run amavisd-new as a before queue filter, thereby eleminating the need for spam/junk folders or quarantine completely: If a legitimate mail is rejected as spam, the sender will be notified by it's own mail server - since you technically never accepted the mail, you won't be responsible for anything.
From time to time I will run sa-learn on these boxes (one for each account).
However, right now I'm delivering it to the inbox and I would like to have a Junk folder instead.
You'll need to setup something like procmail or maildrop to filter the mail into the correct folder when it gets delivered.
however, until there, there is greylisting, spf and rbl's which are really great
