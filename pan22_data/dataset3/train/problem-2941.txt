It uses lvm to create the swap volume and also creates a volume that might be useful as /tmp.
Ephemeral drives are very quick, but sadly not very persisent.
Also, if you partition your swap, you can use the rest of the ephemeral drive for things like the tmp folder, or storing sessions (if your host is a webserver).
One word of warning however, and I apologise If Im "Teaching granny to suck eggs" But as the name implies, an Ephemeral drive is... well, Ephemeral.
You will need to unmount /dev/xvdb before you do anything with it.
Better to either sfdisk as Abhishek mentions, or manually create a swap partition using fdisk:
/dev/xvdb is indeed mounted, you need to check to see if anything is stored on there that you want to keep, although keeping important stuff on an ephemeral drive is a REALLY bad idea.
First unmount your epermal storage and remount like below
it will make a swap space of the whole ephemeral drive, which you almost certainly don't need.
I have created a script that may be helpful for creating swap on ephemeral devices.
If you ever shutdown your instance, you will have to recreate your swap partition and enable it.
For this reason, dont add your newly created swap space to your fstab.
