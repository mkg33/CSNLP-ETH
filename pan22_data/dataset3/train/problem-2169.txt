Ok found the answer and its a lot simpler than you would think.
So this was supposed to be fixed with Directwrite in Chrome 37, but unfortunately I think I am one of a very few people, if not the only one who it actually backfired on.
My fonts were perfectly fine for months up until a few days ago when I believe I must have received the update.
I cannot confirm the exact day I received the problem because I was traveling :(
The only issue is that the article claims the problem is gone!
Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Display -> Adjust ClearType text -> Enable
This time no luck, they are still uninstalled from my computer.
This post describes perfectly my problem: http://www.dev-metal.com/fix-ugly-font-rendering-google-chrome/
I must have had this enabled and maybe a windows update or graphics card update changed my settings.
The first time I had this problem, my solution, which worked even though it was strange was to delete the google fonts from my computer (they were installed so I could use them with microsoft word).
You will then calibrate your screen and restart chrome and everything will be better!
