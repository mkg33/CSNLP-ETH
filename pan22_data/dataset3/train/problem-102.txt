l[02p]_norms would probably be better expressed via range-for or folds from <algorithm> (std::accumulate etc.)
Unsure what your Real type is, technically, for sufficiently large containers, i in this loop, and similar ones, will soon stop changing.
But determining the correct output type is not possible to do in a generic way.
This one is really only useful for arithmetic types, and that is a shame.
The order of the elements in the array affects the mean?
It'd be interesting if it could return the median of a set of words, for example.
Similarly, it computes the mean of integers {255, 0, 0, 0} not as 255.0/4=63.75, not as that value rounded up or down, but as 65.
I'd suggest you require type traits to exist for the arithmetic type being used, and that one of these type traits be the type of the output for these functions.
mean_and_population_variance() will have similar issues, and it will overflow.
I would expect mean() to return a double if the input is integer.
I would not want to use these tools as they are now.
I think it would be interesting to have such a collection of tools be standardized.
