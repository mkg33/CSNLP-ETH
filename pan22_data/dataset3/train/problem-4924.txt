You'll have to assume that the number of sectors per track is constant over the area where you are measuring the maximum transfer rate for starters.
Unfortunately drives are not physically simple anymore.
If a sector is a known size (in bytes), you know the rpm of the drive, you know the maximum transfer rate* (in Megabytes/sec or somesuch) it should be fairly straightforward to work out the maximum number of sectors on a track.
For drives with multiple physical platters and multiple heads you have to adjust for that too - for example on a drive with six read\write heads on three platters, there might be 200 sectors per track, (on each side of a platter) but there will be 1200 sectors per cylinder.
It probably is but it might not be, so the best you can get using these numbers is a pretty close estimate  provided the drive is physically simple.
I say "should be" because you're not being given enough data for a modern drive.
If you know the physical structure of the drive (number of read/write heads), you know that it's pretty healthy (so there are no significant amount of remapped sectors), you know that it doesn't use interleaving and you know that the read test you carried out was thorough enough to swamp any cache effects, then you can make a reasonable calculation based on the rpm of the drive and the maximum transfer rate.
To expand on Michael Graff's answer - there is a lot going on at the physical level (remapping of sectors, variable track geometry, multiple heads and more) that will make it hard to give an absolute answer.
Sector interleaving would completely throw any calculations out too but that is rare in modern drives as far as I'm aware.
