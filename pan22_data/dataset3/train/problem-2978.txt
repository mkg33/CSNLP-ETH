Do you need to restore from an existing image, if so then you need the tool that made it.
If so, then look at Rollback Rx Pro, and there are other similar systems as well.
Do you want to set up a system where you can easily restore from an image you've presently made, then ghost should be able to do it, but there are plenty of others.

If you have a Linux live CD at hand, you can use the power of dd.
