When I now start my Window computer the app automatically opens.
"HD-RunApp.exe" and the apps would appear on the BlueStacks desktop.
Android that came after the above line is a keyword which tells an application info to the launcher and those information are:
I used multiple iterations and combinations of the command line instruction listed by previous users and none worked but BlueStacks would open up with
"C:\Program Files\BlueStacks\HD-RunApp.exe" -json "{\"app_icon_url\": \"\", \"app_name\": \"Integra\", \"app_url\": \"\", \"app_pkg\": \"com.onkyo.integraRemote4A\"}"
in my version of bluestacks it uses -p switch for app name and -a switch for that app activity.
Users > "myname" > AppData > Roaming > Microsoft > Windows > Start Menu > Programs > Startup
and you are telling BlueStacks to run which application
note that activities are like windows in your computer for android os.
Inside the "Apps"-Folder are links to all installed apps.
it sends os, app package name, starter activity's class name as parameter to HD-RunApp.exe
Later I was looking at windows desktop and the following shortcut appeared which opened my BlueStacks app.
@Uwe is right and the command you can use in command line is what you said:
the activity which is named SplashScreenActivity inside the app.
It seems you cannot, Bluestack provides an emulation or virtual layer for android apps to run inside itself, not to be executed by the OS.
the phonics application and it package name in reverse and:
on Win 8.1 a Folder "Apps" with the BlueStack-Icon will be created on the Desktop automatically.
