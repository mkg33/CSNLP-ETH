The data structure could be anything from using classes/objects, right through to nothing and accessing the data store directly.
And then when your game is loaded, or when the menu is accessed, etc, you would create a "new Skill(json.fire)" or similar.
It kind of sounds like you are confusing your concepts here.
A data store may be a database, a xml file, a json file, a flat file, etc.
I am not exactly sure what you are asking, but I would not use a database.
Knowing only that you want a small footprint I would use a combination for classes for the structure and json for the data store.
So the question should be more "What would an appropriate data structure for an RPG be?
Classes and databases aren't mutually exclusive things, and most likely you would have your classes populated by a database on game/event/other load.
If you are executing in a game loop I would recommend trying everything else before parsing xml or calling a database, especially a remote database.
Really, I would use basic object orientation and just set up character class to contain or handle properties that represent the objects of the spells or the attributes, etc, and have the players input build the character class properties at run time.
You can store the XML in a database if you want, or you could access the file directly via:
