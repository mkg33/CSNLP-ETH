If the server isn't supposed to receive mail at all, you can disable smtpd by commenting it out in $(postconf -h config_directory)/master.cf.
So, the mail logs fill up (not a huge problem with log rotation and such) and the server is always running at a slightly higher load than I'd like it to be.
If your host is not a mail relay you can block the port 25 altogether:
Provided you're actually expecting to deal with inbound SMTP traffic, you'll want to set some limits as to how postfix/smtpd behaves towards clients.
Is there a good way that I can detect and automatically block the IP addresses which are trying to mass-relay through my machine?
I'm assuming I would need to cut them off at the iptables level so they can't connect at all.
http://www.postfix.org/TUNING_README.html#conn_limit is a good brief overview.
I'm running postfix on CentOS and I'm properly rejecting relay mail requests, but my server is constantly...
The scripts trying to send all these emails are pretty stupid because it just keeps trying hundreds or thousands of times.
Also You can configure postscreen http://www.postfix.org/POSTSCREEN_README.html , but You need use postscreen only for MX, not for clients.
