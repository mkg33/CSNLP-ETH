Using the quaternion, with its parts called q0 q1 q2 q3.
Regardless of how you have the object's orientation, the key is to find the 'transformed' version of whichever axis (presumably Y or Z) corresponds to your upwards direction and to determine whether it points in the opposite direction from the original axis; the condition for the latter is just that the dot product between the two is less than zero.
So, for instance, assuming that your vertical axis is Z, if the device's current rotational transformation is stored in a quaternion q then the pseudocode might look something like:
Calculate the direction of gravity, gx gy gz using this:
Since the axis is generally a basis vector, you don't even need to look at a full dot product; just the appropriate component.
As Byte56 noted in a comment, you should just be able to read the object's current orientation (i.e., its rotation matrix) off of the gyroscope, and the problem is much easier to solve that way.
If you have your transformation encoded as a matrix, then this simplifies even further (since then the rotation is simply a column extraction), and the code ends up looking something like:
gz will then be positive if in the upright position, and negative if facing upside down.
I resolved it I think - I will however accept Steven Stadnicki's answer but here's how I did it for posterity:
