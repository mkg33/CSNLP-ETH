You are getting asymmetric routing with your setup.
Packets from your end are routed via the tunnel to the 8.8.8.8 with source IP address in the  10.0.33.0/24 network.
I totally hate to tell you, but you have serious problems with your setup.
Not sure why this particular server doesn't work with gre tunnels.
Which means that the setup needs reverse NAT on both ends and the real public ip addresses to work.
Your so called public IP - is private and not routed over the internet.
I think that Google's external firewalls drop packets with private network addresses, so 8.8.8.8 will never receive the packet.
It can also be that the client end of the tunnel uses its Internet facing IP address for the packets sent to the tunnel.
If you want to route the packets back via the tunnel, you have to use NAT on the other end of the tunnel, which changes source IP address to other end's IP address.
Packets from the client are sent via the tunnel to 8.8.8.8, but 8.8.8.8 sends packets directly to the client's own IP address, which might also cause issues.
the issue was with server B.  I tested this on other server and it worked.
