So what do I need to connect 3 TV's to my MacBookPro 5.5
Here's Apple's official response to connecting multiple displays to your Mac.
I have a presentation I don't have my HP notebook with my so I'm stuck with MacBookPro 5.5
I need to connect 3 TVs to and I would need to play a different video on each.
Here's a link to someone who has 4 monitors connected to their Macbook that may be of use to you as well.
Basically I would have my notebooks desktop extended 3 times and then a VLC Player instance on each screen playing one video.
My MacBook Pro Goes Multimonitor: 4 Monitors At Once!
All I found for Mac was an HDMI Hub option that has one HDMI hub input and 4 HDMI outputs but that does not allow you to extend your desktop I believe that is the HDMI hub that they use in tech stores where they connect all the TVs to the Hub and then play one video from a PC and it outputs to all.
I understnad that this isn't a direct answer to your question but may be a good resource for you none the less.
