Redgate has a webinar that might help you hit all the high points and provide some kind of solution: http://www.red-gate.com/products/oracle-development/deployment-suite-for-oracle/education/webinars/webinar-20-april-2011 The webinar covers SQLWays: http://www.ispirer.com/products.
Do you have unique keys, foreign keys or composites, what about views?
Do you have basic tables with fields and primary keys?
It has an 11GB maximum limit but is a free download.
Do you have deeper logic objects like stored procedures and triggers?
In anycase more complex your database the more problematic your migration....I did find SQL Server Migration Assistant.
Or you can spend a year reverse engineering it then have to start over again when the format changes.
Depending on the size, you may be able to import into the free version of Oracle called Express Edition (XE).
Although Oracle doesn't publish the format of dump files, the more recent ones created by Data Pump utility (expdp versus the older exp command) are in XML format.
Transfer the data from Oracle to SQL Server using any number of tools (flat files, SSIS, linked servers, replication)
Hopefully others will provide additional solutions for you...Good luck!
But I agree with earlier responses: it's probably not worth the R&D effort.
If you want to convert Oracle data to SQL, you aren't going to be able to use a dump file unless you import into Oracle first.
Oracle doesn't have that nice incremental parameter instead it has those nasty sequences.
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssma/ it might be something to look at.
I have not used these products personally and only skimmed the webinar, but I have been where you are and I know how touch and go this can be.
The only thing that can process a dump file is Oracle.
"is there any possibility to use another way in converting oracle dump file?"
Once it's imported, you can use SQL Server SSIS to connect to Oracle and transfer the data.
