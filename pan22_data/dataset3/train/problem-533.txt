It's not very fast and it's using only 2% of the CPU.
We completely killed our server here on multiple occasion with stunts like these.
Use tools like strace and Wireshark to study read/write calls and network traffic, for example.
you could shard in multiple invocation of p4.exe but I would try and keep them small, at least not beyond your available core count.
Perforce does however offer an option to parallelize your sync for you --parallel, it does require some server side adjustments but you should give it a try.
If the disk is the bottleneck, parallelizing might actually make it slower, because you'll have lots of processes accessing different files simultaneously, causing the disk heads to thrash around.
Parallelizing it in multiple processes isn't likely to help, because the bottleneck is the disk or network.
Before you jump into scripting, do some analysis to figure out what's making it slow.
I have zero experience with Perforce, but this sync sounds like an I/O-bound operation.
I would stear away from the sync per files... especially so if you have multiple users trying to do this from an embedded tool or something similar.
I am trying to write a function in bash, given a parameter n, it forms a queue of all files and folders n levels deep and forks of a process of p4 sync -f $thatDirectory/... or p4 sync -f $thatFile.
