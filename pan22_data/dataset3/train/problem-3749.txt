I installed Windows Server 2012 R2 on HP DL380p G8 server.
This sounds like an issue with the OS installation.
Seems that WinRM was in some kind of faulty state.
For me, this was because I had an IP binding on the command line, and the server then wasn't bound on the localhost.
I was having the same problem, and after a couple of hours of banging my head against the wall, it occured to me to try and restart the server.
I realize you found the solution, but for anyone else who stumbles upon this error: I am almost ashamed to suggest this, but here is the obvious thing to try before going on a wild goose chase: Reboot.
I am able to install role or feature using PowerShell but not via GUI ServerManager.
If possible, I would run a sfc /scannow on the server and see if that corrects it.
Now, when I go to add a any role or features using GUI ServerManager I am getting the following errors:

That did the trick, and it sure made me feel stupid for wasting the afternoon troubleshooting.
Once I did this, I could then add Roles and Features using the GUI.

 I am in the process of migrating to Windows Server 2012 R2.
If not, toss the OS CD in there and run a repair from that.
