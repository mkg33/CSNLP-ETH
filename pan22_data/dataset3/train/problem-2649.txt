Im working on improve develutils.com, and i develop in a Virtualbox with Ubuntu install, and 4Gb RAM and 2 Cores of 4.
Ok... this is to low Req/s, and during the test, the VBox HDD indicador get On always, and the 2 Cores are not in the 100%...
ab -n 2700 -c 90 -k -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" http://develutils.ben/
I try to determine what its the problem with the I/O excess, and use the fantastic command:
First, its normal this .htaccess accesses or i have any configured wrong?
If this its a "normal" behavior, i think in use an ramdisk, copy the CMS files (only files of CMS, and temp directories, not images or any big files) at the startup of the system, and then, launch apache using this directories to speed up the Req/s to insane numbers, but i dont know if this its a madness.
I have a local virtualhost point to the VBox, and launch tests to check the speed using apache test:
I see this, and dont understand why the system its reading the .httaccess so many times, tooo many times, if the file its an existing file (.css, .js, images, etc) the .htaccess need to be avoided, but the apache call continuously
Any help and comment about this Req/s speed and I/O numers are wellcome.
Second, if this its "normal", apache dont have any way to cache this?
First i try to move the machine to another disk, and SSD, check the ab test and get 360 Req/s, ok, this number like me, but this give me a more questions...
