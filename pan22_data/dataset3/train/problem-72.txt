Although you only requested ports 25 and 110, I included options for secure SMTP and secure POP3 as well.
If they don't, then drop that first line, and drop the "-m tcp" portion of all the other lines.
BEAWARE: this is by no means a strong firewall, it is just a minimal set of rules to do what you want.
What I recommend below takes into account whatever firewall rules you have in place and puts the rules you've requested higher in the processing order than anything else.
If you don't have any other firewall rules, then you could substitute the "-I" with "-A" and drop the line numbers after the "FORWARD" and "POSTROUTING" tables.
Can you help me to configure iptables step by step (im really noob at iptables)?
Asuming that every computer has as its default gateway this linux box (192.168.16.6) it is just a matter of configuring ip forwarding:
Behind eth1 is a router that gives me an dynamic ip.
It has to network interfaces, eth0 (lan) and eth1 (wan).
When the public connection comes up, if it creates a ppp link,then you'll have to replace eth1 with, let's say, ppp0.
Iptables processes rules in the order that it matches them, so just in case you have other rules already in the firewall that might block SMTP or POP3, I used the insert command and specified the rules should be placed at the top of the list.
I recommend implementing connection tracking whenever you can and the first iptables rule below turns that on.
Now, i need machines in the lan to access SMTP and POP3 servers over the internet.
If you're running on a really old kernel then you might have issues with these commands, but if they work for you, then great.
Actually, the computer on the lan can access the web only using the proxy.
Iptables is easy enough to work with - you just have to be explicit about telling it what to do with traffic that comes from or goes to specific locations on specific ports.
