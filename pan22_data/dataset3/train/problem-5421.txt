Notepad works fine for this, or any text editor that you're used to.
Windows likes to strip localizing information from those files when they are copied outside their original place.
To edit the files they will need to have the system and readonly attributes off, hidden doesn't matter for this.

Inside the folder where the desktop.ini file is, use th cd command to get there, type:
