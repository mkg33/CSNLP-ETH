#NUM or #DIV/0) by changing a formula of a cell used in a circular dependency, then fix it, Excel fails to recalculate the sheet.
I have a complex financial worksheet that uses intentional circular references.
That's actually not true, Excel recalculates properly (at least in the example you've posted):
After fixing the error in C1, C2 stays with the original error and does not recalculate.
I've just a few times iterative calculations, however I very strongly advise against them, besides the your current issue there could be others too:
I'd just like to force Excel to really recalculate everything after fixing the error.
But this solution is not applicable to my complex worksheet: I get dozens of cells in error at once and cannot find the one I should "refresh" (F2 then (Enter).
Problem is easy to reproduce with a simple scenario, where tax=tax rate*(revenue+tax):
Excel does a good job at calculating them, because I enabled iterative calculation.
The only way I found to recover a functional worksheet is to edit (F2) C2 formula then hit Enter.
Problem: when I accidentally create an error (e.g.
