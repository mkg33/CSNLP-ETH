According to my ISP it's fixed, but they've been saying that for weeks now.
Again thank you all for taking the time answering my question.
My question is, is there a way to monitor if my internet is being cut off for a duration of 24 hours?
I will be looking into this software, and it sounds like you might want to as well.
I tried ping, but it's hardly reliable and I will have to set on front of the pc to keep track.
It looks like it's a cloud service reaching out to your network, but based on the comment, I thought it was something you could set up locally to see outbound metrics.
Someone came up with a Raspberry Pi that tweets out their speed if it's substantially less than advertised.
I have a bad ISP, and my internet cuts off for like 10 seconds every 2 hours or so and return.
I was reading an article on Ars Technica the other day where they were lambasting Comcast for being a crappy ISP.
Thank you all for taking the time to answer my question, I'm sorry for the late reply, it's due to my very bad ISP.
In the commentary of the article, someone mentioned SmokePing (DSL Reports has an FAQ too).
I went ahead and saved the ping test to a text file as suggested by @root, and that worked great.
Is there a software that can monitor the continuity of my internet connection for 24 hours straight?
It turns out it's cutting even more often than I thought, so just switched to another ISP :)
Your help would be highly appreciated on the matter.
