Would it be possible to backup all of the other files from this file system to a temporary storage location, reformat the partition, and then restore the files?
Created 100,000 512-byte files in a directory (dd and /dev/urandom in a loop); forgot to time it, but it took roughly 15 minutes to create those files.
The files are small enough that the unlink operation probably doesn't jump around too much zeroing out the space.
If you readdir and then sort by ascending inode you would probably get better performance.
So readdir into ram (sort by inode) -> unlink -> profit.
Would it be possible to convert the filesystem to ext4 and see if things change?
This is a Pentium 4 2.8GHz box (couple hundred GB IDE 7200 RPM I think; EXT3).
Alright this has been covered in various ways in the rest of the thread but I thought I would throw in my two cents.
You are getting back a list of files that are not necessarily in any way sequential on disk which is causing disk access all over the place when you unlink.
Inode is a rough approximation here I think .. but basing on your use case it might be fairly accurate...
The performance culprit in your case is probably readdir.
Obviously not apples to apples here, but I setup a little test and did the following:
