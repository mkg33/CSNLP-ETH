deflopt will squeeze out some extra bytes from already optimized image - it is utility to work with any deflated data and PNG is one of those.
It combines various methods for image optimization (including EXIF removal for saving few extra bytes - can be turned off).
Youâ€™ll also find a complete ZIP package with the PHP script and a jQuery plugin.
PNG is a lossless compression format -- without changing the source material in the file, there's very little way to increase compression beyond the default highest level compression.
If you want high levels of compression for the image and don't care about lossless data storage, use JPEG.
pngout will automatically determine if your PNG colors fit in PNG-8 and use it.

The only real way to reduce the size will be to change the image, either by reducing resolution, or colour depth so that the PNG compression has less complexity to work with.
A nice idea for handling PNG with alpha channel in the context of website development would be to let the server do the trick for you: dynamically separate the image data from the alpha channel on the server, optimize both of them separately and recombine them using the canvas element and some JavaScript in the browser.
Another possibility is to use a combination of pngquant, pngout, and pngcrush, as described here, but this is from the command line.
