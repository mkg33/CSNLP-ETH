Some sources say that Cat 6e is just Cat 6a but the manufacturers just added a few extra things to "improve" on it (like shielding I think?).
Cat 5e can support full duplex gigabit operations, so in the vast majority of applications even cat 6 is unnecessary at present, but I guess requirements are requirements...
Thus allowing you work out the type of cable that you have.
transferring files from a PC to a simple 2-Drive NAS with RAID1, you will not see any benefit from fiber).
From what I can understand, Cat 6e does not actually exist but a number of manufacturers are selling some cable labeled as Cat 6e.
I recently had a new home constructed, and went from the CAT6a of my previous home to whole-house fiber, and provided you have it done during construction it doesn't actually cost much more at all.
Some cable analyzers will be able to report on that.
I would definitely recommend fiber for in-wall use, the bandwidth is outstanding, and then CAT6/7 for out-of-wall wiring/simply P2P connections where bandwidth isn't the biggest concern, or you're otherwise limited to where 16-32Gbit/sec doesn't benefit (i.e.
And some say that it's actually some knock off Cat 5e.
How can I tell if this cable is legit Cat 6 (10 Gbps)?
You could use a decent cable tester this should be able to tell you speed.
However, if you have some serious hardware and need access to large data NOW, nothing beats it (i.e.
my basement server room; a single 36-drive RAID60 array buffered by 2 IODrive Fusion-IO 2.4TB PCIe SSD's can push a LOT of bandwidth, and FC was a MUCH cheaper option than trying to go with copper 10GbitEthernet + switches/hubs running everywhere, in fact is was about 1/2 the price overall).
Cat 6a cable is supposed to provide a bandwidth of 500MHz.
