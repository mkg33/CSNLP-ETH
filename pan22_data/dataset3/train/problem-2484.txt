I have a server on which i'm hosting the tfs instance and a server in witch i'm hosting the sql backend for the tfs.
I's there something new in sql 2012 that has to be configured in order for this to work ?
Verify that the server that is hosting the database is operational, and that network problems are not blocking communication with the server..
I can ping the new sql server from the tfs server and i can connect to the sql server from other servers and i just don't understand the error.
I have also tried to the command with the firewall disabled and still the same result.
The thing is that i want to move the sql instance on another server, a task which i have done once before, and for some reason the tfs server doesn't want to cooperate.
CreateTfsExecRole.sql Block #1 Error: TF246017: Team Foundation Server could not connect to the database.
i am encountering a very strange error on the my tfs server.
The actions i have undertaken till now are: i've installed sql server 2012 on the my new server, i have moved the databases to the new server(backup - restore), and bow i'm trying to make the chance in the tfs administrative console and for some reason it doesn't work.
The thing is that the network shouldn't be the problem.
I have stopped iis iisreset \stop, i have stoped the tfs net stop TfsAgentJob and when i try to run 'tfsconfig prepsql /sqlinstance:servername' or  tfsconfig prepsql /sqlinstance:servername\instancename it gives me the following error:
