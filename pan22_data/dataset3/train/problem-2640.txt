But, considering vi is installed on pretty much all unix/linux systems, taking a bit of time to learn at least the basics is definitely not a bad idea ;-)
This is something a lot of users value, me included.
Nano might be an alternative as well, it is a lot more simple than Vi(m) and Emacs but it does what it's supposed to do (edit text).
Do you mean that it's cumbersome switching between insert mode and command mode using i and esc all the time?
It is also a very capable text editor (among other things, thanks to it being extendable by using Emacs Lisp).
If you however want a modeless editor, you might want to take a look at Emacs instead.
A good solution, when you're beginning using it, is to print a cheat-sheet of keyword shortcuts, and hand it on the wall next to your desk ;-)
Only when you insert some text, you switch into input mode, but get right out of it as soon as you're done: you type a sentence and hit ESC right away.
One way to deal with the modal behavior of vim is to be in command mode by default.
Notably, that you can use so many more keys to do things, such as hitting x instead of delete to remove a character, can make editing much faster, since your hands aren't moving all across the keyboard.
Once you get more proficient with the editor and get to use its powerful editing commands, inserting text will become just another command to you like many other commands, and they're all initiated from command mode.
No, you didn't miss anything, that's just how vi works.
That way, you don't have to think so much about which mode you're in: you're in command mode unless you're typing input.
Once you get used to it, there's no hassle at all, and you prefer having the different modes.
As an alternative, you could use something "simpler", like nano -- if installed on your system.
