You might want to use a profiling application such as Process Monitor to determine what Firefox hangs on specifically.
Start monitoring your system with Process Monitor, and immediately start Firefox.
Uninstalling Firefox doesn't remove your profile directory.
I would otherwise suggest Firefox Safe Mode, but that won't work here.
For IE, there should be an option for this under Start > Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Internet Explorer (no-Addons)
I understand that even with a new Firefox profile, it hangs?
I'm going to echo what chris is saying here, but I think you should just try to do it on your own account without creating another entire profile.
Perhaps your antivirus software is locking a file?
Hence, if there's something broken in the profile directory, reinstalling Firefox won't have any effect.
The only other thing that comes to mind is malware since both browsers have stopped working.
For Firefox, try Start > All Programs > Mozilla Firefox > Mozilla Firefox (Safe Mode) and then tick the Disable all Add-ons option.
Either find out where the Firefox profile is kept and delete all of those manually or run revo-uninstaller which will scan the registry and the directories for settings/files that were left over.
After a few seconds of hanging, stop monitoring, and set up a view filter to only display Firefox's PID.
This indicates that the problem isn't Firefox itself or your profile, which is very strange indeed.
