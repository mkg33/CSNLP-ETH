I have a Synology DSM which is configured to use VPN clint to connect to company intranet.
You'd need a local DNS resolver like DNSmasq, configured to forward requests for .local to one nameserver, and all others to your general purpose nameservers.
OpenVPN connection is stable but the DNS servers are not added to the top of the resolve list.
How can I configure DSM in order to use VPN dns for a specific domain (like example.com) and use the other ones (local) for other domain.
DNS (what you can put into /etc/resolv.conf) can't deal with split DNS, so you have to put those smarts into the DNS server.
I think this setup is called split-DNS, something that works very well with Viscosity OpenVPN client.
Instead it seems that they are added in the middle:
and dnsmasq's config would have something like this pair for each domain you want to direct elsewhere.
Depending on your environment, this DNS resolver could run on the Synology NAS, or on a pfsense firewall, or even on your normal desktop if its up 24/7
