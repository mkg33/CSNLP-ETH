I think, barring the virtual network, the real question is "can a virus in a VM essentially 'break out' of the VM and infect my PC"?
First, if you leave the VM connected to the network, it could traverse the virtual network and infect other PCs.
It can't attack your system "through the WM" or anything like that.
If you're using only old viruses, you should be fine.
I use VMs to run arbitrary code and protect my other PCs and servers from malicious code.
I've started to gain interest in old viruses, and therefor I've created an virtual machine using a software called VMWare (Workstation 11)
I'm not sure if a virus could break out of the VM, but I believe it's possible.
Other than that, your attack surface is pretty minimal.
However, about a year ago I ran across some code (trojan) that was virtualization aware - this sort of freaked me out a bit.
The viruses are old, so I am pretty sure it would be detected by my firewall, but I would like someone to kinda clarify if it could infect me or not.
If you want to be totally safe just close the connection to the network!
In theory, it could be aware that it is contained in a VM, and write itself to memory outside the VM containment.
Anyways, I've looked into some worms and such to test it on Windows 98, but I don't really know if it could possibly infect my network, and/or computer?
My current computer is on Windows 8.1, and using Norton.
There are obvious issues with that, and it would be a very advanced technique - but not impossible.
