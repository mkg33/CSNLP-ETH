There is a critical dimensions that has to be determined before using this kit.
Also consider that you cannot (safely) use rack slides when mounting in a two poster, because the leverage resulting from a server slid out for maintenance will almost certainly result in breakage and having to remove a server from the rack just to replace some component is a pain in the you know where.
It can certainly be done but and the kind of shelf Mark is talking about can easily be constructed or purchased but it still ands up with a server that is effectively balanced instead of properly mounted.
Depending on the manufacturer, most modern servers have alternate rail kits that are compatible with 2post racks.
This kit has (4) support brackets that allow you to use your 4post rail kits in a 2post rack.
This rail kit is a non-telescoping kit that will mount most equipment into most racks and cabinets.
My opinion is that if you cannot currently afford a four post rack you should consider not installing the server in a rack just yet and wait till you can buy an appropriate rack.
You only need one bracket to break and the resulting damage could be significant.
These kits are available in multiple sizes ranging from 2U to 7U.
Mounting a server in a 2post rack can be accomplished fairly easy in both a centermount or flushmount configuration.
From an engineering perspective you are placing loads where they don't belong and on parts that may not be designed to handle them safely.
The server chassis with the 4post rail kit installed cannot exceed the opening of the 2post rack, which is 450mm wide.
Another option available if the equipment exceeds the 450mm width limitation is to use a universal rail kit.
There is a second option available that uses a conversion kit.
