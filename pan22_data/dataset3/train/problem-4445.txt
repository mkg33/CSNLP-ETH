That said, the payload I posted will NOT create a host correctly because it's actually somewhat erroneous.
The error message from the API is this: No finish templates were found for this host, make sure you define at least one in your CentOS 6.7 settings
However, the error I posted goes away if you call the API (or use hammer) using an administrator user.
Each time, it complains that I'm lacking a finishing template.
When I click on "Resolve" in the provisioning templates section, I can see my finishing template as well.
I'm trying to create a host using the foreman API (using hammer, but POSTing the host payload gives me the same result).
Nothing in the documentation tells me how to provide a finishing template selection when creating the host.
Just to come back to this, I ended up resolving the issue as a permissions problem.
Some details: this is Foreman 1.10.1 against a VMWare Cluster
How do I specify a finishing template when creating a host via Foreman API?
Doing this in the Foreman UI with the same settings works just fine.
