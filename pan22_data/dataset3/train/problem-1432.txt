Since it's a new install, just reflash the SDcard.
I did look about, found references to (utterly) blank GUI screens, but I don't think that's where I am with this one.
Make sure to shut it down properly each time, with sudo shutdown -h now as opposed to just pulling the power.
tightvncserver will allow you to control the GUI on another computer with this.
And yes, I grew up on DOS, so some basic text commands on the Pi had me in tears (of nostaglia).
I didn't on my pi, and suffered from similar symptoms.
I've had it working fine, written HelloWorld Python3 program and flashed an LED, etc., through the gui on an HDMI screen.
A complete new Raspberry pi3 from Pimorini (in double quick time) and the problem has gone away.
You'll need to re-flash, and once you have, expand the file system via raspi-config.
To anyone still following this - looks like I had hardware problems.
I can Ctrl/Alt/F3 to another login, or get in via SSH, so the Pi is alive and well, and the monitor is OK, too.
Then this evening, the GUI screen goes fully black after a reboot, BUT the mouse pointer is still there, and still moves.
The documentation on the Raspberry Pi website has a great guide on installing it.
I thought I was "reasonably" OK with computers, having built my own 8 bit 4K (yes, 4000 bytes) computer a few [ahem] years back, and am not afraid to dive into PCs.
I did make some changes to the Config file, trying to fill the screen better, but I'm pretty sure I put all that back (mostly commented the options out).
New Raspberry Pi 3, set up with everything set as defaults.
