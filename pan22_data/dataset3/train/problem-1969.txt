Note: Previously I had vista installed on a smaller partition on the same drive, now I'm trying to install it on one large partition.
I found that in my situation I was installing SBS 2008 Standard from a USB pen.
After the install completed I added the third drive back in and I was good to go.
Are both of my drives bad (diskpart.exe says they are both healthy)?
Turns out removing an unrelated third drive made everything install smoothly.
Had to install it from DVD instead to stop the above error from appearing.
I formatted two different disks, and created (with the vista install dvd) brand new partitions and neither one will work.
Erase completely all Disk partitions till you get unallocated space only left, then open Advanced options.
I followed the instructions in the support article to clean the partition and ensure that it is active... no go.
At the screen where you select what drive/partition you would like to install vista to, I keep getting "Windows is unable to find a system volume that meets its criteria for installation."
I know I didn't need to install any special drivers last time.
Had Linux installed already on 2 machines and I couldn't figure out why I was getting the same error message.
Probably native or recertified Disk partitions are not compatible with win vista.
I assume the BIOS was making the USB pen appear as a HD to the SBS installer (actually vista) and this was making it cough.
After installing Windows I'll need to do some work to get back into Linux but I'll cross that bridge later.
Use the Diskpart utility and set it to the target partition for Windows as the active partition.
