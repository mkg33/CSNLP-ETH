For this, they developed KVM as open source (and quickly got included in the Linux kernel), of course, the rest of the stack was closed source, including the remote display protocol which they claim is the best there is.
That's what Qumranet used to sell before being bought by Redhat.
They also had an admin console, simple clustering of hardware and load-balancing by live-migration of VMs
I am looking at this product for a small number of desktops.
You should consider desktop virtualization with specific applications such as Citrix XenDesktop.
They deliver the applications to the user's desktop while being executed on the servers.
I haven't used the product, but would be my first stop if I wanted to virtualize desktops.
You can generally mix and match solutions from different vendors.
The website is still up, and the product (SolidICE) seems to be available.
Also Windows Server 2008 R2 has some new VDI features to take a look at.

There are several layers that you need to understand and separate,
Keep in mind the significant 'porting' effort you'd need to undertake to virtualise your applications (re-package everything), and profile management if you go down the stateless route.
They are working on version 4 which should greatly improve performance.

Some brokers allow you to spin up VMs on the fly, keeping a list of idle machines, rebooting / re-building on logoff etc...
