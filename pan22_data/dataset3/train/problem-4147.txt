Of course, this depends entirely on your comfort level.
Aside from Citrix (who clearly have a vested interest) Xen is on a slide into obscurity and back to the computer science community.
RedHat (and others) are dropping Xen, although they will support it until it's EOL.
Unless you're planning on being tied in by Citrix, you should steer clear.

I'd be more hesitant to use software RAID in a RAID 5 or RAID 6 because both of those configurations rely on a battery-backed cache to achieve suitable performance and data integrity.
XCP is "enterprise-ready server virtualization and cloud computing platform, delivering the Xen Hypervisor with support for a range of guest operating systems including Windows® and Linux® network and storage support, management tools in a single, tested installable image, which is also called XCP appliance."
At least with the open source xen you're likely to able to migrate to KVM when the time comes with a lot less hassle.
In a few years time KVM, VMware and Hyper-V are likely to be the only real players left on the server.

I use Xen (with a linux Dom0) a lot and have done for a long time, it solved a problem and offered an alternative to VMware.
KVM is the winner in all this thanks to it being in the kernel and RedHat buying the company and having big plans for it.
The Xen management domain has also been integrated into the mainline Linux kernel and distro support for Xen is improving Ubuntu 11.10 and Fedora 15 ( http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2011/09/14/fedora-16-virtualization-test-day/ ) are adding distro support for Xen.
I think software RAID is more flexible and in my experience has worked extremely well in a RAID1 or RAID0 configuration.
The introduction of pvops to the linux kernel solves some issues that led to distros like Ubuntu dropping support for Xen dom0.
So starting out with Xen now is likely to cost you a lot of time in future.

Virtual host providers like Amazon are still using Xen and I think we'll see a revival in its popularity.
Personally I wasn't impressed with the management tools available in XenServer and would much prefer the customizability that's possible with a full blown Linux distribution.
The options for deploying Xen have increased and are continuing to improve.
As far as software vs. hardware RAID, I think it really depends on what kind of RAID you are doing.
So there are great options and the options are only getting better.
As a middle ground to both of these options (on that let's you get the enterprise features of XCP/XenServer and let's you have a custom Linux platform) is Project Kronos ( http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2011/07/22/project-kronos/)
First, one important consideration is the Xen Cloud Platform (XCP), which is an open source version of Citrix XenServer.
