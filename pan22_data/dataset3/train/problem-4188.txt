To resolve situations like this you may find that instead of apt-get you could try using aptitude in it's interactive mode - as it can help to explore your system's packages, it will show if you have multiple versions of packages available in your system, and it can allow you to choose which is installed manually - it keeps track of the interdependencies as you select and deselect them and will warn, if not prevent you, from putting together an incompatible set of inter-dependent packages.
repository, it will redirect to a, hopefully, geographically good server for you/your RPi making the request and normally, I believe, it is all that you need to specify.
deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ wheezy main contrib non-free rpi
If you have no luck, I would reccomend searching on google for an ArmHF repository that contains those packages, and adding it using some instructions easily found online also.
Looking at your sources.list file your problem may be that you are only using "Wheezy" {Debian/Raspian Version 7.x "OldStable"} sources but also have "jessie" {Debian/Raspian Version 8.x "Stable"} sources commented out - if you have previous had the latter uncommented you may have installed packages from the later version ones and then, when they were commented out again, you have versions installed that are later then the ones that are present in the older distribution.
And very likely have two repositories for the SAME files:
mirrordirector.raspbian.org is a special (virtual?)
This generally means the package exists, but it is not available from the Raspberry Pi application source.
deb-src http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/ wheezy main contrib non-free rpi
You also have duplicate entries for the same source package repository:
deb http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian wheezy main contrib non-free rpi
