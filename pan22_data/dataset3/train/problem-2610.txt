I have a number of Windows servers running in AWS.
As the number of servers grows, managing Windows logins across all the servers has become a headache.
Because an executive made a poor decision, you're not unable to use the correct, first-party, purpose-built tool for the job.
Novell Identity Manager is also an option, though AD really is better suited for the task.
MDMarra's answer is also good (in fact it's what we do).
[An executive made a decision that we will never use Active Directory in the cloud.
Check this link if you're curious IDM Implementing Password Synchronization.
One solution that comes to mind is using PowerShell DSC and integrate it with an existing CM platform that you might already be using in the cloud (Chef, Puppet, Ansible, etc).
Is there a product (or OSS project) that synchronizes Windows logins across multiple stand-alone servers, without using Active Directory?
If you propose this solution, you're exec will likely acquiesce to using AD as Novell has increased cost and headaches.
Novell's solution requires an eDirectory Vault and the Novell Client on each system.
IDM allows you to build drivers which synchronize passwords between eDirectory and Active Directory.
If he's worried about security in the cloud (and your forest/domain functional levels are 2003 or higher) you could always deploy a RODC in the cloud.
I need some sort of password synchronizer that would allow me to centrally manage logins and passwords.
Create a VPN between your cloud network and your on-premise network, and then use your on-premise AD
I couldn't up-vote him because I lack reputation..
What you're asking for isn't going to be as easy as AD.
