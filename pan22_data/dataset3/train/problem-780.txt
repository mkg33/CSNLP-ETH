I was mighty pissed when I found out that the OS X Lion upgrade wiped out my entire development tool-chain.
I updated to OS X Lion today, and I don't seem to have a copy of gcc any more.
After successfully authenticating, the command line tools component downloads and installs a bunch of goodness, including gcc.
Just installed Xcode 4.3 on Lion from the app store, had the same issue with gcc, etc not installed.
New installations of Xcode (versions 4.2 and up) through the App Store do not ship with gcc-4.2.
You can download and install Xcode 4.1 through the Apple Developer Central.
With "Components" selected, you will see a list of downloadable components.
For my immediate need, I only had to make make, gcc and g++ available on path, so I created symlinks to /Developer/usr/bin/gnumake, /Developer/usr/bin/gcc-4.2, and /Developer/usr/bin/g++-4.2 inside the /usr/bin/ folder.
Look for Command Line Tools, and click on install.
However, with help from a friend, I discovered that the tool-chain had instead been moved into the /Developer/usr/bin/ folder on disk.
However, I imagine the correct approach would be re-install XCode to fix the issue.
You will be prompted for your Apple Developer userid and password.
I followed these steps and was able to get GCC working again.
