No single AV or scanner has 100% of malware signatures in their detection dat files, another reason to use more than one on demand scanner, when Spybot is done run MBAM, then when its done run SAS
Generally, a real-time scanner can co-exist with on-demand scanners without too much issue or conflict.
The reason you may want to disable your real-time scanner while running an on-demand scanner such as MBAM or SSD is to speed the scans by the on-demand scanners.
As others have said, the real problem, the absolute no-no, is to run two real-time scanners simultaneously.
No, as spybot scans files your active AV software is watching also, if spybot scans a file and does not have it listed as malware but your AV does, it will catch it, I have seen this a few times while scanning PC's using Spybot, MBAM, and SAS.
I use Microsoft Security Essentials for my virus protection but I also run scheduled scans with Malwarebytes and Spybot Search & Destroy.
However, while you are running such dedicated on-demand scans with real-time protection disabled, you'll be open to infection and/or attack, and so disconnecting from the internet during these scans can be a good idea.
What you don't want is 2 active AV software's installed at the same time, Norton and McAfee for example.
Should I disable the MSE realtime scanner when these other scans happen?
