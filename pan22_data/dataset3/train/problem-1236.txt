%0 makes whole name of folder as "ServerAlias", if wordpress makes /var/www/html/site1.example.com/ then you must replace %0 with %1, here is rule table (you can also combine them):
Keep in mind you should compare config to your environment, so add more domains like a.example.com before example.com.
If it's your scenario like this, you should try replace DocumentRoot with VirtualDocumentRoot:
I don't know much how wordpress multi-sites structure looks like.
I show you my configuration which works perfectly:
First thing first you should have sub domain and after domain.
My answer is too long for comment, so this is why I post new answer.
It depends on order, so first should be configured subdomains and at last whole root domain.
But I understand what you want, so if you don't want to touch apache configuration ServerAlias file every time you add new wp-site, then you could try VirtualDocumentRoot.
If you try VirtualDocumentRoot remember to comment out DocumentRoot otherwise Apache can fail to start.
You can just add ServerAlias, not whole VirtualHost you can have specified more ServerAliases.
