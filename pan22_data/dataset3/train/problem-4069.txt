Almost all of your requirements can be provided by merge-replication.
We have considered the Sync Framework option, but there is a requirement regarding multiple parallel data replication.
Lastly, the only way of communication between these servers is using port 80; using other ports is not an option.
A real "distributed agents" topology, where each note can synch with each other node is not possible with the build in tools.
I need to decide how to implement the replication structure, but I do not seem to have any options other than creating a replication structure manually and implementing all features.
There is some information about it in my StairWay series here: http://www.sqlservercentral.com/stairway/72401/
Do you know any tools, or have any ideas how to handle replication easily without any central SQL server and with user configurable topologies?
We have a huge enterprise system, with geographically seperated SQL servers.
You have one root and the data is distributed through there.
We have some requirements related with data replication between these servers.
Thus, Sync framework does not seem to be an option.
There are three conflict resolution options; "source wins", "destionation wins" and "timestamp based".
Also, note that, database structure is a bit complicated and we have some deep hierarchies.
Those articles don't cover replication using port 80 but that is possible.
Also, we do not have a central database; requirements state that user shall configure the topology and related conflict resolution steps.
