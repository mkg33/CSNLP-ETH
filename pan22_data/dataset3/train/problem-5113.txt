If you contact support they have a file that you can replace that will stop Deep Freeze from loading.
if you are unable to understand Linux or how to run a terminal, you could try using a program like HexWorkshop to copy the sectors from one drive to the other.
If you were to clone it bit by bit (clonezilla, or DD) you would end up with a system with Deep Freeze in the other end too, and that is definitively something that Faronics does not support (for example if you are running images they recommend to remove Deep Freeze first)
At the same time, you could simply just run the installer and that same installer will uninstall Deep Freeze.
Regardless or, your question should be how to remove Deep Freeze rather than how to clone the drive.
After booting to Linux you could open a terminal window and run the command dd if=/dev/sourceharddrive of=/dev/destinationharddrive where sourceharddrive and destinationharddrive represent the drive's ID in the system, usually sda or sdb etc.
The program you used may be buggy or flawed in some way.
Then you can remove Deep Freeze by running the installation.
If the computer can still connect to the Enterprise console then you can remove Deep Freeze from there.
You could try downloading a copy of Linux (mint or ubuntu etc) then burn it to a CD/DVD or create a USB bootable flash stick.
