If you have questions on setting it up, let me know!
This is easier to setup, though obviously you may have hours of downtime as you recover the data and get things set back up and tested for production.
It is very simple to setup, and can be used with ssh public key authentication.
At the other end of the spectrum, is just having a copy of all the data so that you can recover the production box (or some sub-section of it) in the event that it is needed.
Along the same response but I would look at bacula.
This is very hard and if done wrong will probably lead to downtime rather than preventing it.
It allows you to take incremental and full backup on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis in a secure manner.
I am currently using it to backup 100s of gbs between sites.

I tend to just do a "dump" of the data daily to a file and use that for backups, some people prefer to back up the journal files for re-creating the databases, or use snapshots to get a point-in-time copy to backup from.
It does take some time to learn but once it is set up its stable.
The link below was written for backing up mysql database, but you can use it for backing up other files too.
If you have databases, don't forget to make sure the backups get consistent copies of this data.
For most of my own uses a dump is fine and the simplicity wins out.
Many people want to have a backup system that just automatically takes over if the primary system is down.
I would suggest you go with rsnapshot(http://rsnapshot.org/), which is based on the popular backup tool - rsync.
Setting up something like BackupPC is fairly easy and would give you copies of the production system in the event that it has issues.
