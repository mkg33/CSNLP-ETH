So in your scenario the server would be up an running again after 50m + boot + shutdown-time latest.
This problem I solved by using one small linux box (Asus wl deluxe or smth) which was plugged into main UPS and wake ASAP as the power was restored.
to use any old computer (if you don't care about power consumption), or some kind of raspberry pi, connected direct to energy.
So, when power goes up, one script will check if servers is on, and if not, then send a OWL through network.
This way, it can run for 4-6 hours just on battery alone.
You will need a Unix/Linux based server to monitor the UPS.
There is a client for Windows servers so they can be shut down cleanly.
I would like to suggest running the "NUT" server or the "WoL" server on a laptop, with the lid closed.
Some laptops can have 2 batteries installed at once for even long run times.
The startup script include a 5 min delay to avoid any variations in power status (up/down), WOL-ed all servers (all w2k3, one linux) and sms me with the status.
This will bring the servers back up if they restart on when power is restored.
Once the shutdowns start, it will ensure the UPS is power cycled.
After reading many suggestions, I think that a good solution is
If your BIOS has the possibility to set a power-up-time you could set it to 50 minutes after shutdown, if shutdown is triggered through the UPS-shutdown-signal.
