Messing around with settings your monitor isn't capable of handling can damage the monitor.
Update your monitor driver with the one you just created and you should be able to select this new, larger, resolution in the same dialog you normally use to change screen resolution.
Under Monitor tab you can also untick the box that says Hide modes that this monitor cannot display and it will provide additional modes for you.
I'm not 100% sure what you want in this case, but here's my best guess.
Download PowerStrip and create a custom profile with as large a resolution as you want.
From there you can set the resolution of that particular display.

Go into Screen Resolution in Windows 7, you can select the display that you want to change by clicking its icon.
If you don't see the resolution you're looking for, you can go into Advanced Settings > List All Modes and from there you can select from all of the resolutions/refresh rates available.
