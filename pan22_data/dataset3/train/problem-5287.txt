I am convinced this is a Win 10 problem and not a router or switch problem.
D1 must be the problem: The NAS works for L3; D2 and L3 work so its not the new switch.
says it is on private network 3 while L3 says its on a different network.
L3 is 192.168.1.107; D1 is 10.0.0.3 and D2 is 10.0.0.4
Network looks like this: Router, R1, [wireless, Netgear] connects to Internet and is gateway for all other devices on net; Also has a NAS [USB hard drive attached].
Which connects to Switch 2 [S2] which is new Linksys SE1500.
The router is IP address: 192.168.1.1; S1 is 192.168.1.2; the new switch S2 has ip address 10.0.0.1 hardwired, no interface to get in and change it.
D1 can see D2 [and the Internet] but nothing else.
It's indeed weird who can see what in your network, but could you put your two desktops in the 192.168.1.0 network?
Now parts of the network no longer see other parts.
D1 is visible on the network; is willing to share files, music etc.
If the S2 is just a switch and not a router then that 10.0.0.1 is just a management IP?

Jmorgie7, I don't think it is a Windows issue but rather a network problem.
