If you're looking for a proxy server that's tightly integrated with Active Directory and provides a slew of nice functionality in that area, you want TMG.
I do not agree that TMG has minimal functionality for use as advanced NAT, routing, multiple WANs etc; pfSense offers more, but absolutely not MUCH more.
Exactly as Mark said, they're very much two entirely different products.
We made a stress test with a setup of 10-machines with 8-torrents each plus 2-ftp servers and a SharePoint farm with 2-nodes behind a firewall connected to the Internet via 1 Gbit fibre.
When it comes to stability and reliability, pfSense does not seem to have any chance at all.
pfSence seems to handle enormous blocking rules FASTER than TMG and you can notice that in traffic flow in both ends of the firewall (after the packets have been processed) and you will also notice the GUI-response to be pretty fast on pfSense compared to the very slow TMG.
If you need advanced NAT, routing, multi-WAN, flexible cross-platform VPN options, etc.
pfSense is an incredible firewall with many nice and advanced features, and extremely low hardware requirements compared to TMG.
Just like both Mark and Chris said, the products differ too much to be compared with eachother, and now, I will make it more "unfair" because I will compare some differences between TMG SP1 + Software update 1 vs BETA version of pfSense 2.
The webpages on the SharePoint server were responding pretty fair during the attacks.
We even changed the hardware to another manufacturer to be sure that it was no compatibility issues with pfSense and the server(s), but it was hard to tell if it got better or worse.
Reports and monitoring in TMG is much better than pfSense.
Additionally, we had 6 other machines connected to Internet via separate 100 Mbit lines (different locations with 4-different ISPs) to disturb the traffic which was flowing through the firewall.
It is easy to use and responds very quickly to your settings.
If you really want to compare TMG with another firewall, try Cisco.
I have had a google, but there don't seem to be any comparisons of TMG to pfSense.
The same test with pfSense as firewall was horrible :-( The throughput went down to 2-30 MB/s and most of the clickings (from an external network) on the SharePoint webpage timed out.
you're somewhere between some, minimal and non-existent functionality with TMG, but pfSense offers a lot in those areas and is widely deployed for those things.
For use with Windows clients on the inside, TMG offers a lot more functionality, especially if combined with the rest of the ForeFront family.
Undisturbed, the traffic flow through the TMG firewall was pending somewhere between 60-120 MB/s (upstream and downstream) and with full attack from all 6 "disturbers", the throughput speed went down to 30-70 MB/s.
TMG inside the network, pfSense at the edge, and you get the best of both worlds.
We currently run pfSense with no problems, however we are looking at TMG as it is included in our partner subscription to MS and allows Windows 7 DirectConnect features to our domain for off-site users.
If you intend to stay partner with MS for a long time, I suggest that you use your partner benefits to its limits!
Our infrastructure is Windows Server 2008 R2 behind pfSense at the moment.
