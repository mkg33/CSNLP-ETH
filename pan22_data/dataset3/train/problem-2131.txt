Your time is better spent assuming you are hacked and acting accordingly, because you have to do that anyway.
Never enter your password on a site if your browser says http (not https) or "Not Secure".
There's a lot you could look for, and it's typically not going to be something simple.
It's also possible your router is hacked and not your computer, or another computer on your network.
If you don't want to do that, you can do this, assuming Windows:
Regarding your router, if it's a router you purchased and you have access:
Take some time and make a list of every online service you use, or any program that requires you to make an account, or anything you've ever created an account for.
Regarding your computer, the safest thing to do is backup any important data, reinstall your operating system from scratch, install an antivirus/security solution, and start over from a known "good" point.
Delete or deactivate any accounts you don't use anymore.
Another common point of entry are remote access programs like VNC, LogMeIn, TeamViewer.
And your computer may not even be involved, it's possible this person may have access to your Google, Facebook, or Instagram account which could reveal much of anything you are searching for online or have liked.
Use strong passwords that can't be found in a dictionary.
