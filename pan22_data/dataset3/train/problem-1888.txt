Stupid that I didn't store in it a password manager, but that's looking back.
The good thing is that I still can use the computer with my normal account, but I need the admin account as well.
If necessary I will reinstall the system (which is a good idea anyway for performance issues), but for the moment I would prefer to reset the password.
There are two volumes, one for data, one for the osx system.
Last week I changed this admin password, and forgot it.
Then the Reset Password tool appears, where I have to select the volume that contains the user account.
Restart in Recovery mode again, but this time run Disk Utility, select the system volume in its sidebar, and you should get an "Unlock" option it the toolbar.
You can unlock it using yourr regular account password.
There I fired up the terminal, and started resetpassword.
Then, quit Disk Utility, run Terminal and resetpassword, and you should be able to reset the admin account's password.
On my Mac (10.9 Mavericks) I have a normal user account (rxt) and an admin account with administrator privileges.
Searching for a solution I found out about the recovery mode.
