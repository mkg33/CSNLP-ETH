and that the strings do not contain | or @ (if they do, use some other characters)
There is a Split function in VBA that would help you with your plan, but there is no SPLIT formula.
=RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND("|",SUBSTITUTE(A2,"/","|",LEN(A2)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A2,"/","")))))
It will take several passes but you can do it without formula or vba.
Note, looping through cells like this is not very efficient.
Then you can choose _ to split apart the file name.
to separate the extension, then / to split out the directory structure.
=IFERROR(MID(D2,FIND("|",D2)+1,FIND("@",D2)-FIND("|",D2)-1),"")
and there are at most 5 pieces to be returned (can be adjusted to cope with more)
You can set the different columns to Text to avoid Excel treating them as numbers, or set other columns to Do not import (skip) so they are removed.
You could use Excel's Text to Columns functionality under the Data menu.
=SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE("_"&C2&"_","_","|",{1,2,3,4,5}),"_","@",{1,2,3,4,5})
Since there's no selected answer yet I'll give you another VBA option but this time with the split function.
However, I suggest using an Excel formula instead.
Cells D2:H2 as an array formula, brackets successive terms with | and @
If you have a lot of rows (say more than a few 10,000's), there are better ways
