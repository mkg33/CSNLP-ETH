I also tried the static route which did not work either.
I have created other subnets in order to create interfaces to these routers (blue CIDR).
Note that, I allowed ICMP traffic in all instances, and I disable Source/Dest, how can I do the pinging here, or how to use the Route table in my case ?
I tried to do a custom Route Table Destination as subnet 1 where the Instance 1 which is deployed is 172.31.0.0/28, and the target is one of the interfaces that is attached to Instance 1.
|   172.31.0.0/28    |eni-01688e43d190ca787|              |
I could only ping from Instance 1 the interfaces of Instance 2 and vice-versa, but the others are unreachable.
Because the ip route showed direct connections between 2 instances after the interfaces' configuration, I could not ping the other interfaces from any instance of the network.
cannot create a more specific route for 172.31.0.0/28 than CIDR 172.31.0.0/16 associated with the VPC, with association-id vpc-cidr-assoc-9ee5e5f6, in route table rtb-06de44ffbb5c66799
I have attached each interface to its proper instance.

|    Destination     |        Target       | Status       |
There are 4 instances which have CSR 1000v router deployed in 4 created subnets (green CIDR) that have 28 as a mask.
