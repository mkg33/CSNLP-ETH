All in all, it is nowhere clearly mentioned that VirtualBox needs promiscuous mode to be able to bridge correctly, but at least I can mention it here!
I have OpenVPN configured on three VirtualBox VMs running Ubuntu 16.04.
This was solved by setting the GW's network adapter connected to the 192.168.0.0/24 network to promiscuous mode from the VirtualBox settings, so the interface that does the bridging is in promiscuous mode.
ARP, Request who-has 192.168.0.1 tell 192.168.0.50, length 28.
Seems that the problem has something to do with ARP, because when I tcpdump on br0 on the server, I see that there is a question
I am using the bridge-start and bridge-stop scripts that come with OpenVPN to use the bridge.
Any ideas how to get the messages to flow between the two clients?
I can ping the clients from the server and the server from the clients.

When the OpenVPN connection is open, the routing table seems to be correct:
