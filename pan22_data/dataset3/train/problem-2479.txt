Among other very nice things like input prediction as well as surviving disconnects and even a changing IP on the client side, it also specifically improves the reaction time when using Ctrl-C (by only updating the terminal contents periodically instead of sending the whole stream).
I tried setting the c0-change-interval and c0-change-trigger options as described above but they are no longer available.
Here is the git change with the new attempted solution: https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/3f4ee98162cd5bb7000f93fec0e631e123b1281d
Reverting to tmux 1.8 fixed the problem for me without having to set any options.
Since tmux is inserting itself between the cat process and your terminal, it needs to read the output from cat, write it to the terminal , and at the same time read your input from the terminal (the ^C) and send it to the shell to interrupt the command.
You can always issue kill-pane command from within the session.
I'm not sure exactly what causes the delay, but it's something about how tmux buffers I/O between you and the shell that runs in tmux.
If the terminal text looks like garbage renaming the window and/or issuing reset should fix it.
Assuming you are using ssh over a low-latency connection, have you tried using mosh?
You can use tmux within mosh without any problems.
