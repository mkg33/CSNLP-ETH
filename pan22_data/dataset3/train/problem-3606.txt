More details and commands can be found in the man pages.
(2) Run it as you would any other binary by either adding it to the path, or by running it directly from the current directory with ./tw_cli.
Here we can see there is one controller attached, with the id of c2 (remember this id!
The second group shows which drives are currently physically attached to the server.
To get more details about which drives are attached to the unit, run tw_cli /c2 show (replacing /c2 with the ID of your controller):
Even more information about the status and health of the drives can be found by running tw_cli /c2/u0 show or tw_cli /c2/p0 show.
Type tw_cli into the search bar, then navigate around until you find a download named CLI Linux - from the 10.2.2.1/9.5.5.1 code sets (the latest version number may be different than what is listed here)

In this particular case, I have two RAID configurations:
Extract the zip file, and in either the x86 or x86_64 you will find the tw_cli binary that you need.
This can be found on the Avago Technologies website*:

This has been tested on the following RAID controllers: 9690SA-8I
First, run tw_cli show to list which RAID controllers are available on your system:
Please let me know in the comments if it worked for your specific controller, or if the instructions need updating for your model.
