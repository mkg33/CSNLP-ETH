This can cause problems if you print a document that was created for a different printer.
Fuji Xerox technical support advised me to check the settings for page size and it was correctly set for A4.
It will also ask to select a paper tray when the printer only has one paper tray.
*** at the printer you select the type of paper on the tray.
in our case someone non-technical had put the paper in the wrong side of the tray so the copier correctly assumed it was empty.
When you insert paper in the CM305df it prompts you on the front panel for the paper size and type.
It will then keep printing the one page I was trying to print multiple times until I reset it by continuously pushing clear.
so each time i print it ask me to insert letter paper isntead of A4 in every word or pdf printing.
Support then advised that I need to check the paper size every time I print and ensure that it is A4!
In the case of Word, the size and type are set in Page Setup, as Word ignores driver settings for paper.
i finally got to fix this on my Fuji Xerox docuprint cm305, after more than a year i've been having to unload and load paper on the tray every single time.
For example, the driver may be set for US Letter, and the loaded paper is A4.
and today after reading this i sorta got to fix it.
If the front panel settings are correct, check the driver settings and set it to the same.
A Fuji Xerox Docuprint CM305df randomly asks to load more paper, even though it has paper in the tray.
Just pull out the tray, re-insert it and watch the display.
