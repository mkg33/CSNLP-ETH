Whatever your issue is, it sounds like a mechanical one.
Just to be sure, take the drive out of the enclosure and plug it into a PC.
The only thing you might be able to salvage is the external chassis the hdd is in.
Those sounds are coming from the drive itself, not the enclosure its in.
if you can't see the drive then it might be pretty screwed some hdd have glass platers on the inside that can bust into a million pieces.
Your best bet is to backup your data as quickly as possible.
But even that will probably require some soldering.
take the drive out of the container and see if you can get to the data if you plug it directly into the computer (ide or sata)
If you open a hdd you'll lose all data unless you send it to some fancy data recovery lab and that costs oodles of money.
If loud noises persist and you are unable to access it, then expensive data recovery services are your only hope (in many cases this route is VERY expensive)
if you can you should run a program called spinrite on it and that will hopefully recover any damage.
