So, my workaround is to use AutoHotkey to create custom scripts.
Is there any way to assign a shortcut to, e.g., "insert equation" in PPT 2016?
(Note that Alt,o means "press and release the Alt key, and then press and release the o key"; whereas Alt+162 means "press and hold the Alt key while typing 162, and then release the Alt key".)
They have a tutorial to give you a good idea of what it can do.

The Alt shortcut system described in another answer might work in some cases, but in my case, it is less than satisfactory.

However there is already a shortcut sequence for inserting equations.
But because my keyboard does not have the accented ó, I can only do "Select All" with Alt,o,Alt+162,e!
