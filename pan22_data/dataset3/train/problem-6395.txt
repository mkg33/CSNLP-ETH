The easier way would be just to set up an SSH tunnel with the built-in methods of SSH; look at the -D switch in the manpage and just forward some port to the other server's ssh port.
I want to copy a file from my machine A to server C, but only have access to server C through server B.
If you want to be really wicked, you could chain ssh and tar, something like tar c mydir | ssh server "ssh otherserver | tar x", but this can run into all hands of problems.
The command below will copy files from a remotePath on server2 directly into your machine at localPath.
If you use the same user credentials in both servers:
Instead of first transferring to server B, log in and then transfer to server C, Is is possible to transfer the file directly with SCP or similar programs?
If you use password authentication instead, try with
Internally the scp request is proxied via server1.
(Emacs tramp-mode has this feature for editing files remotely).
You can add -o options to scp instead of .ssh/config.
scp -o 'ProxyJump jumpboxname' somefilename.txt finaldestinationhost:/tmp/.
It's possible and relatively easy, even when you need to use certificates for authentication (typical in AWS environments).
