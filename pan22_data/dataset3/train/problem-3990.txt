I really have to encourage you to look at the way DB schemas are handled by existing CRM systems and consider whether (1) you wouldn't be further off customizing one of these systems and (2) you're not biting off more than you can chew.
Typically, this includes the ability to extend and/or modify the definitions of the built-in entities and the ability to add new entity types and relationships.
Understand that sales reps are going to follow the money with respect to their behavior.
I'd also encourage you to try to pry a business scenario out of this client, as well.
If not, then I'd be a little suspicious about the premise of information sharing.
Many of these CRM systems also have the ability to set up some pretty funky security setups, and some might be able to do something similar to what you're suggesting.
If they're paid to share information, then it'll happen; otherwise, you're going to have to beat them with a stick to share anything.
Most CRM systems I've seen have extensive customization capabilities built into them.
What's got him convinced that sales reps are going to share information?
If they're working together on a team, then existing CRM systems have this covered already.
