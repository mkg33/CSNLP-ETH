If your users are connecting through a windows client like TortoiseSVN, then they are likely using ssh to connect.
If your SVN is being served through apache you can use these steps to quickly find out the right files to modify/update.
If the grep line comes back with several matches you will have to inspect the apache configuration manually to determine the right one for your repository.
For example, if it uses the password-db directive, your users will be inside the file it points to.
I don't have a Debian server to check here, but my Ubuntu uses /etc/apache2 as the standard apache configuration path.
You will need need to create a user with ssh access on the server.
Search for the AuthzSVNAccessFile too - you may have to give this new user explicit permission to access the right paths, depending on your configuration.
If you are using the apache module mod_dav_svn, then you need to look in your Apache configuration and determine what does Apache use as its user authentication base.
A subversion repository can be served in several ways; if you are using the bundled svnserve daemon, then Joril's answer is correct.

There was likely a group created with access to the svn repository directory.
Grant the user membership to the group or create one.
It depends on your config.. Have a look at the file at
svnserve.conf specifies how SVN should authenticate users.
The user needs read and write access to the repository in order to check in and out files.
(on my server the repositories are at /var/local/subversion)
