Raspberry Pi Model B, has 700MHz CPU and 512Mb of Ram.
Another choice could be Resign, which is focused on small solutions:
Unrelated to the Pi, but another possibility for this type of application is to get yourself a VPS (virtual private server) from any number of vendors - these systems can be exceptionally cheap (literally a few bucks a month) if you're willing to manage them yourself.

I don't have Raspberry Pi, but it sure looks interesting to be used as a web server.

If you subtract OS memory, daemon, video, etc; Might be less than 300MB left to run your application.
I advice to run 32bits on everything (OS, libraries, etc).
I've run a number of these type apps on the Pi, but nothing I do is particularly heavy on the memory or CPU, so it's not a big deal.
If is just a web services, with a light database (or even remote db), for internal purposes, it should work.
Yes,As Apache is the light weight web server .You can go to this link for installation stpes.
I have learnt how to develop web applications with JEE technologies, working in Eclipse IDE, using Apache TomEE server and MySQL database.
It certainly could work - now a more accurate question would be "does this thing have enough horsepower to run my specific application and/or load"... and the answer to THAT depends a lot on what you're actually doing with this application.
I think the main bottleneck to run Java inside a Raspberry is the RAM.

So, I was wondering is it possible to use this model of Raspberry Pi, to install software that would run JEE web applications (Apache TomEE)?
