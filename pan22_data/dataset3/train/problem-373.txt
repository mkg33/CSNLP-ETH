I would write the encryptCharacter method as follows and remove the bounds check from the encryptText method:
Therefore this field should be replaced with a method parameter.
And emojis, which by the way would result in two spaces per emoji.
This can never happen since you already check the condition in the encryptText method.
The first prepares everything, the second does the interesting work, and the third asserts that the result is correct.
And, the Turkish lowercase dotless i (Ä±) is also "supported", although not intentionally.
When you follow this style, you can easily see which part of the code is worth stepping through with a debugger.
Instead of assertTrue, you should call assertEquals("BCD", encryptedText).
This comment is redundant if you write c < 'A' || c > 'Z'.
You forgot to test lowercase letters and non-alphabetic characters.
There is no reason that the Cipher class ever stores the clear text.
But even more important: the documentation must match the code.
Depending on who you ask, the word positive may exclude the 0.
There is a typo in "Encrypts", and the URL should be a hyperlink, like <a href="https://...">Caesar Cipher</a>.
Because when that assertion fails, the error message is much nicer, giving you the expected and the actual result.
