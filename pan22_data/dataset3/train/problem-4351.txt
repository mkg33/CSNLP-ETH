The 2008 ts manager doesn't seem to cause this problem."
We monitor lsm.exe memory usage with SCOM and we see an immediate drop in memory usage when we close ts managers on XP or 2003.
How many sessions are generally active on your machine?
This looks like it could be related to the problem you're experiencing:

Just a wild guess (and yes 4 is forced logoff ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394058%28VS.85%29.aspx )
"The XP/2003 terminal session manager needs to be closed once every few hours.
One thing I've seen done to resolve this is to force disconnected sessions to log out after a short period of inactivity (1 to 2 hours) - that has resolved this type of issue for me in the past.
You should try disabling remote audio when connecting to the terminal server and see if the memory leak disappears.
If users are disconnecting their sessions, instead of logging off, that can cause the kind of problems you are seeing.

Perhaps because you are using a non windows shell you aren't actually properly logging out of terminal server.
Although the server has no audio card, maybe this could involve RDP's remote audio playback capability.
Also, an additional troubleshooting step you should take: does this happen when logging on locally to the server's console, or only when using Terminal Server?
