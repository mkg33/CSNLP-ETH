When I try search objects located on domainB.net from domainA.com it gives me following error:
In forest A there are couple of domains, so account from which I've tried to list forest B resources belong to a C domain included in A forest, though account was in enterprise admin group.
Do you have stub zones or conditional forwarders set up on both sides, and do all DCs in all domains have this set correctly?
I'm new to forest trust relationship, so any help is appreciated.
If you nslookup domainA.net from your domainB.net DCs and vice versa do they resolve correctly (ie a list of all DCs)?
There are also 3 different forests with same settings as domainB.net and same error.
'Cannot contact a domain controller' implies it either can't get through (which it can as it can connect the other way) or doesn't know where to look.
If I try search vice versa (on domainA.com from domainB.net) everything works.
Problem solved by creating account in forest A root domain.
How do the 2 domain's DNS servers reference the other domains DNS domains?
