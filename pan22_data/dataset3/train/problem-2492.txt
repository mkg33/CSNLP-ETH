You can get these from performance_schema.variables_by_thread.
If you want to find all the active connections that have this difference, perhaps you could have the application dump the output of that query to a text file along with the connection ID (using the CONNECTION_ID() function) and parse it as you wish.
Other idea, if you have only one APP that access your MySQL, you can write some code into your APP to write informations about that session into your tables, so you can access the information of all connectios from your APP.

Example: You can create a new table on INFORMATION_SCHEME with data of each SESSION when each session starts, so you can know p.e.
As of MySQL 5.7 the performance_schema can provide this information.
Knowing the Process ID you can then look up the Thread ID from performance_schema.threads.
