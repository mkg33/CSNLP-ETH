One of them is "Remote Desktops" - which is an MMC console that lists all systems and can be connected to multiple systems at the same time.
personally i use royalTS, but there is another option if you don't want to install software on your PC.
If you have a Windows 2003 Server, install the AdminPak.MSI file - this includes most if not all of the administrative tools available on the server.
I put it all the way to the right by the clock and when the taskbar is locked, i just click on the little ">>" next to it, and it acts like a popup menu.
Then I created a custom taskbar toolbar and pointed it at the folder with my rdps in it.
I created a folder in My Documents and put all my .rdp files in it.
There is a remote desktops MMC snap-in which does the same thing.
Try Terminals, it's a remote control tool that supports VNC, RDP, SSH, Telnet, ...
That said, I ended up paying for the latest version as it was cheap as chips and had some nice additions.
There may be other apps (some of them could be recommended by others) but this is a free utility that can put all connections in a central location.
