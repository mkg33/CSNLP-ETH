Since I use my right hand on the keypad, pressing right-alt with the left hand is not as convenient as pressing left-alt.
Microsoft continues its relentless regression to the Middle Ages... ♪♪éééé♪♪♪éé
The best I have come up is typig the numeric sequence slower.
Instead of trying to remember that ✓ is U+2713 (which I am unable to), I can suggest trying a piece of software I maintain called WinCompose.
After reading this I have discovered right-alt and left-alt produce different results for the same code.
Maybe the keyboard is dirty and the Alt key doesn't hold steady and drops after the 1 3 and doesn't get the 0.
I want to type é, so I go Alt 130: é, but if I type as fast as I can, I get ♪, which is the so called "eighth note" music symbol, which is normally made with Alt 13.
Anyway, the solution for now is pressure air clean the keyboard and tinker with the typing speed.
Finally, note that Windows doesn’t let you enter Unicode characters beyond U+FFFF with the EnableHexNumpad key, so you won’t be able to enter e.g.
To get GBP I used to enter left-alt 0163, which produces ú.  I should be using right-alt 0163, which produces £.
Bottom line, it seems to be a problem of keyboard sensitivity and those damn "help" anti-repeat features.
Of course if you only know the Unicode codepoint for a given character and not the (supposedly intuitive) combination, you can still activate Unicode input in WinCompose and do the following:
There is a GUI that lets you search for sequences and characters.
It inserts itself in the keyboard input chain and when using the default Right Alt as a compose key, lets you enter combinations such as:
I try pressing Alt+2713 to give a "✓" character, but instead I get a "Ö" character.
