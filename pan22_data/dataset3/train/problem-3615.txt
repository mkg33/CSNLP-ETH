You'll also need to save this in a file because the setting is also in memory and won't survive a reboot.
This single line gives full NAT'd internet access, much like a home router.
This is transient and will not survive a reboot, be sure to save it or it'll eat kittens, etc.
Your best bet (and to keep things from "breaking" further) is to simply alias the internal NIC on the linux box that points to the LAN.
Note that this is a temporary arrangement, it will not survive a reboot because all you've done is reconfigure the network interface in memory.
You'll need to find out how your specific distro saves changes and do so to ensure it shows up on each reboot.
If you are wanting "plain ol' NATing" then it looks like this:
I'm not entirely clear if you are wanting this, or wanting something else, so this seemed to be the most generic (applicable) answer.
This also needs saved just like the prior firewall rule.
If it's taking over full time and you don't care about the broken router coming back, just assign the address outright:
... which will bind the IP address to the linux box.
Sounds silly, but in some cases, you may have a firewall enabled by default, so better safe than sorry:
Without IP forwarding enabled, you'll get jack-diddly in the packet movement department.
It's not entirely clear if you are talking about some kind of tiered routing, or if you just want general NAT'd access for all your machines on the LAN; I'm going to assume it's the later (the most generic and useful case) so, you need to:
