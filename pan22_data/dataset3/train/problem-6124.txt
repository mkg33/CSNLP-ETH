Both roles are users on the same Vagrant instance.
However, this only happens on our Jenkins slave node, which is a Mac Mini.
I often find that when this task executes, it produces the following error:
I've also found that executing the above command does not reproduce the error on my local MacBook Pro instance, which has the same Vagrant setup, even if I do it repeatedly.
I've come up with a simple example that reproduces the connection reset behavior:
I also ran the above ssh commands with -vvv but didn't see anything obvious.
The only thing that comes to mind is that I see some sshd processes on the Jenkins machine, presumably used by Jenkins:
Both machines have the same OS version, as well as the same version of SSH.
Does anyone have any ideas as to why this behavior would appear on one machine but not the other?
So essentially the task is opening two SSH connections to the same VM in parallel and executing some commands on each connection.
I have a script that executes a Rake remote task which executes once for each of two roles.
