Closing the lid on your MacBook should be putting it to sleep.
I don't regularly use Grooveshark or VLC, so I'm not sure how they're designed to behave.
When you tell your computer to go to sleep, System Events sends a message to every app notifying them of this, which is why iChat logs off and iTunes stops playing when you close your MacBook.
You'll know your MacBook is asleep because the screen will turn off, the fans will tun off, and the hard drive will spin down.
As @Muhammad mentioned, this can take a few seconds.
If VLC and Grooveshark are ignoring this message and preventing sleep, then you should report that bug to the developers (after making sure they are up-to-date) and then make sure to quit (or pause) them manually before closing your MacBook.
Go to the Apple menu and choose Sleep, or hit command+option+eject.
On my 3-year old MacBook Pro, the system suspends and the display turns off after just a few seconds, followed soon after by the hard drives spinning down, but the fan keeps running until the processor has cooled offâ€”then the power light starts pulsating.
You can demo this for yourself and test to make sure sleep is working by manually putting the computer to sleep with the display still open.
Once sleep is complete, your power light will start pulsating like the slow heartbeat of a hibernating mammal.
Sleep suspends the entire application level, so when the system is asleep there will be no activity from any applications on your system.
