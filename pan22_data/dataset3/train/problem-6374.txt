I'm using SPBWM with my cable connection to limit the available bandwidth on a per IP bases.
I have a rule for each address on my subnet, that limits bandwidth to 1Mbit/256k.
What I would do is spend a few hundred bucks on a SOHO router/firewall that can do rudimentary limiting by IP.
Depending on the appliance you go with, you may be able to apply QoS rules by IP Address or switchport.
The wiki page for Quality of Service lists this relevant bullet point:
This is why it's best to place each room in their own VLAN and set the equipment to limit each VLAN to a certain amount of ingress and egress traffic.
I like the boxes from DrayTek because, for me, they have been pretty solid routers at a reasonable price.
Setting up DHCP with reservations for each machine, then targeting specific machines with a QoS Rule on their IP address may be the easiest way to go.
As far as appliances go, Zeroshell seems promising, and delivers its distribution (Linux-based with a web frontend and ssh) in different forms, including LiveCDs and VMWare appliances.
If your wireless is on a separate router from the wired then that entire subnet will have to share the limited bandwidth.
It looks like you can download it for free for home use and run it on a Windows box.
There's no reason the user can't use a switch and have multiple machines or multiple NIC's abusing the bandwidth.
If you don't mind installing an additional PC to act as a bridge on the network, this software may be of help.
I just noticed on freshmeat a program called Untangle.
Full disclosure: I'm no way affiliated with ZeroShell, but I'm considering implementing it in the house I'm currently living at as a router/default gateway/DHCP server/QoS Rules/VLAN Routing.
This is because traffic shaping is easiest done by IP address but doing it by IP makes it fairly easy to circumvent.
