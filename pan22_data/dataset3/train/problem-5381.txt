Even granting it at the root of C won't filter to everything.
Is there a way to give webuser, read permissions across the whole disk / OS?
If the whole folder structure inherits permissions from it's own root then granting 'webuser' READ access to that directory will propogate down to any new files/folders that are created in the future as long as they aren't created with explicit un-inherited rights.
I would like the user to be able to read all files that currently exist, and that will be created in the future.
Also make sure the webuser is in the right Local group on the server, and that the permissions are correct within IIS on the website itself if necessary.
My advice would be to set it on the web server directory properly and check that folders/files within that directory are set if they need uninherited permissions.
Random files and folders within our web server directory do not have the permissions to allow our webuser to read files.
There are lots of folders/files with explicit/un-inherited permissions on the OS partition.
Our server appears to have some weird permissions issues.
I know how to do this for a particular file or folder, but this is obviously tedious to change each time.
