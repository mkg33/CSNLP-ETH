Moreover, if you get the cross-over cable that have only two pairs twisted most likely your 1Gb adapters would not negotiate 1Gb speed.
So, the straight-through cable is the one you need.
Presently, most networking devices as well as PC NICs are implementing auto-MDIX feature that allows you to use straight-through cable to interconnect switches or two PCs.
Is there really two different kind of LAN cables(other than performance types) for connecting two different PCs and a PC to a Router.
I went to a computer store to buy a LAN(Ethernet) cable and they asked me whether I want to connect two PCs or a PC to a router.
What you are describing is called a crossover cable:
The straight-through was used to connect PCs to networking equipment.
In the past it was a requirement to use cross-over cable to connect PC to PC or hub to hub or switch to switch.
I used to do both using same cable and it worked for me till I lost the cable.
I have a lot of network equipment but zero crossover cables and everything works no matter how I connect it up (using regular patch cables).
For modern hardware you should never need a crossover cable.
