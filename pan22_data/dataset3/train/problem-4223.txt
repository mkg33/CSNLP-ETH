I want to send some log messages out to a remote log server, and change the facility on them to a configured value so the log server can tell more easily that they came from my hardware.
Yes, I know, this approach would be ugly as hell and belongs to Don't Try This Anywhere category, but still it might work.
That is, all logs coming out of my machine are, say, local3, regardless of their original facility.
As Andrew itself found out, syslog-ng would be the best option.
I've scoured the man page for any clue and found nothing.
Can I do this with vanilla syslogd on FreeBSD, or using some other implementation?
You can easily sort messages in syslog depending on hostname they came from.
But I think there might be a kludgish way to do the trick even with vanilla FreeBSD syslogd.
logger probably adds its own timestamps etc to every log entry, so you might want to sed or whatever the original timestamps away.
It seems to be possible to pipe log entries to an external program: you can then pipe the messages to logger and set the wanted facility & priority with it and ask logger to send the log entry to your log server.
Apparently it is not possible to do this with FreeBSD syslog.
According to this web page you can do it with syslog-ng, but we're not in a position to switch.
