Can I perhaps do a "special" slide in Keynote that tells it to run an AppleScript?
Better yet, to switch to an app, and wait until I switch back, and then automatically advance to the next slide?
It's this switching back and forth that I want to make smooth, just to wow the audience a little.
I.e., it would be similar to Apple's "Demo" slides in a cursive font, except not with a different screen, or different computer.
I'm going to show off five major improvements in an upcoming release of our app.
The short version: I'd like to tell Apple Keynote to switch to a specific app (never leaving full-screen mode) before a certain slide appears, then display that slide as soon as I switch back.
I want one slide highlighting the feature, then one or two showing some details, perhaps with screenshots.
After that, so people get a better impression of what I'm talking about, I'll show it off live â€” to do this, I have to switch to a VM or remote session (since this is a Windows app).
Then, I'd like to switch back and go to the next feature.
