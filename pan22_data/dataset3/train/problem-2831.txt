The closest thing that windows does provide is SIS (single instance storage) - stores only 1 copy of a file - several steps away from what ZFS actually provides.
whilst not directly attached to the server, there are plenty of file-servers out there that use an iSCSI target out of a ZFS appliance as their primary storage.
might i also suggest that providing ZFS via iSCSI or NFS to a windows server is also a method of gaining the benefits of ZFS for a windows server?
Btrfs is still 'experimental' in Linux, and ext4 is recently out of that state.
The "What's New in 2008" doc doesn't show anything like that for NTFS (link).
Are there checksumming filesystems besides ZFS and BtrFS on any platform, especially Windows?
The idea is new enough it isn't in a lot of file-systems yet.
I also have been unable to dig out anything that suggests NTFS has checksumming.
I've been told that checksumming is available in Windows 2008, but I've been unable to verify this.
for a small solution take a look at http://www.va-technologies.com/sbb
Windows is somewhat famous for having one and only one filesystem, NTFS.
The closest I've come is a document describing the checksum protecting the GPT blocks on a dynamic disk.
Windows Server 2012 has ReFS, which checksums metadata and (optionally) data.
EXT4 uses journal checksumming, but not data checksumming.
