Which has the advantage in this scenario, KVM or Xen?
So far I dug trough a lot of articles and posts on serverfault.com and stackoverflow.com.
I am going to set up a high availability hosting server (load balancer, mysql, apache, php, memcached, apc, possibly a distributed/network file system of some kind) with two nodes.
Also for this reason I ruled out openvz because it does not completely isolate the vm's resources.
I managed to narrow the choice down to KVM and Xen, though I haven't found any information that makes the decision between the two easier to make.
KVM and Xen are favourable because of their established track records and the way they manage the vm's (it has dedicated resources which can't be stolen due to e.g.
I want to isolate the load balancer, database, webserver and file system into separate virtual machines to prevent one part of the system affecting another in case of malfunction, security breach, etc.
I am having difficulty finding up-to-date information and advice specific to my situation, hence I am posting the question here.
