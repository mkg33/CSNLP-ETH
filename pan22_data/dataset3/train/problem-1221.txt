Here "%1" is the full Windows path, like "C:\some path\file.avi"
Do this by matching each (tell me if there is a better way).
What can I do to have this Windows path convert to a path like /mnt/c/some\ path/file.avi which the Windows Bash would actually understand?
Remember to assign "variable" to your file path first (if you are using a separate file, try using parameters).
4) This is the tricky part: since Linux is case sensitive, we need to convert uppercase drive letter to lowercase.
1) Get the first letter of the path, which is the drive.
Just place the file wherever you are working or add it to your path (or just put it above your code, which would be easier to work with).
I have a windows batch script that uses Windows Ubuntu Bash.
It receives a full Windows path as an argument and then passes that path to a command in Ubuntu Bash.
Windows Build 17046 [1] contains new wslpath utility that can translate paths from/to WSL/Windows.
Use backticks before wslpath and at the end, and use single quotation marks (straight ticks) around %1.
You can remove unnecessary drive letters too, since you probably have no more than ten drives.
