every time when i do pm-hibernate the system hibernates  but when i resume   cinnamon is not loaded ,  the icons and all are a mesh  and if i try to restart cinnamon the system freezes (same if i try to do cinnamon --replace on a terminal).
I have plenty of swap (10GB and my ram is only 2GB)
These are just examples, you will find many more on a search for "SUSPEND_MODULES", best with some hardware specs (hint: some wifi hardware also often is the cause for this kind of trouble, same applies to graphics and tv-cards).
To give you one reference: Here is one thread on the Linux Mint forums dealing with similar trouble on a Sony Vaio, and here's another dealing with sdhci causing trouble on a HP Pavilion.
From the time I installed mint 13 (cinnamon) I cant hibernate and resume correctly  .
As you didn't state your hardware details, only a generic answer is possible.
I'd guess some part of your hardware is causing trouble on suspend/resume, as it is often the case (some video-drivers are know for that).
That's where SUSPEND_MODULES kicks in: modules defined here are unloaded on suspend, and reloaded on resume -- so concerning the problematic hardware it looks like shutdown/startup.
