But as stated above in place server upgrades can lead to a bad few days.
I don't think the install/upgrade process supports this...
I've installed Windows 2000 because IBM supported it out-of-the-box and offered installation tools (ServerGuide).
(I assume that Dell and IBM's out-of-band tools have similar capabilities...)
Is it possible to upgrade Windows 2003 to Windows 2008 from a mounted ISO (e.g.
From there run the command-line install (it used to be winnt /o /x or something like that) and install 2008 to a new directory.
Bare install, no patching or updates because it's temporary.
You'll have to find another way to boot up to the CD as you cannot start the install from a mounted ISO.
Then I've copied the i386 folder from the install ISO to a folder on the 2000 installation.
You'll then end up with a dual-boot 2000/2008 server.
will let you delete the 2000 boot and change the default loader to 2008.
Main issue to watch for is that the drive letter does not change after reboot process.
It would have to copy all needed files from the mounted ISO and install from there...
Extract the ISO to a flash drive and perform the upgrade that way instead of using software tool.
First of all, upgrading from 2003 to 2008 is bad news.
A few hacks with the boot loader (It used to be simple to edit boot.ini but now you have to work in the boot loader database with cryptic commands.)
If you don't have a drive you can use, you can look into delivering the image from WDS on another server.
If you can do a clean install, that's going to be your best bet.
If your server is a HP Proliant, you can mount the .iso image in iLO (via the virtual disk) and move on with life.
I'm looking for any kind of confirmation about this.
I have used a similar process for machines which Windows 2008 doesn't officially support, but not exactly as an upgrade.
