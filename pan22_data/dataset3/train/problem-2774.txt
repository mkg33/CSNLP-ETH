If this is in a datacenter environment, you need to make sure that you have a free power socket for it, and that the power adapter fits the plugs in your rack.
Or is it going to be left plugged in and used to make ad-hoc or scheduled copies of data on the server?
Do you have another spare that can be used, and how long will it take you to swap it out?
You also need to think about what happens when the power supply fails.
You also need to think about what filesystem you will be using.
As for which type to buy - well, you have to think about what you're using it for.
If you're filling the drive up every day with fresh data, and the drive is cheap and expected to fail after 2,000 cycles, you will end up losing the drive in just under 5Â½ years (assuming you use an operating system which supports the TRIM operation).
But then, there are other factors to consider, such as what the physical media is - is it solid-state, or spinning disk?
If you're regularly writing/wiping the backup data, you might want to look a little more closely at the failure rates and how many write cycles are supported on the drive.
According to the File Transfer Time Calculator, copying 700 GB of data over USB 3, will take just over 32 minutes.
Another point to consider is the requirement for an external power supply.
If this is a Windows environment, and you need NTFS, beware that you should disable write caching on the disk, else you might find the disk is actually empty and you have no backup at all.
If it's a one-time backup, and you're planning to keep it for less than 10 years, you'll probably be fine with an SSD.
