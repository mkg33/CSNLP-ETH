Generally speaking routers cannot perform the necessary re-writing when the request is arriving from the same network the request would be re-written to.
I suspect your specific problem is that you would like to access the web site via its DNS host name.
You can handle that by using "split-horizon" DNS, so it pays attention to where the request is coming from and answers appropriately:  If the request is coming from inside your network, it hands out the 192.168.0.50 to requests coming from your network and the public IP to everyone else.
I was able to fix this by adding the DNS host name to my router's DNS Host Mapping list.
The common solution to this problem is to place a web proxy outside the network that loops the request back through your firewall.
I found these settings listed in the advanced options list of my router.
On my router, I had to turn off "NAT acceleration" (Cut Through Forwarding) as this broke NAT loopback...
The problem is that the packet rewriting can generally only take place when traversing the firewall.
Either of these suggestions could be implemented on any host outside of your network, like a (free) Amazon EC2 micro instance.
