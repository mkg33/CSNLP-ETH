I don't like either of the method signatures, but of course they were outside your control.
In fact, it's a much better place to use a method than the proposed showChar.
Note that I also changed from string1 and string2 to firstName and lastName.
They should never vary from that, as it leads to confusion.
These names better describe what the variables hold than generic numbered names.
I'm not a big fan of the half-cuddled else, but if you're going to do it, please avoid putting any vertical whitespace into it.
That way you don't have to fool with an index variable or dereferencing a character position at all.
This is also a good place to use a method so you can say something like
Think of the closing of the previous block and the opening of the new as one unit.
Not sure if that is better than the for each form, although I find both alternatives to be more idiomatic Java than the original C-ish version.
For example, the first time that I read the program I missed the less than assertion altogether.
If you're using the same value multiple times, you'd be better off storing it and using the variable.
