* 2> /dev/null to check if someone has set a ulimit somewhere, and remove it.
If you would like to change the limit only for that shell, you could run:
It should be enough to (re)set the ulimit, no need to change configuration (let alone system-wide configuration under /etc).
You will need root permissions on the machine though.
If your limits.conf is empty, grep -l ulimit /etc/* $HOME/.
In a terminal run ps -au, that should show all processes running as you, check the list (or post it here) to see if something strange is going on.
If you want to make a more permanent change, you need to edit either /etc/limits.conf or /etc/security/limits.conf (depending on your linux distro) and add the following lines:
If you use * it would be the default for all users
These lines limit username user to 25 processes and users in group groupname to 100 processes.
And 35 processes should be plenty, something is wrong with the login process of OP.
After editing limits.conf, all you have to do is to logout and login again to take effect.
Instead of username a groupname can also be used if you prefix it with an @.
