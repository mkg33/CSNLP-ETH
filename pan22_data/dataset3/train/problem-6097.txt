Clone the System with your LDAP and then remove it from the network.
Preferably test your most applications whether there are any implications.
Running the two LDAP servers in parallel, or two LDAP basis on one system, often entails that you need to make changes in both systems and to keep them in sync and end up with more work and problems then a sudden shift would be.
Change the IP and hostname of the new server to match the productive ldap server.
Windows attached to Samba) or users might change their passwords without telling an admin.
Once you have determined what's attached to the LDAP server, you can plan the downtime for each service.
Make the changes on the clone as you described yourself.
For the actual downtime, I found that a break is often better then running the two systems in parallel.
Downtime for the LDAP can be minimized to a couple of seconds, if you switch the virtual network interface with a script.
Change applications that don't fallover automatically.
Power down the old server and attach the network to the new one.
During my time in Univention's Professional service I worked on multiple similar projects and the one thing missing from the problem description is, what the LDAP is actually used for.
During the whole procedure any changes in the LDAP of the old server needs to be replicated to the new one as well.
If you want to minimize the downtime, virtualization or a second physical server would be the way to go.
