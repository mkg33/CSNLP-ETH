The problem is that VirtualBox canâ€™t find the file in that path for the VirtualBox machine.
If somehow there is no ubuntu.vbox file, but there is a backup named ubuntu.vbox-prev or ubuntu.vbox-pre then quit VirtualBox, copy that file and rename it so it becomes ubuntu.vbox with the .vbox extension.
Then find the actual virtual machine files, double-click the ubuntu.vbox file to get it reimported and there you go!
The inaccessibility means VM can not read the VM file PATH for it to function or run, for some unknown reason an extension is added to the file itself.
On your physical machine go to the File PATH as stated with "Runtime error openning" C:\ users....... and remove any what or ever the extra extension on ubuntu.vbox and save it as ubuntu.vbox
When that is done, restart VirtualBox and it should now be able to find file and all should be good.
What I do in cases like this is delete the machine but do not delete the files so the machine is removed from the VirtualBox list but the files connected to it are left untouched.
