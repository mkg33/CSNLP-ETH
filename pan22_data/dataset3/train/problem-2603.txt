despite in UNIX world, tar + gzip (or bzip) combination is much more preferred.
I love the standard Linux (Ubuntu, at least) file archiver.
why is it popular among (win) hackers, nobody know though, its a kind of attitude.
7zip (generally) has the highest compression ratio but consequently, the slowest.
One feature about WinRAR is it preserves the original creation dates of folders on extraction.
As current versions of WinRAR can decompress 7z (and 7z can decompress rar), and 7z usually compresses better than zip (and often better than rar), I tend to send those who send me RAR files 7Z files back :)
zip is omnipresent, one of the oldest; anybody, anything, anywhere can handle it,
rar has got fair compromises between speed, features/handling and compression ratio,
I believe bzip2 has the best compression of the lot, but it is very slow.
7-zip is my choice on Windows but its icon is horrible; it looks like it's from Windows 95!
Both rar and .zip preserve folder creation date/time but it seems only winrar preserves that info on extraction
All the others get plain old .zip files of course.
When you extract a file, if there's one file or folder in it, it is extracted to the current directory, otherwise a sub folder.
Saves all those folder-in-folder situations, where on Windows I constantly check the contents of the zip before extracting.
I use Zip because it's available and supported on the machines we have at work, and everyone can work with Zip files.
i have ever extracted 4GB wiki data exploded to about 120GB.
A point against RAR is that there is (as far as I know) no free software that can compress it.
