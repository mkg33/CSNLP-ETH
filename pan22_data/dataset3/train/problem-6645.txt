I precede to install a PPPoE server, which all clients are isolated because they are in a tunnel and have to connect to the server
client 1 and client n can communicate directly using the switch, without any packets ever arriving the firewall.
You may need a different switch in order to implement PVLAN's.
If you need to use public IPs and you don't have much of them, you can just assign private IPs and do NAT on the firewall.
However I would like to filter the packets between the clients, therefore I want to disallow any direct communication between the clients.
So, is there any way to tell the switch: Forward all packets to the firewall, don't allow direct communication between clients?

However I don't even have that much IP addresses: I have about 200 clients, only a /24 subnet and all clients shall have public ip addresses, therefore I can't just create a private network for each of them (well, maybe using some NAT, but I'd like to avoid that).
200) clients in a /24 subnet and the following network structure:
I know this is possible using vlans, but then - according to my understanding - I would have to put all clients in their own network.
The switch is transparent to the client and firewall in the network.
Below is a link to Cisco's product matrix for Cisco switches that support PVLAN's:
You need to distribute the clients in different subnets in order to do some filtering at layer 3 (IP).
You can not tell the switch to forward the traffic to the firewall to be filtered.
Therefore none of those packets could be filtered.
(in words: all clients connected to one switch and the switch connected to the firewall)
And here's a link to a Cisco Catalyst 2948G at www.amazon.com:
When the clients are connected to the same switch, they will communicate with each other via passing through the firewall.
