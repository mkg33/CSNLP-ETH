rise and fall in the number of publications, go for DTW for calculating the similarities.
Let me preface this by saying that I'm a complete beginner to R and data science in general, so my apologies if this is a rather trivial question.
I would like to run a clustering algorithm on a data frame with 13369 distinct units, each having just a single variable that is tracked over 15 years.
To establish some context for this task, this is the data for authors and the number of publications they have published in each year, spanning over 15 years.
I do have a rough idea of what I would like to achieve though, and how the end result should look like.
I just don't know which algorithm is best suited for dealing with this kind of data and how to go about implementing it.
I would like to end up with a dendrogram that depicts various clusters that authors fall into, (I'm guessing) depending on how prolific they were in a certain time period (beginning vs. later years, for example).
Thank you for taking your time and assisting a student in need.
I am sure there are R implementations of DTW but I am a Python guy ;) After calculating pairwise DTW similarities, you may apply your Hierarchical Clustering to it (or maybe some other algorithms like Spectral Clustering).
