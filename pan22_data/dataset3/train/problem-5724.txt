If your server is not joined to a domain, it will automatically sync to time.windows.com.
Import the task and you should have that as the User and set it to Run with highest privileges.
If your server is the Domain Controller which holds the PDC Emulator FSMO role, you must configure it to sync to another NTP server using the "net time..." command above.
To run it as System, since mine was on a DC, I had to export the task and in the XML I edited this part:
You can specify any time interval you want, for instance you could set your server to update it's time from your designated NTP servers every 5 mintues.
On the scheduled task properties, on the General page, did you check off "Run with highest privileges?"
To make it sync with a different server, use this command in a command prompt window:
You don't need to configure a scheduled task to synchronise time.
There are options within w32tm itself to set a specific interval for time sync.
If your server is joined to a domain it will automagically sync to the nearest Domain Controller.
Where UserId was my username and now I've set it up for SYSTEM.
You could also try to run it as System instead of your account.
