Remove that ownership and add it again (the same one).
Create a live USB of your Linux distribution of choice, boot into that, mount the drives, and clean them up that way.
Assuming that the deletion has to be made on a second drive: What has just worked for me is:
If you can,change the name to windows.old.Then open disk cleanup,select the drive and click ok.After that click 'clean up system files' and it will delete the folder
For example, if user PETER has ownership, remove it, apply to all subfolders, then add PETER again, and apply.
It could be possible that you already have ownership of the same user, due to it being a previous disk that was hosting your system.
Now if you can't rename the folder,download unlocker,open it and select the folder then click rename and change the name to Windows.old and then run disk cleanup.
You should be then able to first rename the folder you wish to delete, and then delete it.
Simple rename Program Files to Windows.old and run disk clean to clear system files.
Same trick work on any folder what you cannot remove.
