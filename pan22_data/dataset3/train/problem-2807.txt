Final goal is to use vb.net to create an application for generating reports if it matters.
I have 2 tables, one holding Employee details (FirstName, LastName, Email, Manager) and one holding Manager details (FirstName, LastName, Email).
At the moment I made a very basic database in Access 2010.
I need to keep track of their Performance, Quality and Attendance on a daily basis but I'm unsure on how to setup my tables so that I don't run into troubles down the line.
How should I relate the data to each employee and each day so that it doesn't become complicated?
I've been tasked with setting up a way to track employee data over a number of months and potentially years.
This is going to be very basic as I'm a complete newbie when it comes to database design.
Should I make a table each for Performance, Quality and Attendance with the primary key as the date?
I've successfully created a relationship between the manager field in the Employee table and the Manager table but I'm at a loss on how to implement the tracking of the actual stats.
I don't have a problem with that step but I want to make sure I have a solid foundation first.
