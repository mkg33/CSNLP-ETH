I assumed you meant .ssh in your question and not .svn.
If you did actually create a .svn directory, you will need to change it to ssh.
The error messages for permissions appear on the server, in the logs and not in the client so it can be tricky to find this.
Your question is hard to parse, but I don't know what you think ".svn" will accomplish.
Not sure what else to do but i tried generating a rsa ssh-keygen -t rsa.
Resizing your terminal window should also cause it to re-wrap and clearly show any split lines.
Due to the split happening exactly at the end of the line, it isn't obvious.
The second most common error is spelling authorised_keys correctly and having SSH ignore the file because it was written by Americans.
I have also run into the problem with my public key being split over two lines in .ssh/authorized_keys.
When i add my public key to my server by creating a .svn and authorized_keys, when i remove it i can log in again (with a password prompt).
The permissions should be at least this restrictive:
The most common problem when setting up passwordless login with SSH is getting the permissions of your .ssh directory and the authorized_keys files wrong.
im trying to add to a ssh server of mine ssh key pairs so i can log in password-less.
SSH is fussy about permissions - with good reason; the wrong permissions can compromise your security.
Just set user password to '*' - that prevent username/password login
Your public key must be added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote system.
