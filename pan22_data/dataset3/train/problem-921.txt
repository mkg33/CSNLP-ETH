Do I have to watch for something while setting up the plan?
You'll also need to go into the "SQL Server Configuration Manager" and configure the SQL Agent service to start automatically, and then start it.
Then I plan to use the Maintainence plan wizard and set up my plan.
While the maintenance plans aren't the most flexable things in the world, for someone who is only managing just a couple of servers, maintenance plans are perfect for you.
This DB server doesn't have any maintenance plan set up.
You can use Ola Hallengren's - SQL Server Maintenance Solution
You can create your own maintenance plan from MP wizard its easy and works fine.
I tried clicking on new maintenance plan button from SSMS and it looks like the SQL server agent is not configured.
I want to set up a decent maintenance plan that will do a full database back up everyday and do an hourly transaction log back up.
We have 300+ servers and we are using it for all our backups.
The code you show in your question will enable the SQL Agent, then you can configure and schedule your maintenance plans.
