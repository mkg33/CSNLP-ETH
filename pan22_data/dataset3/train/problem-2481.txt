You can enable sticky session or session affinity.
sticky cookie srv_id expires=1h domain=.example.com path=/;
Having nginx responding to the root context of the VHost, and proxying the requests towards an instance of Tomcat in a context /application
I am using nginx for proxy so i can achieve acceding the application from a subdomain
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#sticky
Cesar has mentioned that he has resolved the issue with apache but I am getting the same even with apache.
This will ensure that the requests from same client are passed to the same tomcat every time
Try adding the proxy_cookie_path directive as mentioned below:
The only directive I added was [ proxy_cookie_path ~^/.
I noticed the issue occurs when the Proxy location path does not match the Tomcat application context name and there is a cookie path mismatch which causes a new JSESSIONID for every request.
I have another appliction in jetty that runs without problem behind the ngix.
Also if i acces the application directly i can operate it without problem.
For me, the answer provided by Diwakar Timilsina has been the exact one which solved my problem..
I am also facing the same issue that is unable to keep session.
