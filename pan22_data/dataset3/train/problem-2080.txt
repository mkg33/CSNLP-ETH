On GPT disks (using UEFI booting) boot manager and BCD are on ESP (EFI System Partition).
Max is not completely right in his own answer (23. dec 2013) to his own question.
You can find information about how to fix boot BCD problems here.
You would set both device and osdevice to the drive-letter that other Windows is currently  on (internally this will not be stored as a drive letter anyways)
If you have a single OS there is usually no need to change this.
It is obvious that the path to BCD inside of BCD cannot be used when loading BCD for the first time (BCD is loaded by boot manager).
b) (osdevice + systemroot) is the "complete directory path" to Windows directory
The answer is that both (device + path) and (osdevice + systemroot) make up a whole.
a) (device + path) is the "complete file path" to Windows loader for Vista, Windows 7/8
There is no need for path to boot manager (bootmgr) and BCD itself as they are established programmatically during initial load and execution of MBR and PBR (master and partition boot record) for BIOS booting.
Both bootmgr and \Boot\BCD are on active partition on MBR style disk.
Both device and osdevice should point to the drive the OS is installed on, not the boot files.
You should not be messing around windows boot loader as it may lead to unnecessary problems and crashes and the boot files you are talking they can be misleading as there are boot files in your C drive(Windows partition) but you cannot make the boot loader to boot from another drive while your actual windows files are on other drive.You should make windows partition as your default Booting device/partition.
Say you have another bootable Windows on another drive and want to add it to the current boot configuration data store.
