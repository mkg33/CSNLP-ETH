It's a job no different from any other, and any job can quickly destroy what enjoyment you have in the thing you're doing.
You do realise that when you're in game development you won't be playing many games?
That most likely you'll quickly come to loath playing games because you have to test little bits of them over and over again to analyse errors?
You're going to be spending a lot of time not playing games but in exhaustive meetings about minute details about them.
Which is why I always advise people to NOT try to turn their hobbies into their jobs.
You seem under the impression that working at a game development shop means you're just going to be paid to do what you like to do now, play a certain genre of game when and how you like to do it.
The rest of the time will be spent working on implementing or testing those minute details, and if that includes any playing it'll be playing the same little bit of the game over and over again to test that little detail you happen to have been assigned to working on.
