Also do the same with Norton registry keys - open regedit.exe and click through all the lists until you find something to do with Norton.
Optional (Autoruns should be enough to solve the problem, but I would do this just in case):
I searched and researched, I went into the registries, deleted all norton products in the registry keys as well as in windows currentversion run & runonce (if it in there) and then discovered when I deleted it from the runonce folder within the registry under microsoft windows for local user, I saw the window pop right back up and the key automatically reappear after I just deleted... that is when I SAW where the program was hiding... it was hiding under user\public\downloads (or public downloads).
Manually delete all Norton files on your system by searching for "Norton" at the C: level in your file system.
check to make sure it isn't in your public folders...
Then I went to downloads just for me (being I'm the only one that uses my laptop) and removed any other downloads from norton (such as the "removal tool") just to be certain.
Also go ahead and delete the file named SymInstallStub.exe which runs Norton Utilities Installer, that's why the installer always pops up.
After completing all of the above, reboot your computer and the file should be gone.
I believe it accidently came with the Adobe Shockwave but anyways after that, you're good.
I haven't seen anymore splash screens for installing norton...
I deleted it from there, and then went back to the registry and deleted it from the keys again that reproduced themselves.
When the installer pops up, open task manager and find .exe file that has been running it and delete it.
The link should be enough to answer your question, but in case it becomes broken in the future, here's my version of the answer:
