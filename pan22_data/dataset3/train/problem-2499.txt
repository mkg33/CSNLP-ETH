Turns out the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by our dryer is enough to block all signal (A/B/G/N) that is in an approximate 30 degree vector passing around the dryer.
My wife and I currently live in an apartment and just purchased a new dual-band N/G/B/A router because we thought our old G router was dying.
Depending on your type of dryer: yes, there will be issues receiving the signal due to its location.
It should not make a difference, however, the motor that turns the drum could throw out lots of interference, especially if its an older model.
The thing I didn't get was why I could get signal just fine in our living room, which was farther away, while I couldn't get signal at all while in the bedroom next to our office.
We suspected it was dying because we received signal everywhere in the house except our main bedroom.
I'm sure placing a router so close to a dryer will have an effect on its signal, but especially so if the dryer is between the router and receiving line of sight.
The dryer is located in a closet between the bedroom and office.
