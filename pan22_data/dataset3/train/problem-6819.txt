You notice I also stripped the comment, your if condition was pretty clear without it.
You might also want to prevent the user entering 1, which is theoretically valid but doesn't match the intent of the program.
Otherwise explain the number needs to be positive.
You should avoid using temp variables when you don't need to.
You also don't need to make a copy of knights_table, because you only ever use one of these variables later.
You may have previously needed to but your current code is airtight without it.
This way your print doesn't need to be in an else block.
For a start, you could assign range to a list directly without the list comprehension.
Also, it's good to have as few lines as possible in your try block.
Sometimes to avoid errors, but also for good readability.
You could use the continue keyword in your except clause and then move the other lines down below.
There's no real reason to separate temp_num and knights_num here.
I'll answer your questions then give more general advice.
