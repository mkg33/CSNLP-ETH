The data saved to the clipboard when copying the photo may not support the aplha channel/transparent data.
The image canvas that I'm working with does have an alpha channel, but that does not seem to make a difference.
Luckily, the background I needed to paste it on is white, so I just opened an excel spreadsheet and merged a bunch of cells to make a white background, pasted my image, then used the snipping tool to select my image then pasted into GIMP
In my case in Gimp one image was pasted to another as a black-white.
What works for me is opening the transparent picture in GIMP, then clicking and dragging the layer from the transparent image into the project I'm working on.
So I turned off a visibility of other layers, selected a needed layer and copied whole image to a new one.
On the latest version of GIMP on my PC, whenever I try to copy a transparent image from the internet, GIMP will automatically fill in the transparent areas with the background color I have selected.
I couldnt find a way to make it paste with the transparent background.
This is a non-issue on my Mac, but I need to do this work on my PC, so how can I make it recognize the alpha of the image and not fill it with the background color?
