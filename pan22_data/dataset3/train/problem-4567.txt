Here is alternative solution which involves making Apache to run under your UNIX user account
From there expand Sharing and Permissions at the bottom if it already isn't.
Right click on the folder you want to write on choose Get Info and at the bottom you can change Sharing & Permissions now they must be read only and you should change them to read and write.
If you use Mac OS X and XAMPP, let's assume that your folder with your site or API located in folder /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/API.
If your user account is not in there already, click the little + icon in the lower left and add your user account in.
Then you will have access to change the permissions.
You should now be able to write files into this folder, and this process is also the same for adding write permissions to files.
Depending on where the folder is you may need to click the lock icon at the bottom right to allow you to make changes.
