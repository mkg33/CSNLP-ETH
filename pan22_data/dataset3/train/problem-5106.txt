You can use AutoHotkey to move the keyboard focus to the file pane.
Just as fast as any keyboard shortcut and you don't have to install anything.
Tools -> "Folder Options..." -> "View" tab -> Deselect "Always show menus"

Now focus can be moved from the left and right panes (shown below) using Tab & Shift+Tab.
