Note: Although the latest version of TrueImage is £40, you can often find the previous version for free on the front of magazine cover-disks - that's how I got my first copy of TrueImage 9...
A friend of mine swears by Bacula for backing up a multitude of different machines.
I use Acronis TrueImage Home to image each group of data; the images are then copied to other physical disks.
If you don't mind paying, Backblaze is brain-dead simple.
It's very flexible, easy to use/setup, and reasonably priced.
If you don't want to pay for TrueImage, the are free alternatives, such as Bacula, NASBackup and Clonezilla.
For example, my OS and App volumes are imaged to my internal backup disk and to my NAS.
At any one time every byte on my disks are backed up in at least one other place, and in the case of key data (personal files, photo's etc) there are multiple versions in different location.
Use Jungle Disk to mount Amazon S3 service as a local disk on your desktop.
It also synchronize the MP3 folders across all four computers.
I've also used Mozy in the past for offsite backup.
Storage is ridiculously cheap (the new Samsung F2 1.5TB drives are £50) so storage space is simply not an issue.
I use it to backup two desktops and two laptops to an external drive.
Then use your favourite backup software on each platform to do the backup.
