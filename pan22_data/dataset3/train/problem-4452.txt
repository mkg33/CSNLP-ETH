For the sake of transparency, I have no association or commercial interest in any of these products.
The HDMI Mirror box defaults back to the original settings each time it is powered off and it is confusing for endusers to reset properly.
Not sure it applies to OP situation, but could help others.
However, it can't do it in the extended windows display mode, it switches to duplicating the same monitor.
First, you can buy hardware that does this to a video image "en route" to the monitor.
I've just purchased the Decimator MD-HX and the Horizontal Flip parameter in the Scaling settings will do what you want.
Of the software options I investigated only Ultramon can do this.
Further, the MD-HX is a vastly superior build quality to the HDMI Mirror box in my opinion and it autosaves the settings so that when it is powered off and restarted it maintains the settings you want.
I use this for driving my teleprompter :) much cheaper!
I had the same need for a content displayed within a browser, where I ended up using CSS tip to flip the element :
I'm running a three display setup in Windows extended desktop mode where one of the displays is in a teleprompter and needs to be horizontally flipped (left right flip) so that the mirrored reflection is the correct orientation.
Further, mine stopped working after 18 months (the warranty period is one year).
It lets you flip both vertically and horizantally (independently).
Sedcond, I know you said you were using Windows, but this is trivial, out of the box, behavior on Linux:
There are two hardware products that can do this: HDMI Mirror Box and the Decimator MD-HX.
It also provides a number of other useful features for using multiple monitors.
It also has a very useful USB connection and software interface where you can update the firmware and access all the settings menus.
They use this for driving teleprompt/autocue systems.
