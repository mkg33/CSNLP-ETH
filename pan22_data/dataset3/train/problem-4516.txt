2) mediate all internet access via an access control system - could be done using the authentication system above - or a standalone authentication
If you're asking these questions here - it rather suggests you may be out of your depth.
The best way to keep computers off the internet is not to provide any connection to the internet.
Moshe - you seem to have been asked to just make it all work - with no details of what "working" means nor any thought of the implications.
How can you grant 'per-user' access when you've got no server available to identify what a user is?
There is apparently some internet connectivity - which implies that you need some sort of access control.
But these days that provides no protection against viruses/malware - which have to be a very big concern on a set up like this.
3) control access to shared storage using on-upload / on-demand malware scanning
4) setup a system for network imaging of each client - e.g.
Its easy to plug-in a NAS - but how do you manage permissions - are you just planning on allowing every body to create/change/delete anything?
This could be accomadated for up to 200 clients on a single server - which also provides your network storage.
Norton Ghost - but there are open-source tools available - and regularly write back the original image to ensure the desktops are clean.
It's been a while since I set up a Microsoft based network, but Using Linux, Squid, GoSA I'd reckon on a 2xdual cpu, 4Gb ram, 5Gb/client for imaging + required network storage - say 5x500Gb drives as RAID5 - approx 1400 UKP (although if you cut a few corners should be possible for less than 1k)
