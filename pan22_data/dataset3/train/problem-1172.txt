It's not a be all end all solution to my problem, but the shares can be backed up by following the procedure on this Microsoft KnowledgeBase article.
About a year ago, I installed Windows 7 on an old laptop to use it as a file server.
A simple reboot restored my shares settings without any additional action taken, which luckily is good enough for me, since all the devices/people that need access to the shares have the capacity to restart the server.
That works great, most of the time, but sometimes all my shares (about eight of them) still vanish, forcing me to spend a good ten minutes on setting them up again.
After only a few days I noticed that with every reboot, all my shares on the USB media simply disappeared.
I therefore applied a fix–presumably a registry tweak, forgot exactly what–that seemed to resolve the issue by simply delaying the start of the Windows File and Printer Sharing service.
The laptop itself has a pretty puny hard disk, so I hooked up two 500GB external drives.
