When I start google chrome it starts multiple instances and if I shut it down the task manager displays that instances are still running.
This utility, which has the most comprehensive knowledge of auto-starting locations of any startup monitor, shows you what programs are configured to run during system bootup or login, and shows you the entries in the order Windows processes them.
There is a new tab called "Startup" which lists the tasks that get started on a reboot.
I do not know whether that is different in Windows 8, but a search in your setting for "startup" should get you there.
Some plugins such as Google Hangouts run inside a background instance of Chrome.
These programs include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys.
If I make a complete reboot and then check what is started before I run any browser, google chrome is running according to task mamanger.
I found out, under Windows 10, that I had the same problem.
You can configure Autoruns to show other locations, including Explorer shell extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, and much more.
The bug seems spefici to my user account since from another user account (also administrator account) the behavarior of google chrome is not automatically starting.
I actually tried a search in the Settings to find startup applications because I could not see any settings that would match such in the default.
Autoruns goes way beyond the MSConfig utility bundled with Windows Me and XP.
Right clicking on Chromium I could disable the awful feature.
