Try to enable showing hidden files in Windows Explorer and check what is their current size.
I'd say that a lot of that missing 10GB is in the System Volume Information folder that your screenshot shows access denied.
Try disabling System Restore and see how much space that saves you.
The System Volume Information folder is where your System Restore snapshots are saved.
TreeSize application states all my files take up 64.3 GB.
Most likely, you have hidden pagefile.sys and/or hiberfil.sys in root directory of drive C:.
Look at the properties of any file and I believe windows shows you both.
Usually, they have a size in the dimensions of your RAM, so there could be the missing 10 GB.
It seems as if that program is not event taking into account the sizes of the page- or swap-file.
I suspect explorer is listing the consumed space where as treesize is listing the file sizes.
The reason for this could be a discrepancy between the size of a file and the amount of space it actually consumes on disk because of block sizes.
You may also be losing space to the Offline Files feature, which stores information in C:\Windows\CSC -- another folder which TreeSize likely cannot see into.
