I've tried all the simple stuff like restarting my computer and unplugging the cables.
The internet comes with my apartment and I have no access to the router.
my DHCP says it is enabled and is set to find the IP automatically.
When I run ipconfig in cmd there is no IP address, as in blank, for Default Gateway.
I was using this connection on this computer last semester without any issues at all.
I've uninstalled and reinstalled my network adapter.
My PC uses ethernet for internet at home and here.
So I just moved back into my apartment at school for the new Semester.
I get the error saying "Unidentified Network No internet access".
It was working fine at home, but once I got to school it never worked.
This has been going on for a few days and I can't think of anything else to try.
When I try the troubleshoot it says "One or more network protocols are missing on this computer".
I'm on my laptop right now using the WiFi fine, but I don't know if they have separate set ups for wired and wireless internet.
