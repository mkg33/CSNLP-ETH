The students are part of the Hyper-V Administrators group and we tried using Authorization Manager, but nothing has worked to allow students to run Hyper-V Manager without being an Administrator or having an administrator use their credentials to run Hyper-V Manager with elevated permissions.
The students very specifically only need administrative privileges for client Hyper-V or for client Hyper-V not to require administrative privileges.
The scenario is that we have a domain here at the college and we are trying to use client Hyper-V on the win8 pro machines.
I've done lots of googling and the only thing I find relates to, I believe, Hyper-V server and not client Hyper-V.
The administrator walking around running Hyper-V Manager with elevated privileges is not really convenient, so what we are looking for is a way to control the ability of students to run Hyper-V Manager and load their Win2012r2 VMs and create new VMs without the administrator's credentials and without making the students administrators.
