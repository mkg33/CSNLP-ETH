It basically depends on what you want and what your budget is...
There is hardware, there is software and both have their pros and cons.
There are dozens, if not hundreds of different ways to approach this issue.
For example, you will want to allow VoIP/conferencing protocols to have full priority and trim down on file sharing (whether p2p or even ftp or http downloads/uploads).
It used to work a lot better 15 years ago when there were a lot more static web pages.
You can also think about combining several systems, like a password protected proxy (with or without quotas) and a packet shaper.
You can opt for a regular proxy or set up a transparent proxy (which I think is the better option).
There are a lot of options out there and you don't necessarily have to rely on a package that offers everything you want in 1 product.
A proxy itself will save you some bandwidth, but the savings you make are highly overrated these days.
It can do a lot more than just save you a bit of bandwidth.
Obviously you need the expertise, a person to maintain the system and an infrastructure that supports the chosen solution on top of the initial investment.
Simply google "restrict internet usage" (or similar phrases) and you'll find what you need.
But, that doesn't mean a proxy isn't a good thing to have.
You can add access restrictions, quota's, logins, and so forth and give you quite a good bit of monitoring on traffic as well.
The solution you are looking for, like I said before, greatly depends on your budget, the capabilities of your IT department and your current infrastructure.
First of all, you have your mentioned password protection to allow access, but simple software doesn't restrict what type of access, quotas, bandwidth and so forth.
A packet shaper, will for example allow you to give priorities to certain traffic and/or block other traffic (with or without timed schedules).
There are a lot of ways to restrict internet usage as well.
