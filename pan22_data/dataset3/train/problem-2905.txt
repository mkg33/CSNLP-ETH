At this point note that when you run du it won't show that file.
In your situation I'm assuming you have a collection of .dmg's, zips, or other monolithic files taking up chunks of your space.
If you'd like to see it in human readable units just use df -h or du -sh
Therefore if df or du report a total of 117209520 and your block size if 512 then:
Could it perhaps be the Mac mapping bad blocks out in your filesystem and thus them becoming "used" according to df?
I believe you are seeing this because du reports the sizes of directories under the path you're requesting.
As explained by this article du does not count things like inodes, disk maps, and super blocks since du operate in userspace.
Since this would not happen in userspace it would explain why du does not report it.
The only thing that df reports or should I say takes into account that du does not is metadata.
IE if you have any files in /Volumes/Apps it won't be adding their size to the count.
You should now see the space being used by the test.txt file.
Also as a side note and I'm sure you know already that df and du by default report block count usage, not size.
