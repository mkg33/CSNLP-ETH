Update your app's backend when the results are in.
If you are going to make an app that people can use to see which seats are free.
Why not add a feature to the app where people can "check-in" to a specific seat.
You could divide the room into clusters of seats and cover each cluster with a webcam attached to a RasPi and use motion detection to find significant changes in the picture.
One approach for the light difference could be to use two samples of the color or better maybe the hue of the seat.
In 'practical computer vision with simplecv' by Kurt Demaag et al.
It should be easy to translate this to your situation.
This is done using a camera comparing a stored image of the empty spot and compare that to a (real time) image of the same spot.
With hueDistance and an adequately chosen threshold you might be able to do the trick.
If a change was detected and there is an event going on, post the image of the cluster to Amazon Mechanical Turk and let a human decide whether the seat is occupied.
One of an empty seat in bright and one in dim circumstances.
Not sure on the average response time on Mechanical Turk, though.
If you are going to use a usb webcam you will not need this class.
I would suggest you try this idea using simplecv and then switch to the c++ api of opencv and use the camera class found with here to use the rpi cam with opencv.
you can find an example of detecting the presence of a car in a specific spot of a car park (in chapter 5).
