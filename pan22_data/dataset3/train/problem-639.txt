Adjusting the interface metric to be a larger number than the existing ethernet/wifi adapters will make it prefer the DNS servers on the local network, but NRPT rules will still work to send DNS queries for my own domain to my servers over the VPN.
After that, and in combination with the NRPT rules, DNS works as desired - all queries for example.local get sent to my AD DNS servers.
I suspect that if I could get the VPN to not list any DNS servers at all, the NRPT rules would kick in just for example.local, and everything would work properly.
But I can't find a way to make it not use the ones provided by the RRAS server.
However, there's no way to adjust the interface metric for a VPN connection in powershell, nor in VBscript, nor .NET, nor VPNv2 CSP.
If the VPN is connected the metric can be changed in powershell with the Set-NetIPInterface cmdlet, but when the VPN is not connected, it doesn't show up there at all.
And changes there will not persist across reboots.
The only way to change it seems to be editing the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\Connections\Pbk\rasphone.pbk file and changing the lines IpInterfaceMetric and Ipv6InterfaceMetric to higher numbers.
Anything else (including example.com) gets sent to the DNS servers of their local network.
