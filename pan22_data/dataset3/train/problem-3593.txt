To connect to my pis via VNC on different networks and without port forwarding I use the website: https://www.remot3.it/web/index.html
You can also follow this video once you have an account/the installer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHaY4EBQowQ
I used ssh tunnel for port forwarding and a third computer with a static IP to solve dynamic IP related problem.

Having made a free account with VNC I am now able to connect securely to my Pi from anywhere, over the internet:
I realize this post is old, but thought I might have some useful info.
Once you have one PC doing that, you could redirect one port to each pi, like yourdns.no-ip.org:9001, yourdns.no-ip.org:9002.
You can make a free account, then, in the terminal of the pi, you can run the commands:
Full disclosure: I'm actually an intern at remote.it this summer, but I thought it might be useful for you.
In my case, I had no access to the router and no static IP on both sides.
Then follow the steps in the installer and you can view and control all your devices (as long as they have a route to the internet, or even cellular) from anywhere.
Again, it is not a pi specific problem, so may be you could search for dynamic DNS name and modem port forwarding to do what you want.
But, I had access to a third-party server which I used for the connection.
There are literally many ways for doing this for which what you need are static IP address and port forwarding on the router.
If you have access to an ssh server, you can follow the procedure from this link.

Your condition may vary depending on what you have access to and on what side (client or server).
If you have dynamic IP, you have to use some tool like no-ip.org to update your ip to a domain name, like yourdns.no-ip.org.
