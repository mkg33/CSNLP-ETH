If I want to mount the volume I get the following error:
As you can see I have created a Linux LVM file system.
You can confirm that with df /dev/mapper/gegevens-Data or grep /dev/mapper/gegevens-Data /proc/mounts.
If your next question is why it is mounted: either you did it manually and forgot, or there is an entry for /dev/mapper/gegevens-Data or UUID=XsddGq-i3wO-HjTg-Lafe-TSF3-28kr-FGYhRd in /etc/fstab.
If I open the mount point I see only a few files of the LVM disk.
You may be interested in the command mount --move /some/where /data to change the point where a filesystem is mounted without having to unmount it.
Now I have the following problem the LVM file system don't mount properly.

Please paste the output of the following commands:
This are the information of the LVM Logical volume:
Actually these files are probably files that you tried to write to the LVM disk when it wasn't mounted on /data, so move them to the LVM disk before mounting it where you want it.
An application has files open under /data, which is blocking the mount operation.
