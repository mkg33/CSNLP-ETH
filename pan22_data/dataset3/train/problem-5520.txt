I hope to get this working and to avoid having to make a workaround in which a Python script is called from a PHP script...
I am trying to get the Google Cloud Translation API's PHP implementation to work on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ running Stretch and Nginx with PHP7-FPM.
I have created an account at Google and received the API key as a .json file.
Composer and Google's scripts refer to DIR so I wanted to make sure that it is at least ok. To confirm things:
According to Google's instructions here one has to set an environment variable like this (I did this in the terminal and logged in as user pi):
Also the vendor directory with all the Google scripts resides inside this directory.
If I then insert the environment variable directly into the PHP script like this:
I have also setup composer and the Google client libraries.
Now PHP can apparently find the file but still not access it.
However if I enter this same line to the end of the /etc/profile (and reboot) the Python implementation starts working but PHP still doesn't.
My PHP script is basically the same that Google has in their quick start tutorial:
In my case this does not work or make any difference.
My PHP script will not find the API key file and therefore not execute.
I believe the directory and file permissions are ok and I have even tested by making them chmod 777.
