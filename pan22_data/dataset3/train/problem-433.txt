In master.cf you create a new "ruby" configuration for the ruby script to accept mails.
But how to configure it depends on the ruby script and the related system environment.
From then the configured addresses go through ruby and the others go through the transport configured with local_transport.
This will pass mails for these persons to the ruby transport you configured in master.cf as long as you named it "ruby".
/etc/postfix/ldapvirtual.cf is LDAP configuration file to search for mail addresses.
This is done via pipe as described in http://www.postfix.org/pipe.8.html
You can probably already see some examples (with pipe in the last column) in your current master.cf.
I need this functionality since I would like to have mails passed to particular address to end up on our redmine server.
Now I would like to specify that for particular address (e.g.
someuser@domain.com) instead of delivering mail to mailbox it gets passed to script (ruby script to be more precise).
Then you need a file (for example) /etc/postfix/transport_maps with the content
I have mail server setup to use postfix and cyrus imapd + ldap for mail lookups.
