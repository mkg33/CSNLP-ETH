That might be another sign that you should have a function instead of multiple lines of calls to setw(some-constant).
(Of course, see my comment about the % operator above, and you won't have that line of code at all.)
You're trying to get cute, and use a ternary expression instead of an if statement.
you have a for loop nested inside another for loop, specifically to handle the case where your month counter rolls over.
Why don't you just reset your counter to the top, and handle the code in your main for loop?
Of course, you might not be aware of this, but the C++ % operator (modulo, or remainder-after-division) is perfect for use in this scenario.
Similarly, you have lots of places where you are fiddling with the width of your output fields.
Next, it took me a moment to realize what you were doing here:
I'd suggest that you find cases like this - where you are really drilling down to handle some very fiddly detail - and abstract them into a function whose name reflects what you are doing.
You need to study the relationship between statements and expressions in C, and learn about assignment expressions.
Next, this code doesn't do what you think it does:
You have a very non-specific loop, but a highly-detailed set of operations involving your output stream.
I'm not sure how much C++ you've learned, so I'll stick to what I'm sure you know.
(In fact, perhaps you could compute the width value?)
