Looking only at the Active Directory implications your best bet is to approach this as an Active Directory migration.
There are, in fact, a multitude of considerations.
You would use a tool, like Microsoft's Active Directory Migration Tool (ADMT) to migrate all the accounts with mailboxes out of the domain hosting the Exchange 2003 server into the domain with the Exchange 2007 servers.
Given the nature of your question it's likely that this isn't something you have a lot of experience with.
If your concern is physically re-using the Exchange 2003 machine then you're going to need to perform a multi-step migration wherein you move the mailboxes to a "surrogate" machine at some point so you can free-up the physical computer running Exchange 2003 and rebuild it as an Exchange Server in the domain hosting the Exchange 2007 server.
