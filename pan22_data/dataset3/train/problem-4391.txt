Any of the following three workarounds seems to work:
I have just gotten the my Silo SL-42v1 to claim to be displaying 3840x2160 @ 60Hz (when I use the remote control to check).
I have not observed it with a couple of other 4k displays that I have access to and with which I have used the same or similar platforms.
Perhaps I will update this answer when I have more time for further research.
I think I may have gotten a similar failure when using a long video cable with HDMI port 4, but I am not sure, and I do not want to disturb my 4k @ 60Hz configuration tonight now that I finally have it working.
In case anyone is using the Silo SL42v1 display with Linux and Intel Graphics video hardware built into the mainboard (i915.ko Linux kernel module, xf86-video-intel X windows driver), I want to mention a workaround for an important problem.
Using HDMI ports 2 and 3 resulted in the Roku offering 1920x1080 when it auto-detected the resolution, and then refusing to transmit 4k to an HDMI port that did not support HDCP 2.2 when I attempted to manually select 4k video.
After the X Windows server activates the idle hardware screen blanker, and I then use the mouse or keyboard to cause X to reactivate the screen, the video becomes jittery and the screen often goes blank for a second about once a minute.
I assume that something in the HDMI connection has not be renegotiated properly.
I did this by connecting a Roku 4 (which claims to support HDMI 2.0 4k @ 60Hz) to HDMI port 4 on my display, using an HDMI cable that is only about 1 meter long.
I do not know what is special about the Silo SL-42v1 that triggers this problem.
