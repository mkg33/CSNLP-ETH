You could use a smart switch of some sort, but then you will still use the software within that switch.
The device should have one ethernet input and one ethernet output.
The device should just be a throughput of the signal.
I know this can be done using the router software but this is not an option for me.
May I ask why using the router software is not an option?
I want to connect a device between the internet aerial and the router.
There is nothing stopping you from putting a router between the ISP supplied router and the rest of your network.
I want to be able to view the data usage on the device for set time periods, e.g.
aerial >> ethernet cable >> device >> ethernet cable >> router >> laptops, mobiles, PCs
I want to measure the data usage through my router.
It sure seems to be the easiest way to measure this.
Most home routers support some sort of rudimentary traffic meter.
You would then be able to use the new router to meter your traffic as long as it was the only thing plugged into the old router.
