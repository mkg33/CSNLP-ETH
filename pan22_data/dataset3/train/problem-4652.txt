It will install nearly 98% of missing drivers: see instructions here : "Solution: Find, Install Windows XP Drivers Easily"
You can download compressed drivers from driverpacks.net and create a driver cd for installation.
On the other hand, wireless/update/management software by Lenovo is not so good, I always skip it.
As a ThinkPad user, I'd recommend installing all drivers provided by Lenovo.
See the MS support article on troubleshooting unknown devices.
Maybe a third party app like devicedoctor or drivermax can help you?
what you need to do is find the hardware ID of the device (should be in the properties of the unknown devices) with this you can post it here or do a search with JUST that information in Google and it should point to which device it is.
One example is ActiveProtection, another are the 3 TrackPoint buttons on some models.
Even though the default XP drivers may work, some functionality only works with Lenovo drivers.
Neither would show up as Unknown Device, but the functionality would be missing without Lenovo drivers.
