I run a little server environment with some clients (workstations and notebooks).
Using static ip addressing doesn't give you a better or simpler view and it doesn't make managing your clients any easier.
When clients move to another DHCP enabled network they'll get the correct ip addressing they need, including the DNS servers and router.
I am still green in network administration, is there a better workaround for a situation like this?
So he needed to set those settings to automatic ip with administration rights.
I gave all devices a static ip to have a better and simpler overview.
Obviously he couldn't connect to the internet because of the static ip settings.
I think when I set automatic ips on every client I still need to set gateway to router so it must be changed again when going outside.
Everything is working fine so far, clients are in my domain, primary dns is server and alternative is router, standard gateway targets the router ip.
Now I had the case that someone took a notebook and wanted to work from outside the building.
