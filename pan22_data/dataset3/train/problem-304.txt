If a RAID card is present, evidence of it should show up in one (or both) of those places.
So I am pretty sure that it's supposed to use RAID.
It's likely that your server is using some sort of hardware RAID card, not software RAID.
If the server uses hardware RAID, you can usually find the management screen during BIOS bootup.
I am out of means to find out if my server is using RAID or not.
After a reboot, enter Control - R when prompted and you will be able to get into the RAID BIOS and confirm the config.
I believe that will be connected to a Dell PERC card if using a Dell supplied config.
When using hardware RAID, the card itself takes care of all RAID tasks, and presents a single volume to the operating system.
Watch for a message telling you to press a particular key combo to enter the utility.
Also, if you have a supported OS (Red Hat or SUSE Enterprise Linux, VMWare ESX), you can install OMSA to see the hardware configuration, the files to install it can be found in support.dell.com.
This array, the Dell PowerVault MD1000 is normally connected to a PERC 5E/6E or H800 card, as Robin says you can see the configuration of the RAID controller pressing CTRL + R during the post.
If you have Ubuntu or Debian you can install the community version of OMSA, check this link http://dell.to/wcN71S for more info about OMSA.
