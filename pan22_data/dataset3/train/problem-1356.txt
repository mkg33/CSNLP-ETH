Although it's a cosmetic issue, the laptop is going to be used for customer presentations and so the sales person is rightly concerned about the image this portrays.
I presume there may be something floating around the registry or in a file somewhere but I can't find it.
Well, problem solved: it seems there was another installed instance of Office 2007 helpfully called '2007 Microsoft Office System' so it sat at the top of the list of software in the Control Panel rather than among the entries for "Microsoft...." applications.
I have just removed the demo copy of Office 2007 preinstalled on a new laptop and replaced it with an install of the full professional edition downloaded from the MS Volume Licensing site and installed one of our volume licence keys, yet the apps (Word etc.)
show "Non Commercial Use" in the title bar, which is what usually happens in the Home and Student edition.
Articles I have found elsewhere just refer to the message being related to the use of a Home and Student licence key, which is 100% not the case.
Once this was removed and Office 2007 'proper' removed and reinstalled (again) the problem went away.
