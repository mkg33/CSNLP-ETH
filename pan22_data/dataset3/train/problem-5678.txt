Some by the domain, others could be by individual mail within domain... the list goes on.
Others are limited to number or recipients per email.
For example, I wrote my own called AMEmailer (which is not live for download so don't look for it) but it allowed the user to specify during what parts of the day to send emails and how many to send every 10 minutes.
There is no way to answer this properly, but to answer your actual question, it varies too much.
Remember, if you abuse the system, your IP may be black listed, then your company can no longer email to anyone on that server/domain etc.
If you need more resources, get another server, or pay a third party because if you do, then they take that risk (typically).
I ran this via my own mail server which had no limitations, but I still limited it to 10 emails every 10 minutes (therefore 1 email per minute) and never had an issue with being blocked or overloading the server with so much traffic it hangs.
Other answers say some figures such as 250-500 a day and it is dangerous to follow this (although it's certainly not inaccurate in any way).
Again, to re-iterate it, let your news letter take an extra day/week or month to send and don't risk it.
Some allow up to 1000 a day or more, some much less, and some are limited to the hour!
