You should be able to set write permission to just the file.
Trying to lock down one file in a folder is a path to madness.
For example some apps will create temporary files in the same directory as the file (word) or will delete and recreate the file when saving (some mathematical applications, among others).
In the case of the delete and recreate this is very problematic as the newly created file will inherit the permissions from the folder, erasing whatever permissions changes were previously made.
If you're receiving an error, you're doing it wrong.
The other thing associated with only granting access to a single file is that it can cause some serious application headaches.
I would suggest a folder or sub folder from that you want kept read only.
You are correct - you're much better off moving that file to a separate folder that has read/write access for all users.
If you want clarification about what exactly you're doing wrong, you should edit your question to include what ACEs you're granting to what group in the ACL for that file as well as the error message that you receive.
