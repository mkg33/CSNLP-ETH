For those directories that contain the same songs with both extensions, how can I use Windows 7 and/or a batch file command to search through my entire music directory (and respective sub directories) and delete only those m4a files where the same song file exists in the mp3 file format in the same music library folder as well?
I have a blended music library with both “mp3” files and “m4a” files.
My music library contains about 75,000 songs if I ignore the duplicate m4a files of the same song that may exist in the same music folder(s) of various albums.
If you ultimately decide to do this manually, there are a lot of freeware "dupe" file finders, but those are slow and hard to use in my opinion.
I prefer to do it manually using a freeware program called "Everything", a file indexer that uses your system's MFT:
a “batch file”) that will do it for you in case you don’t want to download a program from somewhere:
What operation or command can I use to safely scan my music library and remove extraneous “m4a” song files where the preferred “mp3” files already exist?...While  KEEPING those m4a files where NO same song mp3 files already exist?
I also need step by step instructions on how to setup and start any batch files that achieves the stated goal above.
I am aware this is not an automated solution but I prefer to do things manually, so I can use the extra time to also prune my music collection of unwanted songs anyway.
However, right now, with no regard to specific file extension types, my directory appears to have over 100,000 songs (where obviously 25,000 of these songs are duplicates that account for these aforementioned file formats of the same song(s) coexisting in their given respective music album folder and/or music sub directory(ies)).
Many of the music directories and specific album sub directories actually include what appears to duplicate music song files differing only by the file extension of both mp3 and m4a files.
