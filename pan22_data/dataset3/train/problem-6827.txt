A sprint lasts a week with Scrum standup at the end of the week, where students report progress.
I'm adding information about a particular CS course for high schools that does include Agile.
Students aim to knock out two sprint tasks per session, and a sprint lasts a week.
The Project Lead The Way curriculum for AP CS Principles has students divide their work on a project into a prioritized backlog and divide the top backlog item into a sprint task list where each item on the list can be accomplished in a small amount of time.
That's not really what is supposed to happen in a standup, but it works in the classroom.
Students are exposed to the lingo with a "Scrum in 10 minutes" video.
After they've done it for a few projects, Scrum poker is added in one activity because some teachers and students find the mechanics fun and lets the class talk about the importance and difficulty (especially for beginners) of estimating how long something will take.
For some teachers, once or more during the year, pairs create the problem they intend to solve and then swap with another pair and solve someone else's problem.
This provides a client, albeit without engaging the community.
