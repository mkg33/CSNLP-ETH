Look up the meta/alternate data on the file if you have utilities to do so, or view it under a different use to see what happened.
when booting or formatting via a usb drive too we need to format it in the NTFS type.
It sounds like its IS copying the file to the local c: drive under the user, then 'referencing' the changes you make there.
Once the file has been copied, it only writes changes you make causing it to be fast, and you're only seeing the virtual effects of moving it after that.
If one of those two solves your problem at least you will know what was causing it:
Size matters when the file is being indexed by windows.
have you tried emptying your HDD and re-formatting it in FAT32 format ?
Disable Thumbnail Preview then clear the thumbnail cache.
Run unlocker against the file to see if there are any processes that need it to stay where it is until they are done.
See if anything pops up under Disk Activity and go from there.
To rule out an application causing this, try running resource monitor while your file is being moved (or copied or whatever).
Try defragment(smart defragment) it, or else try using Teracopy.
If the file is NOT being locked by any process: are those files newly created?
If it was the thumbnail cache, clearing the cache AFAIK is all that you can do this time.
If it was indexing, rebuilding the index might help.
