The short of it is that active directory queries are sent to active directory servers, while local authentication is handled using the SAM in the registry.
This sounds a little bit like a homework question...is it?
If you want to switch methods, you'd authenticate as \localmachinename\username instead of \activedirectory\username right at the opening login prompt when you turn on the machine (some versions of windows let you change the "method" in a third box, under username and password, where it lists domains available or the local computer name (this computer).
If you have more than a couple Windows computers, AD can be very helpful and almost necessary for running the IT infrastructure.
Is there a particular issue that these questions are aimed at solving that the community could possibly help with that you're driving at?
AD centralizes the management of the accounts and centralizes passwords and user management.
One is local to that computer only, one is providing a way for you to have an account valid on any machine that is a member of the domain.
As Bart mentioned this is volumes of information (literally) eg (locating a domain controller in DNS etc.)
The detailed information you are looking for is in the server 2008 resource kits.
I'm not sure what exactly you're looking for on how AD vs. local machine authentication works, but you can switch between the two.
