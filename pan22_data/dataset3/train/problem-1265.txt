That daemon process, owned by user 'joe', would authenticate to Active Directory as joseph@EXAMPLEDOMAIN.COM.
I suspect there's going to be some Kerberos 'magic' involved but I haven't gotten anything to work yet.
(For non-interactive operation you might use kstart to properly automate this.)
Via Samba I have joined a CentOS workstation to an Active Directory domain.
Let's say for example, a daemon process is started via an init script or systemd.
There's much less magic than on Windows â€“ the Kerberos tickets you have are actually completely unrelated to your system account.
What I would like to do however is run a process on the CentOS workstation as a specific, non-root user, and for that user to authenticate to Active Directory in order to access files in a share.
This means you can just run kinit joseph@EXAMPLEDOMAIN.COM, enter your AD credentials, and be "logged in" as far as smbclient and other Kerberos-aware programs are concerned.
And, then the process would connect to a Windows share to copy files.
I can log in as an Active Directory user on the CentOS workstation.
Googling for how to do something like this is challenging as most references talk about how to authenticate an Active Directory user on a Linux workstation.
