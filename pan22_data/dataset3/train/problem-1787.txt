Apparently there is no equivalent of nsswitch.conf in OSX.
In 10.5 it's under Sys Prefs -> Sharing -> File Sharing -> Options
That will then activate Samba on the Mac, and lets it query NetBIOS names directly.
With the sharing on, most Windows operations seems to work easier.
Windows name-resolution problems like this tend to be the result of the machines not being in the same workgroup.
On my mac, I can ping some home windows by name (If I use the full name such as stallion-main.local), but other machines, I can't.
It's a PITB when I try to RDP from my mac into my windows machine; as I have to log into my router to determine the ip address of windows machines that I can't resolve their name.
It seems to configure WINS correctly, automatically, although irritatingly hidden.
<10.5 it's Sys Prefs -> Sharing -> Windows File Sharing
If all of your machines are in the same workgroup they should be able to browse and talk to each other.
My machines get dynamic ips from DHCP, so I can't edit the hosts file on the mac, or rather I want to avoid that solution.
I'm running a mixed environment at home and at work.
Without control of your local DNS environment, this is probably the easiest way to make it work.
as Brent mentioned, in Ubuntu you would install winbind and add "wins" to that conf file.

I'm not sure why some names resolve, while others do not.
Im running Yosemite and I can use the 'smbutil' command to do WINS lookups
My server machines are Win Vista, and I have a Unibody Macbook Pro running 10.5.7
