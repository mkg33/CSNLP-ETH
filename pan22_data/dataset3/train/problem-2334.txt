Ideally the communication should be encrypted using some form of pre-shared secret but of course the very sharing of that secret presents problems.
However, you should consider that it's fairly common that people get email and IMs on their phones, so the communication may not be as separated as you might think.
When I need to send a password to someone, I usually send all the info except the password (i.e.

server and user) through a certain channel (email, IM, etc.)
The intended recipient may need to repeat the request if they don't get the message.
This used to be quite common practice but as far as I can tell is not used much these days, although I can't understand why not.
Might want to consider some form of 2-factor auth.
and the password itself (with no explanation of what it's for) by text message.
However, as you obviously already suspect, it's far from ideal.
The identity validation replies earlier totally make sense and are valid concerns.
It isn't as easy to "detect" in case of rootkits/malware you may be trying to avoid.
Another option I do sometimes is taking a picture of a written password, can use MMS or anything else.
I think you might be surprised at just how common this practice is and realistically it's quite acceptable for a lot of cases.
Considering that a request might be initiated from the phone as well, it's not all that secure.
