This is murder to find in a lab or development environment, which is why I always try to insist on separating the two physically and with a firewall.
Less frequently it is a spanning-tree storm, and less frequently than that is an actually broken network device.
The next most frequent issue is some kind of viral activity.
I've never seen that and I'm wondering how exactly you determined that, are they actually ICMP echo request packets going to multicast addresses?.
Maybe even post a line or two of the capture showing the packets you're referring to.
Can you give us more detail on what exactly you're seeing in the capture?
9 times in 10 when I see something like that, it is a loop somewhere.
If spanning-tree isn't enabled you might look into that; some HP switches even have loop-protect features that will shut down a port if they detect a loop on that port.
You also stated that the ping requests appear to be coming from your switches, but then you go on to say that the source MAC addresses are not from your switches so I'm confused as to what you're actually seeing.
Loops have always been the low-hanging fruit for me.
check for the default advertisement timings for your routing protocols.
You say that you have ping requests going to multicast addresses?
and what spanning tree setup are you using on these hp switches?
If it is infrequent, someone is plugging something in, then getting baffled why it isn't working, then unplugging it again.
