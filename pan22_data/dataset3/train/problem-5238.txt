It's also possible (though very unlikely) that you had two bad network cards.
Anyway, I'm glad that I'd discovered the relevant explanations with sources above.
Try one of those methods, if they don't work let me know.
1. it may be you're version of windows/mac (OLD/OUTDATED).
With this approach each OS may be able to use it's own drivers without the issue.
Dual boot by itself doesn't or very unlikely to damage the hardware, but it can lead to certain hardware i.e.
In another case, Windows is said to have disabled the wireless card when power off, causing Wi-Fi to be unavailable to Linux on a dual boot machine, according to this forum thread quoted below.
How unlucky of me back then, because these findings are dated late-2012 or newer; I'd migrated to Linux several years earlier than dated.
Dual boot might not be the problem by itself, but could be a trigger to known issues.
wireless adapter to be disabled and inaccessible to another system i.e.
Make sure you're drivers and pc/mac is up to date.
Start with Windows and add Ubuntu using a standard install disk.
In one case, it is possible that dual boot could reveal a bug for existing driver of certain hardware, according to this Debian Wiki quoted below.
Moreover, those laptops with damaged or disabled wireless adapter have been discarded since then, so I can't test the workarounds either.
I dual booted for a couple of year with Ubuntu at versions 11 through 12 and never experienced any hardware issues.
There are known issues when dual boot Windows and Linux on some machines.
This might help avoid the bricking issue (should it still exist).
