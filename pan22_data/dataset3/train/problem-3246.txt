I suppose you could stand up a dedicated print server computer to host the queues for each  "area" and use firewall rules to limit the cleint computers computers that can communicate with the file and print sharing service (the "Server" service) on each machine.
There isn't any native functionality in the product I can think of that will do what you want.
As such, OU "membership" can't be used in security decisions anyway.
Assuming the printers you're talking about are exposed to users as Windows print queues then, no, there isn't functionality in the product to do what you're talking about.
Dynamic Access Control (DAC) is the first object permission system in Windows that allows the client computer to be taken into account in the access control decision, but DAC doesn't apply to print queues.
OUs aren't Seucurity Principals because they don't have Security Identifiers (SIDs).
You'd pretty well have to bolt-on something third-party to make this happen (and even then I'm not coming up with good ideas).
