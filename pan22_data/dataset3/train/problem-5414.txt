If you need help with the more specific instructions, feel free to leave a comment and I'll go into more detail.

Enable and/or unlock Administrator account in Windows
How can I have an administrator account so that I can take ownership and access the data I lost when I disconnected to the windows 2008 r2 domain?
Take your time and read the prompts (there are several), and you'll get your Admin account back.

The latest release is 05/11/2011, but I can verify it works on current software.
My advice would be booting the machine using the bootable ERD65 LiveCD, which take ownership of the local administrators' profile, then enable the administrators account.
So if you don't have access to a friends computer, you're stuck going the live CD route.
It's usage for Ubuntu is detailed here, but it can be installed on other distributions too.

In order to make a USB disk mountable, you'll need Administrator access.

I disconnect my windows 7 computer from the domain and now I all I have is a STANDARD user account(no administrator local account).
If the normal option of booting to safe mode doesn't give you access to the administrator account, or if you don't know the password, then linux is your answer.
In short, you might still need a friends computer.
Once you've created the CD or USB disk and have booted from it, you just have to follow the on-screen instructions to get through it.
To avoid a long download and complex setup, I recommend the chntpw-specific USB or CD image (~3MB) of the Offline Windows Password & Registry Editor by Petter N. Hagen.
I created 2 dummy accounts on Windows Server 2012 (essentially Windows 8, just server-fied), and I was able to successfully blank the passwords on them both as well as enable the one I'd deliberately disabled.
From there, you can flag your other account as an administrator through the control panel.
It's a linux program designed specifically for enabling and unlocking accounts on Windows.
Boot the system into safemode (Hold F8 before the Windows logo appears) and select the Administrator account (I don't think it should have a password).
In addition, many user accounts are blocked from burning CD's by default and either need permissions enabled for it or require a program that was installed prior to losing the Admin account.
When I tried to access that particular USER folder using this standard account I got a message that I need an "administrator account privilege".
