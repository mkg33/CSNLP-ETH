I used an application called "usbtreeview" to look at my usb drives.
Instead of restarting, I tested the usb device and it now worked as it was supposed to.
If the device is running at 3.0 speeds it will have a little "S" next to it for "Super Speed".
From there I chose it to search automatically and when it finished, it asked me to restart.
In my case the fix was to update my "USB Enhanced Host Controller".
I did this by opening the "Device Manager", right clicking one of the listings for my host controller, and then in the "Driver" tab I clicked "Update".
It showed that the usb 3.0 thumb drive was plugged into the usb 3.0 port but was running at 2.0 speeds.
Note that there were two USB Host Controllers on my device.
It's a Fresco Logic FL1000 series, but there were no updates available for it.
This is an Asus U46E laptop that was updated from windows 7 to windows 10.
Also note that the actual USB 3.0 Controller is different.
The one I chose was called "Intel(R) 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller - 1C26".
From what I understand, it is actually the Host Controllers job to decide whether a usb device is recognized as USB 3.0.
But after it worked to fix the problem I had, I decided to go ahead and update the second one using the same method.
If it's running at 2.0 speeds it will have a little "H" next to it for "High Speed".
