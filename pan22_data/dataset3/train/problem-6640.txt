Here are some common sense guidelines when disclosing vulnerabilities to stay out of trouble:
Your well-intentioned disclosure will likely be seen as hacking and they'll have no qualms about releasing their legal team on you.
On the other hand, if the company is newish, if it's seen as understanding things like social media well, and are generally supportive and open with their customers, then yes, go for it.
You are primarily interested in the "discovery" and "notification" steps I believe.
However, if they interpret it as an extortion attempt or you go out of your way to shame them they might decide to bring in the legal team to deal with you.
For a more formal set of guidelines you can have a look at CCSS Forum and the OIS Guidelines for Security Vulnerability Reporting and Response.
Does said company have a large legal team or has it been around for, say, more than 15 years?
No sane company is going to cause you problem you for reporting a vulnerability in private.
Letting the legal hounds of hell lose costs a lot of money.
