I'm doing a 2D platformer but I don't know how they are usually built.
You can build your own level with it, and then load the output file (a XML) into your application (generally Tiled compacts everything with gzip and then converts to base64, but there are libraries to load that).
This page covers several approaches as to how one might implement 2d platformers with both basic and some more advanced mechanics.
It doesn't give you straight up code but it does a fantastic job at explaining the techniques so that you should be able to code it without too much trouble.
I would buy the Level UP book: http://www.amazon.com/Level-Up-Guide-Great-Design/dp/047068867X/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top
This is the only one with a broken spine & dog eared pages currently on my shelf.

I'm going to share a link with you that someone else had shared with me:
Then some physics to add gravity to pull the player down if airborn, and just scroll the map horizontally and check for collisions.
Try using Tiled, which is a great free map editor.
The approach I'm looking at is making it tilebased, with ground tiles on bottom row, then platforms on some places in "mid-air" within the array.
Also read the author's blog for awesome ideas, particularly his Platformer Primer: http://mrbossdesign.blogspot.ca/2008/10/platformer-primer.html
