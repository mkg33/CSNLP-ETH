I have install java through yum on CentOS, however another java programme needs to know what the JAVA_HOME environmental variable is.
Running this command will display the path no matter what version you are running, from command line.
Then, you might want to set your $PATH environment variable to include the bin directory as well:
re: Centos7, refer to the /etc/java/java.conf file.
If the JDK (Development kit) is installed, ypu probably want it to point to that, else use the JRE path (Java Runtime Environment).
I found the package manager can place in a variety of locations, so using which (you will need to explicitly install this if using a container) the following is a little less brittle
If you are using tomcat, you might also need to set CATALINA_HOME for the tomcat user.
Thats weird, the whole point of having a JAVE_HOME environmental variable is so you don't have to specify the path to each program, it can get this path by looking for this variable.
Either way, the correct way to find the environmental variable for JAVA_HOME is to use echo:
For a particular user you can put it in the users ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile files.
my env doesn't have JAVA_HOME set by default, therefore I set it in .bash_profile
i checked, it is the correct version of the jdk I loaded via yum, and so...
java is installed in /usr/bin/java, it can't be there!
I know all about setting environmental variables, but what do I set it to?
You want to set JAVA_HOME to be the root location of the JDK or JRE, for example:
I found out what it was by doing update-alternatives --display java and it showed me the directory /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.6.0-openjdk.x86_64/bin/java
To set this for the system you want to edit your /etc/profile or add a .sh file in /etc/profile.d folder.
in it JAVA_HOME is indicated to be located in the following dir : /usr/lib/jvm/java
