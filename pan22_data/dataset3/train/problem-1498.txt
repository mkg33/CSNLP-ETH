Obviously, user should not be given 'root' access under any circumstances.
Primitive, yet surprisingly effective, which is why they are still being used for many security situations.
As has already been pointed out (almost) anyone can pick locks.
You can use trusted GRUB with encrypted partition for your program.
I've previously been tasked with sourcing tamper evident seals and have not found anything I could recommend.
In all cases the adhesive could be softened, usually with either turpentine or kerosine, the label removed and later reapplied.
Done carefully you would never be able to tell the seal had been removed.
Also, preferably make it not in their best interest to try and grab the source.
make the warranty expire if they open the box or run the code somewhere else.
If you machine has TPM then you can have ultimate protection.
I prefer the old fashioned type consisting of wire and a crimped lead seal.
Set up agreements that clearly stipulate what they cannot do, and what they must do to protect your code.
There have already been some really good ideas posted by others, so Ill just build on the physical security.
I realize you were asking for technical solutions, but in my experience the layer 8 and 9 are just as important and often more effective.
This will give you protection even if hard drive is physically removed and connected to another host - the OS cannot be booted from it and encrypted partition cannot be read.
