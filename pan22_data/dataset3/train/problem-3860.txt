I am starting a project with my old computer, planning to make it into an economic multifunction server, but I am new to networking, servers, virtualization and firewall-Antivirus-Anti-spam software.
I am planning to use Untangle lite version to act as a firewall, antivirus, antispam, etc, to protect my LAN and remove the AV and AS software on my other computers in order to improve performance.
Secondly, it will act as a backup storage server, doing regular backups of many devices on my LAN.
The server would then be connected to the router on the network slot of the motherboard, isolated from the network card, where the packets are getting filtered by the VM.
I'll have an additional network card with two (or more) slots, with one slot connected to the modem, and another to the router.
My question is: is it possible to dedicate the network card to the VM, in order to isolate entering packets from the main server OS, and the server data?
As a gateway firewall need to be operating on a standalone OS (correct me if I am wrong), I was thinking of virtualizing Untangle with VMware player, which will run on the main OS of the server, filtering packets as they arrive from the router and delivering clean packets to the LAN.
The first role that it will play will be a gateway between my modem and my router.
