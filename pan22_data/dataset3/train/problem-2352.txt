As far as I know and tested (only WOL), the computer does not need to be in "standby", can be also shut down completely, but still powered (for example, a Windows PC, can be Shut Down/Turn Off and will wake-up from the "magic packet" of WLAN).
So if I would be to guesstimate the WOW part of it, I would summarize as this:
Also what I've come across was that it DEPENDS on the WOL implementation in the device you're trying to wake, because I had some that will only wake if they where previously started then shut down and never let without power, and had some (fewer) others that did not need to had this routine before, so once plugged in to the power, not need to start it manually, the WOL worked just fine.
As of WOW, I have no experience at all and can't comment, other than if I think it through, I believe a Wireless Network Adapter needs WAY more power to have the antenna up&running catching signals, than the wired adapter that need just the stand-by power (five volts?!?
Again, those were fewer in number, and usually very good brands (example Apple, HP, can't recall just now what models were the devices exactly).
