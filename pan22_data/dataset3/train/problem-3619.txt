Prior to setting up my own server, I relayed via my ISPs servers, again with no penalty.
A bigger problem may be that some systems will simply reject the messages, unless each customer adds an appropriate entry into their SPF record.
It will certainly increase the spam score, although by how much will depend on each filter technique and implementation.
Without that your system may not be recognised as authorised to send messages for that domain.
To 99% of recipients, the email appears to come from your customer, but you get to handle bounces however you please, and avoid falling foul of SPF and similar checks.
Why not set the envelope sender address to an address you control (customername-invoice-bounces@yourdomain, if you like), and just set the From: line in the headers to the customer's intended sending address?
If your email server is set up correctly, there should be little if any penalty.
Sender addresses frequently are different from the sending domain.
If you do not send Emails to Invalid addresses or people who do not want the emails, it is very unlikely that your emails will be considered SPAM.
I relay a domain which does not have its own servers with no penalty.
I have only had to manualy whitelist incorrectly configured severs.
Alternatively, you could arrange to relay via the clients server.
