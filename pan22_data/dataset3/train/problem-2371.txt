Once you have re-installed iTunes drag-and-drop the .OPML file on to iTunes to re-subscribe to all your podcasts.

My version is shorter, but here's a different write on it that I found...
The only negative is that it doesn't save your unlistened shows.
If so, when you reinstall iTunes you will be fine.
Backup your itunes music folder, and restore it once you have re-installed.
Make sure to select the podcast section in iTunes, then File | Export.
I would like to not loose all of my selections in iTunes for podcasts that I have subscribed to.
If they are not associated with your iTunes account (and only stored locally as I suspect), your best bet would be to copy down the names of the podcasts, and when you reinstall iTunes, re-subscribe to the pertinent podcasts.
In the save window choose "Podcast Subscription files" as the file type.
Right-click on Podcasts in the Library and select Export...
Save the file where ever you want it saved, but make sure to change the file type to OPML.
After the rebuild, you can import the OPML file and all of you subscriptions return.
This will save all your subscriptions in an .OPML file which is the standard for a collection of RSS feeds.
Are subscriptions associated with your iTunes account?
