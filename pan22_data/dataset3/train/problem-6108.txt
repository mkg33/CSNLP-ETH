I fully cleaned it using MalwareBytes AntiMalware, Anti-Rootkit, ADWCleaner and RogueKiller, so I know it's clean.
I did a system restore to about 1 week ago and the problem was gone.
If you were infected by 'some' malwares and by a rootkit, it's highly recommended you format your machine and reinstall Windows.
This issue deactivated my mapped network drives and I can't reactivate them or add newer ones because if the issue mentioned above.
Start up your machine in Safe Mode (F8 key during boot up), and back up your data.
It could have removed key components, or who knows what so my suggestion is probably what you don't want to hear but possibly reinstalling windows or doing a windows repair option might be a good way to go.
My PC was infected by a rootkit virus along with some malwares.
I've checked a few things in the local group policies, sharing and advanced sharing, security settings but couldn't fix the issue.
Since the infection (yesterday) I can't access local PCs on the network.
Also, I can access the now-clean computer from other computers.
