The -d option supports installing multiple packages if they're stored in the directory tree format.
And if this is on Solaris you'll probably have to tweak the location of sh.
pkgadd -d /path/to/directory all should do what you want.
This would create a directory /var/tmp/pkgs/FOObar, containing the files and subdirectories that make up the package.
Solaris packages can be stored as a single file, or as a directory tree of files.
You could unpack all of your packages into the same place, then run:
I haven't tried this, but the pkgadd -s option claims to unpack packages to /var/spool/pkg, and pkgadd without -d looks for packages in that directory.
Right now it won't handle spaces of control characters in filenames gracefully.
This should get you started-you'll want to pretty it up and extend it if you're actually going to use it.
However, if some of the packages depend on others, instead of all you'll need to list them in the order they should be installed.
Don't really want to go through several dozen files and manually invoke pkgadd for them.
Is there a way to automate this process or call pkgadd to have it install everything in the directory?
