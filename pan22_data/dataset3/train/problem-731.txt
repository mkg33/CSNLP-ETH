In addition to the mathematical approaches, you could do this with string functions.
This just takes the leftmost digit, appends a decimal point after it, appends the rest of the number, and then turns the string back into a number.
You can use this formula to shift all the numbers:
Orrr... type 100 in a cell or 1000 or whatever factor you would like to divide by - copy it and then use paste special>Divide on all the relevant cells.
If you need to replace the original values, use copy, paste special values to replace the original numbers, after which you can delete the extra column.
If you prefer not to have a new column and you have all the numbers having the same number of digits (e.g.
Voila no formulas, no questions asked, easy peasy.
so for example: you have a data set that always consists of 4 numbers, in my case we always tally pipe in the field and its almost always XX.XX long (40'-50'per joint).
You don't indicate whether all of the cells have the same number of digits.
between 10'000 and 99'999) then just type the divisor (10000 in this example) in a cell, press CTRL+C on this cell then select all your numbers and go to Home - Paste - Paste Special - Divide.
To do this I go to FILE-OPTIONS-ADVANCED- check the box that says "AUTOMATICALLY INSERT A DECIMAL POINT"- set how many places you want it to placed at.
If not, I suspect you would need an additional column, at least temporarily.
