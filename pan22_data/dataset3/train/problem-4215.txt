As you can imagine, having to double click to enter almost every cell to edit it is a drag.
And it's frustrating that if you are even slightly near the top/bottom of the cell, you end up at the top/bottom of the worksheet!
Is there a way of telling Excel to stay in 'edit mode', so that when I click on a cell (or better yet, scroll down to it), it automatically allows me to edit the content?
check box should be unchecked in order to see the content of the box and edit it as you need it.
what it does is while it is active you can single click your middle mouse button and it will send a double left click to your computer.
I have a list of about 10,000 name/addresses that I have to manually cleanse in Excel (fun!).
select the entire column, and use find and replace.
I can't just start typing, as that overwrite the whole cell, when often times I just need to edit 1 or 2 characters.
If you know the edits you want to perform, the find/replace (Ctrl + F) is also very useful and may save you a lot of time.
Additionally, you can find a list of over 200 excel keyboard shortcuts here.
Check the parameters of format cell...if the cell has a check mark on hidden on the protection tab, it wont give you the option to edit on the written text of the cell.
A possible answer would be a program called "Middle Mouse Button (or Wheel) to Doubleclick" it is available on codeproject I do not know if I should post links here but I'm sure google can be your friend.
just put an empty space  on both find and replace then it will update- like this you can fool excel and it works
Pressing "F2" is possibly the best choice, though it won't remain in edit mode.
