By now it should be apparent why people recommend using a live CD.
If you can install it then go for this, sudo apt-get install gparted or download it as .deb file and then sudo dpkg -i file.deb
Again, it is critical that the new partition starts at the same block as the old.
However, once the partition is resized (and the system rebooted, if necessary), it's a simple matter of running resize2fs on the file system, and you can do this even when it's mounted as the root partition.
After i wrote Linux Mint LiveCD image to my 16GB flash, the drive's partition shrunk to  14.9GB.
It's indeed much more convenient to work from GUI tool (it is simple even for beginners) like [gparted](www.gpated.org].
You could do it right now on your machine by fdisk but check this example out and believe me, you first want gpared:
Formatting doesn't help and although Disk management shows that partition doesn't take the whole space it still doesn't allow me to delete or resize it (those options are greyed out).
Also you can do your partitioning stuff from another Live CD like Ubuntu or even from Gparted Live CD.
Be prepared to lose all your data at the slightest typo.
