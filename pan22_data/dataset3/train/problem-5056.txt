At school we had some lessons in network infrastructure.
One of the exercises was looking up the current ARP table with arp -a.
This is all from memory and I hardly know anything about PPP (or any of its variants like PPPoE), but this is why I think the answer is no.
Everyone needed to use the school's virtual machine environment to do certain exercises, but of course since 60 people are using it at once, it's slow and annoying.
This worked fine on all our laptops (Windows, Mac and Linux), but the VPS had issues.
It seems that when using a point-to-point protocol, you don't need a MAC address, but you can access the Internet (IP layer goes on top of PPP).
A few of us ran it on their own laptops or had a VPS and used that instead.
The IP protocol was used on top of PPP instead of on top of Ethernet.
We called the teacher and to our surprise, he had an answer: Because the VPS connected over a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), it didn't need an arp table because it didn't use ethernet at all.
I think the answer is no, it's not compulsory, but I'm not sure.
