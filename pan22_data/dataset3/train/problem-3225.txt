Save this as js file (myjob.js) and add this to your task scheduler:
I was having this problem with powershell scheduled tasks (that I was deploying through GPO).
This stays visible until the task completes, and then disappears.
Every hour, the task runs, but it shows the black command window, in which my .NET Console app is running.
If those are deal breakers for you, the ultimate solution is to create JS script file like the one below, that will run your command in hidden window, wait for your command to terminate and return its error code:
I've got a daemon process that I run on my machine every hour, and even though I've checked the Hidden box, it doesn't work.
I really do want it hidden, so how can I fix this?
will prevent the black command window, but be aware of the drawbacks : you won't be able the work with some GUI automation tools like 'AutoIt' or SendKeys in PowerShell, as Windows launch the tasks in a headless style environment.
This is very annoying, because it pops up and interrupts whatever I'm doing:
Check the "Run whether user is logged on or not" check box and executable will run in the background.
