SONET was developed for the traditional circuit-switch telephone system to multiplex different calls onto a single circuit as if there were multiple circuits.
Fiber optics uses a particular wavelength of light for signalling.
Circuit-switching is fading away in favor of packet switching, but remember that there is a huge installed base of expensive circuit-switching equipment that simply doesn't disappear.
WDM lets you use multiple wavelengths for separate signals, as if you had multiple fibers; each wavelength is a separate signal.
data centers, you will find one of the ethernet standards because the equipment is so much cheaper than TDM equipment, and packet switching is more flexible and efficient than circuit switching.
Ethernet frames can be encapsulated into SONET frames and de-encapsulated on the other end, or there are various ethernet on fiber standards, too, but the equipment for ethernet on fiber and SONET on fiber is very different.
Either SONET or ethernet can be run over a fiber with only one signal, or you can have multiple logical links with WDM, and each wavelength looks like a separate connection.
SONET is for circuit-switched networks, where each frame in a time period represents a different circuit.
That is why you (can) encapsulate ethernet frames in SONET frames.
SONET and ethernet are methods of framing the data on a signal, telling the other end where the data starts and stops.
