What actions can be taken to ensure that DNS for a hostname cannot be altered?
Can this potentially be disruptive to the server, or is Windows DNS smart enough to spot a duplicate hostname and deny an auto-register request from that host?
Your DNS zone must be Active Directory-integrated in order to use the feature.
The DHCP server, if it is to register records on behalf of clients, must have a credential that permits it to do so.
Records registered in such a zone are protected by ACLs and the updater must successfully authenticate as a user / computer with rights to modify an existing registration.
Given a Windows domain, with DNS provided by a server on that domain, I am curious about what happens if a guest joins the network attempting to use the same hostname as an existing server, and then tries to register that hostname in DNS with its DHCP address.
Duplicate hostnames are explicitely allowed, so the server can not really stop that.
There are ramifications for DHCP servers in such an environment.
This article talks about the considerations for DHCP and DNS dynamic updates and describes what I'm glossing-over here in detail.
Microsoft's solution to the "fileserver.domain.com" scenario you outline in a comment to TomTom is "Secure dynamic updates".
