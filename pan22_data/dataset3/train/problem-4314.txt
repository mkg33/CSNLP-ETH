In case it helps future readers, it seems as though hotplug is likely available on most modern consumer motherboards.
I left it overnight in case it was scanning the drive and perhaps cached some drive metadata in CMOS.
Formatted it GPT/exFAT in Windows and attempted to copy some data over from an old drive.
But the setting was not obvious in my bios (it was per-port).
The new drive heats up quite a bit, but nothing happens.
After I eventually found and enabled it, I was able to hotplug the drive, rewrite the partition scheme (dunno if this is correct terminology, but readers will hopefully understand) and format the disk.
Nothing appeared to happen, the copy appeared to not be in action.
In the end, I read my motherboard docs and discovered SATA hotplug is supported.
I am currently using the machine with the problematic drive disconnected.
My suggestion is to use your warranty and have it replaced.
It works just fine, as it did previously, when the drive is not connected.
The drive is a 4TB HGST Deskstar NAS (struggling to find a more detailed id, but can probably locate one if necessary).
Very simple advice : If the disk plays havoc with Windows and if it is heating up
considerably when not in heavy use, the disk is probably defective.
