They do this to make sure you don't just duplicate the drive and stick it into a new computer - and bypass copy protection.
Then, you have do the same for all the things you cannot remove, most of these will only be in the device manager.
There are certain files that are created when you install Windows, as well as some other programs, that look at hardware identifiers - such as the manufacturer's id for the motherboard, CPU, Network card, and hard-drive controler.

So first, you would have to get your drive to work again on the original computer.
