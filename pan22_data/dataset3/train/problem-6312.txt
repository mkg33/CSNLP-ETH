You should be able to leave it in "test" mode (most implementations call it that when they allow traffic regardless of successful/failed authentication) and simply monitor the logs/reports.
A simple one-off utility is arpwatch, which will alert you to any changes (including additions) in MAC to IP address mappings.
Probably over thinking this on my part, but you could write a script scan the network with the nmap tool to scan the entire network, log new entries, and block them.
I was wondering if there was a way, that whenever a hostile device (unknown device, like a wireless router a personel member brings to the office) this would be notified to a central system with the switch on which it occured and what port.
802.1x can provide both port security (only allowing authorized computers) and can report unauthorized connections.
A network intrusion detection device should be able to do this for you.
I know you can shut down ports with port security, but is there a way there would also be an immediate notification ?
There are a lot of different strategies to implement this:
