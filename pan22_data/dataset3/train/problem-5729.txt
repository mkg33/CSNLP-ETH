I now have a problem, i. e. a VM that is generalized and should not be and that when I create a VM using my image I have this message:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/create-vm-specialized#option-2-upload-a-specialized-vhd
Error: OS Provisioning for VM'X' did not finish in the allotted time.
If you do not sysprep VM you can use it as a specialized disk but not an image.
What I'll like to know is, is there a way to de-generalized the VM?

I created an image of a VM without having done the Sysprep procedures.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/prepare-for-upload-vhd-image#determine-when-to-use-sysprep-
To resolve this issue, either use the VHD as is with CreateOption=Attach or prepare it properly for use as an image
This suggests the guest OS has not been properly prepared to be used as a VM image (with CreateOption=FromImage).
Now I cannot use this Image to create any VM since I didn't followed the proper guide to do so.
