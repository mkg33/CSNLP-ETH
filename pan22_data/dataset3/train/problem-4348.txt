Iperf3 tests from android to the Windows 10 machine is ~200 mbps.
From what I remember, this app was using an older version of SMB which caused slow transfer speeds.
I have also tried transferring files from android (Neuxs 6P and Pixel XL) to the Windows 10 machine and get an average speed of around ~800 kbps.
However, when I transfer from the Windows 10 machine to the phone, I get speeds of ~40 mbps.
This speed is faster in this direction, but still much slower than expected.
To bring some closure to this question, the problem was with the client itself, ES File Explorer.
Iperf3 tests between the two Windows 10 machines show ~900 mbps in both directions.
I have two Windows 10 machines and have tried transferring data between the two and get only ~500 mbps over a gigabit connection in both directions.
Switching to a different app which supported newer standards resolved the issue.
I am using Unifi UAP-AC-Lites for the wireless transfers.
Here's a Microsoft article describing the TCP features.
I haven't actually tried these myself but a lot of internet sources seem to recommended disabling TCP Large Send Offload in the network card device properties page and editing some TCP stack settings, mainly autotuninglevel of the TCP Receive Window size.
