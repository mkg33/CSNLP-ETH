I have a script of curl http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html commands - one line per file.
I would recommend using one of Canonical's AMIs in conjuction with cloud-init
Easiest to spin up linux images then ssh into them to have them do work.
I had the idea of automatically spinning up n EC2 instances, executing the command and FTPing the files to a central location, then shutting down the machines.
Thus, you can just put all the commands you want to run in the script and put "shutdown -h now" at the end of the script.
Look for the section about "User-Data Scripts" where you can use the --user-data-file to auto-launch a script on startup.
The download is rate-limited by the host so it takes MUCH longer than the theoretical transfer rate based on normal Internet speeds.
But if you are doing this on a regular basis and need something to automatically start and stop your machines, then you may want to look at this product: http://LabSlice.com (with the disclaimer that I am the CTO).
I need to download 100 GB of files (itâ€™s in about 150 files) within a 7 day period before they expire.
