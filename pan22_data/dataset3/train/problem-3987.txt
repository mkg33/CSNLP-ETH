Having said all that, please, please, please, please, please think about using DNS to do what you're trying to do rather than using a HOSTS file.
There's no valid reason that anyone can come up with for using a mass-distributed HOSTS file to accomplish anything.
Run your HOSTS file distribution script there and you'll find that it works fine.
This will cause the VBscript to run as the user logs on but imitates the computer account which should give permission to copy the file to the location.
A logon script runs under the context of the user logging-on, so if the user can't do something a logon script running under their context can't do it either.
A Startup Script, assigned to the computer via a GPO applying to the computer object, runs as LocalSystem and can do anything to the local computer.
Having said that, a non-Administrator user can't modify the HOSTS file (and you've figured that out already).
This will work if you truly want it for the User logon instead of startup.
I hate telling you this, because you anything you think you should be using using HOSTS files for should really be done with DNS.
Computer configuration > Policies > administrative Templates > system > group policy > User Group Policy Loopback Processing mode
I do not recommend this see the post about DNS but it should work.
Go into the computer configuration part and run the policy in loop back mode.
