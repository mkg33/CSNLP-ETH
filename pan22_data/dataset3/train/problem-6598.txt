I've heard that if I leave the router in router mode and have it connected to the main router (my RT-AC86U router) it will act as a switch/network switch.
I want to use a Linksys wireless-g router as an extender/network switch.
Now I need to port forward to the devices on the Linksys, but since the devices now work on an entirely different intranet I was wondering if it's still possible to port forward to devices on the secondary router.
The external connection to the Linksys is provided by the main router, the internal devices behind the Linksys need a network range different from the range of the main router.
You have to configure a port forwarding from the main router to the external address of the Linksys and another port forwarding from the Linksys to the target device.
If you use the Linksys as a NAT router, it is a little more complicated.
First, you should consider whether you want the Linksys to work as a router or as a switch.
Using it as a switch is the easiest way, all connected devices are in the same network, you configure a port forwarding in the main router and you are done.
