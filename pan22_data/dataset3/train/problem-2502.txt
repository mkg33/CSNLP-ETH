What you could try (and I my be out on a limb here) is calling the script from a batch file and then calling the batch file from the registry.
For more information, run this from the command line:
Maybe Windows sees executing from the registry as executing directly.
You need to set the execution policy to remotesigned and not "bypass" as Microsoft told me.
I've added it as a REG_SZ in my current user "run" key, but it never executes.
So now I have a powershell script that starts all my usual programs with a gap between them allowing me to get working on my machine immediately without the slowness every application trying to open at the same time.
I have a powershell script that I want to run on my PC every time I log on.
If I remember right you can't execute a powershell script directly (as in double clicking it), it has to be executed from the command line.
I've altered the execution policy to "unrestricted", but still no luck.
Here is a little snippit of my *.PS1 file as others may find it useful:
