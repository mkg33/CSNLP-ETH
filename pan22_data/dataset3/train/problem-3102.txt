That immediately found and disabled the culprit, without even asking me.
All the guides I've found online start with "go to the Tools menu".
My problem is that Outlook 2013 will not start at all because it gets stuck at start-up while it tries to load the TeamViewer add-in.
I read alternatives about running outlook as administrator.
There are four files in this folder and three of the names start with "TeamViewerMeetingAddIn"
The shortcut I had on my taskbar was not a shortcut to Outlook its self, but some meta-information about it.
Go to: Program Files (or Program Files (x86))\TeamViewer\Version9\outlook
I assume this is similar to running it in safe mode.
Go to options, advance, then disable outlook addin near the bottom of the list.
You can rename the TeamViewer add-in files and Outlook will load and show it as inactive.
Eventually I found the OUTLOOK.EXE file somewhere in C:\Program Files and rick-clicked it and ran it as administrator.
you can change the TeamViewer settings to disable the TeamViewer's Outlook addin.
I renamed these by putting 1 as the first character, "1TeamViewerMeetingAddIn"
When I restarted Outlook it loaded up with no problem.
