The mail environment feeding a ticket system could be configured with '_' as the extension separator, so that anything addressed to ticket_1234@example.com would get forwarded to the ticketing system, which would use the address extension ("1234") to match the email to an issue.
If my mailer supports address extensions, I may also be able to send email to "bob+some_extension@example.com".
For example, let's assume my address is "bob@example.com".
Many email systems (sendmail, postfix, and others) support the idea of "address extensions".
In this case, instead of email going to ticket_1234@example.com, maybe it would go to ticket_1234@support.example.com.
Another mechanism is to dedicate an entire subdomain to the ticketing system.
The mail still goes to the same places, but the extension is available for filtering.
The example.com mail system would be configured to pass all email for support.example.com to the ticket system.
In general it is done by routing any address which is not resolved to an existing mailbox to a default mailbox, and then having a script that processes those mails for specific template data.

This would be better posted at ServerFault.com as Andreas mentioned.
