I tried to log into this site (superuser) today but when I clicked the username box, an email I didn't recognize popped down below mine... this is a work computer but nobody at my workplace recognizes it, and looking it up shows someone we don't know in a different state.
Web searches and searches on StackExchange pointed me to open Chrome's cache or SQLite DB to find the "user history" or autofill, but the info recommended seems outdated and I'm on Mac Mojave now; there's nothing in autofill for this email, and I'm seeing a bunch of possible folders and files to open in DB Browser for SQLite, but I don't know which to open.
The closest answer I can find is here - https://stackoverflow.com/a/16742333 - but it's from 6 years ago and the path info is either ambiguous (like *) or not matching up (probably because it's just old).
Any current accurate info for this would help us squash possibly a security issue.
I checked Chrome's password section (in settings), and it's not there; I have no login/password info stored there for this site anyways, and I don't remember when I last used it.
