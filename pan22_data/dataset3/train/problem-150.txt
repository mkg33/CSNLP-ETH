Or, as others have noted, you can try using the wildcard approach. ?

It's not in fact true that this is impossible on Windows.
is a single-character wildcard; if you don't have any other files or directories with one-character names you could try "ren ?
AFAIK and others have stated here there is no way to do this using Windows.
It is possible to fix this with the SFUA Utilities on the Subsystem for UNIX-Based Applications on Windows 7 (Ultimate edition).

Instead of using rmdir I could have just deleted the space folder from the desktop using Windows Explorer; or done anything else, including accessing its contents (had it had any).
As noted, the problem is the Windows user interfaces, not the Windows filesystem.
The best bet for you to use a live cd of Linux and then rename the folder and then use it windows.
If you can write in almost any programming language, and that language has a library function which will let you manipulate the filesystem, you should be able to quickly write a minimal program that will let you rename this beast.
This is definitely untested, but out of curiosity it may be a solution:
