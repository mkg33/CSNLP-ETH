I wrestled with this for 2 days before I found the answer (see bald spot).
But after re-align the numbering system the error message should go away
It would be better if the message simply said, "No such style" or similar.
I add the italian version of this weird error, beacuse looking for it on google I only find... documents containing the error!
In my case (caption of a figure) "0" refers to the style of first level of numbered list, i.e.
Ensure that the numbering system is consistent, WORD may have return your numbering system for Tables and Figures back to the default.
When you try to add a new caption with a different numbering system you get this error message.
Note: This error message also occurs in MS Word 2007 and possibly earlier versions.
The problem lies in that the Figure, Title, Titel, etc dialog box has a Numbering option.
It means that the name of the style in a STYLEREF field (often used in headers and footers to pick up text from a heading) is misspelled or has an extra space, as can happen if you edit a STYLEREF field manually.
Press ALT+F9 to view the field contents, which will look like:
Per applicare 0 al testo da visualizzare in questo punto, utilizzare la scheda Home."
the style of the section where the figure is contained.
Figure  {STYLEREF 0 \s}-{SEQ Figure * ARABIC \s 0}
Indeed the figure is in sub-section 3.4.2 and I selected "title 1" as level for the figure number.
The reference to the Home tab is because that's where you can access the list of styles in the document.
