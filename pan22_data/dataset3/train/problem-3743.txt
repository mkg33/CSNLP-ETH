Do you have any suggestions where I can look further in order to get into this problem?
When restarting the systemd-networking service (or rebooting) a vlan1 interface gets created.
According to Archluinx Wiki I have tried to configure.
However, the file vlan1.network seems to be ignored completely.
I had to rename the vlan interface to enp4s0.1 instead of vlan1.
I am running an Archlinux machine and I want to get VLANs running.
The 192.168.4.0/24 network is not assigned to any adapter.
I tried it in a small virtual environment to avoid messing with the production machine, there the behavior is perfectly useful: The vlan interface gets only the configured IPs in the *.network file.
Additionally I want to create a virtual controller vlan1 that is in VLAN with id=1 with the IPv4 192.168.4.5/24.
I have a running configuration without the VLAN thing in my productive system.
This seems to be a bug regarding the logging output as far as I understood.
Network card enp4s0 gets 2 IPv4 addresses 192.168.0.249 and 192.168.5.5 both /24.
I added also two more files in /etc/systemd/network:
The new interface gets the IPs copied from enp4s0.
In the logs of systemd-networkd.service the following lines appear after the restart:
The error in the logs are 1:1 in the logs of the test system as well.
I will maybe ask the developers of systemd but for now a workaround is found.
I tried to add the other parts to the configuration like the following:
So I cannot reach any of these machines while having routes to the wrong devices.
Maybe I am simply silly or overdue but I do not get the reason why this happens only in the production server and not in the test server.
For details, see comments in https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/11921.
You should not use MACAddress= in [Match] section if the .network file contains VLAN=.
I thought I could give any name I liked but this did not work as expected.
The original routes are not copied over (which seems nasty at best).
