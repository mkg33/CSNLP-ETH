listen 127.0.0.1:80) you should get the following:
How can I make Nginx only act only on the 127.0.0.1 address?
Note: you must explicitly set the listen directive on all server blocks, otherwise, NginX will still listen on all addresses.
The second problem is that NginX, by default, binds to all available addresses.
Per section 1.3.2.3 (Addressing) of RFC 1122, the entire block 127.0.0.0/8 is reserved for loopback; you should avoid using bogon IP addresses, especially special-purpose ones as defined in RFC 5735 for some purpose other than private addressing, as the results may be undefined.
For some reason, any local IP address in the 127.xxx.xxx.xxx range redirects back to the default 'Welcome to nginx!'
(Tested with CentOS 6.2, Nginx 1.2, using curl - after making the change, trying to connect to 127.0.0.2 (or any other non 127.0.0.1 address), results in: curl: (7) couldn't connect to host)
From my experience with Apache, only the 127.0.0.1 IP address would resolve back to the apache web server.
If you change ALL your server blocks to have a listen directive that explicitly specifies the address to which to bind (e.g.
You have two separate issues - firstly, multiple addresses (127.0.0.1/8) are reserved for loopback - however, that only explains why an address such as 127.0.0.2 will still point at your computer.
You can verify that NginX has, in fact bound to all addresses by looking at netstat -pant | grep nginx, which may show something like:
Note the 0.0.0.0:80 under local address, meaning bind to all addresses.
when it is omitted) is listen *:80 and NginX will try each available server block and use the 'best match', even if the server_name doesn't match (if you specify a listen ... default then it will use that one).
