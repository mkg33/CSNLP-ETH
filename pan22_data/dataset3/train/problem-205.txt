I had an email account configured in Outlook 2010 connected to an Exchange server.
The way I see it, if we somehow had access to the raw emails in Outlook (like view-source in TB), it shouldn't be hard to simply write them to text files!
I have encountered a number of problems, to name a few:
Imported email into Thunderbird (simply Ctrl+U to view source)
Enable IMAP in your GMAIL account and then configure Outlook to use the IMAP GMAIL account.
Next I wanted to export these archived mails to be used inside
binary .msg format option (or am I missing something)...
Thunderbird 10.x (place them in the Local Folders in TB).
You install it and backup your email as eml then you can import it into any email client.
(now I no longer have access to the Exchange account)
), so I'm hoping someone developed a decent tool for this task..
Then configure your Google IMAP account in Thunderbird and copy the files to your local storage.
BTW: In Outlook Express we could directly choose File > Save As and export in .eml format, but Outlook 2010 only have the (proprietary?)
All the above fails, as the emails are not preserved when exported.
Here's a sample to show how the emails get mangled -- names and other stuff have been changed to protect the innocent :)
So my question is how can I export emails from my PST file into Thunderbird's EML/MBOX textual format, in a clean way the preserves all the original headers?
The easiest solution I found was MailStore, free for home use:
I understand that the specification of PST files is now publicly available (right?
Copy your files from your PST to your IMAP GMAIL account inside Outlook.
Original email in Outlook (open email in new window, go to File > Properties and inspect the 'Internet headers' text field, although sometimes its just blank!)
