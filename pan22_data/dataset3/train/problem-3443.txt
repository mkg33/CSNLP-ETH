I haven't yet experienced any issues with them - no slowdowns, no data corruption (although I haven't tested all the files on them, so there's a chance that one of them might be corrupted).
As you can see, there have been no sector reallocations and there are no pending sectors.
I have tested the situation after half a year - still the same, nothing gets worse.
Full non-destructive scanning with Victoria and HD Tune doesn't report anything critical nor warnings.
If there was an error while writing (as Write Error Rate suggests) and a sector was marked as uncorrectable, why didn't the drives attempt to reallocate the bad sectors?
Or does it mean just that an error occurred once (maybe during an abrupt shutdown during a power failure) and then later the same sectors could be written again... but then why call them "uncorrectable" if the situation is normal again?

I have two WD Blue 1TB drives since year 2015, bought new from two different shops, used in two different machines.
Still curious, how exactly this situation should be interpreted.
What does the Uncorrectable Sector Count mean in this case?

Still, some disk utilities have marked the disks as suspicious because of Uncorrectable Sectors.
