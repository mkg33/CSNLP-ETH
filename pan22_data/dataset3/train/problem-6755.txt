This is almost certainly because there is a mismatch between the number of hours you have declared to be "in a day" (probably left as the default 8) and the number of hours you are actually working in a day (probably defined in the Working Time as 7 or 7.5).
When I face this, I try changing the Date format (In MS Project 2010, it's File > Options > General > Date Format) to something like "Jan 28, 12:33 PM"
I have found many articles on this but none have seem to help me.
I want to put duration of a task for one day and I want the start date and end date to be the same.
Unfortunately you will have to go through all tasks and reset their durations as fiddling with the above will have recalculated the durations of all tasks.
Then set the "duration" of a day to equalt the number of hours worked in a day according to what you have set in the Working Time.
Not sure if this is the reason, but something you can try out.
Then sometimes I notice that the tasks is starting at 10:00 and a full 8 hour (or 1 day) task ends up during the beginning of the next day.
Then I change my start to 9:00 AM of that day (assuming the default is set at 9 to 5) and the task finishes at 5:00 PM the same day.
I have tried work time and many other options but nothing seems to work.
This is a common mistake with MSP and the way around it is to ALWAYS set up your working calendars and working times when you set up a new project and definitely BEFORE adding any tasks...
