In my mind this still falls short of requiring root credentials in the case at hand and I do not see how requiring root proves ownership of anything substantial over and above what a standard IAM user proves.
According to this documentation for generating key pairs for use with Cloudfront Signed URLs and Signed Cookies root credentials are required to either generate or upload key pairs.
Why this design wasn't subsequently changed to support an IAM user being granted permission to administer these keypairs is neither readily apparent nor documented.
The closest I can get to an answer is by way of metaphor to other types of proofs of control, such as when DNS TXT entries are used to prove control of a domain during a certificate signing request.
Is there something special about signing this category object (urls, cookies) that requires special authority?
There is no obvious reason why this still works the way it does... but when CloudFront signed URLs became available in 2009, there was no such thing as an IAM user.
Other key pairs used with AWS, such as EC2 authentication key pairs, do not require special elivated root credentials.
Originally, the root user was the only user in each AWS account.
