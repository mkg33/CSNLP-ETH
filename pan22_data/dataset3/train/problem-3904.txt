My friend has his router blocking certain traffic at certain times...to keep his kids off the internet after hours.
I believe you could do this by changing the local accounts logon hours then setting a local GP to force logout when they expire.
I have a 14 year old boy who's obsessed with his gaming pc so much that he stays awake all night sometimes and sleeps all day.

If he's playing online games (or games that require an online account) I would suggest making a rule in the router.
You didn't specify if the gaming is online, but if it is, then you could set the PC he is using to have access permissions inside the specified hours.
My command allows [user] logons Monday to Friday from 08:00 â€“ 17:00 local time.
Normally that would cause havoc with his schooling but he's being home schooled where he lives with his mother but is there some way to make the computer unusable after a certain predetermined time we can set so his pc shuts off say at 10:00 pm and won't start till 7:00 am?
Then go into gpedit.msc and set the policy linked below:

OpenDNS Home... DNS Web Filering, allows you to block websites from anyone inside your home network no  matter what device is used.
*Note it won't shutdown the PC it'll log user out, you could find a LGP for that as well maybe.
