That is:  You can run multiple instance of XE as long as each one is in a different Virtual Host.
Can you run 11g and 18c on the same machine for SE2/EE editions?
Can you run 11g and 18c on the same OS if both are XE?
As I understand, this was done so that you can run 18c XE inside a VM:
I have a 64-bit Windows 7 machine with an Oracle 11g version installed.
Better go for dedicated virtual Windows (or Linux) environment for each Oracle installation.
every time before you start an application or process, this can be rather painful.
You will have to check/modify environment variables like PATH, ORACLE_HOME, etc.
The behavior of the Oracle installer changed over the releases.
18c XE License does not have Condition 1 from 11g XE.
If yes, what are the configurations I need to do for them (11g and 18c) to coexist?
11g XE License limits you to one XE instance per physical machine.
There are some components which can be installed only once per machine (or one each for 32-bit and 64-bit), e.g.
I want to install the Oracle 18c version on the same machine.
"Oracle Administration Assistant for Windows" or "Oracle Provider for OLE DB".
If you find some Oracle documentation "Installing Oracle Database into Multiple Oracle Homes" they might be valid for version 11.1 + 11.2 but not 11c + 18g.
I think in principle it should be possible but it will be very difficult.
The code also prevents you from running multiple XE instances on the same host.
