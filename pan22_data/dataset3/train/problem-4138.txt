Since this is an external mount, it is possible that it has been mounted read-only.
If this is a removable drive, it could be something a simple as the write-protect tab being set.
You need to run chmod from an account that does have permission to make these changes; your account might have permission using the sudo command, but if you don't know if it does, it probably doesn't.
It would helpful to know exactly what, if any, error message you see when you try to chmod.
Suddenly all of my contents residing on external hard disk has changed to read-only mode.
This will recursively (therefor the "-R") set 755 permissions fo the specified path.
In that case, chmod would return something like "Operation not permitted".
if that doesn't work, try sudo CHMOD -R 755 /path/to/external/drive
But I cant delete anything.Please suggest me some way.
Even though I am using Linux, I don't know how a virus have done this.
In any case, I advise against doing a chmod -R on the entire drive until you know what is going on, as doing so could mess up permissions on existing files.
I tried using "chmod", but still I am not able to change permission.
