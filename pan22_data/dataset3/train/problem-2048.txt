It should also have a line like MAILDIR =$HOME/Mail which will identify your mail directory.
If you want to save attachments always in the same folder, John1024 describes how to do it.
There's no config option (AFAIK) but here's a simple work around.
mutt also allows you to define many powerful macros.
The following alias will save your files into an "attachments" folder in your home directory:
It should have a line like SAVE =$MAILDIR/save which specified where attachments are saved, likely defaulting to your mail directory.
If you want to save to a particular directory, cd to that directory before starting mutt:
In that case, check the file .procmailrc in your home directory.
This page suggest that procmail determines where the attachments are saved.
By default, mutt saves attachments to whatever the current directory was when you started mutt.
To define a macro "W" for saving to a particular directory, put the following in your ~/.muttrc file:
In your case, it might be /home/shinokada/mail/save/.
So if mutt proposes attach.ment, just fill in the path you need the file saved to, ~/your/desired/folder/attach.ment and hit Enter.
alias mutt='cd $HOME/attachments;/usr/bin/mutt;cd -'
Naturally, to specify where attachments are saved, just change the SAVE variable.
At this point, you can provide mutt with a new directory (and with a different file name).
After you hit s and before you hit Enter, mutt proposes a default file name (which is the original name of the attachment).
