After you have your terminal, run these commands, typing them one per line and hitting ENTER at the end of each line.
At this time  vim will switch to "edit" mode, the previous mode was "command" mode.
You will know that you're in "edit" mode if you see the word "-- INSERT --" in the lower left corner of your terminal
I have the same notebook model, running Fedora 25, You have to update the grub.cfg file located under /boot/grub2 directory
Once you're done with the editing, press ESC key and then write :wq to save your work and exit vim.
If none of these works just run sudo dnf install xterm and run the xterm terminal using the previous procedure.
In this "edit" mode enter a space followed by the new parameter mem=17G.
Note that you don't have to write anything after the '#' character, that's just a comment mentioning what we are doing at each step
Once you've inserted the text, press the ESC key to switch back to "command" mode, press the n key to look for the next occurrence of the "linux16" string and repeat the previous step
Particularly for me it didn't make great impact adding this parameter to the kernel command line, but it definitively made some improvement.
After that go to the end of the line pressing SHIFT + A .
If that doesn't work, type xterm, or you can try with mate-terminal, lxterminal, terminator, etc.
Repeat the searching step and editing step for every occurrence of the "linux16" string
Reboot your laptop with the reboot command and select the first line, i mean, the latest kernel available.
Please let me know if you succeded and if you could make a bigger improvement.
This will locate the lines which start with the string "linux16".
