Yes, you can make Android Game without the prior knowledge of JAVA and without Android SDK.
I'd suggest you build and test it directly on android drom the first line of code you write while using a game framework.
Also if you'd develop your game outside the android framework you might use libraries that don't exist on android.
Unfortunately author of the blog stopped writing, but nevertheless it's a great start, and I've done most of tutorials in August and they were all valid.
There is great blog just for you with number of tutorials for game development for Windows, Mac and Android with Java.
You can however build a big part of your game as a jar library so you can re-use parts of it.
https://www.youtube.com/user/doctoriley has a decent series of tutorials which should give you a starting point (not exactly best practice but you get to understand how it all hangs together) and the code can be found at https://bitbucket.org/GQGK/creating-a-game-in-java-youtube-series/overview if you want it.
LibGDX is excellent, a layer on top of lwjgl which provides support for Android, desktop (win/lin/mac) and html5 (though frankly I'd say just use an applet instead as it's quite limited) and I believe work-in-progress iOS support too.
The documentation is relatively solid (though the wiki is incomplete and outdated) and it has been used in commercial projects.

You would make it easier for yourself implementing a game framework.
LibGDX is my weapon of choice, note though that many of the tutorials out there are set up pre-0.9.6 and quite a lot got changed in that update, rendering most of them useless.
It is a Hypernext Android creator which gives you complete environment to make an Android game.
This library can then be imported in your android project and you can see if it runs (and your not missing libs etc)
