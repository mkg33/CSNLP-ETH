How do I make the bios stop trying to load the other hard drives which clearly don't have any operating systems installed.
I have the drives and partitions on my PC as shown above.
Your Windows disk has an UEFI-style partition layout.
However, for some reason the bios tries to first load DISK 0-2 which obviously fail before finally loading Windows 10 from Disk 3.
You should be able to do this from within Windows using the special {fwbootmgr} object, which directly propagates changes to EFI firmware settings:
Are my partitions set up in some way that triggers the bios to want to load them?
I want C: to boot (the third partition in Disk 3).
It's this entry that needs to be placed topmost in the boot order.
I also completely disabled all other drives from the boot order configuration in bios settings, but it still tries to load them.
So placing disk 3 before disks 0–2 is going to be meaningless, because Windows isn't booting from "disk 3" in the first place.
As you can see in bcdedit /enum firmware, in addition to the disk entries meant for "legacy boot", there is also an entry that directly points to the Windows bootloader.
In the UEFI boot process, the firmware usually doesn't boot a 'disk' – it boots a specific OS by name.
Your firmware will likely re-add the legacy disk entries at the end, that can be safely ignored.)
(Some firmwares expose this in their setup screens as a multi-level thing, where you might need to move "UEFI" above "Legacy", or something like that.)
I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm looking for a solution because it annoys me that it slows down the startup speed so much.
(This sets Windows Boot Manager as the only item in the boot order.
