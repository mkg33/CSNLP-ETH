I inherited this LH stuff when i joined the company.
We bought our initial applicances back when it was still LeftHand Networks.
I'm guessing performance would be similar for vSphere HA.
If so how are you finding it and how do you have your multi-site setup configured?
To perform a multi-site setup, you need to have nodes at either end.
We've compared Dell EqualLogic and felt this served our needs better.
I guess thats why you need two of them all the time.

We also has similar problems with HP support, and some problems with the P4500s crashing for no apperent reason.
You have to understand the reason that no other vendors use commodity x86 servers to build SANs with.
We're looking more and more likely to go the P4000 route and I'm looking at how things like failover work between the P4000 and vSphere (I have read the HP PDF's).
Using multipath IO on 1 Gb ethernet SAN fabric, with jumbo frames and flow control, per HP guidance.
We use async replication, because our link is not fast enough for synchro rep (needs to be 1 Gb or greater).
We use them to host HA VMs on Hyper-V.  VM Guest performance has been very good.
