The difference with the PostScript module is; the printer will receive raw files and after it will cache it and make the work on it.
Windows will not give you an error if you use a PostScript driver or not even if the pritner does not have the module, BUT, the formatting inside the printer will not change, as a simple 2 meg PDF can finish 2 gig inside the spooler easily..
It's a old question, but to give you a detail not told by anyone else, for optimizing PDF printing you need the PostScript's module inside your printer and memory upgrade too from the formater board, possibly with a HDD for the temporary cache.
To circumvent the problem, like other said, it's mostly to use Acrobat and make it send as an image, that way the printer just print the output without dealing with the output, but you loose a lot of DPI.
To see it by yourself, check a PDF that is long to print, check the size, and start to print it, and validate in the spooler how much size now it's.
You can try enabling or disabling "Print as image" to see if that helps.
Try printing an image with the Photo and Fax printing wizard of Windows, or something like Gwenview if on Linux, and see if that takes a long time.
Also, if a text-only PDF prints quickly, that may be the whole issue.
Try to narrow the problem down a bit and troubleshoot from there.
Mainly, since some PDFs take longer, it could be an issue with rastering (rasterizing?)
It could also be the version of Acrobat you are using.
Sometimes going back to an earlier postscript version, if available, can help.
I've used a similar Canon and didn't see that problem, so I imagine it's fixable.
I know in older printers, this could be helped by upgrading memory, but this doesn't appear to be the problem here.
