This can be done using the PowerDNS Recursor lua scripting.
Please don't do this, it has massive consequences.
error messages about the program not working and calls you and / or your coworkers for support.
And, obviously, a DNS service has to run on the forwarder, which can either resolve the query or forward to another DNS server.

If this times out, then 10.0.1.2 isn't answering the queries from your Ubuntu box.
Plus, that DNS server must be configured to answer queries from the first DNS server.
I understand that it's only for your internal network; however, it will still break many things.
While this may seem trivial, consider a situation where an application is attempting to send data to a remote server and sees that it's up from behind your network; however, in reality the server has gone offline.
Keep in mind that you're returning an IP for a live server, and as such many applications and services may think that something they're trying to access is really available when it's not.
From the short extract I cannot see whether either of these conditions is fulfilled.
As other have stated there can be significant consequences to NXDOMIAN hijacking and you understand the potential issues before implementing.
The forwarders option must either be in an option block or a zone block.
The Ubuntu 10.04 repositories have a package for PowerDNS Recursor which supports the lua scripting functionality.
