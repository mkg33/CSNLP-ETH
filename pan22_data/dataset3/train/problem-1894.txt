You should NEVER open a power supply (even a dead one) unless you really know what you are doing.
the heatsink is usually strudier than anything else.
They contain (at the very least) large capacitors which could cause a strong electrical discharge or even a small explosion if shorted out.
Dissecting the power supply is safe if you know what you are doing, but if you are asking this you shouldn't be doing it.
Moreover, there typically isn't anything really worth salvaging in there anyway, unless you get your kicks from transformer coils and rectifiers.
For example, could I reuse the connectors and/or add them onto other power supplies?
You can probably take it to a recycling center and get good money for it.
usually, in a power supply, if it ever fails, then most likely the capacitors are dead already, so not useful salvaging it.
the power plug and fuse unit is quite expensive to buy for hobby crafters, take that out and use that if you need it as well.
the transformer is usually OK unless your power supply died of releasing magic smoke.
Capacitors storing large amount of energy can cause burns when dischaged over skin, or unfortunately, a stopped heart.
voltage regulators are usually intact in a failed power supply, but you usually need to desolder it and take it into a new circuit..
if you ever want to open the power supply of a computer...
(2) Discharge all capacitors using a resistor (NOT A SHORT) (Protect yourself with gloves!)
So I've got two dead power supplies right now and I was wondering what was possibly salvageable on them.
