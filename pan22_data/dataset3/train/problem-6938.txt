For example, for an sshd configured to log to syslog, you might find the messages in /var/log/secure.
The SSH daemon won't trust files that can be tampered with by others than the user (well, and root, of course).
2- check the secure log from remote machine, look-up the detail sshd daemon error log.
Then check the ownership and modes for directory /home/xxx, maybe you need run this
Check username with wich you are trying to log in.
the problem was the public key, it got some bogus data,regenerate it and post it in the sshd_server, you sshd_client is sending the key information but is not recognized by the server (it dint match any of the keys in authorized_keys)
You likely need to be root in order to have permissions to do so.
i just got trapped in the same problem accessing with fedora core 16 to cents 5.5
1- check your /etc/ssh/sshd_config, ensure you have
Check the server log files to find out what's wrong.
The reason in this case was a (stupid) default default of 0002.
The output of the client as in ssh -v will reveal that there is a problem at a certain step in the protocol, but when it's due to something on the server the client won't be informed of the cause.
