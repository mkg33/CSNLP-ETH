You can create the boot disks by running the winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe with the correct parameter.
The 3 .exe files you have are probably self-extracting floppy images used to boot from floppy.
I used my ancient SP1 NT4 disk, created an ISO, then booted a VMware virtual machine from it.
To extract floppies into images that you can use in VMWare use Winimage to create a .img file which vmware will recognize as a floppy image.
You will also need the NT Server CD, though, to complete the install.
This means of course you have to find a computer with a floppy drive that works & a running copy of windows.
If you have a floppy drive (and even better, media to go along with) should be able to run the .exe's and have them create boot floppies and mount those from VMWare.
About 2 weeks ago I built a NT 4 VM to start an AD migration.
I assume you have a copy of a windows NT CD, or an iso of it.
If you can't boot the CD and still want to create the "floppies", grab this virtual floppy driver and use the instructions from Microsoft to create disk iamges of each of the bootable floppies.
NT 4 Server had 3 floppies for setup prior to being able to use the CD to complete the install.
Although as suggested, you won't want to do this when you can boot the NT4 CD
(Actually, you can find images of the Windows NT 4.0 boot disks in various places on the 'net, but you'd do well to make the disks from your particular CD-ROM if you can't get it to boot off of CD.)
These floppies included things like the boot loader and drivers required to get you far enough to be able to use the CD.
I then ran SP4, SP6 and installed IE6 to bring it up to as modern as I could get it.
