I'm trying to set up a site-to-site VPN using RRAS on two 2K8r2 servers since yesterday.
Configuration: the servers are configured using the wizard to set up a site-to-site connection.
Both servers use a static IP address, subnet.11, and are set up as DMZ.
I added a static route on both server (home, office 1) and I can see the result in the IP routing table (home, office 1).
The routers act like a DHCP-server and assign IP addresses from the range subnet.21-subnet-.100.
Problem: I can't get the servers to send the traffic for the other site, to be sent through the VPN connection.
Set up: the set up is the same on both sites: the server is connected to a router that's connected to a modem.
This works with a demand-dial interface and a PPTP VPN connection.
I hope someone has an idea to get this route working!
The connection is working at this point, but I can't get it to send traffic from one site to the other one.
My guess is that this last step isn't right, for example because the routing table states "non demand-dial", which seems not correct.
I did this because the route didn't show up automatically.
