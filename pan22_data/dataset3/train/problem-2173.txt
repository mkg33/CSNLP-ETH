And until you go over 10s of thousands per directory you really should not worry too much.
The suggested number of files in one folder is 5000.
I had trouble some years ago with a directory which had about 30000 files, and new files couldn't be written (it was the "temp" directory of eMule...), it was on a FAT32 partition, but it's possible that I was using Win98 at the time, and that it was a limit of the OS itself.
Note however that programs like Explorer suffer much sooner than 10s of thousands, because they try to access all files in a given directory to get meta-data, etc.
I have about 700,000 .7z files each size 24KB in the root of my 4 TB WD BLUE's 2 TB partition and the explorer takes about 3-4 minutes to load all the files in the window and takes about 1 min selecting them but dies when i do any operation with them such as opening properties or pressing ctrl+x .
However, the rule of thumb I go by is about 500 per directory.
I can select upto 150K files at best when it somehow responds with more than a minute of delay but any more than that and its just dead , atleast for hours when i come to check and find the selection done .
Assuming NTFS here, in which case the technical limit is around 4 billion files.
10 yrs old thread but I only discovered the limits per se today on latest Windows 10 build 18362.356 .
I use Windows 10, and 25,000 images in one folder (average size of the file is 500 KB took more than an hour to load completely in the folder.
