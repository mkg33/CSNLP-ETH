My secondary purpose is to have access to files and databases from any of my family's computers - functioning similar to Dropbox.
I would also welcome suggestions on how to approach purchasing a personal cloud device - what attributes to look for, to be sure it will work for syncing OneNote and accessing files away from home.
If I understand it correctly, a personal cloud storage device (for example the My Cloud by WD) is basically a simplified type of NAS, as a network-accessible external HDD that is not attached to a computer.
I want to maintain control of my files, for the security of keeping them private.
My primary purpose of this would be to sync OneNote between multiple computers - without using Microsoft's OneDrive online "cloud" servers.
(Please note this is a question about a type of NAS (Network Attached Storage) device, not an online cloud storage service.)
I have several questions about these devices, as they are somewhat different from other NAS.
Having one seems like an ideal alternative to online cloud services, because instead of my private/work data sitting on companies' servers, it's in my living room.
I have carefully read through threads about NAS and clouds and not found this question yet.
I appreciate any help refining this question as well.
