In this problem, the signature in each email is related to the text that is before the signature that's why I would suggest using recurrent neural networks like LSTMs or GRUs especially if it's a classification task.
Detecting a signature in an email is more like a detection problem in an image rather than a natural language processing (NLP) problem.
In such a case, detection in images is currently dominated by convolutional neural networks (CNN).
This is a very powerful technique which has proved to be the best for a multitude of image-based tasks.
The output of the CNN can provide either a binary output 0/1 determining if a signature exists.
Or it can provide an output which is the coordinates of the center of the signature (X, Y coordinates) such that you can know where it is placed in the document.
You can also try the LSTM seq to seq model if your task is to output the signature.
So you will need to collect a lot of varied examples and annotate them yourself.
It does not particularly matter what the signature says, you simply want to be able to detect it.
