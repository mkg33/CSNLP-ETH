So, in effect you are doing nothing wrong and the program behaves as designed.
For gzipping the files via logrotate you could not include the date and rather let logrotate handle the dateext.
The alternative to using a number sequence is to use a date/timestamp.
/var/log/messages, the rotated logs will be named /var/log/messages.0 and /var/log/messages.1 etc.
From the above you can also see the defaut behaviour is expected to be simply adding a number.
This number is how logrotate differentiate the versions.
You have the option rotate 30 in your configuration, which means that 30 older versions are kept before deleting.
This is so that if it's used for filenames like e.g.
Normally you would want to logrotate your logfiles not via script but via cronjob(s).
This would "remove" the 1 you see in the filename.
But you can configure what the string should look like - which in your case would be an empty string.
You are doing nothing wrong this is the default and expected behaviour.
If you want a different extension e.g a date then you can specify dateext
So for a "solution" to your issue you could use the logrotate options
This is normal behaviour for logrotate as you described it.
Logrotate doesn't have an option to not use an extension - but there's a workaround that you might use.
Your situation is somewhat different since you already have a timestamp in the filename, so that the extension is unnecessary.
Logrotate will default to adding a number to the file.
