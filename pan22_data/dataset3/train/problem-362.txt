- you can increase (decrease) indent of any level independently of its sublevels, just push increase (decrease) button for this
Is there a way to fix this in bulk, rather than clicking on each individual header one by one and changing its style?
And "Dogs" and its subsections really belong under "Mammals".
If they don't, then the list style isn't properly set.
The following article shows how to create a list style.
Is there a way to bump up (or down) the heading levels of multiple paragraphs at once?
I'm going to suppose you already did that, because i'd just plagiarize the article.

In that view, you can easily drag headings and their corresponding paragraphs around and change the level.
For example, I realise that the "Insects" should really be a sub-section of "Animals" rather than its own separate chapter.
From the navigation pane, drag the section to the correct place (eg, drag dogs between mammals and reptiles) and then you can select 'demote' on the dogs section.
If I just move the paragraphs and corresponding headers to the proper location, the heading levels will still be wrong; i.e.
- you can increase (decrease) indent of any level with all its sublevels, for this you must use right mouse click on any level and select increase (decrease) indent in the context menu.
"Insects" and "Dogs" will still be Heading 1, whereas they should be Heading 2 and Heading 3, respectively.
I want to reorganise the my Word 2010 document and have the heading styles update accordingly.
