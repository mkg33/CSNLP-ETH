After Dropping those tables DB size was reduced to 300M but the Innodb_buffer_pool_bytes_data was not reduced as per our expectation it remains same, so dropping of tables didn't flush out the buffer data of dropped table.
I have googled and refer official doc for related issue but not found any solution.
After 10-12 days some of tables a specially two tables contains approx 20G data at that point Innodb_buffer_pool_bytes_data was approx 53% of total allocated innodb_buffer_pool_size.
Current status is DB size is 6G and Innodb_buffer_pool_bytes_data 30G approx which is approx 70% of total buffer pool configured.
So on hourly basis we have Drop those two tables as we are generating data from these tables to other tables.
We have MySQL server V5.7.11 in which the Innodb_buffer_pool_bytes_data is getting increasing day by day.
Initially we have set innodb_buffer_pool_size to 8G but we got error of max connection reached, after that we come to know that Data was increased drastically and reached to 6-7G due to some transit tables in production site, so we have set innodb_buffer_pool_size to 40G.
