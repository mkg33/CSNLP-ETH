The advantage of PortableApps is that they are automatically updated and come with a launcher which is also automatically maintained.
It's worth looking at PortableApps to see if any of your software is available there.
I would recommend what I do, which is to create a root directory, such as %SystemDrive%\Utils or %SystemDrive\Programs (you will need an administrator shell to do this), and install each application into separate subdirectories under that.
This uses a similar structure, with all the software in individual subdirectories in single master directory (which can be the same one as you created above).
Now go to the shortcut directory where you want the shortcuts (eg Desktop), right click and select Paste shortcut.
In either case, you can copy the single master directory to any other machine you want, or run from an external drive.
If you need shortcuts to the applications, go in Explorer to each application's directory (eg %SystemDrive%\Utils\AppDir), then right-click on the application name (eg %SystemDrive%\Utils\AppDir\AppName.exe) and select Copy.
