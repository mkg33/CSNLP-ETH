On my freebsd box i have snmpd daemon from net-snmp-5.5_4 packet.
In marked places snmpd cache the result and return prev values, thats why rrdtool plot zero activity.
The MIB tables (nsExtendConfigTable etc) are indexed by the NAME token, so are unaffected by the order in which entries are read from the configuration files.
also you could take a look here too; http://www.fineconnection.com/How_to_set_the_net-snmp_agent_update_or_counter_refresh_interval
    If MIBOID is specified, then the configuration and result tables will be rooted at this point in the OID tree, but are otherwise structured in exactly the same way.
`extend [MIBOID] NAME PROG ARGS works in a similar manner to the exec directive, but with a number of improvements.
This means that several separate extend directives can specify the same MIBOID root, without conflicting.
There are two result tables - one (nsExtendOutput1Table) containing the exit status, the first line and full output (as a single string) for each extend entry, and the other (nsExtendOutput2Table) containing the complete output as a series of separate lines.
The exit status and output is cached for each entry individually, and can be cleared (and the caching behaviour configured) using the nsCacheTable.`
where mpdinput.pl my script which return input-octets from some mpd5-ng network  interface.
