Depending on how urgent this is, your best option might be to hire a consultant to help you setting up a secure system.
If you block port 25 outgoing, you won't be able to send any emails which is usually the goal of a mail server.
From this pc more than 10 mail was send per second.Using this process you can easity detect the lan spammer and after that I request all the blacklist web site to remove my IP from blacklist.
[My LAN part switch is connected on server’s eth1 Ethernet card.that’s why I have to check the eth1 for detect LAN spammer]
You need to work out what exact problem you're facing, before knowing where to go.
I am sorry, but I don't think you will get a solution to your problem here, as it depends on just too many different possibilities.
If the consultant is out of the question, you might get better answers here if you would describe your network layout much more detailed, including the software used, how the clients are configured to send mail etc.
Unfortunately, to solve this problem, you will have to understand at least some of the topics involved.
Frankly, the biggest issue appears to be that you don't really understand that much about how the mail system works.
Then they check my IP and become sure it is not spamming anymore.
What you actually should do is put some effort into securing your mail server with some sort of authentification whether based on IP (all of the computers in your local network) or username/password based.
