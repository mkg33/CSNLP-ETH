I'd leave a comment to Alex Jurkiewicz's answer, but I don't have enough rep :'( yet...
The exclude patterns are relative to the source directory (which in this case is /, so they are effectively absolute).
This will show me the differences in the names of the files that reside on the servers.
I have two servers that have should have the same setup except for known differences.
What I really want to do is run a checksum on all the files on both of the servers and compare them to also find where the contents are different.
So ".bashrc" and "yum-updatesd.conf" are "configuration" files that have changed in size, time, and MD5 checksum.
This will print out a list of all packaged files that differ from when they were packaged.
Make sure you can run this as root on both sides (or some other user with full access to the machine):
I was thinking that rysnc already has most of this functionality but can it be used to provide the list of differences?
I can find a list of all the files on one server and compare it against the list of files on the the other server.
If you want to exclude certain paths, use commands like --exclude /var.
They also include a flag that tells you if they are considered configuration files.
This ignores any non-packaged files, but it's a very good way to get an idea of files that were changed since the install, that are part of the base system.
