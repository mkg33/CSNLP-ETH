I've managed hundreds of Cisco ASA devices and use a mix of 80:20 between working in the ASDM versus the command line.
First I created a NEW network object for each of my servers.
Sometimes people should really use the ASDM for their ASA firewalls.
Secondly I extended my access-list on my outside interface by defining every server and the required service (echo, echo-reply) in the "Public server list".
Indeed I had to extend my access-list on my outside interface!!
When you create a new object you will be asked for the internal IP address and "this is where the magic happens" you have to set the NAT IP address (the external address) !!
access-list OutsideToInside extended permit icmp any any
If you would like to anyone to be able to ping your server on public IP interface, you will need to add below ACL:
When I performed these 2 steps I was able to ping the server from the internet.
access-list OutsideToInside extended permit icmp any4 object SERVER2002 object-group DM_INLINE_ICMP_1
Or you can choose the servers instead of allowing ping to all/any.
The packet tracer GUI is very easy and would tell you exactly where this is happening.
access-list OutsideToInside extended permit icmp any4 object SERVER2004 object-group DM_INLINE_ICMP_0
access-list OutsideToInside extended permit icmp any4 object SERVER2003 object-group DM_INLINE_ICMP_2
All you configuration looks fine and I can see that you have only allowed desired traffic to your servers using ACL.
You would need to use the OutsideToInside access group, but that really should work.
