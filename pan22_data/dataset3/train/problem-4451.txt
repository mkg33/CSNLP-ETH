 This will ping all addresses in your local network
If you know the name of the other computers in the LAN, the simplest way is to ping them:
If the bare hostname doesn't work, try appending .local (ie, ping hostname.local).
This may depend on your local router or DHCP server.
Try arp -a to see your computer's current arp table.
It will show only those IP addresses your computer has interacted with.
Obviously this doesn't work well for large LANs or people with poor memories.
If you don't have further information on which computer is which, you can gain a little more information by identifying the manufacturers of the network cards through MAC address lookup.
Maybe it's a bit of overkill but you could use nmap
If you're using Macs, (assuming 10.5 or greater,) just enable VNC for desktop access and use Flame.app.
Output like this (obscured a little to hide MAC addresses on my network):
The only thing is that you would have to go farther than SSH.
1) Write: for /L %I in (1,1,254) DO ping -w 30 -n 1 168.29.0.%I
It's a really nice little utility that gives you exactly what you need, really quickly.
