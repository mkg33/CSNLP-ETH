Favorite platform is Sparc Solaris, but x64 Solaris is almost as good.
We haven't had any major problems running Java server apps with Windows, but most of our developers run Linux themselves.
We're running our Java-based web applications almost exclusively on X86-64 and Windows Server (2003 or 2008).
The reason for the OS choice is, that almost all of our customers prefer Windows servers and don't have enough experience to support *nix servers.
in fact i never considered moving it under windows or even testing performance there, on the other hand java part is not a bottleneck for me.
i feel at home with it [ yes i do know it's not expected answer, still let it count for statistics ].
Development is completely agnostic (barring above special devices), done mainly on OS X and Windows.
Linux is not on the picture as it changes too quickly without regard for compatibility and we need to have systems which will be supported for 10 years.
We go with Solaris on Sparc for servers (good HW, good performance, best OS), for workstations usually Windows because of various special devices connected to our system (automated scales, label printers, ...).
