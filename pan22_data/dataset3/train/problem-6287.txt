For the solution (mathematically speaking you can solve the problem with the solving of differential equations, but im sure they don't do it that way) of creating waves you have 3 possibilities(depending on how detailed it should get):
Now i hit a hard wall, this is the most complicated solution.
Here you can find a presentation about the mathematics of it, its not simple and there exists also differential equations for different kinds of waves.
Here is a not complete list with some differential Equations to solve more special cases (Solitons, Peakons, ...)
The game sturmovik has used this approach but i don't find the link to the article about it.
Really simple, for each wave we calculate the (absolute) distance from each point of the surface to the source and we calculate the 'hight' with the formula
We use precalculated textures and blend them together, after that we use displacement mapping (actually a method for 2d waves but the principle can also work for 1d waves)
A bit more complicated than solution 1 but not so complicated a solution 3.
I didn't implement this one but it is possible to solve these monsters.
Note that we can add as many terms together as we like (superposition principle).
