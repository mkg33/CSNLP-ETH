However, for my purposes I don't want to use IPv4 or DHCP.
I am able to ping6 another machine on my local network by its Link-local address, and vice versa, so the interface appears to work.
So, to sum up: Try setting the iface line for your bond0 interface to:
So I have an IPv6 Link-local address (derived from the MAC address), and no IPv4 address.
Ideally I'd like to be able to use the exact same file on multiple boxes without modifying it for each one, btw.
fe80::whatever:it:is) and no other IP addresses (well... loopback is okay).
the box uses the first jack for communications if it is working, otherwise it uses the second jack).
I don't have experience with your particular bonding device, but I tried out the following test in a VM on Debian Lenny with a single NIC (eth0).
Should I change "iface bond0 inet dhcp" to "iface bond0 inet6" ?
and add this line to the end of its configuration stanza:
After bringing up eth0, here's what I get from /sbin/ifconfig eth0:
I have no idea whether this is "the right way" to do it, but it works for my simplified case.
I'd like the box to come up with bond0 using ONLY the box's IPv6 self-assigned address (i.e.
I apologize for this blatantly newbie-ish question, but I'd like to do this "the right way" and not just muck about until it seems to work, and the documentation I have doesn't seem to address this case.
The above works fine, and mostly does what I want -- on boot, the box comes up and the two Ethernet jacks are used for failover/redundancy (i.e.
Currently, a Debian Linux box that I am working with has the following /etc/network/interfaces file:
