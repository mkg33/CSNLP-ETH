VMS is vastly superior for handling super scale databases due to the hardware architecture.
You DEFINITELY want something that can handle that - Oracle clustering or SQL Server clustering may work speeding this up if you really have to do that.
If you think the licensing cost are going to kill you, let me just say that you dont have an idea yet what hardware you are going to need to run it.
Hm, from my experience - are you sure MySQL is even the best database for that?
We dont talk of "10 discs" here, we talk of a high end SAN with possibly 400 upward discs in order to handle all this data - don't forget so far we dont really have ANY indices.
Not only for the saved costs disc wise, but because it means less IO - which directly translates into more performance here (as you can not cache the table in memory).
In order to process that efficiently this is a HIGH END SAN.
Which probably requires AMD and one of those really expensive Opteron 8000.
This is imho WAY above what free databases can even think of handling.
And you need proper backup procedures in place (which MySQL lacks).
Sorry to ask, but 8gb RAM wont really help (not impressed here), go for a 256gb machine...
As much as I hate to say it, you may also want to consider using IBM DB2 on a nice Mainframe - and I dont mean running a Linux VM on it.
You also may LOVE SQL Serve 2008 Data Page Compression which MAY reduce your data size around 50% on disc.
Tried looking at Oracle or SQL Server (though oracle clustering may have an advantage here)?
Once you get the first offers for the SAN you need for that - you probably will laugh at the price of  the corresponding software.
By any means, this would be (I doubt you properly represented the facts) one of the largest database installations on the world.
