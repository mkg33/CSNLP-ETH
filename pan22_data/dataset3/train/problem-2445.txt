You can specify who has the rights to read and write files.
This is why most people create an administrative policy instead.
You can set the rights so nobody can read the files, but then why place them in a network share?
Writing the file to another device would require auditing on the other device for writes.
But if you give users the right to read files, the can read the files.
You might also want to turn on auditing on the share to see who's accessing which files, but I don't believe it'll alert you if they copy the files elsewhere.
For example, you could force users to sign something saying that if they download the files off the network share onto any other device it's a termination-level offense before granting them permissions to access the share.
While you're at it, you probably want to disable USB devices, block access to cloud services on workstations used to access the files, etc., and none of that is a guarantee.
(Auditing would tell you that they accessed the file if they read or copy it.
So, to answer your question, it's probably not possible to prevent it via technical means.
This is a problem that's generally solved with an administrative policy rather than via technical means.
Also, you would need to read the event viewer to see the audit information.)
