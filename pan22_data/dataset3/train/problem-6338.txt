While creating your own denormalized structure in a RDBMS would work, the point of a RDBMS is the relational aspect.
Solr would be the easiest solution for the time being (most probably as I don't know your skillset) as it was created for handling denormalized documents.
The DBMS itself looks after storing a particular key range on a certain server and keeping redundant copies for high availability.
As an alternative, if you have Solr already set up, you can have it index your document and return it to you in multiple formats (JSON, XML, even Python dictionaries).
The obvious benefit from using SQL Server to house your JSON would be that all your information is stored in the same place and in the same environment (most likely) that you're working in.
Multi-server scale out becomes easy, at the cost of CAP compromises.
Note: In the end it is your best judgement that matters.
Solr would work well for your needs at the moment, but would it work well long term?
Solr offers a way to search through your information really fast as well as allowing you to do faceted queries as well.
Client connections are routed within the DBMS rather than in the application.
