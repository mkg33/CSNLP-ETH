If you are using a laptop, then after turning hibernate on and before turning it off, do also the following :
in my next experiment I shall toy with the "HiberFileSizePercent" registry key under:
As a 99% solution, I changed the HiberFileSizePercent value to decimal 1, which makes the hiberfil.sys only 80MB on an 8GB RAM machine.
Not a solution, but a workaround that worked for me:
I suppose I could try .001 or less, but 80MB is not much.
And next time I run out of space on the C drive, I can still delete the 1GB file..
I thought about creating a small hiberfil.sys, but I think that would ave been overwritten.
Could this be caused by a restore partition or similar?
this is really frustrating since I'm running Win7 Ultimate on a 60 GB partition.
So I removed it with powercfg -h. But it just kept coming back after about 10 seconds or something.
and see if that might force it to (re-)create a smaller file at least.
I think it has something to do with PointSec because that was mentioned earlier here.
My Windows 7x64 install is on an SSD partition on a Mac laptop.
out of frustration, I even configured the local policy such that it would run a cmd on machine startup that would run the powercfg line, but even that's not good enough!
Now it doesn't come back and I have still 6GB of space left.
I guess it's still trying to enable hibernation and finds that there is no longer enough space for that.
I tried to change the permissions in regedit, but they did not stop the value change to 1.
Then I disabled hibernation, and then quickly copied a 1GB file over to the C drive.
I've disabled with powercfg /h off (elevated) and ms fixit's disable hibernate, as well as the setting registry key HibernateEnable value to 0.
I had only 900MB of free space on my C drive and wanted to get rid of the hiberfil.sys file, which took more than 6GB.
Tom Wijsman's suggestion of ProcessMonitor with boot logging helped me find that vmtoolsd.exe (from VMware) was re-enabling the registry key during the native boot.
Maybe manually recreate it after the removal and set permissions to disallow the system to modify the file?
When I boot native hiberfil.sys is always re-created, but when I boot inside OS X and VMware Fusion, the hibernation stays disabled, as it should.
