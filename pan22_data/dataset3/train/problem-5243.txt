Your AP is MyWifiAP and you must create file /etc/wpa_supplicant/MyWifiAP.conf that contains your access data.
Since I am using SSH to control the Pi, I always have to connect it to the router via an Ethernet cable.
For unknown reason wicd (gui that is used) did not work.
Type startx to enter the GUI, then there should be a icon for wifi.
After struggles - and I know it is not an ideal solution - I created a script:
It should connect automatically after you set up wifi on the pi's GUI.
VERIFY that it works with  wpa_supplicant before you use it.
To do this you need to connect a monitor and keyboard to the pi then boot up on the pi(not over SSH).
My new Raspberry Pi 3 is great, but I am facing one difficulty: my router is in the lounge (one floor down), and my laptop has no Ethernet port.
A mistake in rc.local could lead to a necessity to edit your SD card to revert changes back.
This did not make the Pi connect automatically to wifi.
I think this was some error in debian distribution or systemd...
Click on it, find your network, and it should remember the network, even after you reboot.
Is there any way to automatically connect my Pi to wifi right after booting up?
In other words, I want to power up the Pi without any network connection, and it should automatically connect to the wifi.
The script resides wherever,  it can be run on background from /etc/rc.local (nohup + &).
Also, I can't use the GPIO pins from my room as I have to be close to the router.
One thing I tried was to edit the /etc/wpa-supplicant/wpa-supplicant.conf file to include only the SSID and PSK of my home's wifi connection.
