Is there an easy way of specifying (as a matter of policy?)
that only a specific NIC should register its address in the AD DNS, so that client name resolution for other clients only returns a private address?
Therefore, CLIENT01 looking up the IP address for CLIENT02 first gets the AAAA record, and then the public A record, then the private A record.
In the Advanced TCP/IP settings for the IPv4 and IPv6 configuration of the external adapters, uncheck Register this connection's address in DNS in the DNS tab.
Each server has two NICs, a public and private NIC.
The AD DNS has registered A and AAAA records for each IP address, for each client.
I'm hosting some Windows servers on Rackspace, and have added them to a domain.
Also, the firewalls on each device behave differently for each NIC.
I know for my purposes, I only want the clients communicating with each other on the private network, because public bandwidth is billable.
The public NIC has a public IPv4 and IPv6 address, while the private NIC has an RFC1918 address for communicating with other VMs within the datacenter.
