These compress very poorly and therefore will be lost work.
You should also consider whether the program you are using stores its data in compressed format.
So i think you would be better off with slow 5400 rpm drive.
It depends on how fast your processor is and how slow the drive is.
Compressing and decompressing a file is processor intensive task (varies a lot depending on file sizes and how frequently files are created/modified).
(unfortunately I don't know exactly how to do this in Win 7)
NTFS Compression is heavily reliant on CPU performance.
I dont think compression is going to improve performance.
But especially movies are usually played rarely and can easily be stored on a slow drive.
Implementing disk-wide NTFS compression on your system drive will increase performance because the processor will decompress the file very very quickly.
If you really need to get that little extra speed you could move these on your slow drive and place a link instead on your SSD.
If it does then trying to compress/decompress it will result in even worse performance.
If your CPU can compress/decompress the data faster than the drive can read/write the uncompressed data then that is the way to go.
Given that huge amount of data it uses there is a good chance that the data is stored compressed.
Yet, repeated read/writes would drastically influence performance as well.
Compressing a file reduces the size on the disk, thus the disk reads the file quicker, and the additional time taken to decompress the file in the CPU is very small, thus you have a net performance increase.
These days with Intel Haswell and AMD Richland CPUs, we have super computers on our laps.
Typically the files that take the lot of space are movies and music.
