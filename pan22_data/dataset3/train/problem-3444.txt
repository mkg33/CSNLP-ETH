--> deleted the group (change groupname to yours, no quotes)
I wanted to remove a device that appeared in my file browser, because it is from another OS that i dont want to access from Ubuntu.
I wanted to remove the device mapper device reference in my file browser.
When i rebooted, the device didnt reappear in my browser.
The answer by wazoox worked for me, to remove the device mapper reference.
--> lists all the devices and showed me the UUID came from device mapper
Its not a new or separate device, its just a new reference.
Device mapper creates references to partitions or devices, and associates a UUID that is different to the one seen in partition managers.
When i reopened the file browser, that persistent device was gone.
You can just get rid of the reference, there is no need to clean up your partitions or devices.
--> showed the persistently displayed device, and another of same OS
Hiding the partitions using /etc/udev/rules.d/ didnt work.
--> showed me that i had one group, corresponding to the OS of the device
