It happened to me in the past to got a defect part as a replacement.
So we buy new system board (spare 583736-001) and when i replace it storage start to power on, but with error code 1611 - Fan Solution Not Sufficient, Fan 4 missing and power off in 5 seconds.
I try different fans (i have some spare fans), clear nwram (System maintenance swich S6), to swap fans - nothing helps.
Initially, I had such a problem: HP P4500 G2 does not turn on.
Then i try to popolate fan connector #4 with additional single fan and storage can post (with fan 4 warning) and load os.
Or may be someone have system board replacement guide?
(From HP ProLiant DL180 G6 Server Maintenance and Service Guide)
Storage have "Redundant Fan Configuration" - 4 pair of fans, i plug them to following connectors:
I also think that it may be old BIOS firmware (10/14/2010), but firmware from DL180 G6 is unsuitable, and i can find special P4500 G2 BIOS.
But this is not the solution - I think that the problem is probably in the Jumper Setting, but i cant find and guide for HP P4500 G2 system board or matetials on HP Partner Services Media Library.
As for the connection if you replaced and watched what you did they are no chance that you did a error at that level.
