I explicitly have my settings in Windows update set to,
So at the very least I should be getting notified that updates are available.
This problem began a few months ago and it this point it is becoming annoying.
FYI: I am running Windows 7 Ultimate Service Pack 1 (64-bit) with 8 GB RAM dedicated to the VM in Fusion 8.1.0 on an iMac 5K (2014 model) with OS X 10.11.3 with 32GB RAM.
I checked my update settings, which had not changed, but Windows Update still does not check for and notify me of new updates for my Windows installation as it should.
I run Windows 7 Ultimate in a virtual machine (VMware Fusion) on an iMac (Retina 5K 2014).
The Win7 VM was built from an image of the Dell Studio XPS I had in the office up until the motherboard died—the VM is recognized as a Dell Studio XPS 435T in the System control panel—and,  excepting a few Fusion quirks from time-to-time, my Windows 7 VM has always worked just as it did on the Dell hardware from the time I got the iMac in February 2015.
After several weeks of not getting notifications, I manually checked Windows Update one morning to find that I had an excessive number of updates awaiting to be downloaded, so I spent the better part of a wasted workday downloading and installing several weeks of updates.
At some point last fall, I noticed that I was not getting the regular Windows update messages that I was typically getting roughly every week.
