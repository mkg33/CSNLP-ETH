The System Restore Task Schedule which create a restore point each time a user is logging in...
My set up has 16GB of RAM, by the way; I highly doubt it's a case of a memory leak because I've yet to see half of that completely full, let alone the 16GB.
(Also, don't ask what programs or processes do I have opened because I'm fairly sure that's irrelevant; the cpu usage for instance doesn't go up before freezing, I know how the fan sounds like when a process is stuck in an endless loop increasingly demanding cpu time and that's definitively not the case, ie I can't hear a change in the fan before it freezes)
Now, I understand pcs/laptops are supposed to do a proper shutdown/restart from time to time, and I may be just hitting on something Windows 7 simply doesn't handle well, but still: is there something I can do about it?
Few months ago I was experiencing the same problem with W7 64 bits Home Premium edition
and I finally find the "culprit" (with the help of Sysinternals Process Explorer...):
The solution I suggest is to disable this scheduled task:
So I have noticed an interesting and equally annoying pattern of Windows 7: no matter what you do, if day after day you always hibernate and never shutdown eventually (after approximately a week or so) a crash is guaranteed; at some absolutely random point everything will just freeze leaving no option but to restart.
