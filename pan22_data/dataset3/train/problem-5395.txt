I won't laugh the next time a colleague says "cosmic ray" when we fail to identify the cause of a crash...
You might want to have a look at this google study :
If you don't want to reboot into memtest86+ you can get some results by
running memtester for testing the memory to find if it is faulty or not.
But they talking about ECC RAM, not your everyday user RAM
It has several tests for catching the borderline of the memory, and produces a verbose report of faults located, tests run, and the time taken for finding the faults in the computer.
It does a realistically good job for finding the irregular faults as well as with the non-deterministic faults in it.
Do you have the option to use 'mirrored memory' in your system - that would tell you if you have memory problems or not - with that in place there's MUCH less chance that any errors are due to physical memory problems.
No need to reboot you can run it on a running Linux system.
Harris quotes a study performed over 2.5 years on Google's fleet of servers.
From Robin Harris' DRAM error rates: Nightmare on DIMM street:
I didn't find any link for the app but here is the debian package information:
Note that servers usually use EEC RAM, which performs some error correction.
