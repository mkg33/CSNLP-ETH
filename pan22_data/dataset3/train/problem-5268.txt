I tried to turn it on manually in the Customize section of the Tray, selecting "Show icon and notifications" on the MS OneNote Quick Launcher, but was told "This icon is not active and will not be visible until it becomes active"
According to this post, that "sometimes happens" and can be turned back on by toggling the checkbox lableled "Place onenote notification icon in the taskbar" (under File -> Options -> Display, if using OneNote 2010).
So my point is, make sure your Windows key isn't disabled either by hardware or software.
By the way, this is a Windows 7 machine, and I know that this will not resolve issues on Windows 8 or 8.1, as the functionality has been modified in those OS's.
(I.e., it didn't turn on the Notification icon in the tray).
In my case, it was pure user error...  and may be for others too!
With MS OneNote installed, I could use the Windows + s key-combo to launch the screen capture utility.
Then using the shortcut mentioned above in the startup folder to relaunch it.
I also ran into this issue and the fix was to close onenote.exe via Taskmanager.
If the "Place OneNote icon in the notification area..." checkbox is selected, you should find a OneNote Screen Clipper and Launcher shortcut in your Startup folder.
I'm using a gaming keyboard... that has a switch to disable the Windows key while in games...  and it was switched to disable the Windows key!
I know this is a response to an old thread, but since I've experienced this frustrating issue off and on for a while and have been unable to find an answer (until I figured it out literally 30 seconds ago) I figured I'd post the solution that worked for me.
Just click that to manually activate the taskbar icon.
I'm happy to report that Windows + S now works flawlessly.
