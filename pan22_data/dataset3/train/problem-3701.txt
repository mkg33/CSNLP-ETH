For example if you have a 128Kbps tune, converting it to 320Kbps will not make it sound any better.
Converting music to a higher quality format does not make the audio better quality.
However if you have a FLAC or WAV converting to Apple Lossless would be beneficial, mainly for compatibility and the ability to add ID tags and album art to the file.
Converting to a different format would only be useful for compatibility or to save file space.
I am a big fan of dBpoweramp, but there are many other alternatives that you can find with a quick Google search.
The vast majority of the AAC files in my library were created using dBpoweramp which uses the NERO encoder.
Obviously I can't just create AAC versions of the files I already have because they would sound worse (lossy compression to converted to more lossy compression), so I'm going to their source and downloading them in a lossless form and using a third party to make them into AAC.
Also before you jump on my back about pirating, these files are from old CDs that I lost years ago.
Apparently iTunes will not handle AAC files that aren't made with iTunes.
@Zoredache Converting to Apple Lossless would just increase file size with no quality benefits  if the source is MP3, regardless of the MP3's bitrate.
There are a large number of 3rd party tools that can easily convert between various formats.
I have a library filled with some old MP3 files and I'm in the process of changing them all to AAC for the better sound quality.
Anyway, in my opinion you should skip the AAC and go directly to Apple lossless, and then you can do whatever you want within iTunes.
I've looked at third party programs and would be willing to use them, but since they all require the iTunes/iPod/iEverything driver, I don't know if they would still prevent my files or not.
A valid AAC file that doesn't include some DRM encapsulation and properly conforms to the standards should work perfectly fine with iTunes.
