Part of my site needs to run over HTTPS and I'm creating a sub-domain for that part.
I don't think this forwarding technique can work in this case.
Right now I am doing domain forwarding for requests that need to run off tomcat.
Actually, you can configure virtual hosts to forward all types of requests, including 443.
Just setup two virtual hosts for the same server, but forward by port.
I would like to have Tomcat handle the https requests for that subdomain.
I have apache httpd 2 AND Tomcat 7 running on the same server with the same IP, Apache is on port 80 of course, while Tomcat is running on port 8080.
http://proctinator.com ==> request goes to Apache web server
Port 80 can go to your webhost and 443 to your tomcate via ajp or http proxy.
For example, mathteamhosting.com/mathApp can forward to  mathteamhosting.com:8080/mathApp.
You'll have to tinker around with the config settings a little, but this should provide the setup you describe.
https://private.proctinator.com ==> request goes to Apache web server
How do I set that up so that Tomcat receives the requests on port 443 while apache handles port 80.
