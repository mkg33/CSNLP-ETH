I have a rented dedicated server that seems to have run into some issues.
I have full access to the disk of the server and should be able to gain access to the registry.
Last night I received an email saying that the server had gone offline and it had been booted into a recovery OS (WinPE).
I'm assuming you can download files from your servers hard drive.
I have attempted to reboot into windows only to have the same thing happen again with the server never coming online thus making me think it will no longer boot.
The ideal would be to turn on boot logging but as I cannot access it pre-boot (The F8 boot menu) I don't know of another way to turn on boot logging.
Literally any ideas on this would be a great help I'm banging my head against the wall and looking at the reinstall button with disgust.
Unfortunately I have rented from a company who will only give hardware support leaving me in the dark.
restore bcd file to appropriate path and reboot server with fingers crossed ;)
My server had been running happily for three months with no reboot and nothing extra installed since the last reboot.
Grab your BCD file from your servers boot partition.
I can remotely reinstall the OS but obviously I don't want to loose what was a weeks worth of work configuring the server.
