Having a look around at the time I saw lots of posts/tips about just appending
If you're having issues with Chrome, they're stemming from something else.
Running any x86 application under a Windows x64 operating system will start them in 32-bit emulation mode ("wow64").
Non-64 bit apps work just fine under 64-bit Windows Vista/Windows 7.
to the shortcut for chrome, after trying this and still not having luck, I found more posts including what seemed ones from the Chrome developers saying this was not wise and exposed a security risk.
Before my W7 x64 computer broke, I was using Chrome as my primary browser.
This was not the case when the beta was first released, but the Chrome devs have since fixed the problem(s).
You didn't need to do anything special to install it.
So does anyone have a well sourced answer, as to what's holding up Win 7 64-bit support in Chrome, or better yet an "official" answer to say that it is supported in Win7 x64 RTM and works well now...
Being on a 64-bit installation it came up with a 'non-supported OS' or some error (can't remember).
The only thing that may cause problems could be applications such as games which may not run in emulation mode.
As soon as I jumped onto one of the beta releases for Windows 7, I tried to install Google Chrome.
So there should be no problem at all with normal applications.
