Reformatting my system will eat up a day or two of my time and I just don't have the time to spare right now.
I think somehow my Windows Explorer has become corrupted.
Might not be an explorer issue, run chkdsk /r, then run a memory and hard disk diagnostic
Before reformatting the system and starting over, which is most likely what I'm going to be forced to do, I'd like explore (no pun intended) my options in fixing the problem with a patch or reinstall or something of that nature.
I'm running Windows Vista Home Premium on a Sony Vaio laptop.
I've also had problems launch certain apps, like Adobe InDesign CS3, that just basically freeze the system but leave mouse movements functioning for a short time before freezing the entire system which requires a hard reboot to  resolve the freeze.
If you don't have the CD of windows vista, you can burn one by following theses instructions
You can try a automated repair if you have a CD of windows vista.
I don't recall any certain inciting incident like installing an unreputable 3rd party app or hardware failure but just recently my system won't wake after it's been left idle longer that 20 minutes and goes to sleep.
Boot on the CD and instead of choosing install, choose automated repair and this will replace any corrupted files that might be in the Explorer program.
The system seems to run normally when used but I fear there's a looming possibility that this is a house of cards and will all come crashing down soon.
My question is this, can Windows Explorer be repaired/fixed?

You're assuming it's Explorer based on nothing at all.
Explorer may work fine in a new account, which will save you the bother of having to reinstall the OS and all your programs.
Run the Task Manager and see if a process is getting stuck.
