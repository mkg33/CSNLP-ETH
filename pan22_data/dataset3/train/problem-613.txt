You'll continue to run into issues with 64-bit for now (until more app vendors create x64 apps), unless you use a small set of applications that for sure work in a 64 bit environment.
You will need to do some testing to verify that any quirks don't appear, but by and large users are quite happy at seeing the same hardware that ram 32-bit xp or vista, show a dramatic speed increase just by going to 64 bit.
I guess this is just another example of your 'obvious issue' but the Cisco VPN clients we use do not work on 64bit.
Vista 64 will run any 32-bit app but it uses Windows on Windows to do so.
It's probably not noticeable by an average user with MS Word and Outlook open all day, but for heavy load systems it could be quite a difference.
On my laptop, though, I usually just use MS Office and IE, so Windows 7 x64 has worked fine for that.
The systemroot is different under WOW to ensure that a 32-bit app does not call any native 64 bit OS dlls.
For example, my desktop is Vista x32 because I have tons of programs that I need for various projects.
Servers is another ball-game, 64bit there usually only comes with sunny days.
Right now my best advice is to stay on 32bit on desktops unless you actually need it.
On the bright side: 64bit desktop OS is fabolous for CAD users, heavy 3D modeling users etc.
So my bottom line advice is to stick with x32 unless you run a limited set of applications that work in x64.
Other drawbacks I've seen at our company is 32bit applications having troubles intergrating with the explorer interface (like the right-click context menu on files).
Running a 32-bit OS today on modern processors is like buying a mansion and living in the closet.
Running 32bit applications on a 64bit operating system allocates larger blocks of memory than needed.
The biggest drawback to vista 64 is running 32 bit apps that expect a 32-bit OS to run on.
