and if you seperate them as virtual boxes, they all still be on the same hardware, so i'd say keeping them on one machine may be a better solution...unless u plan on moving them offf to seperate hardware/virtial systems..
but since you are on a virutal environment yo probably have a good hardware raid and I/O wouldnt be the problem.
In an environment where each service can produce a substantial load, I would definitely recommended to separate them into individual (physical) machines, mostly because the context switching can cause a lot of overhead.
This is a classic example of a scalability problem.
Running them in virtual machines will definitely make your life easier when you have to scale out, but it does add to the overheads of the physical machine than runs all the VMs.
So all in all, it all depends on what kind of load you are going to thru at each of the services.
IDE subsystem may perform fine for one or two users but as soon as you start adding load, the IDE sub system may cause a bottleneck.
I would not recommend running IIS and Apache on the same (virtual) machine.
I dont think you can classify this in a category to make a decision.
Bottom line - u need to say something more about typical usage of each service.
This should not be a problem for a handful of developers accessing the resources, but depending on the size of the projects/commits/updates/branch merges etc it may cause a slowdown i the I/O speed is slow/limited.
However, I doubt that a dozen developers can produce substantial load on any of the named services.
