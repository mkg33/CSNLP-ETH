It would probably be best to take the case off first though.
They are labelled with a little waterdrop+keyboard icon, too.
If you're wondering how, it's simple: The hair dryer induces quick drying.
After the wash, I set it on it's cooling fan base, set up a hair dryer to blow into it, and let it sit for 2 hours.
Hair dryer + cooling fan = hot air flowing through the laptop (a lot like the fan in your car) and drying it before anything that can rust, does rust.
Maybe not worth the risk to some of you, but it can be done.
You would need to dry it for several days and in a way where the water has a way out.
Pop the memory and the battery back in and PRESTO!
But to keep from causing heat damage inside, you put the cooling fan underneath to draw out the heated air.
. . once a month, I remove the battery and the memory and toss it in the dishwasher without soap.
I'm not about to test whether this will disperse liquids rapidly enough to wash under a tap, though!
More related to spillage, rather than deliberate washing, but Thinkpads have a drip tray under the keyboard which drains through to a couple of dedicated holes on the underside of the machine.
I have a $1400 laptop so, common sense would say not to risk it.
