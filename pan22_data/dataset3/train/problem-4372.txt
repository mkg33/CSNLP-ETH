If I understand correctly, /usr/bin precedes /usr/local in /etc/paths, so the version of git in /usr/bin/git (the Xcode version) is used.
So, this is a bit old, but I have the answer to your original question.
The OS X installer adds git to /usr/local/git/bin.
check which directory the git version that you want is in... mine was in usr/local/git/bin
in order to add this to the PATH accordingly (even though it was already theoretically in the PATH, I had to add it at the beginning to take precedence over the git 1.7.5.4 in the other folder) I added the following lines to my .bash_profile:
For anyone who is a total noob like me and didn't know how to access .bash_profile, this is how I got to it (using vim text editor):
I'm assuming (perhaps wrongly) that you have both versions installed in different directories.
It also adds /usr/local/git/bin to the /etc/paths.d.
The answer is here: http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/issues/detail?id=67
Did 1.7.9.4 get installed into a directory that is later in your path than the directory containing 1.7.5.4?
I then quit terminal and started it up again to give it a chance to piece together the new PATH and it worked for me.
However, for some reason adding a trailing slash to the entry in /etc/paths.d will force the system to use the /usr/local/git/bin version instead.
Installer showed it was installed, but when checking the version number in the terminal it showed that it was still version 1.7.5.4
I've already checked if the paths are ok in .bash_profile.
