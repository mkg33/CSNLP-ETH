The Application is quite disk heavy, but we've changed the drives from Raided SATA to a faster SSD Disk, and there has been no improvement.
It doesn't look like the issue is caused by a lack of processor, or a lack of memory.
We think it may be something to do with unloading/loading Hives as users log on, but this is a guess.
We're running an Application as a remote App using Remote Desktop on Windows server 2008, and we're getting situations where (after we've got about 40 people logged in) the server can freeze for a number of seconds (e.g.
The Application ran fine on RDP in Windows Server 2000 (up to 100 users) (Although it started to slow down as the server ran out of memory)
 - Anyone else experienced an issue like this - And how did you fix it?
 - How do I find out what could be causing this error?
The Application is a 32 bit App running in a 64 bit environment and 8GB of RAM.
Looking at the Various Monitors, there is a peak in processor and network usage at the time of the freezes, although this seems to be more associated with the server catching its breath after it unfreezes.
