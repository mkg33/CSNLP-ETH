though many of your engineers will also use this convention as well.
since this question focuses on a modelling tool, and is placed on a gamedevelopment Q&A site.
also realize that some system the axis system is hard set, and permanent, and others it can be modified (think it can be changed in Blender and Unreal, but might be mistaken)
while 3DsMax, and Unreal have Z-up (probably designed by mathematicians/engineers).
because X/Y was drawn on the paper that was flat on the table when the Z-axis was extended it was coming up out of the paper, and therefore up.
in regards to the convention used by the given tool: Maya, and Unity have Y-up (probably designed by someone with a physics background).
As far as I have ever gleaned the Y = up/down, and Z = depth is based off of physics where gravity is always in the (-Y) direction, and then adding 3D means you don't want to change a fundamental, so it was made depth.
you might want to look into what coordinate system you will be exporting to, and make sure that you conform to that.
On the Z = up/down method though that is a throw back to mathematicians.
though it can also be said that these could also be just a split decision made one day because a consistent system had to be used.
