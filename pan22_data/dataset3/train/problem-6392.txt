You can bring up Windows 10 context menu's regarding the touchpad by right clicking on the start button on the bottom left of the screen.
While I can't help with your specific set up - I can give you a hint of a few places to look.
For Synaptics Touchpad v1.5 on SMB Port, go to Control Panel, Mouse & Touchpad, then click Additional Mouse Options at the bottom of the panel on the right.
There is also an 'other options' that may show different data for you than it does for me since you set up is different.
I found mind as "switch direction" in a synaptics tab.
1) Check out the touchpad software settings (for my machines, that's usually the synaptics touchpad software).
Under the Two Finger Column, check the box next to "Content moves reversely with your finger's direction."
There is the "mouse" field here (which offers different buttons than the control panel route).
Select the Device Settings tab and click the Settings button.
On a Lenovo ThinkPad, it's Control Panel > Change Mouse Settings > Settings button on the UltraNav tab > expand Scrolling, click on Two-Finger Scrolling > uncheck Enable reverse scrolling direction
Go to Control Panel, like Browning IT said, but instead of clicking on the "Mouse" option, click on "Asus Smart Gesture" instead.
Settings > Devices > Mouse & Touchpad > Additional Mouse Options > Devices Settings > Settings > Multi Finger.
There are usually several tabs here, you will have to hunt for which one will be relevant for your touchpad.
The option you want to toggle is Enable reverse scrolling direction.
