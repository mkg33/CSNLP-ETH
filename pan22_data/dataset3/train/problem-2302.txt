Better even than gitosis is gitolite, which is newer and more flexible.
Now my question is, What's next?, the git documentation is a little bit confusing,
I wrote a blog post about it not long ago: http://colonelpanic.net/2011/01/git-and-gitolite-nirvana/
I want to setup a git repository, three of four users will contribute, so they need to download the code and shall be able to upload their changes to the server or update their branch with the latest modifications.
i am a little bit lost with this issue, let me explain you my problem:
So, i setup a linux machine, install git, setup the repository, then add the users in order to enable the acces throught ssh.
i want to avoid using git-daemon or gitosis, sorry, maybe my question sound silly but git is powerfull but i admit not so user friendly.
when i try from a dummy user account to clone the repository i got:
gitosis-admin is the best way to get rolling with serving git, IMO.
You install the software, setup a "git" user, put each user's SSH public key into the config file, and you're done.
