My client sells an industrial application that runs on a custom system with multiple drives and partitions on those drives.
If so, is there any way of defeating this for drives that aren't frozen?
The issue is that without Deep Freeze installed, I can run the application, which saves new data to the E: drive.
Drive C: is frozen with Deep Freeze, but the other drives are not frozen.
However, with Deep Freeze installed, and only C: frozen/thawed (the operating system lives there), the same procedure leaves me with data loss.
Files that seem to be present on the drive before the forced power-off, are gone after power loss and boot.
I can kill the power to the system, boot back up, and the data has been written to the E: drive properly.
Does DF interfere with NTFS's journaling capability?
Does it have some sort of caching mechanism for non-frozen drives?
Drives D-F are used for data storage and retrieval by my client's industrial application.
I can repeat this over and over again, ad nauseum, with the same result: with DF, data loss, without DF, no data loss.
