Sort it by the Network Column and check the application that's consuming the bandwidth.
Have you installed anything like DropBox, OneDrive, or similar which might be attempting to sync a lot of data from your system to 'The Cloud'?
Since you haven't provided any information to go on, I'll go out on a limb and say your new machine could be downloading Windows updates, and your home network probably has a bufferbloat problem, so TCP congestion control isn't working, so your big downloads ruin things for everyone instead of sharing nicely.
Short term, put your laptop on a fast network until it finishes downloading the updates it needs.
In my experience when a device connected to a network causes a massive slowdown on that network, it's usually the upload bandwidth that's being consumed.
If so, pause the application and see if your connectivity returns to normal.
Since it's an ASUS laptop, I presume it's running Windows 10.
If they don't then that's a good sign that your laptop is downloading something (like windows updates) and that is what is consuming your bandwidth.
You could also try connecting the laptop to your network using the 5GHz frequency (dependant on your wireless adapter being capable of finding them and your modem being able to stream them) since this network is less used and often has a better bandwidth to work with.
I would still highly recommend using data cable to download updates since it will be quite faster and you won't clog your wireless network.
If so, you can use the Task Manager's 'Processes' tab to view which applications are using the network.
Fix your network's bufferbloat problem to fix this long-term.
Try connecting your laptop using an Ethernet cable to see if other devices get their network traffic congested as well this way.
