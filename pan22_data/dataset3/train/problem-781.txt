This was highly unusual given the Xbox was connected directly to a powerful DD-WRT router and speedtest was showing 60mbps down and 6mbps up.
However you could test this case (It's properly not the problem) by setting a different DNS server (See here to see how to do it with Windows) to one that will mostly give you the correct IP (Google DNS as an example 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).
I was having issues with streaming quality for NHL.tv, even on a connected app built into an Xbox One S. Quality was horrible.
This solved the problem, I'm now back to high quality streaming.
Troubleshooting at the NHL.com website suggested changing back to ISP's DNS servers, which I did.
When the the server allows the connection and many other people use the same DNS server and get to the same server the speed of the server itself could a problem.
If this works you should move to a other DNS service permanently.
The only thing that could happen is that the DNS resolves your Domain directly to a server instant to a load balancer.
The IP-Address is then used by your computer to connect to the real server, which provides the content then.
All it does is translating a domain (http://xyz.com) into an IP-address (111.222.121.212).
