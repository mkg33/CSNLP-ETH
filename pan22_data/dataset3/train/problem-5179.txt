My question is: Is it a bad idea to have a buffer_pool_size greater than the size of the database itself.
Which, I assume means that I have more data loaded into the cache.
Is it bad to effectively have all the data in the buffer_pool ?
Which, reading around (and running mysql-tuner script) seems about sane.
Now, the physical size of the database is about 5Gig, and the available RAM on the server is 32Gigs.
If instead I run select * from <table> I get a heap more RAM used.
It seems the clients database server has never had any performance tuning done.
It seems to make no sense to me to make the innodb_buffer_pool_size = 25G.
Reading other posts on the net, the suggestion is to run a bunch of select count (*) from <table> to warm it.
If I do that, I get the amount of RAM at point (1) in the picture below.
Upon reading around, it seems the one thing is to set innodb_buffer_pool_size to "80% of the available RAM".
Is it better to run select * or select count(*) for warming the cache?
I have a couple of questions about tuning a MySQL (5.5) database.
