If the connection bar is set to show (which is the default) then it requires hitting Tab a couple of times to minimize the RDP session: CTRL+ALT+Home Tab Tab Spacebar.
Then I can switch among 4 remote desktops in full screen with one mouse click each.
Set next desktop to Alt + Scroll Lock (If like I you don't have scroll lock use windows on-screen keyboard to press "ScrLk")
Also if you only need 2 screens you can set dexpot to use only 2 desktops which will make alt + caps lock quick toggle for remote desktop.
Now use Autohotkey to make redirections (this way Caps Lock will be prevented from changing it's state):
However, Virtual Dimension doesn't work quite right in Windows 7 (at least in 64 bit).
At first annoying to set up, but in the long term the most comfortable.
CTRL + ALT + BREAK will minimize the maximized window to the host PC.
Now you can use Alt + Caps Lock to switch between screens without Caps Lock changing it's states.
I like to be able to quickly switch with left hand only
CTRL+ALT+Home brings focus to the Remote Desktop Connection bar.
In Windows 7, if I un-check "Display the connection bar when I use the full screen" option when making the connection, then the keys to minimize the RPD session are CTRL+ALT+Home Spacebar.
Alt + Caps Lock without Caps Lock annoying state changes (Good if you don't have Scroll Lock)
It seems to work but it loses the "always on top" though the checkbox stays on, the virtual desktop switcher does not.
The best solution I found in XP was virtual dimension with the virtual desktops always on top.
