I want to load all assets from cache without communicating with the server if possible.
What would be the required change in my nginx configuration?
Remember, you can never control what requests any user agent will make you can only give it instructions and hope it listens.
First thing, a 304 HTTP Status does not contain a message-body, rather it should not as described in specifications, there are some specific conditions based on cache validators also, check W3C documentation for more details.
Like Martin pointed out, you give a "directive" and leave it to that, but the browser will check whether to use the cached copy or not.
And lastly, if you trying to view the effect of all of this on page by a refresh, you might still get 304 responses due to requests initiated by browsers, which is something you cannot really control AFAIK.
What you're looking for is expires max; This sets a far-future header which most browsers will take to mean don't even bother asking if the resource was modified.
However when I use Google Chrome Developer Tools to observe network traffic, some of the assets are loaded from cache (200-from cache) while most of the assets are making a request to the server (304 Not Modified).
Additionally, you can add a age and max-age headers keeping max-age higher than age to sometimes avoid even a 304.
You should refer to HTTP specifications IMHO; and fully understand the mechanism behind caching and the meaning of 304, it doesn't transfer same data like a 200 response does.

I am running nginx, and have the following block for expiration:
