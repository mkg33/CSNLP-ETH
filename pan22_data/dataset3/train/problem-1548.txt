I am looking for a router that will support 4-5 MLPPP interfaces.
So what I am looking for is some commercial or otherwise solution that is less than $800 and will support at least 4 MLPPP interfaces.
MLPPP is supported in any Cisco router capable of running IOS 11.1.
The Mikrotik Routerboard RB750 has 5 ports, supports MLPPP, and costs ~$40.
I'm not a fan of the Microtik gear (personal preference).
I believe m0n0wall (download, docs) will support what you're looking for.
The larger versions have direct ADSL & T1 interfaces (mutiple on the SRX240, albeit well above your budget).
As soon as I try and add a third interface it doesn't seem to work properly with the wrt54g.
Mikrotik also sells various other hardware for additional larger loads.
I have been using the tomato mlppp patch from fixppp.org which works fine for 2 interfaces.
Combined with some of the available Soekris boards, or other devices as you prefer, it appears to be able to handle this situation.
I have looked into ZeroShell and tried to install this but the hardware that I have (PC with Dlink dfe-530tx) has issues with the network cards for some reason.
There have previously been discussions on Broadband Reports with reports of good success bonding 4 DSL lines together.
Another option from a more well known vendor is the Juniper SRX100.
