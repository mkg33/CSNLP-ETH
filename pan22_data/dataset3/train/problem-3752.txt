Have a look at the Myths and Facts About Intel Macs page on their site.
Also, the flash drive has to feature a HFS+ filesystem.
The Flash Drive has to have a GUID Partition Table.
This should work as of Fedora 10, but it's not automatic; you need to create a USB stick specifically configured for this purpose.
Other details on creating a USB stick are in the Fedora wiki, though curiously nothing about support for Intel Macs.
However, this post suggests that the MBR may also need to be cleared (destroying all existing data on the USB disk):
As far as I know, it's not possible to create a USB stick that will boot on both Intel Macs and non-EFI machines.
I've had success with this method in the past, though it seems somewhat hit and miss.
I'm not sure you can do this directly; you might require something like rEFit to be able to boot into an Intel Mac with your live usb.
The Windows7 Tool diskpart finally implemented this or of course MacOSX itself.
According to the Fedora 10 release notes, you can do this using the livecd-iso-to-disk tool like so:
Or see if it is visible as a startup disk (System Preferences Â» Startup Disk) and boot from there (reboot).
