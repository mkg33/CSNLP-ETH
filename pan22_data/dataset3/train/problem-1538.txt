When the "combat manager" (instantiated to manage each individual fight) works out what move the enemy and your person will make, it should tell the Animator to play the animation specific to the selected move.
Sorry if the title is confusing, but I literally don't even know how to summarise this into a title.
2) How do you get the int value of that enum value?
If this is confusing, please comment what makes no sense and I will try to explain, I'm honestly so lost that I don't even know how to ask what I need to ask.
1) How do you find an enum value whose name equals a given string?
IF anyone is wondering what I mean by 'int value', Fafase's answer at http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/764091/using-c-enums-to-control-an-animator.html says that each enum value has an int value by default, which can be used in animation conditions; however I have no idea how to access them, which part 2 of my problem.
"Right Middle Jab"), remove the spaces and search for an enum value whose name is that string (eg.
Now it has the corresponding enum value, it retrieves the int value of that (eg.
I have an animation for each of those possible moves.
The script controlling the Animator has a public enum "CombatMove" containing every possible move (ie.
The player's Animator has a state for each possible move, containing that move's animation.
move's string name, turned into an enum value name, turned into its int value, used to specify which move animation should be played.
It then sends that int value to the Animator, where each move's transition will occur if the int value equals the move's int value on the enum.
So the Combat Manager will get the name of the move (eg.
