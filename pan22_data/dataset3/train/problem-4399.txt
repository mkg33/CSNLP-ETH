I'm pretty sure I've heard that you can set up php.ini files on a per-site basis, but don't know how to go about doing this.
If you do not want to set this value for the whole of the site, but to one particular directory where the application lives, then you can specify the values within a .
It also allows you to specify a PHP version for each VirtualHost.
In your case you can specify the configuration values within the  context.
See http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php for more explanation.
The following example should set upload_max_filesize to 10M for the virtual host example.com.
Yet another option is suPHP which allows you to define a php.ini for each VirtualHost.
You can also specify configuration settings in the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf/apache.conf).
Until recently having a global php.ini file has been just fine, but recently one of our developers has requested some settings in php.ini that I'd rather not set globally.
I have a LAMP server serving a number of different websites using NameVirtualHosts.
Can somebody point me in the right direction as to how to accomplish this?
