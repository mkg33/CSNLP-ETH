No error is reported in Tomcat logs, but I fond such errors in mod_jk log:
I think one of this timeout options should be responsible for the problem.
So application was running out of Connections to DB, as those were never timing out.
Every few hours when I try to access application browser simply spins, and no content is retrieved.
If you graph the historical of these tests you might find an issue with your application and/or application server having periodic outages, which will eventually lead you to a root cause.
It was actually, as some of you suggested - application issue.
Typically you leave that to 'localhost' (default) unless you're specifically backending to an off-machine Tomcat running in the same network (so there's an /etc/hosts for it) and so forth.
What I would do in this situation is have some sort of monitoring set up (be it Nagios, or something far simpler) to make sure on a frequent interval that:
This was caused by incorrect configuration of MySQL connection pooling (typo in timeout - so value was having one 0 to much).
Tomcat has same port number in Connector configuration:
thanks for all your support, I really appreciate it!
Is your machine on a NAT, and that hostname resolves to an external IP?
It appears that no response is being sent Tomcat before the timeout period.
Try a simple test, comment all the timeouts, retries and other optionally stuff:
Best of luck... intermittent issues are the worst.
Same goes for your Connector address from server.xml = do you have that set to something other than 127.0.0.1?
There is Apache in front of web server talking to it over mod_jk.
Fixing pooling configuration (in my case c3p0) resolved issue!
