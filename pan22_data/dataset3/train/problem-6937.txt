Currently the main.cf has a large set of restrictions listed under smtpd_recipient_restrictions which are not needed and which end with permit (which I understand is the default anyway if all rules are inapplicable)
I have a Postfix 2.5.1 on a Debian 4.0 PPC server.
The default configuration is probably set up with goals different from yours in mind.
In general, I don't think there would be any problem with setting smtpd_client_restrictions in your configuration as well.
However I feel it's best for me to use the conventions in the main.cf supplied with the software rather than re-organise.
The Postfix server is behind a NAT router to which I have added some port-forwarding rules for inbound SMTP.
Given that you only want to use the server yourself, from your phone, you
So there is no SASL authentication data available anyway.
in main.cf can I simplify my restrictions to this?
As far as I understand, yes, you can simplify your configuration to the example you've given.
I intend to use this as an SMTP relay for outgoing email from my mobile phone (as my phone service provider recently dropped their SMTP server).
I don't know why the existing main.cf doesn't have rules organised under other sections like smtpd_client_restrictions etc as the Postfix docs do.
Just keep in mind that smtpd_client_restrictions apply before the client even had the ability to communicate over SMTP.
