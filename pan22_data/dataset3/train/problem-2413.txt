Release ALT key before you release the click hold.
While you are moving the path item (line,curve, etc) if an end point gets close to another path item's end point, then they will snap, if they apply to the same object (the shape you want to animate).Animation paths that belong to separate shapes don't snap to each other.
The item will lock into the new place without snapping to the object.
I've found if you open the Selection pane (available under the Home tab, Select drop down) and hide the item that is being snapped to, you should avoid this issue.
Click to highlight the object to be moved then after, click and hold down the ALT while you move it.
When moving animation motion parts around (the lines that start with a green arrow and end in a red one), they are snapping to each other.
I have tried disabling object snapping to both object and grids but it's still doing it.
To overcome this problem, move the path items by their endpoints, one at a time.
Then once you've finished editing the item you're moving you can unhide the offending item and you should be good to go.
It does not always work though and I resort to moving the object away from the area, shifting its motion path, then moving it back to its original position.
I haven't found a better system but was hoping to find a better one hence me searching on here.
