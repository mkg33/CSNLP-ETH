A single assignment will be created along with all the events for each occurrence.
The assignmentUser will be created with the corresponding data.
I'm having trouble designing a data model that allows for the following:
When a user interacts with a specific event instance of the assignment.
In this model, Assignments have one AssignmentOccurrence for every time it occurs.
So, focusing on the assignment aspect of these requirements I came up with the following partial ER model: (It's missing how users are related to courses, teachers, etc...):
Maybe it would be better to only have one event per assignment and generate all assignments that fit the recurrence rule on creation?
A teacher would then create an assignment for their course, let's say: 'Hand in math lab every tuesday due for tuesday next week'.
Take the values of the AssignmentOccurrence with a grain of salt, there's not enough information for me to know what data needs to be stored in there.
*There's a mistake in the picture, an event is related to 0 or 1 assignment
I'm worried about the recurrent events side of this.
I think the entity names are a bit confusing though, and I would put some fields in different places.
If an Assignment occurs once, it would have one AssignmentOccurrence.
From my understanding of the system you're trying to build, here's a diagram I recommend:
