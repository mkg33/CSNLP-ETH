Add a rule for your home ip address to override all others in case you saw off the branch you're sitting on, but when making changes, better to try a timed test and fallback to a working config after 5 seconds, eg:
I won't guarantee that this will work, because I edited it online here, but I hope it helps.
I added a rule to stop irritating ssh brute attacks too... :-)
There are loads more rules that you should add to keep traffic down to only that which is necessary.
This is a very simplified version of my own forwarding rules on my ASUS EEEPC acting as router for my wired and wireless networks.
Running tcpdump on an ISP's internal network makes you wonder how on Earth any real traffic has space to move!
My iptables contains about 25000 variable rules, mainly to stop spam on port 25 from unwanted countries during peak periods.
Block outgoing traffic too, such as broadcasts, dhcp, mDNS etc.
A perfect set of rules is a very complicated and individual thing!
You appear to be missing a masquerade in the routers POSTROUTING table!
