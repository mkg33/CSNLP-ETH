Even ED vs LD isn't 100% indicative of ideal code versions in all cases.
You can find information about how Cisco does its releases since IOS 15.0 in this Q&A article:
I was looking on the download page and realized that there are no "GD" versions available.
Some shops I've seen have made the move to be able to support SSH certs or new knobs on routing protocols while others just want to be on a reasonably modern rev just as a maintenance practice.
Essentially the more feature you add to a product, the more likely you are to introduce new bugs, therefore the "most stable" version of IOS would be the one where feature additions are less frequent.
Is there anything special to upgrade to one of the 15.x trains?

Check out the bug navigator to list the open/fixed issues in the version of code that best fits your requirement.
The bugs that involve your particular set of features are the ones you care about.
As to upgrading from 12.2 - what features would you gain that would be particularly helpful?
Your Cisco SE / support team should also be in a position to run through a quick bug scrub to see what the prevailing wisdom is as far as best of the latest-and-greatest but ultimately the bug toolkit is the best tool you've got.

Even if you change "ED" to "GD" in the URL the IOS images are still the same.
Toward this end you might also want to run through the feature navigator to determine exactly what's changed from version to version.
The GD designation is, unfortunately, mostly a memory - and even when GD code was available it tended to be a year or two behind in (usually critical) features.
