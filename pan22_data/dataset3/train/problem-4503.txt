Is there a program/way (open source prefered) that can do this for me with little hassle?
The sample command from their website describing how to merge multiple PDFs.
Other alternatives include CutePDF Writer & PDF Toolkit
If you share a program please give reasons why it will work and not just a link.
It'd be really handy for merging several different types of source files though.
I believe it is written in Java (hence cross platform) and the source code is available.
I am looking to stitch together multiple PDF's together into one file.
It even supports in-place reordering and thumbnail views which can save a bit of time, especially when you can't remember which file is which.
pdftk seems to be the most-often referenced tool for all sorts of PDF manipulation.
Finally, PDFCreator can merge documents as well, but it seems to be a bit cumbersome to do.
I quite like PDFSam as it's a nice cross-platform tool for splitting and merging pages from pdf files.
I've used it as my fallback many times when people have scanned me a bunch of documents off the network printer that I've then had to split off and remerge in different orders and I'd have to say it has rather a lot of useful features for a tool whose only real purpose is to split and merge pdfs.
