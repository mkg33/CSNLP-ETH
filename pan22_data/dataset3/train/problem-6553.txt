In fact, the slave server should receive the zone file from the master to ensure it is serving the exact same information.
I was thinking in this problem and "found" a possible solution that I'm sure is not valid because I haven't found it published anywhere (and my network knowledge is low).
(as you can see, both are registered with kimsufi)
The failure in that scheme is that DNS in a master/slave setup can not actually serve different records for a single domain.
So if you try a dig with this you'll get something like:
The idea is to add a DNS server in each server and configure the slave as a backup server in case Master cannot resolve.
I haven't tested it, it's just an idea (currently I only own a server at kimsufi).
More or less the idea is to setup in the register domain.com something like this:
With these servers and without an additional IP address, my purpose is host a www.domain.com with Master and in case it fails transfer the control to the slave (I know there is software like Heartbeat that allows this but needs a virtual IP, it is, an additional IP address and Kimsufi doesn't allow that ).
Then, the Master server will be configured as usual, pointing his bind9 service to the Master server:
I have two replicated LAMP servers, one as slave and the other as master:
The idea is that as Master is the primary name server, it will process any query for domain.com but if it is offline, Slave do the job.
