Both the Hyper-V viewer and Remote Desktop give me a tickbox to "Use all my monitors for the remote session".
The Remote Desktop Multimon feature provides an option to restrict the number of monitors a user can use to connect.
I have used the Hyper-V to create a virtual machine for my Software Development stuff, on my VM I have also installed Windows 8.1 Enterprise Edition.
2.Setting the “Limit maximum number of monitors” machine group policy as shown below:
this http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rds/archive/2009/07/01/using-multiple-monitors-in-remote-desktop-session.aspx talks about setting up and also the limits for multimon for RDS on win7 and server 2008r2 - might apply here?
There are a few settings associated with the Remote Desktop Multimon feature that can be used to restrict the number of monitors and resolution that clients use to connect.
3.By setting the MaxMonitors property in the Win32_TSClientSetting WMI class (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383778(VS.85).aspx).
I want to have two screen support when using this VM (not using /span)
This number can be restricted to any value between 1 and 16 using one of the following three approaches:
However even with it ticked (and even when I tried the /multimon switch on the command line), I only get a single screen.
1.Using the “Limit maximum number of monitors per session” setting in the Remote Desktop Configuration Tool (tsconfig.msc) as shown below:
Is there some extra config I need to do on the RDP host?
I have just flattened my machine and installed Windows 8.1 Enterprise Edition.
By default, RDP protocol supports a maximum of 16 monitors.
Forgive me if it's an obvious question, I'm more a developer and just stumbling through ;-)
Am I missing something - this should be supported in Enterprise edition, right?
