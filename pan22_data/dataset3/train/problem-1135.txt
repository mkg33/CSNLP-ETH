Setup: a QGis-2.18 Server (really an embedded MapServer) instance via FastCGI in Apache-2.4.18 on Ubuntu.

If a certain value is set in the query string for the cgi handler, I would like to add another value.
I would have expected the effect to be the same as if I had manually appended &OUTPUTFORMAT=GeoJSON at the end of my URL, but I see no difference at all after restarting apache.
And finally apache2.conf (again, comments stripped):
I am unsure how the interaction between rewrite rules and a script alias works, so I'm thinking that one shadows the other?
