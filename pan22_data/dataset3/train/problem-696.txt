This will kill the active synergy UI, then you should
For cases where you launch the UI, and for some reason the status bar icon is unavailable (This happened to me), if you close the UI then you can't open the UI again for that instance of synergy and hence can't stop or control the server and you can't even exit, even if you use killall synergys the app respawns on its own.
The info in this thread did the trick for me on Ubuntu 18.04 (sudo systemctl stop synergy):
The processes can't be killed, either individually or with killall.
There are instructions in the official guide on starting automatically (and killing an existing process) synergy when a user logs in for Windows, OSX and Unix/Linux, you may be interested in setting that up:
It would be much more comfortable if you don't have to manually launch it every time you log in your session.
You can either use the task manager to find the process and terminate it or a console command such as killall synergys, which will close all running processes with the name "synergys".
Another way is to find out the process ID first using ps ux or pidof synergys and then killing it with kill <process ID>.
