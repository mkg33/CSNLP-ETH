It's not as pure as the more complex solutions, but has the distinct advantage of being much easier to implement and works every time.
Rather than focusing on the entire puzzle, break it into smaller, uniform units.
Using this technique, not only have you guaranteed that the puzzle is solvable, you've also helped "cheat" the order of release to make it easier to stay alive.
The idea is that you "stripe" the puzzle ... choose the widths randomly based on the available remaining room.
Here's a technique we've used in the past to cheat a bit on more confined hardware.
Each of these units is composed of a set number of pieces that fit together to form squares or rectangles which are much easier to fill into a puzzle.
If you want to increase the difficulty, randomly release from two or more stripes at a time.
Of course, my example is a stripe 4 blocks high, but you can choose something larger and more complex:
Choose randomly from the different configurations to fill up the width of the puzzle (samples below, but there are many, many configurations).
Of course in practice, players aren't able to perfectly solve each stripe and so chaos ensues.
You release pieces one stripe at a time by randomizing within each "stripe" set.
