The problem has been characterized well by the other answers but in short:
Depending on what other things are actually happening on the server the copy speed that is needed to kill your system may be even lower than this, if there is any other sustained read\write activity, even at very low rates, then an inbound copy over a 100Meg connection might be enough to trigger this sort of problem.
Given that you have disabled caching\read ahead etc the performance will be even worse than that.
If your 5GB is a single large file (or a couple of fairly large files) and if your network based copy is being sent at faster than about 30Meg/sec (easy enough with a Gigabit connection) then your server's disks wont be able to keep up, the network copy buffering on the server will grow until it consumes all available memory on the server and then that will force the OS to start paging excessively further worsening your performance problem.
Your RAID array with 3 (active) 7200 RPM disks in RAID 5 has a write performance that is about 3/4 the speed of a single 7200RPM drive for extended copies.
For the most part the performance of your server from a write perspective is pretty going to be poor with this config.
