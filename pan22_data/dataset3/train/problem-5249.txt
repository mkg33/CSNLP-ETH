I'm using Pageant (on Windows 7) to login to SSH connections with private keys .ppk files.
You can add all keys in command-line, but passwords must be entered by hand
I have mine configured to auto-start with my private key when my system boots up, so that when I load my desktop I just type in my password, and I'm good to go until I shut my system down.
If you use SourceTree, make sure you fill in the 'SSH Key' option in the settings.
However, if you edit the keys with PuTTYgen, you can store the keys unecrypted.
Pageant cannot save the encryption keys for the key files.
However each time I start the program I have to add all the keys I want again and enter their encryption keys.
It will automatically pass it to Pageant when it runs it.
You can also simply not close pagent If that fits with your security model.
That would defeat the entire purpose of encrypting the keys in the first place...
You'd want to set a screensaver password and an aggressive screensaver activation to make sure your system is quickly protected in the event you leave it, though.
