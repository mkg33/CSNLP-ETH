it will work when the BIOS has an Option to Boot from USB-Devices, because it will check for attached usb-devices during the start
I'm planning to install XP Pro on a new machine with a motherboard that supports RAID.
But this poses the problem of loading the RAID driver.
See this Microsoft support article to find out which USB floppy drives are supported by XP.
I'd prefer if the new machine didn't have a floppy drive.
To set this up you normally enter a floppy disk with the motherboard RAID driver at the beginning of the XP installation.
some (newer) Mainboards support an USB-Stick connected on Startup
 so if you are promted "for thrid-Party drivers" you can access the USB-Drive.
You could use nLite to add the appropriate driver to a copy of your install CD, then boot and let Windows find the driver by itself.
Of course, a floppy drive is so cheap that buying one is probably the most reasonable option.
Can XP read this driver from somewhere else (maybe USB) or will I have to install a floppy drive just for this?
You can put them directly on the CD unsing nLite (great tool to customize installation)!
