You might have noticed that I left out one option.
Repairing that depends a lot on just what is broken, and there is not enough information in your OP to determine that.
Boot the liveCD and try to look at the laptops volume.
Next make a backup of all the other documents you want to keep Do this before attempting to rescue the laptop.
Your first step after this should be to insert a pendrive and copy your paper to that.
However I recommend removing the harddrive from the laptop and putting it either in an external enclosure, or as a second drive in a desktop.
Depending on the state of the drive some files simply might not be recoverable.
Alternatively put the laptop drive in an external (USB) enclosure and connect it to another computer.
You seem to have access to another computer (else you could not have posted this question).
If you can access that then it is likely that the windows installation is broken, but that the disk is fine.
It might be extra work but you really do not want to take any risk until you have backups.
That is a gamble, but I ran into several computers which refused to boot due to corrupted files c.q.
Swapping the pendrive for an external (USB) harddisk might help with this.
