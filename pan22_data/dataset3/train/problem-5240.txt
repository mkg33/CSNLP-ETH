The drawback is that there are a lot of design decisions already made for you and they cannot be easily changed.
With any engine you are mostly at the mercy of documentation writers.
It depends on whether you are interested in programming lower level game system frameworks or higher level game design and behavior.
It's actually pretty easy to get simple scenes on screen, it's rewarding and you will learn far more about graphics programming than from using Ogre or any other 3D engine.
If you start with Ogre you will initially be programming the framework and working your way up to the higher level stuff.
If you really want to use C++ instead of a scripting language, you can try to create a mod for a game, one good option is any game from Valve (like half life).
Keep in mind that Ogre3d is a Graphical engine and it will not allow you to build a game only using it, you will need to implement all the other subsystems or integrate with other engines, like physics, audio, etc.
Using Unity, or some other pre-packaged solution, will let you get there more quickly.
If you're willing to work hard and spend a lot of time to get it exactly how you want it then rolling your own is the way to go.
Start simple though, graphics programming can be a really challenging task, but IMO is one of the most rewarding types of programming.
You can also refer to one of the thousand books on the subject during the process.
I suggest starting with OpenGL and writing a little renderer yourself.
It depends on how much you want to customize the final product.
If you start with say Unity, the framework will all be setup for you.
For example if what you really want to program is an idea for an AI or NPC behavior, you're better off with Unity as you can get right to what you are interested in.
If you have no experience with game programming, I suggest as a first project that you use Unity3d or UDK.
You do not need a full-blown graphics engine at this point.
