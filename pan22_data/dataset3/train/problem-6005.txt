The features for MP4/M4V and MOV are very much centered around iTunes compatibility.
In general, most video containers have a quite fixed metadata structure.
I don't think that it is possible to globally tag multiple video types.
You can use various tools to read and write this data, Wikipedia lists a few.

Apart from abcAVI, there is also the program MetadataTouch, which support both RIFF INFO tags and XMP for AVI files, as well as XMP support for MP4 and F4V files.
AC-3 audio or subtitles) in the form of so-called private streams.
Still, there's the Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP).
The only video tagging I know of is about AVI tags.
FFmpeg.org maintains this list of metadata tags per video container format that can be written back to the file using ffmpeg:
Oh, there are tagging facilities for videos, there's just not one single format for all video containers.
The EU-supported PREFORMA project is currently standardizing the MKV container format for professional use in e.g.
ID3 formatted data may be populated into Program Streams of MPEG-2 as defined by Apple (http://www.smpte-ra.org/mpegreg/ID3.html).
Long long time ago, there was a program called abcAVI Tag Editor.
It's a standard developed by Adobe defined to store Metadata for media such as images and videos.
These data are surfaced to iOS environments during video playback at runtime via timedMetadata notifications as well as in other environments that support surfacing this metadata.
It's old but still works fine with Windows 7 in XP compatibility mode.
The files are mostly XML, as XMP uses RDF for data representation.

Not surprisingly, MKV (Matroska) is the most agnostic container in terms of metadata support.
"The MPEG-2 Program stream has provisions for non-standard data (e.g.
Most containers roll their own solution, such as FLV and MKV.
