Then look up error codes for the beeping part on the manufacture's website.
You'll want to make sure the admin knows about it as soon as he becomes available, and may want to notify him immediately.
But again, this is all the admin's truf so CYA and tell him about it.
There are many more, but as you can see, there are many many things that could be wrong.
Open msinfo32.exe and look around for the motherboard information it'll probably simliar to:
Possible problems could be: RAID Disk Failure, ECC Memory Error, Fan Failure, Power Supply Failure, Case detected as open, system is running too hot.
The model number, serial number and make will now become useful.
If you still want to help after that then cool, but CYA.
I have never heard a comptuer emit this exact sound.
Don't expect it to be exactly obvious but the erorr codes will give you a pretty good idea of what's wrong.
Could this be caused by a failing cmos battery on the mobo?
You'll be able to see them if it's a dell and you run the dell system utility (windows based), or a server specific management program that lets you view the status of a RAID array, fans, system logs, and the such.
Also, remoting into the machine will likely not show you the errors, since they are probably hardware based.
Can be a variety of things, but definitely worth having the Admin look at ASAP.
Baring that, open the server up while on(not best practice) to locate exactly which part is beeping(I'm 95% sure it's the mobo though).
I dont know if the status of this type of battery is even monitored or not, but I havent seen this mentioned.
Many brands of servers have utilities installed from the manufacturer that can show where the problem could be.
I/O Port 0x00002000-0x00002FFF  Mobile Intel(R) 45 Express Chipset Series PCI Express Root Port - 2A41
From there find out if it's under warnety and call tech support.
Find out the model number, serial number and make of the server(Dell 2650 Edgeline).
