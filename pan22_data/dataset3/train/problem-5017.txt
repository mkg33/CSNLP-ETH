Right now I've added a CNAME alias where "host" is "www" and "points to:" is "http://www.something.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/".
Pointing www.example.com to S3 with a CNAME record should work fine (CNAMEs only can't be used at the apex of a zone, i.e.
Note that you should only have a CNAME record for that name, so make sure you've removed any A records you used to have.
I think the problem is related to "DNS CNAME alias" however today is the first time I've heard about CNAMES so I'd love some help.
I'm trying to work with my DNS provider but they just send me to reference docs that I've already looked over.
But I created the CNAME about 10 hours ago which I think is ample time.
Specifically when I browse to www.something.com I'm sent to whatever my previous host has for the site.
If it does resolve like this then either your browser or a proxy you're using is caching the website.
I've followed these instructions however I'm still having trouble.
If it doesn't resolve similarly to above then either it's still cached, or your configuration is wrong.
I've double checked my S3 bucket: it's named "www.something.com", the website feature is enabled and all files are public.
Browsing to "http://www.something.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/" works fine.
I want to host my static site www.something.com on Amazon S3.
Check that the name is resolving correctly with the host command like this:
I'm pretty new to this so any advice is appreciated.
Perhaps the DNS entry is just taking a while to update.
I've read around this site and the net and it seems like CNAMES sometimes can't be used for www but instead are for subdomains.
