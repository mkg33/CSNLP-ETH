My question is: Is there any benefit to use SSDs as the boot drive?
Stick about 10 virtual machines on a server with standard drives and then compare it to one with SSD's.
Get all 10 VM's doing something and watch the SSD based server fly while the old magnectic drive one has stalling VM's as they wait for thier turn to read/write to the HD's.
Of course SSD is out of the picture in terms of the data drive.
They're expensive, it's a relatively new technology that's not without its own problems; Jeff Atwood has an interesting blog post about the advantages and disadvantages of using them.
Depends on the server usage, from what you describe probably not worth it.
Given your intended use case the need for an SSD seems even smaller.
Where SSD's come into thier own is servers with high I/O usage like virtual server hosts.
I think most of the time the services should be loaded in memory and the server should rarely require rebooting.
I have servers that haven't been rebooted for about 3 years which I would have thought would be reasonably normal for stable machines that just do the job they were supposed to do.
You should research the types of problems people are experiencing with different brands and models of SSD drives before going down this path.
Are you planning on regulary rebooting the server?
Back to your original question though, why are you worried about the boot time?
Do keep in mind, however, that SSD is still very new and not immune to failures of its own.
You normally see huge benefits when booting and when opening up apps, but on a data server with a lot of RAM that rarely gets rebooted there's no point in spending the extra money.
In this case, does it make sense to get SSD or just get a RAID1 with two SATA drives?
The SSD promises greater reliability (especially important for laptops) and improved performance (no relative track-to-track seek time concerns), both of which are wonderful advantages when dealing with server problems.
