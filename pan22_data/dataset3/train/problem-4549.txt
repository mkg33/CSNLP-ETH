The nominal load for my systems should be around 130 W, and if the GPU is working hard then it could get as high as 400W.
I'm having difficulty selecting the correct UPS for my home configuration.
Is it utterly useless, for what you bought it for yes.
Startup-load can exceed run-load by quite a bit, so that by itself can be a problem for UPS sizing.
It's not unusual for UPSes to shut themselves down if they detect an overload condition.
So I got a cheap Ultra UPS but it turns out this was completely the wrong choice for 2 systems that have 500 W PSU's each.
We have been having daily power failures (2-4 seconds) and I think that can't be good for the H/W.
Chances are that 250W UPS is still good, it just need to have less hungry equipment plugged into it.
It may be useful for smaller load applications (home router, wireless, etc).
Some will also work slightly over their limit, but if you greatly exceed their capabilities, they will shut off.
I'm not sure what I expected, but I didn't expect the UPS to just shut off.
A UPS will warn you when you get close to the limit of their capability.
Still I know the rules - I should have gotten at least a 1200W UPS.
