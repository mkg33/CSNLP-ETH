), however, fragmentation is not as significant a problem as before with FAT.
Of course where this may not be practical, periodic defragmentation can maintain performance above acceptable limits.
But if you ask me, I would recommend creating a flat, big, pre-allocated file for the virtual disk, which will result in no fragmentation even after extensive use.
Fragmentation would prove to enhance the performance of a virtual machine.
I have never encountered an issue defraging a drive that is host to a virtual machine, as virtual machines are simply a collection of files on your Windows file-system, that make up things like your virtual drivers, memory that has been stored for suspended VM's, and your snapshots.
Virtual machines are stored as files on the host machine, and depends on your virtual machine configuration (e.g.
And yes, @Lachlan is very correct in that you should always backup before defraging a disk holding something important -- especially when you are talking about production systems.
Its hard to say how much of a performance gain you would receive though, as it very much depends on the read speed of the drives and the size of the VM files that are being read, etc.
Defraging will result in a performance gain, especially when loading a suspended VM, or reading data from your virtual disks, as the actual hard-drive will not have to seek as much to find the fragments.
If you are really worried, you can always be cautious and clone each machine an a separate drive in the unlikely event the defrag process corrupts something.
