If you're unable to create this directory, try creating a directory elsewhere in the filesystem and mounting your share there instead.
then you execute the command(replace the appropriate values)
Once that is disabled you should be able to access the share.
Most mount-like programs on Linux follow the mount convention of:
It is worthy to note that /mnt does not exist on the filesystem, but I was told by the company who gave us these units that fs-cifs should automatically create the /mnt/net folders if they don't exist.
of which <mountpoint> is presumed to already exist.
Here is the command that fails, along with the verbose output:
It's right down the bottom of the list of options.
Then you will be able to mount the local windows shared folder onto any linux or unix based systems.
At the very least, I'd suggest creating /mnt/net and giving it another shot.
So to mount the local windows shared folder onto the QNX(any linux based systems) system you need to change the two registry key values from the below path
I have a head unit that runs Linux that is connected to my PC via an Ethernet cable.
I have a Windows XP share on this PC that the head unit needs to be able to mount, however, when mounting using the following command, it fails.
This appears to be failing because /mnt/net doesn't exist.
If you are using the windows7 PC by default the anonymous samba user is disabled.
By default Windows XP has an idiotic thing called "Simple File Sharing" turned on.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->SYSTEM->CurrentControlSet->Control->Lsa
//fs-cifs -a //MyMachineName:MyMachineName:/ShareName /mnt/net username password
