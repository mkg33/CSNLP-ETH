The challange is to provide internet access through this wire.
If you do want a wireless system, a good place to start looking is at Ubiquiti.
You'll need to get the signal to the workshop using either wired or wireless tech.
The phone line is a copper wire pair, nothing fancy.
There are extenders that can do this, but they cost several hundred $.
As Bash said, powerline adapters may be used, but i have no experience with them and their capabilities.
These are based on dsl technology, so my idea is, that I put two dsl modems (I have two d-link dsl-360r) on both ends of the wire.
You wont be able to extend the network without spending some money.
Running your own cat5e/6 cable would work, but if the two buildings have different earths (at 100m they may), problems may arise with voltage differentials, which can damage equipment (an entirely different question, ask a new one if you go this route).
I know you said no wifi, but a point to point bridge can be quite reliable (and fast) when set up correctly if they are your concerns.
To use the existing wire, you'll need a device or two specifically set up to use the single pair.
The DSL extenders do different 'stuff' to a home router (as Big Chris said), so two home routers wont work; you'd need the extender.
If so, what additional step I need to take, other than described above?
Connect one to the router in the house, and the other to another router in the guest house.
There is a house with internet access, and there is a workshop/guesthouse which has a phone line connecting to the house.
