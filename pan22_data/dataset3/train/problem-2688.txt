I did rest my wrist on the table in the past, it made my wrist tired easier - so have the wrist off the table is better for me.
Even the fact that my keyboard is straight, I still let my wrist flows naturally straight.
Now that I actually pay attention to my hand and wrist placement, I don't bend my wrist straight in front of the keyboard as pictured.
Maybe if I use a proper wrist cushion it would be better, but I have never tried one and happy without one.
It does make some fingers stretch to reach certain button but I never had any wrist / RSI issue as I do keep my wrist straight and let my finger do the extra reaching works).
I simply put my hands closer to the keyboard (somewhat on top of the keyboard) and not resting my wrist on the table.
There are lots of ergonomic keyboards out there, and some are weirder than the other (for the sake of ergonomics I guess).
I can't vouch for other people typing problem, but somehow I don't have that issue that you pictured in the question.
I am a fairly big bodied person and with wide shoulder (I tend to get 3XXL shirts as a guess of my width), and I have been using MS Keyboard 600 (pretty standard width keyboard to my knowledge) without any arm rest.
There are also Mechanical Ergonomic Keyboard if you really want one, but they all come with a fairly hefty price tag simply because they have "ergonomic" tag on them.
