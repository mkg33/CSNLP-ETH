Google has promised to deliver a sync client for linux soon.
https://github.com/odeke-em/drive/blob/master/platform_packages.md
While waiting an indefinite time for googles own sync clieent, these are the solutions around:
still it is good, especially if you have so many files like i do.
you can't limit the bandwidth and it has no GUI but it's still easy to use.
That's enough for me to switch, unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a client for my operating system (Ubuntu).
But still google drive has problem of not syncing folders outside google drive folder, do upgrading storage for backup purpose resulted in vain for me.
Syncany looked promising, but there doesn't seem to be any actual releases and I think the screenshots are just mock-ups from over a year ago, that project looks dying if not dead.
Now I want to purchase additional storage, but Dropbox is currently twice the price of google drive space!
I use Dropbox client for syncing files to the web, and it works reasonably well.
Is there any client for syncing files to google drive with file manager integration on Ubuntu?
