Check out this post on the VirtualBox forums: Windows XP: In both VM and native (using Linux as host OS); it details the crazy hoops you have to jump through to work around the hardware problems that Wil mentioned.
As far as I know, there is no way to have a single copy of Windows that you can use as a main OS and then switch it to use virtually.... Technically you can if you generalise / sysprep the machine every time you want to shut it down, however in practice, this is not very practical at all.
Desktop virtualization- Access Physical hard disk in VMware Virtual Machine
Yes, you can... but it depends on the product you are using.
I'm afraid that VirtualBox is behind in the race and still is not able to do it, but it should be checked out.
Instead of swapping with another system drive, I put the drive in a USB enclosure, attached it to another running Linux machine, set up the raw disk access, and attached it to a new VirtualBox VM.
See the articles below for how-tos for Virtualbox and VMware Workstation of using a physical disk partition in a virtual machine:
There are issues not only with hardware detection, but with the resulting Windows Activation.
Typically, when you set the virtual hard disk location, it is possible to use the entire hard drive as the "virtual" hard drive.
I'm not sure of VMWare's capabilities, but I'm fairly confident that it can run and OS installed in a partition.
Access Physical Disk in VirtualBox- Desktop Virtualization Software
Parallels for Mac is able to run BootCamp partitions, at least.
However, if you are trying to do what I think you want to do, you will get the same problem as taking out a physical hard drive and sticking it in another physical machine - complete hardware mismatches.
Yes, but it depends on the virtualisation software.
I've successfully done this with Linux that was installed on a drive.
