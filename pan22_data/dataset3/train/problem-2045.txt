Note : i tried so many programs(without success) to make bootable usb but lets say that we`ll stick to the rufus because everywhere in internet uses this program to achieve my goal in usb3 port.
Wanted result Windows 10 installed in EFI boot mode in bios.
Note: if i change boot mode to be on legacy mode im able to boot via usb, but then when im trying to install Ubuntu i have another issue, because Windows is installed on legacy mode and ubuntu tries to install on EFI mode but i think if i`m able to install windows under the efi mode this error will desappear
First i setup boot mode in bios to be EFI And here start my problem, so i have 2 windows(x64 isos) on another pc one is under the 4gb and the other is above 4 gb.
So i tried to do the usb how it is ment to be "GPT partition scheme for UEFI" with fat32 file system with my windows that is under 4gb, and after that i tried on the laptop, and here the different is that this menu with available devices doesn`t appear and directly i receive this screen which is a think is the background of the windows, and after that my pc is shutted down.
With rufus version above 1.8 it is possible to make "GPT partition scheme for UEFI" with file system NTFS so i made it, but after i tried on the laptop, it appear this menu with available device on the pc and when try to use the usb drive nothing happens it returns me on the same menu to select the device that i want.
So if i try to make EFI usb within windows above 4GB, the usb file system must be something else then fat32(it is not possible fat32 to handle files bigger than 4 gb and rufus dont allow me to start).
