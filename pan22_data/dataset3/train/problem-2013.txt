I want to know how to run a python file in Ubuntu to show the GUI in Ubuntu but the commands will run from Python will be directly linked to the Raspberry Pi.
My understanding, you have a script/program that collects data and displays this data on the screen.
In that case, you could look into Paramiko, which hopefully allows you to do that from Ubuntu.
Now when run your program in the new ssh-shell all the UI will be presented on your Ubuntu machine.
There are downsides to this technique worth mentioning:
A simple solution is to have the desktop act as a full fledged remote display to the raspberry PI.
You may split the program into a client/server  where you have one application acting as a server, accepting commands to control the motor.
I have written a Python Tkinter program which uses buttons to control a Motor which is linked to the GPIO pins, It also displays any changes as a tkiner label e.g Button pressed will change the label to "Button Pressed".
It has better performance and ability to reconnect compared to ssh -X, but the principle is the same.
This is the beginning of industrial control and automation, which is a very wide topic.
There are a variety of approaches, a simple web server may be enough.
xpra (docs) is a X11 forwarder that allows remote code to run against a local X Server, and allows for connect/disconnect like screen or tmux.
If I understand correctly, you want to remotely run your Tkinter.
You would like to have the display on a desktop PC, but the data collection code executing on raspberry PI.
When you access raspberrypi from a Linux-machine with a XServer (as Ubuntu does) you have the possibility to use ssh and tell it use X-Forwarding like this:
In industrial systems, PLCs are used to interface controllers and sensors.
