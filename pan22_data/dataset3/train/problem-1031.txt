a SD card with the switch in the "read-only" position, etc.
a thumb drive with the switch in the "read-only" position,
I think this should run on a normal external hard drive though.
The flash disk might be too slow to run a virtual machine on, or you might have insufficient space.
The read-only boot drive can be a "LiveCD" CDROM (not a CDRW),
If you're just trying to keep some files safe, a few simple chmods might solve the problem?
If I'd have to give you an answer right now without googling for this issue, then my solution would be: put any Linux distribution with vmware on the drive, within that distribution keep your other Linux hard drive encrypted and just decrypt that on boot and start it using vmware.
you can be sure that no sensitive data is accidentally leaked onto a non-encrypted partition.
Fedora can do an encrypted install, and if you pass expert to the installer then it will let you install onto removable media.
There's not a lot of documentation available on it, but it's simple enough to install and poke around a bit.
The only caveat is that /boot will need to be unencrypted so that the computer can read it for booting.
It's a Debian-based distro, actually just a tweaked version of the Debian LiveCD.
