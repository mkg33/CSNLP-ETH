Circumstantial evidence can be gathered but this being said, 'investigating' someone else computer without is consent cannot server as evidence.
If so, there is a question on the it security site about this.
Find the serial number of your hard drive by requesting it at the store where you purchase your external hard drive, using your original receipt.
Unlike smartphones today, hard drives don't have that option (yet).
Even so if this information itself is not enough, if the person did open any document from the external hard drive, there is some trace in the computer cache.
Do you have physical access to the system you suspect?
Only direct access to the computer your hard drive was connected to could show you what you are looking for, but there is no automatic online protection system for hard drives in that way.
Most external hard drive enclosure require some kind of USB driver.
You would have to have some sort of Trojan that would call home (aka send email updates), but they won't always work on hard drives since it would have to run once plugged in.
