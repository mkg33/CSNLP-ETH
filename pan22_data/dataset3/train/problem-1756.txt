Nowadays, the hard disk is definitely the bottle neck in a computer.
As I've read that most of the time, the processor is actually twiddling its thumb waiting for the HDD to finish whatever operation the HDD is doing.
So I was thinking whether i5 with 7200 RPM HDD is better than i7 with less RPM.
I've googled around and basically most people agree that i7 would be too much just for that.
So, I'd consider how long you'd like to keep it too.
So, in my opinion, if you really want a fast machine for the same money, go with a simple Core 2 and use the money saved to get an SSD if you can or more RAM if you can't.
It's a LOT easier to replace hard drives in the future than processors in a laptop...
Hard drives have gotten a little faster since then (better transfer rates, seek time per platter size), but they haven't seen the same kind of rapid growth that memory and processors have.
Everything else are the same, just the processors and HDD.
I'm getting a new dev laptop, mostly on Apache/PHP/Oracle/Eclipse and VirtualBox doing web dev stuff.
Consider this:  the i7 just came out this year, but they were already selling 7200rpm hard drives at least as far back as 1999.
The processor itÂ´s only important if you are going to do a lot of math, like encryption, or rendering, but not for apache/php/oracle.
