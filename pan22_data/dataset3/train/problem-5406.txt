If you only use one CPU, you can only use half the RAM slots and half the PCIe ports.
Most likely that you just didn't insert them in the right order - server hardware has such a feature that you need to follow such an order.

Since you did not post the ram specs, this is only am educated guess, but something about the RAM is likely incompatible with the motherboard.
I know all the ram works because it was working in a different server.
In the past I have noted some H/W incompatibility between different manufacturers of the identical type of RAM, same speed, same size and even between systems.
Perhaps they're quad or dual ranked DIMMs and your motherboard doesn't support that?
On recent biprocessor motherboards, half the RAM slots and half the PCIe slots are attributed to each CPU.
On older motherboards (such as the X7DB8) you need to insert the RAM stick in the proper order.
You need to check the order of how the RAM should be inserted into the RAM slots, for this you'll need to check the server documentation.
