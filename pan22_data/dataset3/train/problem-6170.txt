I did not want to block GoogleAnalticsObject because I have several projects under development, AND I want them to register if I hit the external-hosted site, so messing with the hosts file is not an option.
Another option is to run your own DNS server and filter out the badness there, which has the same effect as blocking servers in your hosts file.
There is a plugin Google Disconnect for Firefox which will block Google on non-Google pages, including analytics.
In Chrome go to chrome://net-internals/#dns and press clear host cache
The squid proxy can be configured to block ads as well.
Everything gets blocked and doesn't impact pageload time or allow for 3rd party tracking, but the page gets little boxes you can click to load things you didn't cover by default.
Instead, I used an "asp:Placeholder" tag to wrap the Jscript and set visibility=false when localhost, otherwise =true.
For the sake of completeness, although not as easy to set up as the other solutions, you could consider running an ad blocking proxy such as Privoxy.
It's a bit like ghostery, in that it allows you to whitelist and blacklist cross site requests, but isn't explicitly focused on privacy.
Had this problem, just cleared the DNS cache and everything is back to normal.
It's pretty configurable, but I set mine the blacklist by default
