It is the HP format utility for flash disks, but works on any brand of flash stick.
Use gparted to remove the extra partition and merge it into the other one.
You can also boot up a Linux live CD, or other boot disk with gparted.
Kept telling me the CDFS partition was write protected.
It simply formatted the entire stick into a single partition (drive).

It just shows up that way so you can't add or remove any info on that partition.
It automatically, as part of the format process, removes partitions.
If you can't find it there, google for "hp usb disk storage format tool".
This utility warns you gently about it removing data, but what it is saying is that the ENTIRE USB STICK will be erased.
Keep in mind not all boot disks will let you see USB drives, though, to edit the partitions.
Basically having it labeled as a CD drive makes it read-only.
use the HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool to format the USB drive and remove all partitions.
It showed as 2 drives as noted above -- a large FAT32 and a small write-protected CDFS partition.
Remove it with the Windows (2000 and higher) Disk Management tool.
The solution was to open the Launchpad.ZIP file that was on the small partition, select the UninstallLaunchpad.exe file in the zip, and run it (can do that from within ZIP, no need to un-zip to anywhere).
After program completion I now have a single writ-eable FAT32 partition USB stick.
Normal Windows management or DOS format did nothing for the CDFS partition.
