Computer Browser, WorkStation, Netlogon, etc should be running.
I would try unpluging the computer from the network and reboot, see if that will help.
I've tryed every tip available on internet but it just doesnt works, so my last try was to unninstal the service pack 1, and that did the trick.
To verify it's not my account that's at fault I've enabled the Administrator account and tried to join, logging in with that account, without any success.
When I go join the machine to the domain I see the 'Domain' text box greyed out (the system is in Spanish) :
Removing all instances of "WORKGROUP" from the registry
Downgrade it to home and then upgrade it to pro again using the windows anytime upgrade.Make sure you have the anytime upgrade keys.
Seeing if there is some kind of hidden GPO preventing change
Hmm, I thought for sure the "Computer Browsing Service" would be the culprit.
I've just received a new laptop with a ghosted Windows 7 Professional image.
"Client for Microsoft Network" etc should all be there.
A re-install from scratch using the DVD resolved the problem.
I hope this helps anyone that have this same problem.
Also check to make sure the correct protocols are installed.
Check the Device Manager and make sure the network card is ok.
If none of that works, well poop, we'll have to find something outlandish to try!
The 'Network ID' button is also greyed out in the system properties dialogue box.
Hi guys I know that this topic is old but I just found the way to fix it without formating the pc.
It would appear that there was something wrong with the image used to ghost the machine from.
