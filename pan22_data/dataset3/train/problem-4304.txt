I would recommend to change the while loop, so it will handle any rows:
Also I would advice against the use of short open tags (<?= $var ?>) @Cygal suggests, as they are not recommended and by default disabled on many hosting services.
This is really important: even if you write everything in one script, the two pieces of your code should be completely separated so that it could be possible to split them in two files with close to no changes.
Is this the way PHP developers write PHP or is echoing the html the preferred method?
and if you do not want to output all values from the row, but just a subset, or if you want particular order in output it is better to modify your SQL query as appropriate.
The first and most important thing to learn about writing good PHP code is that you must separate the code that gathers data from the code that outputs it.
This means that you can change how you display your data without touching how you get them, or you can change the source of your data and keep the output exactly as it is (so long as you follow some conventions regarding variable names and data formats).
Regarding the interface to the database, while in simple scripts it can be okay, I think it's useful to skip mysql_* functions in favor of the PDO interface which gives you a lot of advantages (most notably prepared statements) at the little cost of learning its syntax.
As already mentioned, you can't call session_start() after output has already being sent (your output being the first lines of HTML) as starting a session implies setting headers and you can't do that once they have already been sent.
In your sample code this means that you don't call your data extracting function and display what you get, but you stuff everything in an array and later display its contents.
