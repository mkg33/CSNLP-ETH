Whenever you edit the partition tables you run the risk of corrupting data.
I've dealt with this issue a few times, mostly with various Hyper-V VM's.
But again...make sure you have a full recovery backup available first!
Run a chkdsk on this resized/changed partition just to be safe.
There is one other idea I'd consider, but only if you have a complete backup handy as it may ruin your partition tables.
Definitely back up first, but I've done this with at least 5 systems with no issues.
I'd practice on a "spare" system first so you get familiar with it as these aren't the most user-friendly tools, but they can solve your partition problems so you won't run into this issue again down the road.
There is a Linux CD called Rescue-Is-Possible; you can boot it into X and from that run GParted on your (unmounted) drives to first shrink the second data partition then expand your system partition so it's larger.
If this is the c: drive, then this is your last step and you can just expand the c: drive, reboot into windows, chkdsk, and you're on your way.
Then, boot back into GParted and you can now expand the 2nd to last partition the same way.
So what you need to do is first modify the "last" partition, so that the "Space Before Partition" is larger (either by reducing the size of the partition or by taking off unallocated space from the end).
You could use NTFS junction points and mount another NTFS partition into the NTFS folder C:\WINDOWS\installer.
At that point, I would reboot back into Windows to make sure everything is peachy.
When you open GParted, you'll notice that it has three entries for every partition:
I've not destroyed a partition (and I use it a LOT as a tool for prepping images), but I have had situation where I've needed to run (also on this CD) Testdisk to repair partition data; this was mostly due to differences between master images and imaged system's hard disks though (number of heads are different between the two, for example).
