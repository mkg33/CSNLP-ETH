I manage my domain with 123-reg so in their advanced DNS settings I've added the awverify records
the web site and the api each have their own Azure Website (Yossi.azurewebsites.net and yossiapi.azurewebsites.net respectively)
Worth noting that DNS takes a while to update, so you will need to wait a little bit between updating the DNS records and successfully updating the custom domain in Azure.
(without the correct verification records this would fail, but will show which verification entries in the DNS need adding)
I have the following three records for the public website - one CNAME to drive internet traffic and two to support verification of both naked domain and full domain
As you can see in my DNS records I simply needed to add another set for the subdomain - one for verification and one for traffic and I got two separate websites as part of the same domain.
I then added the following for the API - again - one for the verification and one for actual traffic
I've just done something similar to what you're asking about, using Azure Websites -
I have a public facing website, call it Yossi.co.uk (not real) and I have an API I wanted published on the same domain.
I then went to both Azure websites on the Azure Management Portal, made sure they are both Shared or Standard instances, to ensure support for custom domains and then in the configure tab I added the custom domains.
