Whenever there is data to be written to the RAID device, it is split in two, the first part is written onto the first disk, the second part on the second, which makes your write operation pretty fast.
But if either disk breaks, all your data is lost (since you lose (roughly) 50% of all your files, rendering all of them useless)
RAID 10 brings back a reasonable level of reliability.
RAID 0 doubles your chance of storage failure (assuming a 2-disk Raid 0).
For each drive in the array, you increase the chances of losing all the data.
if you don't use raid - if 1 fails, 50% data lost...
If you lose just one drive in the array, you lose everything.
IF you use raid 1 - if 1 fails - you have 0% data lost, but you pay twice for your Hardware.... :-)
you have 2 disk, raid 0 - if one fails, all data lost.
Because now you are relying on the reliability of 2 disks, instead of just one.
I had 3 drives in RAID 0 and the middle drive broke only a few months later, losing nearly 1TB of data.
Which means anything on RAID 0 must have a backup.
Speaking from personal experience of losing data, I'd definitely recommend you save yourself the headaches and avoid RAID 0.
