I found that if one of the 'push "route x.x.x.x 255.255.0.0"' lines has an invalid mask for the subnet an error will be thrown in the log file and the vpn won't operate at all.
Can someone help me or provide me with working config files?
Also, note that any services will need to be listening on all IP addresses or 10.8.0.1 to be reachable over the VPN.
Then, try to ping 10.8.0.1 from the client, once it's connected.
Try nitially removing all push route lines and see if you can ping the server side of the vpn 10.8.0.1 by default.
You should set up the routing on the server, so, for example, the 10.8.0.1 will be masqueraded to 10.10.0.100 or whatever your local intranet range is...
Normally, the VPN clients has it's own IP range, as in your configuration (10.8.x.x).
The error looks non-fatal but it does indeed appear to be fatal.
Once you can do this add in your route push lines gain.
The client is connected and has an IP in the VPN range.
The problem is that I'm not able to ping nor connect to the server or other clients.
You need to add rules that allow traffic from tun0 on the server.
