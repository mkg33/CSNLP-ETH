Your MX record tells the internet where your mail server is, and in that regard, it is intended to be pointed at a specific host.
You can have multiple MX records per domain with a different or equal priority.
Again, this is because of what an MX record fundamentally is - a signpost for the rest of the internet saying "send mail for my domain to this host."
As long as your example.com domain has an associated A record, you can point an MX DNS entry to it.
(If example.com resolves to a single host, you may have your MX records point at it, and provided there's something there to receive the mail, it should even work, but is not recommended.)
So you need to have defined a name associated to its IP before using the MX field.
An DNS MX type record always points to an A record which points then to an IP.
It's also ok just to have only one MX record pointing to an A record, no matter which one.
And even my registrar's backend doesn't allow such operation.
I think you can define the zone IP and then the MX to the zone if you want, but it is not common, as generally the Web server (used by IP zone) is not the same machine as your mail server
In all examples of setting up dns, MX records points to mail.example.com (as I understand, purpose is easily change mail server without touching main host).
You just should not let it point to a CNAME record instead of an A record (this is often done in big environments, where thousands of domains pointing to a few servers.
The MX field is corresponding to a name of a mail server (not an IP), with its priority.
Why I can't point MX to example.com, and why I shouldn't?
