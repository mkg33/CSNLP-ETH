What's selected and appears under that in the list, is the Global Address List.
It seems that this was/is due to my profile being migrated from an old computer to a new one, and when I used "Windows Easy Transfer" (is it called that?)
To check this, right-click on the Contacts folder, go to Outlook Address Book, and make sure the "Show this folder as an email address book" is ticked (and optionally set the name).
When you click the To button you should get the select names dialog box.
Then when you open the Outlook address book it should appear in the "Address Book" drop down list with the name you specified in the previous step.
some time outlook does not map fields automatically.
Try to reimport contact and make sure to map field with target outlook field when importing.
something with my contacts and outlook/exchange went wrong.
At the top of that window there should be a drop down named Address Book.
Make sure that your contacts are set to show as an address book.
The first thing in the list, which is not selected, should be your outlook address book.
