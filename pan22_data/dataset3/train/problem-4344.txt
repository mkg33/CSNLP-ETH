But now, I've been asked about manipulating MS Word 2010 documents.
Microsoft Office VBA supports regular expressions searching natively.
But, I don't have much experience with similar functions in Word.
The macro could probably be done too, but could be difficult to deploy to users depending on how many users you had.
But, it's easy enough to use surrounding VBA to manipulate the results as you wish.
With javascript/jQuery, I could write some code to take this data, search for words in quotes, find the closest number before the match and insert an all CAPS version of it after the period.
You have to add "Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions 5.5" as a Reference in the VBA Editor for each .docm, .xlsm, etc.
Can this be done via a macro or some type of scripting?
It really depends on more details of your situation to say if this is a good solution.
they currently have transcriptionists who manually make these changes (sometimes with mistakes).
Is it possible to write my javascript/jQuery code and have it run in a Word instance somehow?
Most of the object model for this regex module can be found on MSDN here.
I have some limited experience with basic javascript regex, which I've used to manipulate some user data entries.
Specifically, my users get a long numerical list of data as such:
One thing that appears to be missing is the MultiLine setting.
They would like a formatted header after each numeral, based on the item in single quotes, ala:
If it's just plaintext in the word document and it's not very big and you're familiar with jquery, you could make a simple site where they can copy/paste the word document into and you do the necessary changes and let them download the transformed word document or output the desired text.
I don't believe there's a way to do a sed-style replace-in-place operation -- it's a search-only functionality.
