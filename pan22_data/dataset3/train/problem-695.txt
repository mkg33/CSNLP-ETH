Note that there are multiple ip addresses that correspond to this ip name.
So far, I've only noticed this with bestbuy.com, and I tried it because a friend was reporting that he was redirected to Best Buy Turkey, and Best Buy Korea when visiting bestbuy.com last night.
I wouldn't think DNS servers could be updated so quickly, so my guess is that this is something to do with load-balancing.
It's better to implement that using a true load balancer, or a VIP (virtual ip).
(Probably a better question for serverfault, but...)
Wrong site for this question, but my guess is load balancing
The positive side effect of this is that when everything is operating normally, they can share the traffic load between two farms.
But it's a pretty unsafe way of doing it because DNS load balancing works close to round robin: every time you ask for a hostname, the DNS server answers with one of the pool (like you see happening in your ping).
Unfortunately, it means that in case of one of the "servers" goes down, half of the requests will fail.
If one of their web farms goes DOA, then the other will continue to accept inbound traffic.
I got three different IP addresses when trying to resolve a domain name three times.
As pointed above, they do it for load balancing, fail over, etc...
The primary purpose of this is to provide a failover.
The reason for this is because the zonefile for the bestbuy.com zone contains multiple A records for the entry @ eg:
All three of these pings happened within seconds of one another.
