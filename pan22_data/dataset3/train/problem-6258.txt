You can use msconfig to do this, but I would suggest using Autoruns from Sysinternals since it is more thorough.
You can try to check BIOS settings too, BIOS setting for num lock should not be conflicting with the registry details.
PS my virus scan had also remove 2 possible threats the night before...
Make sure its Num Lock is Turn On, Save and Exit the SetUp page before rebooting the computer.
I don't know exactly what option I unchecked, but it's OK if you uncheck it all.
That keyboard worked with no issues so I tried the old keyboard and it seemed to fix that issue as well.
If you do File > Save from Autoruns and send me the file, then I can look through it and tell you if there anything that might be causing it.
Use Win7 built-in "On Screen Keyboard" to test if NumLock behaves well.
I would suggest looking through your startup items for anything that sounds like Ease of Access or Accessibility and disabling it.
Just click the correct key on your Toshiba to load the BIOS then view Boot Device Menu, choose System Setup, look for POST Behavior then check the Num Lock Key Option.
I had this problem once and it turned out to be an ease of access problem.
Turned my computer on this morning and the number lock wasn't working.
If you're certain you've disabled Mouse Keys from the Ease of Access Center, then it seems like some other software is providing Mouse Key functionality.
I plugged in a different usb keyboard and windows downloaded driver for that keyboard.
Ease of Access Center under Make the keyboard easier to use and uncheck all the checkboxes you find there.
