Also, is it possible that Visual Studio Online runs in any other data center than US East?
I was able to find some documentation as to what IP Addresses Visual Studio Online supposedly uses, but it doesn't seem to be accurate.
According to the FAQ (http://www.visualstudio.com/get-starte/load-testing-faq-vs) the Visual Studio Online Load Testing runs in the Azure US East data center.
Does anyone know a definite way to find out what IP Addresses the Visual Studio Online Load Testing Agents are using?
We were able to temporarily remove the IP Whitelist restriction and the tests all run successfully, so it has been determined that it's definitely the IP Whitelisting and not the Load Test setup that is at fault.
And according to the Microsoft Azure Datacenter IP Ranges (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41653) document I was able to determine what IP Addresses to whitelist for the Azure US East data center.
I need to setup IP Whitelisting in an environment that I need to run some Visual Studio Online Load Tests on.
Unfortunately, when we setup IP Whitelisting in out environment for these IP Addresses, the Visual Studio Online Load Tests would run with errors.
