However you're only loosing days off of an life expectancy of years.
The only thing I'm aware of so far is that you shouldn't defrag a solid state drive or that ruins the life expectancy of it.
One precaution you should take is to backup as normal Alex.
Speaking to several laptop engineers however, when SSDs fail they can fail suddenly without any warning.
Here's a great link for a thread from Tom's that talks about defraging an SSD.
This is unlike with the traditional hard disks where you can hear them start to make that whining scratching noise when they start to degrade, thus you have time to make a backup.
The thing about Defrag is it won't speed up your drive in the slightest since SSD's can read so quickly that fragmented files are no longer the issue they used to be.
Running constant sequential writes can in theory shorten the life expectancy of an SSD.
I've personally deployed and supported lots of PCs and laptops for many years and I have to say that SSDs are a joy to work with in comparison to the traditional spinning hard disks.
CCleaner will not hurt your drive in the slightest.
I have ccleaner set to clean every time I turn my computer on.
There has been a lot of disambiguation about running things like CCleaner and Defrag on an SSD.
In short I went to an SSD raid 0 in my rig two years ago and would never go back
