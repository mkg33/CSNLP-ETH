Tiny Core Linux is an excellent minimal distro, very modular.
Tiny Core Linux is a very small (10 MB) minimal Linux GUI Desktop.
Slackware is probably too, but who uses Slackware anymore?
It represents only the core needed to boot into a very minimal X desktop typically with wired internet access.
It is not a complete desktop nor is all hardware completely supported.
The user has complete control over which applications and/or additional hardware to have supported, be it for a desktop, a netbook, an appliance, or server, selectable by the user by installing additional applications from online repositories, or easily compiling most anything you desire using tools provided.
With both VMWare and Xen virtual-disk download formats supported.
CLI versions of Tiny Core's program allows the same functionality of Tiny Core's extensions only starting with a console based system.
Also offered is Micro Core a 6 MB image that is the console based engine of Tiny Core.
I believe it also contains a market-place of previously configured appliances other people made and published.
The core runs entirely in ram and boots very quickly.
It is based on Linux 2.6 kernel, Busybox, Tiny X, and Fltk.
I've been using it for 2 years, and I'm very happy with it.
You build the system you want online through package selection and other setup screens, and download what you need.
