So I always have and always will write (and prefer) code that uses QUOTENAME() to generate scripts that include any kind of identifier.
I would much rather have the square brackets there all the time, than take them away and get bitten the one time they were needed.
You can look elsewhere to see what they are doing, and sys.sp_rename in fact does yield that PARSENAME() is used:
SQL Server obviously has something internal that strips out [square brackets] (or other identifiers, like "double quotes").
[foo], you're right, only foo gets stored in sys.tables and sys.objects, and there is no complaining that the schema [dbo] (with the square brackets) wasn't found.
For me, personally, a large enough percentage of my code is written for a broader audience, who will use the code in environments where I have no knowledge or control over whether they are using unsafe identifiers.
But this happens inside the code for CREATE TABLE.
But again, I'm not sure I understand why you want to only sometimes remove the square brackets.
Hooking up the debugger could indicate for sure, but does it matter?
They may be using PARSENAME(), as David pointed out.
