I also tested creating shortcuts to both .msi and .exe installers that require administrative rights in the folder.
If that user has administrative rights, the program will run elevated by default.
When I logged into an account as administrator, both shortcuts ran and both ran elevated.
The net session command requires administrative rights to run and will return "Access Denied" if a user without administrative rights attempts to run it.
When I logged into a normal user account, only the normal shortcut ran and ran without administrative rights.
The shortcut set to run as administrator did not run at all.
These also only ran under the account with administrative rights and ran elevated by default without the User Account Control (UAC) prompt.
When placing something into the C:\Users\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder, it will be run using the logged in user's account with their access rights.
An interesting side note: A batch file run through the Startup folder under an administrator account will run elevated, as stated, but without the "Administrator: " text in the title bar.
If that user doesn't have administrative rights and the program requires elevation, then the program will not run at all.
I ran a few tests using a batch script, an .msi installer and a .exe installer and shortcuts to each in the folder.
