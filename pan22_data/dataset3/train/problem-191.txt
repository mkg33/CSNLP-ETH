I don't know if you also want to do this with macros, but here is an example with a macro.
You can use the following macro to do your cross_addtion as demonstrated by your picture.
Another method would be to use the INDEX function:
Doing the math is easy if you specify the number and location of the rows.
You could use this formula in C1 and then copy it down to the other cells:
It gets complicated if you want a generic formula that includes determining those parameters.
And to keep it simple, let's ignore handling blanks and other complications.
The INDIRECT function creates a cell reference from text and math.
INDEX returns the value from the specified range given a row and column relative to the range.

Alternatively, you can use the shortcut ALT+F11 to open the VBA editor - right click on Sheet 1(Sheet1) and select Insert Module
So, please modify the code as per your requirements.
The macro assumes that the data that you want to add are in columns A and B and column C would be the output column.
This hard codes the data range into the formula, which may not be desirable.
Assume you have a correctly prepared block of data and that you manually copy the formula in column C just where you need it.
