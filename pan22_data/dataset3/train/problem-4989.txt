The only exceptions I can think of is applications that will only run with their own instance.
If you need to separate things to secure them then I'd suggest multiple server installs (you can virtualise onto one physical box here), because I'm not sure I'd consider different instances on one box to be a security boundary.
Is it best to have one single instance with many database or to spread the databases across a few instances?
I'd suggest one instance instead of several instances on the same box, unless you are trying to solve a very specialised problem.
Multiple instances are usually going to make things more complex than one instance with multiple DBs.
Moreover, if you get to the point where the one instance is not handling the load very well it's time to add another machine, not another instance.
It makes administering the server easier and it uses less resources for overhead.
A very good rule for systems administration is the same rule that works well for programming, or did back when I used to still do that: Make things as complex as they need to be in order to solve the problem properly, no more and no less.
Of course such software is best avoided or placed on a different machine if possible.
Regardless of what SQL server we are talking about, as a general principle I would run all databases under one instance wherever possible, for all the reasons already mentioned by others.
From a memory point of view (again, assuming MS SQL Server) multiple databases within a single instance will generally result in more efficient usage.
We run multiple instances when required to by an off the shelf application.
For stuff we develop, we throw it all in a single instance.
