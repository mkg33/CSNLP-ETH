I shared the Drobo device out over NFS and copied the data onto it.
If you have even 1k to spend, it'd be easy enough to build a basic system (Even new) and load it with 4 or 5 500GB drives, all raided together (My Personal Favourite is Raid-5).
This way, if you ever need a place to keep files that are not super heavily utilized, there would be a place for them.
Remember: A NAS system you have limited control over (which some say would be a good thing).
I faced a similar situation with a large Oracle database.
I would build an opensolaris based box with a supermicro AOC-SAT2-MV8 SATA Controller Card, and some hard drives.
A 6-7TB solution like this would put you far under the $1000 mark.
But if you had to somehow manipulate the data that's being stored, a proper computer system would be the way to go, in my opinion.
Get a HP Proliant G6 with 8 Disks at 300GB each, 12GB of RAM, 2 Quad Core Procs was about EUR 3-4K - and it takes only 1U
We did the maintenance required on the production storage and then copied the data to it.
Then you have a TB of spare storage whenever you need it for random tasks as well :)
We had a Drobo (http://www.drobo.com) on hand (not the network enabled one) so I filled it with disks and connected it to my Mac laptop.
Everything went pretty smoothly although it did take quite a while (500GB or so).
And then you have a system you can use after the 'project' - either for storage, or for some other application you've been looking at testing.
If performance on the temporary storage isn't a huge deal your best bet would be to get a usb or possible cheap NAS enclosure with a 1TB disk.
Will give you very good IOPS and you can use it as a real production box later on.
No thanks, if anything on my site depends on it I wouldn't go with a consumer NAS...
