As a concrete example, consider upgrading a system from a i5-6440HQ to a i7-6870HQ, assuming one has the necessary tools and experience to take care the hardware side of things (i.e., BGA rework).
Often when upgrading a CPU, people say to check that the BIOS/UEFI (going to refer to both as "BIOS") supports the new CPU before buying/installing it, but what are the specific reasons that the BIOS needs the support, given the following assumptions about the upgrade?
A quick glance through the datasheet seems to show that they both run on the same voltages (correct me if I'm wrong).
Since surely if the new CPU's interface is similar enough, things should work just fine?
Is there any reason why the BIOS has to explicitly support the new CPU for the system to work?
Both chips have the same FCBGA1440 package and TDP of 45W, as well as being of the same "generation" of chips (Skylake).
The main high level differences between the chips is the i7 has 8 threads, runs at a slightly higher clock rate, has a more powerful graphics chip.
