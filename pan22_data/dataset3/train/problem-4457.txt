There are tools out there, such as ksar, that can take sar output and turn it into pretty graphs.
Windows client : h**p://sourceforge.net/projects/bbwin
If it comes down to it, multiple single OS monitoring programs would be acceptable.
I can't use perfmon because the python scripts are usually run from a *nix machine.
In my previous job I replaced Nagios with it to monitor linux, VMS, hpux, tru64 & Windows NT/2000 servers.
I'm looking for a way to remotely gather performance data for the CPU, Memory, Disk and Network I/O.
Solaris installs with commented-out sar cron jobs in the 'sys' user crontab, and I think some of the Linuxes do likewise.
I will not describe here all features of this tool but I highly recommend it !
Is there something similar to perfmon that can be used on multiple OS's to gather information remotely.
It can do remote monitoring of performance related metrics as you are asking for.
(Sorry for bad link but I can post only one as I'm a new user ^^)
Clients runs on Unix, Windows & VMS ( ;) ), it monitors & graphs a lot of metrics out-of-the-box (ie.
I have a python framework that I've created to run performance tests in a mixed server environment of Windows, Linux and Solaris.
It's an opensource rewrite of Bigbrother, I use it to monitor our server farm (linux) and i'm very satisfied with it.
If you want something quick, on the Solaris and Linux hosts you could enable collection of data with sar(1).
Server runs on (almost) any Unix, there is a simple & nice web interface integrated.
