Anisotropic filtering is primarily to solve the problem of texture blurring at highly oblique angles such as looking down a roadway or standing next to a wall.
Batch the objects its appropriate for and use it only for those, or if you don't have enough objects to justify it, copy them into pieces so the chunks aren't oblique when rendered.
Anisotropic filtering allows the texture to be probed at a different rate on each axis, versus isotropic filtering (linear, bilinear, trilinear...) which must be probed at the same rate on each axis.
Anisotropic filtering isn't inherently better, it's only "better for objects at funny angles".
You don't want to use it all the time because you'll be paying a performance penalty.
Anisotropic and isotropic textures are stored differently in the hardware because they do different things.
Anisotropic filtering does not alter the size of the texture.
Objects that are rendered long and skinny look better because the filter can choose the right mip level on each axis instead of being stuck with the resolution of the smaller axis and blurring the other one.
