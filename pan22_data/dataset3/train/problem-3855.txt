Then within the persistent session, use Tshark with the -b ring buffer flag.
Instead, capture all packets because the root cause could be anything.
To see if the network is a factor, consider running a packet sniffer on the server.
The sniffer will create a set of files containing the captured packets.
It is also possible that the root cause is in the server.
To assist in the search, ensure the server clock is accurate and then be as precise as possible in noting the time when the symptom is observed.
Use the time stamp to isolate packets around the time of interest.
To analyze the capture files, Wireshark's graphical interface is probably easiest.
Since the symptom occurs between two IP addresses on the same server, the root cause may or may-not be network related.
Using Tshark with the -r flag and piping results to grep can also work.
I agree with Iain that some monitoring is needed to debug.
It is possible that something unusual is happening on the network and causing the NIC to stumble.
b. SSH to the server and use a command-line tool such as 'screen' or 'tmux' to create a session that persists after logoff.
The trick will be finding the packets of interest within these capture files.
At this point, I suggest not specifying a capture filter.
Run Wireshark while remaining logged-in at the server console.
Since the problem is intermittent, perform ongoing monitoring with the ring buffer option.
