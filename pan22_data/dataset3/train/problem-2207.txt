However this is a slower process for discovery, so the vast majority of clients use probe request/responses primarily for discovery.
When an access point hears a probe request, if the probe request is either general in nature or for the configured wireless network, it responds with a probe response.
This does not necessarily indicate they actually want to join or associate to the network.
You have likely experienced this yourself without realizing it.
This is required with the SSID is "hidden" and is the default way many mobile devices try to reconnect to stored networks.
Often these are general in nature and how a device discovers which networks are around them.
Probe requests can also be directed to particular networks.
This list was generated largely from the probe responses the wireless client received from APs in the area when it sent out probe requests.
When you want to join a wireless device to a network, you have likely been presented with a list of wireless networks and selected the one you wanted to join.
So your AP will always respond to any general probe request from a wireless client.
When a wireless client is looking to join a wireless network (or check for the possibility of roaming to a new one), they send out probe requests.
All APs also advertise themselves with beacon frames periodically, which is the other way that clients can find wireless networks in the area.
They are simply checking the availability of wireless networks around them.
Think of it as the client device yelling, "Can any wireless networks hear me?"
This behavior is defined by the IEEE standards for 802.11 networks.
