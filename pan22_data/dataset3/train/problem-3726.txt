You may want to consider using a separate domain for bulk emails.
You may want to look at the SPF records for Gmail which use multiple include records.
Policies specified in includes are ignored so don't worry if they use a ~all or other permissive policy.
What you should put after the slash depends on the subnet that contains the mail servers.
Consider implementing DMARC with a reporting address if you want to track issues with SPF and/or DKIM.
If you are using a responsible provider, they will have an SPF record you can include before your policy, which normally should be -all.
There is a limit to how many DNS lookups that will be done before your SPF record is considered invalid.
I've blogged about Securing your Email Reputation with SPF among other topics.
There are multiple services that can provide reports on how well you have configured your email domain.
This should reduce the damage to your mail domains reputation, if there are problems with a bulk mailing.
You may also find the resources in my posting Detecting Email Server Forgery useful.
Several large providers provide reports to domains with DMARC configured.
This will depend on the subnet that was allocated for the mail server.
