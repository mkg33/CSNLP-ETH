If you do have to, just find a machine that already has an IP address, and ping something in middle.
But since you say DHCP isn't working, and your administrator is on vacation, I'm afraid you'll be stuck with some trial and error, as you've already been doing.
After all, standards are around so we don't have to reinvent things in new, and painful ways.
As per our discussion in comments, this is normally done via DHCP.
So quickly find a static ip available, use colasoft's free mac address scanner.
Use network inventory advisor trial version or perhaps newt trial version, run a scan of the IP range and whichever IP addresses don't respond - you'll have a good chance that that IP address is not taken :)

My advice is to find an IP that works, and keep it, until your admin returns to fix DHCP and/or to assign you a permanent static IP.
Considering there's a gateway and presumably a network.
Else, its pretty much trying IP addresses till one sticks.
To scan a subnet outside your local one, use lizard  systems network scanner or nmap.
Well, that's the whole point of DHCP - which is what you should be using.
Again, everyone is right that you should use DHCP if it is available, but since you asked, here is the range you have available for hosts on that network: 172.16.20.1-172.16.23.254.
You are bound to hit a free IP address with 1022 potential host IP addresses on the subnet.
