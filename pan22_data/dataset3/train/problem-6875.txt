Check the availability of your laptop's drivers for windows 7 and 8 (if 7 supports your devices, it is likely that 8 does too).
Go the microsoft site and checkout the MINIMUM hardware requirements for Win 7 and Win 8.
Assuming you can make those upgrades, the two OS's are very similar, 8 is actually slightly lighter / faster.
If you really want to continue using your laptop, a linux release might just work for this type of hardware.
If you are OK with the Modern GUI, that would probably be a marginally better choice.
I've managed to use Windows XP with Office 97 on Pentium II computer with 128 MB RAM.
From my experience and the opinion of numerous people I know Window 7 is much slower than Windows XP.
Windows 7/8 is better choice for new computers, having >= 8 GB RAM, >= 8 cores etc.
But if you still want to stick to Windows OS, then you are going have to upgrade to something a heck of a lot better performance wise.
I believe you are going to find that 1G of memory is insufficient for either.
Breathe New Life into Your Old PC â€” with Windows 7
On Microsoft's site, they state the minimum hardware requirements.
From my experience, systems that ran XP could run 7, but there were some performance issues, and 8 is supposed to be better than 7, performance wise.
From what I've seen, Windows 8 works somewhat faster than Windows 7, but I'm not sure how your hardware would be supported.
