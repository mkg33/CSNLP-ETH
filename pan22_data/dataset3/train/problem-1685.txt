Blue-eyed as I am, I considered this an easy task: I just stopped the server, copied the files and restarted it as follows:
I checked permissions and ownership of the directory a dozen times, everything within my MariaDB data directory is owned by the user mysql and every file has the permission 0660 every directory 0700â€¦
With innodb files you need to restore the entire database server to a new instance.Use mysqldump oc_activity_mq to extract a SQL version of the table out of that backup.
Oddly in PHPMyAdmin all tables have the Collation in use.
I than tried to create an empty database of the same name before I repeated all steps above, but I got the same error.
But I am asking here specifically for a database with innodb engine, as off what I read, I got the impression the problems I ran in, might have to do with the engine
I know this question came up before, for example here: How to restore MySQL database from Files
Revist your backup strategy using innodbbackup, lvm, and/or mysqldump/pump.
I am trying to restore a MariaDB database containing innodb tables from files.
My question is, is it possible to restore a single database with innodb tables directly from an old data directory to a new one?
If mysql was running and being updated at the same time it was copied it might have some form of corruption.
Although the database and all it's tables are there, I can't access any table.
