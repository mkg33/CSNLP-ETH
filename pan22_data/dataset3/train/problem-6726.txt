Here are some screenshots from my setup: http://www.reborndigital.com/pubfiles/wifi_gp_ss/
I've setup this exact scenario except I do not use any 3rd party wireless utilities such as the Dell one, I simply let Windows do it's thing.
You can create a Vista+ and XP policy in there that gets the job done.
When the SSID is in range, the machine will connect to it using the credentials supplied at logon (SSO), connect then auth.
Also good idea to enable "Always wait for the network at computer start-up and logon" (Computer Config > Policies > Administrative Templates > System/Logon).
How to enable computer-only authentication for an 802.1X-based network in Windows Vista, in Windows Server 2008, and in Windows XP Service Pack 3
Since I hate doing things redundantly and repetitively, I simply use the GPO Computer Config > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Wireless Network (IEEE 802.11) Policies.
We were having issues with the shared devices receiving "No login server available to service logon request" The issue was resolved by enabling single sign on under the 802.1x settings.
I set this up on 7 but should be the same for Vista and actually XP.
I didn't see it posted but we are running a wireless network using 802.1x user authentication against AD.
Also, if the credentials supplied to not allow the machine to connect, I have it set to the user can be prompted to enter credentials again for wireless (not necessary with SSO but in some cases it's useful).
