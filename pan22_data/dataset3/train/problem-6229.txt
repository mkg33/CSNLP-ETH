A system managed page file with its shrinking and growing is subject to  heavy fragmentation.
The general rule for system managed pagefile is: the operating system will create a page file that is one and a half times the amount of RAM that is installed in your computer.

The rest of the article is well worth reading, and does talk a bit more about what happens when Windows grows the pagefile.
Near the end of this article, Mark Russinovich briefly discusses system-managed pagefile sizes:
