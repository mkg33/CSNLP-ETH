To make that application work well, you`d better to install .NET framework 3.5 for that application.
It seems that there is an autorun program need  .NET framework 3.5.
Of course, you could uninstall that application if you don't want to use it anymore.
You should easily be able to fix this by making sure the program is fully uninstalled.
You could try to perform a clean boot or use Autoruns tool to capture the culprit.
You can do this by going to Control Panel > Programs and Features > find your program and uninstall.
This is probably because part, or all, of the program you were trying to install is still on the computer.
I've started installing some program but after noticing that it requires the .NET framework, I canceled the installation.

You can sort the programs by name or date installed to easily find the program
Since then this popup appears whenever I start the system:
AFAIK, some installers 'rollback' any changes made to the computer if the user clicks cancel, but some do not (which is probably the type of installer you used).
