I wouldn't suggest Software RAID-5 because of performance overhead (the parity calculation is best left to a dedicated RAID controller).
http://www.baarf.com/ I'm not just accepting what they say.
I hated not being able to upgrade the kernel of a RHEL installation because the binary drivers for the hardware RAID weren't updated for the newer kernel.
While I'm aware of a slight performance decrease, is it really that much of a difference?
Considering you can't aquire a hardware raid setup, raid1 done is software is way better than no raid at all.
Is it recommended to use software RAID-1 in a production environment?
and I wouldn't run it on a database server in production, but if disk I/O isn't going to be too heavy it's probably fine.
Due to budget constraints, I cannot get a hardware RAID controller for a new server.
I would almost recommend it over hardware RAID because of this and what ptman says about having to have backup controller in case it dies.
And if the RAID card dies you need to get another one to get at the data (well, not necessarily with RAID1, but with RAID5 you would), but with software RAID any machine will do.
Actually, you may be happier with software RAID as it is more flexible in regards to disk sizes and types.
I use the FreeBSD software RAID-1 (gmirror) on production web servers, and the performance impact isn't noticeable.
I've been disappointed by RAID5 performance and found the answer why.
