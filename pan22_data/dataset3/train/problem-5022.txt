I dealt with a similar issue, all replies I could find on the web were of no help whatsoever.
Is there any reason you aren't using the installer to do the work for you?
First off I assume you have tried running http://yourservernamehere/check.php and everything seems to come back correct.
Also, can you confirm that the .php handler mapping is correctly set?
Well, I'm not sure what I did, but somehow I fixed it.
I turned on detailed error handling in IIS and discovered I was receiving a 404.7 error: 'The request filtering module is configured to deny the file extension'.
IF this is the case I would suggest checking in your php.ini file the setting under:
I'd still like to know why I was getting the error if possible.
; Defines the default timezone used by the date functions
Most likely it is blank like mine was, this generates a silly error with newer version of php and for whatever reason you will be dead in the water until you have a timezone specified (mine is America/Chicago).
I may be assuming a lot about your situation but it sounds very similar to mine and I spent several days frustratedly searching for an answer.
Just wanted to add the stupid answer encase anyone else find this issue with the same problem.
What had happened, was that windows was hiding file extensions, so the file was actually called index.php.txt... Not a funny 30 minutes.
I went into the 'Request Filtering' menu within the IIS manager, added '.php' as an approved file type and this fixed the issue for me.
I had this issue today but none of the fixes above worked for me.
I removed the website and re-added it, then checked my FastCGI Mapping settings, everything looked just like before, but this time it works.
