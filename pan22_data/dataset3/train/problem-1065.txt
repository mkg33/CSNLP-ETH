if the password is entered correctly then they are allowed to view the website
(I can live with the fact that someone could work around it using a proxy... most of my users won't know how to do that)
Ideally I'd like to only to be available at (say) lunchtimes.
This sort of functionality is offered by all good web content filter systems, and some bad ones.
AD has no interaction with the users browsing experience, web traffic is directed through your proxy if you have one, then your gateway and so it is at these points you would need to filter the traffic.
You can add the allowed/blocked URLs on the Content Advisor Approved Sites taB
I have checked out AD and there's no way you can blocked website but use Content Advisor (GPO -> User Config -> Windows Settings -> IE Maintenance).
Is there a way that AD can be used to block access to certain websites (e.g.
AD is used to authenticate users, validate the users access rights for resources and can be used to prevent the user accessing the internet at all by blocking access to browsing applications, or directing to a non-existant proxy, but it cannot filter sites.
I work for SmoothWall - our "Network Guardian" software will enable you to do just what you describe.
not sure where u went to school but YES AD can blcok website... it can add a password to view the page.
