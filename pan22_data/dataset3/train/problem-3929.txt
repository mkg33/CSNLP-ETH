It could be some kind of ActiveX control or script issue.
Maybe try using IE 6 or IE 8, as there have been changes between all three versions.
If other user-agents (as Tom Willwert hints at in his comment) then I would start by seeing if some sort of URL rewrite filter is employed by your host (such as ISAP_Rewrite).
If they're on your internal network check DNS, check proxy settings in your IE clients.
if so, check that there is no rule in there disallowing ie.
Also, check and make sure your DNS is returning the correct IP address.
Are the IE clients that are not getting through to the host in your internal network or are they on the Internet?
IE7 may block access to certain features by default to an external site, but allow it for intranet sites.
Is it intentionally blocked or is there just an error?
check if there is a robots.txt in the root of the site on the blocking server.
Otherwise, probably check IIS settings, and make sure both platforms are using the same version of things (SQL server if used, IIS (probably identical), system updates).
What are the firewall policies between your local network and your remote site?
In IE7, you could try adding the website for the externally hosted version to IE7's list of "Trusted Sites"...Tools, Internet Options, Security, click Trusted Sites, then click the Sites button and add it.
It may not be able to find the IP address if there's a DNS error.
that can cause problems, too, and doesn't always tell you the problem.
Especially if for some reason the hosting company is using a non-standard SSL port.
Make sure you can ping the external server, and can access it with something else, i.e.
What devices are you going through, (example firewalls, routers, ISPs, etc) to get to the "Remote Server"
They have the ability to match user-agent strings and send clients elsewhere based on the results.
