The client tries again ~3 seconds later, and gets no response.
The problem is that browsers are not retrying frequently enough for the user to get a response quickly and the users are claiming "system slowness."
The problem I am getting is slowness of the SSL handshake.
It is configured to use separate processes per connection to isolate them and set up to use /dev/urandom for startup and builtin for connect.
After the handshake is successful, it works smoothly.
Apache is really the only thing running on this box.
I have an instance of Apache (httpd) on one machine using mod_ssl with openssl and mod_jk pointing at several tomcat instances on other physical machines.
I need to figure out why Apache (or mod_ssl) is simply ignoring or taking forever to process the requests for certificates.
This can repeat several time before actually sending the certificates.
Looking at a tcpdump, there are instances of the server receiving bytes from the client (assuming this is trying to establish the SSL connection), but Apache (mod_ssl) does not respond.
