I solved this by double-clicking the contact card in the attachment, selecting the File tab, clicking on the big 'Move to Folder' button, selecting 'Copy to folder...', and then selecting my contacts folder.
All you do is left click on the distribution list in the email and drag it from the email to the contacts button and drop it.
I wasn't able to just open the contact group up and hit save as suggested below...although that's probably how it should work.
How do I save a contact group that was sent via to my email - to my outlook contacts?
If it is sent from another users contact list simply double click the attachment to open it.
Other clarification:  When attempting to use this method in a new message, however - We still have to select "contacts" from the drop-down menu, where if we create our own group, the name of the "contact group" will automatically fill itself in as you begin typing it in the "to" field.
Click on File in the top left hand corner, you will then see a square button which says 'Move to folder' click that and you will see 2 drop downs click the second one which says 'copy to folder' scroll down to contacts, click it then press save.
Make sure to double check it has gone into your contacts and it is ready to use.
Then, click the big, "move to folder" button - select "Copy to folder" and select "My Contacts".
To solve, as stated above, double click the "Contact Card", which is the attachment in the email sent to you.
