Here is a pair of metal rails I found by googling hard drive mounting rails, http://www.directron.com/cdrail.html.
Well, improvise, or see if you can order the bits from the maker.
When I asked the previous owner, they said they threw out the clips.
However, when the previous owner removed their hard drive, they also took the clips required to insert the hard drive.
Something to absorb the vibration (cardboad works fine), and either screws or good strong duct tape.
The drive bay is significantly larger than the  hard drive, so just sliding the drive in leaves it too loose to use.
I think you'll need to check either a computer builder near you that has been in business long enough to have old parts lying around, or get online and start searching.
If it's a CD style bay you're trying to fit it into then you can get conversion kits for 5.25" to 3.5".
I know Antec sells the trays and vibration absorbing screw kits for mounting drives (and has really nice customer service people!
Today, I got around to installing my hard drive, and noticed this.
I have recieved an old computer minus the hard drive.
Depending on the case and your experience, you can sometimes drill holes or attach a custom made bracket to hold the drive.
