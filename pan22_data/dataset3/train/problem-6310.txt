This can be a number of things and unfortunately, without seeing the machine, it is hard to advise.
Start -> Settings -> Control Panel -> Network Connections
If it does not show under Device Manager, take a look in the system event log as you should see a few warnings.
Those 2 monitors are an indicator of a network connection.
As an extra, sometimes DHCP can just mess up in some environments - it may be worth trying to assign a static address to your machine as it is possible that everything is working but DHCP is not assigning a correct address.
The first thing I would do is check for a driver update for your network card as I have seen problems like this in the past.
If there is no connection listed, the PC is not seeing your network card and you likely need a replacement.
Without seeing your network, I can't say what address to try.
If you have no connection on boot, it is likely an issue with your network or your NIC (network interface card).
Lastly, if it is found but there is just some random error - try going to Control Panel > Network Adapters then right clicking on your device and choose Disable then re-enable it.
Next, I would check that the adapter is being correctly discovered as if it is internal, there could be some sort of hardware problem - Right click on My Computer to go to Computer Management and then expand device manager and make sure it is listed under Network Adapters  AND there is no sort of yellow triangle - if there is a triangle, try to see what the error is.
