I try currently to disable some tabs of the ms-settings software included in Windows 10 OS.
As you maybe know, this is not possible to handle ms-settings: with GPO or gpedit and I have to make it work with my own methods.
- Used applocker to allow package application windows.immersivecontrolpanel.windowsupdate.
In fact I would like to allow Windows Update for all users and disable the others functions for everybody.
I'm working with two versions of W10 (W10 LTSB 2015 => v1507 and W10 PRO v1607).
- Delete regedit keys, DWORD, ... to only authorize the access to Windows Update tab.
- Handle security strategies of Dll and Exe who are used by ms-settings:windowsupdate (Dll and Exe that I found in registry) -> this was a test to do it to the others functions.
Hope you'll help me with this very painfull problem.
I can't find anything about that except to repair the ms-settings software when it doesn't work.
All these things I tried doesn't work, I can still have access to all the functions of ms-settings:
