To this make sure you have access to to the EPEL repository, you can do this by running the following command.
The -y flag will automatically answer "yes" to every confirmation question, so leave it out if you want to be able to say no to something.
Another efective but very easy way to install Node.js on your machine is to do it from the official repository.
On Centos 7, for installation of npm and nodejs, follow these steps
Once you create RPMs using these instructions, you must do the installation of created RPMs with --force (there is a conflict on node man page, just ignore it).
Both nodejs and npm and all dependencies for both have been added to epel 7.
usually the build will go without any issues, or minor ones that can be solved easily by modification of the .spec file and nothing else
mind you - I don't have access to centos 7 machine right now, so can't test.
And since I want to manage node packages during the development I also need to install the npm package manager for Node.js by using the following command.
