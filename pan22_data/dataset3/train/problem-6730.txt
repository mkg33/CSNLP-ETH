Creating a high granularity grid increases computational cost for training, and there is no reason to do so if it would only cover additional cases that are much rarer than the detection accuracy that the base algorithm achieves.
It seems that the height and width should always be the same, but how is it determined?
The ground truth for YOLO needs to be expressed in the form of grid locations with classes and bounding rectangle sizes.
The choice can be driven by the ground truth data.
And even with smaller grid squares, YOLO may not be able to learn to separate the objects, if such an overlap only occurs rarely.
If you don't find any training examples where you want to label two items with their centre inside the same grid square, then this is a good indication that your grid size is fine-grained enough.
I would expect a simple rule of diminishing returns applies.
It will depend in part on how crowded your scene will become with items that you want to detect and locate separately.
Some article like this one uses 13 x 13 while others use 19 x 19 (e.g.
Is there any general guideline regarding how many grid cells should be picked up over the others?
As datasets grow larger, and object detection can be trained on more powerful computers, we may see state of the art models still using YOLO but with more grid points.
I'm now learning YOLO but I don't understand how the number of grid cells is determined.
Even if there are one or two examples with a clash like this, you may be able justify labelling just one item in the ground truth and be OK with a resulting model that is not able to cope with close overlap between two separate objects.
