If the user has the Admin access to the PC, then would this not allow him to remove all others ability to do anything with the file/folder?
Since I don't like installing software that I won't actually use, I found this jewel of a VBScript:
Clicking Apply/Ok then applies the new setting to the file or directory.
Would it not be possible to limit the accessibilty to the file with the Security Tab, when you right-click and go to Properties for the File or Folder?
Conversely, you can do the same thing through the GUI by right-clicking the file or directory they you want to mark read-only, selecting properties, and ticking the Read-only box.

The attrib.exe command is available at the command line, and will allow you set a file or directory to be read-only.
I have to admit as I type, that my work PC is still on WinXP Pro, so what I stated above may not be available any longer - I am still not as comfortable with my new Win 8.1 Pro box at home as I am with the years of working with Win XP
In some scenarios creating new folder with name of the file may do the job.

This would effectively "lock" the file by not allowing it to be changed or deleted.
