Bottom line is get your quotes and look at what you need and what your horizon technologies are.
As a general guide, thicker wire (larger guage) is less resistant than thinner and current travels much better along it, so thicker wire is said to give you a lower signal attenuation (or loss), this is measured in db.
STP is only needed in cases of high EM noise if you have that high EM noise in your DC you have other problems.
Unless you are severely cost constrained, CAT6 is the way to go.
Noise is introduced to signal transmission it will effect how the signal is received.
I'm about to buy cables for our first data center install.
Another helpful metric is the SNR (also measured in db) or signal to noise ratio.
Most modems will provide this diagnostic, but for testing cables you will need expensive testing tools.
The future growth and similar cost to Cat5e makes it an easy choice.
You could use unshielded CAT5 cable, but you really shouldn't.
So the speeds attainable with that is much much higher than copper.
Especially in a data center, where there are lots of cables and quite some EM noise.
Attenuation for a medium and SNR can be used with any signalling.
However, the additional cost of STP is probably not necessary unless your application has strict packet loss requirements or you are required by code to have shielded wire.
