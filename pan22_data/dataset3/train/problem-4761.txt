Building off Traveling Tech Guy's solution, DropboxIndex is a Python script that generates an HTML file with links to the files in a Dropbox public folder.
Any public site is fine from Dropbox till Skydrive or anywhere else.
If you want to specifically use Dropbox, then why not use one of the extensions for Joomla that connect to your Dropbox account.
I am thinking of having the entire solution automated, somehow like Dropbox does.
I have a website (Joomla), where I wish to share MP3 files.
Important: the MP3-s do not need to be copied to OUR Joomla site.
I would like to make the weekly upload as simple as possible.
In Joomla, you would then link to the index.html file that it generates.
I believe you need to register to have access to the Dropbox API - but it's free.
Just copy the new MP3 to a dedicated folder, and let the system do all the upload and link creation hassle.
Unfortunately, Dropbox does not allow website visitors to browse/list the content of its  public folder.
But I wish to have some automated solution of having links appearing within our Joomla site.
