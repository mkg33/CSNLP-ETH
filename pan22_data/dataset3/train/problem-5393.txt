@ceejayoz's answer is correct on the technical points.
As far as I can tell, Citrix XenServer offers the following on top of Xen.org:
XenServer will support Windows up to and including Windows 2008.
Does anyone know the difference between version of xen produced by xen.org and Citrix XenServer?
I can't seem to find any mention of the differences between the two?
I should also mention that XenServer includes everything that you need to install on top of bare metal.
With Xen.org you need to install it yourself which can be very challenging/fun/interesting (pick whichever one fits the context).
Just about to cancel our VMware ESX Server subscription...
Note, however, that both xen.org and XenServer are available for free (see http://www.citrix.com/freexenserver).
Official Windows 7/2008 R2 support should be introduced soon; it does currently work, albeit with a command-line tweak, and it's not officially supported.
The value-add features Citrix offers may or may not be required in your environment, but I've found from personal experience that the full XenServer works very well for small-scale deployments.
