one pc can able to ping other pc which is in the same LAN Network.
Based on you comments, it seems that you first problem is that you don't know how to subnet, and you need to divide your 23.12.0.0/24 network into four subnets.
You can do this with static routes (this doesn't scale well), or you can run a common routing protocol between the routers that will automatically tell each router about the networks connected to to the other router.
that's why you are able to successfully ping Between computers on the same switch.
if you want to ping pc0 to pc7 then you have to run routing protocol on your both router.
Assign a different /26 network to each of the sites, and you will need a network different than the site-assigned networks for you router-to-router link.
nut when you try to ping computers like PC0 to PC7 they are not able to ping others because they are in the different LAN Network.
Once you have the networks correctly assigned, you can set up your routing.
Each router will inherently know about the networks directly connected to it, but the router will need to be told about the networks on the other side of the other router.
Usually, you will use a /30 or /31 network for a point-to-point link like you have between the routers.
your Network Model contains 3 Network as shown in figure.
