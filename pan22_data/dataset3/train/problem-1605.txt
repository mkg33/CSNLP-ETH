All you need is the same amount of RAM on each channel.
back in "the old days" we would get 4 or so identical amd p5 cpu's and 6 sets of ram out when trying to build a system because 1 processor jsut wouldent work with memory set 1345 in the systemboard.
(Also, assume that there aren't any bottlenecks because of other parts on the system)
the tolerances and such are much better now so you dont find that kind of compatibility issues much  any more but it still makes it so that 2 identical pc's with a corp image that was started on both at the same time complete at 2 entirely different times etc.
memory always goes to the lowest common denominator.
q4 unless the systemboard doesnt specify other wise usually you can put multiple sized pairs in as long as the "kit" stays in the same channel.
I'd like to know what are the factors that need to be set in order to sustain the Dual Channel mode.
The official stance is it should be same type/speed of memory to keep dual channel.
(Some of the questions might sound silly but their answers aren't that clear to me)
some systmboards are very picky about ram being from dual channel kits while others may not care if they are the same type of memory.
My comment earlier about depending on the system board is due to each system board even from the same batch of the same model can act very differently.
the phisical componants have a tolerance of x% meaning that no 2 products will be exactly alike causing little quarks because 1 critical capasiter etc is -1% from spec where the next is +4%.
