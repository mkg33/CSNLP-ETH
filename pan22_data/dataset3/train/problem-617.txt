(copy&paste the album URL to the end of the first one)
At the bottom of the source file for each album look for "album_id", [list], where album_id is in the URL for each album in the albumarchive page.
Albums only in Google+ are not capable of being downloaded in bulk.
There you get them all, in full size (but no EXIF data)!
https://get.google.com/albumarchive/<user_id> (I had to get the user_id from their Google Plus page: https://plus.google.com/<user_id>/
For example I wrote a Python script to download all the images:
You can then use a script to read the [list] as json and iterate through it.
What I ended up doing was look at the album source on:

Using Picasa should allow you to download full albums to your computer.
Update to the latest version of Picasa, then start Picasa, and check the top right side of the window to make sure you are logged into Google Plus.
This apparently only works for albums which are shared to Google+ from Picasaweb.
Had to do this today since they are closing Google Plus in a couple of days and a deceased friend of mine had shared my birthday photos with me so I wanted to download a copy before they shut down.
This even works for private albums (visibility: ‘anyone with the link’).
I'm like so much new wallpapers shared on Google Plus but I don't like to download them manually so today I'm just create a bash script to download complete Google Plus Album for me ;-)
