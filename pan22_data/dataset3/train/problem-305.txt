You would need to have at least some understanding though of your routers and VPN tunnels and how they are configured and what commands to run to accomplish the above.
You'll need (assuming straight VPN tunnels between the routers and not a managed network in the middle):
On the remote router, I don't see any icmp packet from 10.20.0.1 while pinging a host on the 10.10.x.x network.
Every gateway can ping every other one, and the PC behind them.
when I run a traceroute, I don't even have a first hop.
Focusing on just the main router and the remote 10.10.x.x:
without knowing your network and the configs involved, it is a difficult thing to answer outright.
I have a main router (10.20.0.1 (lan), 10.20.201.1 (vpn server)) connected to 5 other GW via VPN.
One of my router, 10.20.6.1 (lan), 10.20.201.5 (vpn), has access to another network (10.10.10.x) and I want to give all my network access to it.
There may even be things beyond what I've mentioned.
If I remove the route, the first hop is internet (which is the default).
THe remote router can ping the 10.10.x.x network and access it whitout issues.
