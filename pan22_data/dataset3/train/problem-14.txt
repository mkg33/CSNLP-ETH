Create an account ahead of time with the password.
then write a script that tries to map the share with all the usernames and the default pw.
If users have use that same password the password hash dumped out for the users should be the same.
Should be quite fast, probably faster than the share + connect via password script proposed.
You should look at John the Ripper - its a password cracking utility.
It sounds as if you could compare the user creation date to the date the password was last changed, and if there's a match, toggle the 'password change on next login' field.
There's no official way to view user passwords (it's possible, but you have to delve into ... security utilities).
this way no logon is nessecary and you will not break the policy
I worked at a company audited by a large firm they suggested we stop providing common passwords when setting up users as they often also get group assignments - meaning someone knowing john smith was starting could attempt to logon with the standard username for john smith along with the standard password.
Linux and unix systems prevent rainbow tables as they often add salt to ensure the hash tables for one system cannot be used for a second system.
I have used pwdump 6 in the past to dump password hashes.
create a share where you are being asked for a password when doing net use.
Your word list could consist of just your default password.
It's probably best to approach this from a password-age angle.
Just make sure you have permissions as password hashes are sensitive as there are tools like rainbow tables which are several gb in size and allow people to find the user's password from the hash.
You can run it in dictionary attack mode which takes a list of passwords from a text file.
