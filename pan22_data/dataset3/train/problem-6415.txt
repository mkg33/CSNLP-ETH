Your issue stems from the fact that your /dev/sda2 is TOO small for both Windows and Fedora EFI bits.
At which point I'd recommend starting the partitioning logic from scratch with the following minimal partitioning:
(CAUTION: This drive Should NOT be reformatted during reinstall, nor does it need reformatting; unless all precious data is copied/backed up somewhere)
2) enough space (noticeably smaller restraint) for the non-os data on Windows and Fedora respectively
(Windows D: (possible Shared Drive across both OSes)
The average Windows 'kernel'  is 75Mb  in size and a default 'just works' Fedora kernel is 25-28M, simple math shows 100-105M > 99M.
1) enough spare drive space to hold roughly 300Gb to contain ALL of the present Windows and Fedora data.
(Enough for Windows kernel and the default 3 kernels held but grub)
If I understood your 2)Is there a possibility of creating a recovery image of my Windows partition(C: drive) and back it up to a D: drive or a complete separate hard disk that i have?
