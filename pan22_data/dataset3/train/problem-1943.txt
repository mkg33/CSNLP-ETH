Choose "Place a copy in", "Other", then choose your inbox.
Menu entry "Edit / Account settings...", tab "Copies & Folder",  then "When sending messages, automatically...".
You can create a new virtual folder which contains both incoming and sent messages.
I'm still using Thunderbird 2.0.0.23 and the "Copy Sent to Current" extension which gives you the option of choosing the folder sent items get saved to.
You might want to install the companion extension called "Gmail Conversation View" (cannot post more than 1 hyperlink) (full disclosure: I'm the author).
I don't know whether it works with Thunderbird 3 or not - I haven't thought about upgrading yet (but as it's now at 3.0.1 I might).
I just configured Thunderbird to put copies of sent mail into my inbox.
See http://wiki.github.com/protz/GMail-Conversation-View/displaying-your-own-messages-in-the-inbox (warning: requires Thunderbird 3.1).
As a bonus, you might want to check "Place replies in the folder of the message being replied to".
By default it selects the current folder, so if when sending or replying to e-mails from your inbox it will choose that folder.
Nevertheless, the conversation -- or tree -- view seems not to work perfectly here with my TB 3.0.1.
When you create it, just choose the inbox and the "sent" folder and say "no conditions" (or corresponding, I'm German).
