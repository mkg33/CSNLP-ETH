I think the question rather is "at what cost", to which I do not have a direct answer.
I don't have personal experience with the operation of a New gTLD but the answer surely must be that it is possible for you to operate your own nameservers (and other services).
Making changes to a gTLD delegation also appears relatively straightforward, IANA has information on how to manage a delegation readily available and a web-based management interface.
It seems that it would be prudent to review your own application and the agreements you entered with IANA to assess the impact of these planned changes when it comes to complying with policy and any additional technical requirements mandated therein.
However, browsing through the New gTLD Applicant Guidebook, it would appear that during the application process you provided IANA with documentation of how you will operate in compliance with their policies, a good chunk of which appears to be about the technical operation of the gTLD registry and nameserver services (presumably answered, at least to some extent, based on your use of these externally provided services which you now want to replace).
IANA's technical requirements for nameservers appears to be a straightforward technical baseline, essentially just normal best practices for any domain.
