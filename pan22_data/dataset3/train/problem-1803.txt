I believe without them, you will have the 'turn off' effect, but I am not certain.
You could also use the other options like suspend, or shutdown the guest OS.
So my take is that individual vm need not be shut down if the default setting is used.
If you have your VMs configured to 'Turn OFF', then shutting down the host OS would be close to equivalent to pulling the power from the VMs.
I think under HyperV settings there is a default option to 'do this to VM when restarting'
The VM came back up with the notepad open, with the text there.
If your VMs are configured this way, and you want them to safely shutdown, then you need to shut them down first.
In my tests, no, the VM's do not need to be shut down.
It depends on how your configured your Virtual machines.
Do keep in mind that the shutdown the guest, requires that you have guest additions properly installed on the guest.
It seems that the default setting is saving system state.
I actually tested this by having notepad open on a VM, with unsaved text, then restarted the host.
