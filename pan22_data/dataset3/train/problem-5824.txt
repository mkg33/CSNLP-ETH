It is an wonderful tool to do a file system audit and five much more insight into it.
The find command with the -mtime and -mmin predicates can do this.
However, how do you know your database wasn't compromised as well?
You should make them read only except where needed.
as sinping pointed out "tripwire" should be your answer to the problem you are facing.
Helpful bit of advice -- if you can't avoid Joomla (or the 3rd-party add-ons, which are the biggest offenders), I would highly recommend staying up-to-date on the known exploits out there and disable add-ons as necessary:
Going forward, might I suggest you run some form of IDS such as tripwire (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/) or aide (http://www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html).
Find is probably your best bet at this point, but I would agree with the fresh installs.
Dnotify might be interesting for you as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnotify
Most applications like Joomla can benefit from locking down the file permissions.

I doubt your web server needs write access to all of the files/directories in the tree.
