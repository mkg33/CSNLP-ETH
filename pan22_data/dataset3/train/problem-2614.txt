It sounds like a router/firewall Linux distribution would serve you just fine.
At it's core it is a linux box with a nice web gui.
There is a telnet and ssh interface but that is completely undocumented.
If you only need ethernet interfaces on the router a snapgear firewall (I use the SG560) would do the job.
So you can't use a "reboot in 10" like you can on a cisco to get you out of trouble if you lock yourself out when working on the firewall rulesets.

If you put a dsl modem in bridged mode on the wan side it can also initiate PPPoE sessions.
The Cisco 871w is a phenomeninal SOHO router that does everything you've required and more.
They offer wired and wireless, with DSL modem and without.
There Enterprise class routers are highly configurable, and are almost as easy to manage as Linksys (albeit via Telnet) and yet powerful enough to offer site-to-site connectors, multiple public ips, filter rules, etc.
If you need ADSL, T1, E1 cards, the SSG20 has you covered.
One gotcha with the Snapgear is that all changes are live and automatically saved.
