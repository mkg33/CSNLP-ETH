I've had that kind of problems before, with a cheap mouse.
The problem has to be in the scroll wheel, and opening the mouse with a little cleaning and checking the moving parts would help.
I had the exact same problem on my Win 7 x64 after installing Logitech SetPoint.
Thought I'd mention it anyway since no other has, and the requestor didn't mention if problem occurs everywhere or in browser only.
If you click it, it suspends the extraneous scrolling.
Solution 2 is not fix your problem but change the way you using mouse.
The problem only occured in my web browser though.
Pushing the scroll button usually fixes this but did not.
So my solution was to simply disable Logitech SetPoint addon in your browser and it worked perfectly again.
Then I noticed it continued after i turned off the mouse.
TUrns out it was the batteries in my bluetooth keyboard were low causing it to errantly activate the "home" button on the keyboard.
Depending on the mouse, it may be hard to do, or nearly impossible without inducing damage.
I never noticed during the SetPoint installation, but it actually installs an addon (atleast for Firefox), and that damn addon apparantly creates scroll issues.
My 2017 Darkfield has a button behind the scroll wheel that toggles on and off.
