Axcrypt is used to encrypt a single file or folder.
The only solution I thought of so far would be to password protect it in an archive, but how safe is that?
If you do it properly and don't do something silly you should not have to worry about being hacked.
Just use an encrypted notepad replacement such as locknote - its portable so you're sharing one file still, and you can pass the password to the person who is running the system.
It is a normal text file containing notes, but which will pass, let's say, through an unlimited number of hands, but needs to be accessible to only a few.
What would be the most practical way to protect (from reading, or better to say, understanding the contents) a text file in a way that can be done from the command line?
You'd need to find some way of exchanging the password, of course, but its secure, simple and would work across systems.
It is actually a bit more complicated, but this is the gist of it.
You should simply use an encryption program that is open source, proven and widely accepted by the security community.
