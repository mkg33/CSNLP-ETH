I've tried many different solutions ranging from powershell scripts, wsreset.exe and folder permissions but I can't get it to run at all.
So this time when I recreated my account and copied over my files, I excluded the Appdata folder and the store now works perfectly.
wsreset.exe came back with error 'Invalid Registry'.
On my Windows 10 machine (with latest updates), when I login with my user, search for 'Store' and click on the 'Store' result.
I had this same problem, did a bit of googling, and landed on this solution (source):
I've had to do it twice, but after the second time the problem hasn't come back.
After doing some digging and again re-creating my user account, I have discovered that the AppData for the Windows Store had been encrypted from my previous Windows 8 install.
I've also ran sfc /scannow and it said that it fixed some corrupted files.
My existing Windows Store apps do load up fine on my machine I just can't load up the Store itself under my user.
Has anyone had this issue before or know some steps that do work?
When I login under my partner's account, the store works perfectly fine.
