Once you have installed ESXi you can use its interface to set up your data stores.
Your physical hard disks become Data Stores and as you configure virtual machines and drives for them, you'll see folders with various files, the largest of which will probably be VMDK files which are the only Hard Drives the virtual machines know about.
Do all your hard disk config for the virtual machines inside the vCenter app as you set up each virtual machine.

The "hard drives" you set up for Virtual Machines are actually files.
So don't bother partitioning anything on the physical drives.
I just have one giant volume, then in the datastore vmWare puts each VM's files in a seperate folder to keep them tidy.
During the reboot operation, VFAT scratch and VMFS partitions are created on the disk.
Unless you have a specific need, partitioning will reduce your future flexibility.
Yes, ESXi partitions and formats vmfs volumes on your local disk.
