Right now, I'm in the process of reformatting, but I've hit a snag and I'd like to ask a question before I proceed any further.
/dev/sda7 - / - for second Linux which is yet to be installed.
/dev/sda5 - / - for first Linux which is already installed.
Back in the day I used to tinker with the kernel a bit, so I got into the groove of creating a separate /boot partition to make it easy to fix when I invariably broke something.
Common files such as stage 1, stage 2 and config files will be the same for the grub package from the two distros.
I realize this arrangement is a bit stupid, but before I get rid of most of those partitions and start over, how would Grub2/Linux behave if I set /dev/sda2 as the /boot mountpoint for two different Linux distros?
The boot partition can contain as many kernel images as physically possible.
Link above vaguely suggests I should not do this, but does not provide a very rigourous answer.
So far, I've installed Windows and the first of two Linux distros.
Will the chainloader derp out trying to figure out which volume to look for?
Assuming you don't allow the installer to automatically overwrite the boot partition and that the filesystem of sda2 is supported in both kernels, there will be no issues.
