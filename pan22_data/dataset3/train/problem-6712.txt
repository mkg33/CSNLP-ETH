What you want to do is known as Multi-WAN or multi-homing, and it will allow you to "bond" two 4 Mbps lines into what is effectively an 8 Mbps line.
The performance gain is obvious in programs that use multiple connections like Bittorrent and internet download manager (in the latter, the max number of connections should be big enough (definitely > 1)).
It wont allow 1 machine to use 2 connections at once but it will allow multiple machines to connect to the via the load balancing router that will automatically switch the connections depending on load.
this is not balancing this is doubling the speed for one download...
pfSense offers something on par with most business-grade routers (very much like DD-WRT), but also has excellent multi-WAN support.
If this is something you want to play around with, I highly recommend putting several networking cards into an old computer that you're not using, and load up pfSense on it.
So essentially you could have 20mb (10mb + 10mb lines) into your premiss but the max any one machine could use at one time would be 10mb.
Some routers can accept multiple WAN connections (e.g.
It's actually possible, I managed to do this with two WiFi connections and two WiFi cards (one that came with my laptop and a usb one).
What ive looked into doing in the past (i havnt had time to set it all up yet though ) is using a load balancing router.
Yes you can,I personally tried a program called connectify dispatch and it merged two networks even for Internet Download Manager,and merged the speed,one of them is LAN and the Other WLAN.... yet one problem it is not free but there is a free version(still useful).
For the load balancing, I used Network Manager (from SortByte) that can be found here.
The software is very easy to use; to achieve the load balancing, just open the control panel from the gadget, then select load balancing from the tools menu.
There are quite a few "multiple wan routers" available in many price ranges.
