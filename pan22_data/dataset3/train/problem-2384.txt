Once these are installed, you can go into the Settings menu of this VM, choose "Shared Folders" and add as many folders as you like (also select auto-mount if you don't want to mount them manually).
This approach has the merit of not depending on Virtual Box's addons, which are fine, but if you move your VM to other platforms (VMware, for example), you may find you like this more generic approach
Here's a link to CentOS instructions for doing this.
Note the link above where these steps came from has more secure and alternative methods explained as well.
Install the Guest Additions in CentOS (Devices->Insert GA CD image, then navigate to the CD ROM and run the installer).
As an alternative to jalbarl's answer, which gives the typical method of doing this in Virtual Box, you could try and somewhat more generic approach and just connect your CentOS VM to a file share you create on your Windows machine.
CentOS reboots are needed after every operation (GA installation and adding new folders).
