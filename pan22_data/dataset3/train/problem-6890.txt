That means you already get all the data your ISP sends you, unfiltered.
Seeing how you’re from India, there’s probably a severe shortage of IPv4 addresses, making things like that necessary.
Coupled with the fact that your “real” public IP address is different from the one your router shows means you’re behind a carrier-grade NAT system.
Your ISP will not set up a port forwarding for you.
It’s most likely impossible for them, even if they wanted to.
Like @infixed speculated, they will direct to a business plan.
That way, you would be able to access your home server (and with proper setup the entire home network).
(Theoretically, it could still filter the traffic, but that’s unlikely.)
You could get a cheap Virtual Private Server, set up a VPN server on it and connect to this VPN server both from your home server and mobile clients.
These plans usually include fixed IP addresses (among other things) but are a lot more expensive.
If you’re connecting to the modem via PPPoE, it really works like a modem.
