Also, these instructions are not permanant - so you can at least reboot to make the problem go away if you do something stupid.)
(Note that where I have given examples they are minimal, and you need to satisfy yourself you understand how they work and flesh them out our you could lock yourself out your box.
What you do need to ensure is that your OpenVPN server provides a default route (and with a lower metric so its preferred) via the OpenVPN server.
If you want to ensure you connect via OpenVPN you would want to put a firewall on your VPN client preventing traffic going out via the normal interface (except traffic to the OpenVPN server).
You can do this by adding the command (on the server)
You will probably also need tell the OpenVPN server to NAT the connection so that it will share the IP address of the server - as 10.x.x.x is not globally routed.
I'm not convinced that a proxy of this nature is a good idea as an always-on solution because of complexity, reduced speed and curveball problems it will throw at you.
