It also enables you to verify the chain of dependent network components that sit in front of the web server.
At my company, we use a couple of methods to monitor our web servers.
Because there's situations where your internal server may not be able to send emails, we setup third-party monitoring through Montastic.
Internally, we use Nagios to monitor CPU, memory, disk utilization, uptime, etc.
You can also set it up to notify several email addresses of outages.
There are lots of monitoring products out there (including Operations Manager from Microsoft); if you want some custom-built solution, you need to put together something that can make an HTTP request to your web server and send an e-mail if it doesn't get answered properly; you can do that with some VBScript or PowerShell.
because it's often not the actual server that is experiencing problems.
Ours notifies our company email addresses as well as an external "emergency" account.
This helps you determine the reason your web server is down (switches, routers, DNS, etc.)
