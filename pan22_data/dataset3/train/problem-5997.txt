Actually, what you need is a cloning utility that recognises filesystems.
I understand that further to @shodanshok reply you can then activate that snapshot for normal use as per the man documentation:
dd if=/dev/mapper/vg_thin01 of=/dev/mapper/vg_thin02 bs=1M
My ubuntu 16.10 and OpenSUSE Leap:42 have it in their package manager repositories.
When using thin volumes, snapshot and new volumes really are the same thing, with different default flags.
So it is perfectly legal to snapshot a thinly-provisioned volume to create a CoW clone.
Preferably unmounted ones as cloning a running FS is a recipe for a disaster.
Cloning a thin volume is as simple as taking a snapshot of the to-be-cloned volume.
(Actually the thin volume will be used for DomU storage in Xen or KVM )
For now I know dd can clone a thin volume as following:
What I want is cloning an LVM thin provisioning volume to another thin volume.
You can use clonezilla as well which is a live CD backup / recovery tool supporting LVM2 as well.
