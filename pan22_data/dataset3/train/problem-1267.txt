vSphere Cluster is 3x HPE DL380 G8 with 128GB RAM on board connected to 3PAR.

By following the recommendations https://www.starwindsoftware.com/blog/vmware-vcenter-server-appliance-homelab-tips I have already lowered from 8 to about 7Gb RAM by disabling updates, vsan health service, dump collector and HTML5 UI.
Check the list in the source to disable more unused service in your configuration.
I would recommend to disable also VMware Performance Charts and VMware Content Library Service.
One other option might be to backup your tiny VCSA and restore it to a newly-deployed small VCSA.
Although the vCSA deployment size is Tiny meaning there should be the enough resources to maintain the production, the project I currently work on requires the installation of over than 50 VMs more.
Therefore, I need to ensure the vCSA configuration could handle the desired workload until we are ready to update the vCSA configuration.
