That being said, openconnect version 7.06 may be able to connect your your VPN.
I am new to this whole thing so I could be missing something very simple.
I cannot get the GUI based client Pulse Secure to install properly on my machine and my schools tech help is useless for anything linux.
Also, try to install network-manager-openconnect-gnome (apt-get install network-manager-openconnect-gnome) if you have network manager installed.
I have tried a simple sudo apt-get upgrade openconnect command to update and it says the version is current.
It has a GUI interface which allows you to create a new VPN connection, and you may choose 'Juniper' from a list.
What this means is that the latest version that is available to your distribution of Linux Mint (18.3) is openconnect version 7.06.
I have been unsuccessful so far because the VPN requires openconnect 7.08 and I currently am on 7.06.
No scripts to force install the version I have found have worked.
So, I have been trying to use openconnect to connect to said VPN in terminal.
I am relatively new to the ubuntu linux world and am having trouble connecting to my school's VPN network.
