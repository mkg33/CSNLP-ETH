# Here, we set the command to a lambda function which calls the led_flash function with the proper led number.
All they will do is delay your code where you don't want it to be delayed.
button = PushButton (app, command=lambda: led_flash(0), text="Borang Faks", grid=[0,1])
button = PushButton (app, command=lambda: led_flash(4), text="Borang Cuti Gantian / Tanpa Rekod", grid=[0,5])
Personally I would make the led number a parameter so you only need one function rather than 5.
button = PushButton (app, command=lambda: led_flash(2), text="Senarai Kehadiran Mesyuarat", grid=[0,3])
button = PushButton (app, command=lambda: led_flash(1), text="Borang Sijil Cuti Sakit", grid=[0,2])
But to do that I'd have to understand the overall objective and learn more about guizero.
You would need to change that to a different command.
leds = [LED (26), LED (19), LED (13), LED (6), LED (5)]
That way, you can activate a certain led based on it's index in the array.
button = PushButton (app, command=lambda: led_flash(3), text="Borang Pemilihan WP", grid=[0,4])
Within that function, turn on the LED, then wait 5 seconds, then turn it off.
First of all, remove all the sleep statements from your button declarations.
app = App(title="Smart Shelves", height=500, width=800, layout="grid")
You would then replace command=led1.on with command=my_command_1
Also, turn the leds into an list of leds instead of seperate variables.
