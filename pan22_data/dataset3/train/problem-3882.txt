I've got a brand new installation of CentOS minimal, and have installed Samba as follows:
They do correctly have home directories as /home/<DOMAIN>/<username>, though.
Since a single backslash is the default separator for Winbind, I have removed the separator line, and both template directives now work.
I can now use getent passwd and see AD users as well as local users, but all the AD accounts have shell listed as /bin/false.
Using testparm I discovered that this was due to trying to specify the Winbind separator character as \\ - in an attempt to get it to do the standard backslash that Windows uses.
Firstly, have I got all the necessary packages to become a domain member?
Because of the parsing of smb.conf, that is interpreted as a line continuation, so the line after the separator is seen as the end of that directive, and therefore ignored!
All AD users currently get logged out on authentication!
When placing the template homedir first, Samba ignored it, and when placing the template shell first, Samba ignored that command instead.
