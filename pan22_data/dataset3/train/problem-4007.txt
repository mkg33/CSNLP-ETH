(on xfce it's accessible by clicking on the sound/volume icon in the toolbar indicator plugin, other DE's should be similar)
So I suggest you to try to fix it with "Volume control" settings.
pactl set-default-sink [name] should set one as default, using the Name: from above.
And when I enter that above-shown pactl etc code I still get both sinks suspended.
Or use the terminal and the pactl command could do about the same thing:
Have you selected that card (or tried everything listed) in the Sound Settings under output?
Tried a reinstall of the drivers, and the headphone jack seemed to work.
I tried to set default sink etc., no way, there was no sound on my laptop.
Linux Mint 18 should still use pulseaudio as 17 does.
pactl list sinks should show your available outputs ("sinks"), and
When I enter pactl list sinks code on terminal, it gives me 2 sinks, and both of them were suspended.
There is volume control on menu (start) bar, so I changed devices from there and tried again and again, restarting etc.
Sometimes the desired sound output source (or "sink" using the sound setup terms, I think) isn't selected.
Opened the laptop case, and the speakers came back to life.
