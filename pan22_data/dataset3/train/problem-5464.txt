In Task Manager, try to re-start the 'Windows Explorer' Windows Process.
In my case the problem was caused by an app (a utility for an external WD HD)running in the background.
I was having this same issues that persisted through reboots, but re-enabling the search icon/box and then disabling it again allowed both taskbars to auto-hide.
This worked for me to resolve the identical problem;
I can imagine other apps having the same annoying impact on taskbar behavior so it may well be the case that each user plagued by a non-hiding taskbar will have to experiment as I did before finding the culprit.
In my instance, the toolbar would not hide on the secondary display with Windows 10.
Right click on desktop and select DISPLAY SETTINGS, highlight secondary screen, check MAKE THIS MY MAIN SCREEN box, click APPLY.
Highlight your primary screen and do the same to reverse your action.
After reading all the suggestions and trying them, I tried the following (with success): right click on primary display toolbar, click on "search", select "Show search icon".
The solution involved closing the app by displaying it via the "show hidden icons" option that appears when one hovers over the "^" symbol in the task bar.
