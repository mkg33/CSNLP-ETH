My suggestion is to do some research and see what will work best for your situation.
Try looking in Control Panel > User Accounts & Family Safety > Parental Controls.
It works cross-browsers; one configuration covers Internet Explorer, Firefox, and others all one the same machine.
You can set what hours of the day you want the Internet on the computer to be blocked, and can customize each day of the week.
absolutely no crapware or trialware or anything, just plain free!
K9 Web Protection is a child's (or children's) web filtering and blocking software that is extremely configurable.
All settings are accessed via the web browser, and are protected by a password, which you could give to someone else and not know yourself if you wanted to completely block access.
The problem is that there's tons of "programs" out there that supposedly offer this service.
Have used the program myself with great success, highly recommend!
As for managing it for each child, I would recommend setting up separate user accounts, and then configure K9 Web Protection in each account to how you want that child to access the internet...
A big point is that you can turn off different aspects of the program, like turn off the webpage filtering, and just use the time feature, or whatever...
It appears to provide what you are looking for, but again, do your research, because most of these products are paid services and you don't want to buy a crap piece of software.
K9 Web Protection: http://www1.k9webprotection.com/
It offers: web-page filtering, word block, site block, category block, and the Internet time feature.
What you are looking for is a Parental Control software that limits the time each user uses the PC.
all you have to do is give them your email for a product key, and it works...they don't send any spam, or bug you about anything...
