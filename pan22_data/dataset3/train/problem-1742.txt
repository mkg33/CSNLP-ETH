It is definitely possible without a published API because I use a product called gSyncIT to sync tasks from outlook to google tasks.
There is no way to directly sync, one problem being that 'Google Tasks' are far simpler than 'Thunderbird Tasks'.
However, a response from Google in this support thread directs people to vote for this feature in the Google poll soliciting ideas for enhancements to GTasks.
Is there a thunderbird extension that would allow you to display the contents of that url in the sidebar?
I'm using the GDataProvider along with Lightning to access my Google Calendar from Thunderbird.
Howerver, "Google Tasks Sync 0.3.1" is a currently working addon that pops up in the Task daily pane to the right of the calendar and email (when daily pane view is active) and presents the Google Task system nested neatly there.
It means that the very good T'bird task management is bypassed, and there is an initial signing in process the first time that you use it, but other that that, it works very well.
The GDataProvider wiki suggests that they will support this eventually (they've been stuck waiting for a Tasks API), but I'm wondering if anybody has managed to get this working any other way?
One interesting workaround for this problem, whilst we're stuck waiting for tasks API, is to use Bryan Clark's Google Calendar Tab.
As long as you have your tasks displayed on your Google calendar, you will then have access to them from Thunderbird too.
You can view the google tasks page itself at: https://mail.google.com/tasks/ig?pli=1
Obviously this isn't as good as native integration into Thunderbird via an API, but its the best I've managed so far.
Unfortunately their product is only for Outlook and not Thunderbird/Lightning.
It's not a web browser view of Google's own 'Tasks' window, but a proper, native add-on, consistent with Google's task system and synced with it.
However I'd also like to have access to my Google Tasks as well.
