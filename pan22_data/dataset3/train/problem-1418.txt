Having never converted a file that large, I'm not sure how long it will take.
Once the program is installed go to codec central, download and install this codec, note:these only work with the dBpoweramp program.
I also tried Super Converter, which looks like it was written by a schizophrenic, but it is my go to freeware converter.
If not, you can have it search for them by going to Edit -Preferences (or press Ctrl+P), go to "Import / Export", and click the "Find library" buttons if nothing is listed (see here for detailed instructions)
Other codecs if you need them, I suggest you download and install all of them.
I have downloaded some .m4b files, but my mp3 player cannot play them.
I'm assuming since your file has an M4B extension, you're working with an audiobook.
The first time after you open Audacity, it should automatically find the LAME and FFmpeg installs.
I have tried several converters i found through google, but they can't seem to be able to convert the whole files.
You should be able to use Audacity to open the .m4b file and export it as an MP3 file.
Is there a reliable program for converting them that i can use?
Once Audacity is installed, open the .m4b file, and then choose File -> Export... and save it as an MP3 file.
The m4b extension is just a fancy name for an AAC file.
You'll also need to install the LAME MP3 encoder (to export the mp3 file) and the FFmpeg Import/Export library (to read the .m4b file).
I would recommend the 1.3 beta version - even though it's labeled as a beta, it's very stable.
Audacity will give you the chance to fill out the ID3 information, so you can have the proper author, etc, listed for the MP3 file.
(Its an 8 hour long file, first program only converted it to a 1 hour long mp3, and the 2nd converted it to 5 hrs long, but with 3 hrs still missing).
I know this is an old thread, but VLC continually crashed on me when I tried to export mp3.
