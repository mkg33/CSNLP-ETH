So, I am definitely not switching the cables around.
I was unable to find a specific cause for this to happen.
On each monitor, I have multiple Desktops/Spaces open.
I have a MacBook pro MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)
I have my thunderbolt cables and ports color-coded.
This is how my mission control settings look like.
I've got a display-setup with two identical displays connected via two separate HDMI-Adapters in two separate USB-C ports.
My solution until this day was to rearrange the displays via "System Preferences".
Now I'm using aveneyer's displayplacer-solution in combination with a shortcut setup to launch a shell-script in Keyboard Maestro and it works like a charm on Mojave!
The main monitor (the one on the laptop) always stays the same.
What seems to work for me so far, after one week of trying, is simply connect each monitor to an USB-C port on a different side of the laptop.
When I wake my mac from sleep, sometimes, it switches the recognition of the monitors and all the Desktops/Spaces from Monitor2 are now on Monitor3 and all Desktops/Spaces from Monitor3 are on Monitor2.
My Macbook Pro is always connected to the displays and whenever it wakes up from sleep-mode, the displays-arrangement is mixed up.
And have 2 External Monitors ASUS VS247 Display connected via thunderbolt.
