This has happened to me multiple times (but not always).
mine is office 2010. the excel file was store in share drive (NAS).
Picking up useful pointers from those above, this worked for me for files with referencing errors when the linked file on our network was opened:
In Trust Center window, on left side, click Protected View then on right side untick Enable Protected View for files originating from the Internet.
Once I do - all references to Sheet1 turns into #REF.
It is very frustrating and I have no idea why it does this.
A.xls contains formula that links to B.xls Sheet1.
and naturally all values that were previously correct now returns #REF.
Options > Trust Centre > Trust Centre Settings > Trusted Locations > Check the box alongside "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended).
This is absolutely frustrating as there is no way for me to undo it without re-opening my last saved version of A.xls.
Find and replace is not ideal either because A.xls refers to several different worksheets of B.xls - and they're all now #REF.
because the target spreadsheet (B.xls) is not trusted.
By going to FILE->Options->Trust Center->Trust Center Settings-Trusted Locations and adding the folder containing B.xls I was able to make the problem stop happening.
Presumably you could add B.xls to "Trusted Documents" and get the same result but I haven't run that test.
