KVM supports running a KVM hypervisor inside a KVM guest; The Xenner folks are working to allow you to run a Xen VM inside a KVM guest; Recent patches on the KVM mailing list are working towards allowing it to run HyperV on a KVM guest.
The main limitations are two-fold: first, you can only use hvm Amazon instances, not paravirtual.
Thanks to the recently GA'd i3.metal EC2 instances, you can now run Hyper-V on AWS.
I should note that re-selling Amazon is prohibited by the user agreement, so this is useful as a thought experiment / fun evening, unless you have a real nested virtualization use-case (they exist; see the IBM Turtles pro
Xen-Blanket (see http://code.google.com/p/xen-blanket/) allows you to run Xen on an EC2 instance.
I know I am resurrecting an old question with this response, but this page comes up when you Google for answers on the subject and I'd like it to be helpful to other Google users.
The authors have tested it and report reasonable performance.
I have done this successfully myself and achieved similar results.
Second, it uses a fairly old version of Xen (3.1.2 I believe), so your knowledge of how to create and run an image may need to be downgraded to 2007 levels.
Ravello Systems have a solution to run virtual environment on the public cloud.
Here's the official AWS announcement from May 17th, 2018.
There's also a VMware Cloud on AWS offering that is sold and supported by VMware.
That means you need the cluster compute instance (starting at $1.50 on demand, ~$.50 spot).
I don't think Amazon is using KVM as its hypervisor, but if it moved in that direction this could be possible at some point.
