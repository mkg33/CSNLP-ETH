Originally I had two Windows Store apps that wouldn't open (Calculator and Weather), and I successfully reinstalled them from the store.
I thought it was unrelated until yesterday, when I was able to get on-site and inside the domain.
I don't have an "answer" per se, but I've been having this problem for 4 days now.
Starts out with just a few, but now about half of my apps are grayed out.
I suspect something going on with the Start Menu\Programs location or perhaps Microsoft registration somehow, but they're just hunches.
This started happening to me at the same time as my IT guy moved the domain controller at work, and my VPN connection (Dell SonicWALL Global VPN Client) would "connect" but I could not use Remote Desktop Connection, nor could I File Explorer browse to network resources.
I was able to tether with Ethernet, get healthy and stable RDC behavior, and lo and behold, my apps were white again, not gray.
My PC is a domain PC used remotely, logging on as a domain user.
Now, today, back home and remote, same deal as before.
All others are random and still launch even when gray.
I will be monitoring this blog as it is EXACTLY what is happening to me.
