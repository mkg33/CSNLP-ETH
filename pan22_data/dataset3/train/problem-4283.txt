I've done this kind of thing many times (only Vista and later, otherwise just give it up).
I would strongly recommend that you transfer over only your settings and data rather than trying to clone the actual hard disk to a new machine.
Others have suggested tools already, but I feel I should add that cloning an install to different hardware is certainly not recommended!
You will also lose some of your windows customization and will have to reactivate but will otherwise keep your existing install intact.
Just run sysprep (for good measure), swap the drives: it probably will fail to boot, in which case, pop in the Windows CD and run startup repair, and you'll probably be set.
This is especially important if the hardware is radically different between your machines - as it is in your case.
I imagine that drivers will be an issue, but beyond that, how do I do a clone?
This thread on sevenforums looks like it was written just for this purpose, using sysprep which has a 'generalize' feature to remove hardware specific drivers and roll back to built in drivers which allows your existing hard drive to boot up in a new machine.
Disk cloning is a great way to backup your existing PC but if you're installing to different hardware you should really do a fresh install on that new PC and then copy your data over.
I am getting a new laptop and wish to "move" my desktop installation exactly as I have it on my desktop to my laptop.
