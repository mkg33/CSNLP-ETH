and I just can't find it, or does MS really abandon this field?
We used ISA Server 2006 as network firewall, router, and VPN server - and I loved ISA server, because it did exactly what it supposed to do, nothing less, nothing more (ok, someting more, e.g.
Now I need to setup new small local network and I can't find/believe that MS doesn't have anything like ISA/TMG, I still think I simply can't find it - what I need is exactly what good old ISA Server (or TMG) did.
you can use Sophos UTM 9 network firewall including web browsing protection, AntiSpam filter and antivirus protection.
I don't like to install and use already discontinued product (TMG), but it will probably end up this way.
I've read several articles about either non-MS alternatives, or that the best alternative for TMG is ... TMG.
Officially there is no Microsoft Solution to replace Forefront TMG.
Is there some replacement for ISA/TMG from Microsoft (another server product, or maybe feature in WS2012R2?)
If you need a reverse proxy, you can use products like BigIP by F5, Barracuda WAF, Citrix Netscaler, NGNIX... Microsoft Web App Proxy (available in Windows Server 2012 and >) is an option but has very limited features and can't be compare with specialized solutions.
Same answer for VPN site to site gateway or Point to site gateway : Windows Server includes these features but with less options than a specialized solution from Cisco, Juniper...
Then we migrated to Forefront TMG, which I ... didn't hate.
