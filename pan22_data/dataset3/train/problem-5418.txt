It will not be treated as normal RAM to be sure, but it does let you add more, and it can certainly help.
If you have vista this might give you some performance gains using a USB memory stick:
This is treated like a solid state drive in essence, so pointing a swap file to it for example would boost performance.
Gigabyte makes various RAM disk offerings that allow you to add memory modules to your system.
The memory is connected to the CPU by the "Northbridge" of the chip set that supports the CPU:

Replacing the motherboard also has the benefit that there aren't going to be any unexpected performance downsides to using a non-standard connection between the processor and whatever memory you manage to add.
Outside of that, one would need to try an re-engineer the motherboard and the CPU Chipset.
Also, there were in the 1990's some motherboard designs by Intel that attempted to be "modular".

I would imagine that even if it existed in the form you are looking for it'd have a hard time beating the piece of hardware called 'motherboard replacement' for price.
Is there a piece of hardware that I can buy that will allow me to use more than the two slots my machine provides for memory?
There are some applications that use the video processor and associated memory to do complex computations.
