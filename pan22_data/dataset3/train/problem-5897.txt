The sshd is running on port 22, there is nothing running on port 25 on that server.
You can reproduce this by setting up SSH dynamic port forwarding:
So my guess is that the OP had a user login with weak or trivial password, "disabled" the account by setting shell to /bin/false or /bin/nologin, and it was exploited to send spam by ssh port forwarding.
Perhaps someone who logs in to your server is trying to establish an ssh tunnel to 1.1.1.1:25?
In order to make use of the SOCKS proxy with other traffic, you can use a socksifier program like tsocks:
You'll see something like this in the /var/log/secure on SSH server:
I've changed the actual IP address, they are external addresses that often belong to mail servers.
What exactly does this line mean, who is initiating the connection and why is sshd involved?
The part I don't understand is who exactly is trying to connect to those addresses and what sshd has to do with it.
To route HTTP traffic via this tunnel, in Firefox:
I've noticed several repeats of the following error message in /var/log/auth.log on a server:
Setting a user's shell to /bin/false does not prevent ssh port forwarding.
To narrow down, take a look at the /var/log/secure (auth.log on your distro), and examine who has logged in before this:
On my Gentoo, edit the /etc/socks/tsocks.conf as belows:
