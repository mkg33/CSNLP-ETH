But if I alt-tab to another program (or click on it in the taskbar), then back to Firefox, then I can use the area that I click on.
Here is a strange bug I'm experiencing in Firefox: I can only use either the chrome, or the content, not both at the same time!
Try creating a new profile and see if the issue still occurs.
If it does, it's likely a problem with your Firefox installation and you should attempt a clean install.
I restarted windows, and now the problem is gone, which is good, but a bit strange.
I've tried closing and starting it again, but the bug is still there.
I can't even click on the minimize, restore and close icons!
The mouse pointer doesn't change either, it just stays a pointer when I hover over things, and the links I hover don't react either.
So if I click somewhere on the webpage to get focus back to Firefox, then I can click on links and write things (like this text), but I cannot click on tabs or refresh or anything else in the chrome.
This bug seems to occur sometimes when I wake up the computer from standby, but I leave by computer in standby all the time, so that is not the only factor.
For example, I can click on tabs and the toolbar icons, focus the search bar and write in it as well as the address bar, but if I try to click on anything in the content (eg a link or a textfield to write something), then nothing happens.
I have no idea why it occurred, or why it got fixed when I restarted windows.
To get focus back on the chrome I have to alt-tab to another program, and then click on the chrome to get back to Firefox to be able to use the chrome again.
I have experienced this before, but I don't remember what I did to fix it.
