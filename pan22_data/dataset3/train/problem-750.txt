VirtualBox runs Mac OS X perfectly fine nowadays, but you need great hardware to do so smoothly (2016 Dell XPS 13 is not quite enough to run it without micro-lags).
Version 3.1 has EFI support, which would be the first requirement for running vanilla (non-hacked) OS X Server as a guest.
VMware can, with some fiddling, run recent OSx86 (hackintosh) distros.
There are no guest additions available though, so clipboard sync and shared folders are not supported.
It would be much easier to run OS X as your main OS and run Linux under virtualization.
In order to replace the features you'd expect from guest additions, you can use VNC (which does support clipboard sync) and SMB (for sharing folders).
As to the licensing issues involved, OS X Server is the only version of OS X licensed to run under virtualization.
VirtualBox can apparently just about run an out-of-date Deadmoo hack, but it's probably not worth it for testing software on OS X as the results are very unstable.
VirtualBox can't currently run OS X, but is slowly moving in the right direction.
Keep an eye on this topic in the forums for updates.
Here's a detailed walkthrough on how to set this up.
