The ultrasonic sensor wouldn't work for me because this container will be closed and the water would touch it.
I read about using 2 wires, like on this trhead Detect water level and I think it would be ideal for this project, but how can I build that?
What's shown in the schematic as a 20M ohm resistor is actually just two wires which are about 1cm apart.
They should be arranged so that they just touch the water when the water gets to the desired level.

But it always returns different readings, so it's never accurate.
The 3.3V comes from the Raspberry Pi's power supply (the whole circuit consumes less than 0.5mA) and Vout is connected to a GPIO input pin on the Pi.
I am creating a self watering indoor garden with a Raspberry Pi 3 B+, but for the way I'm building it, I need an accurate level detection.

For different reasons, which I won't explain not to make this post long, I  need to accurately detect when the water reaches two different levels.
Or is that sensor I'm using supposed to be accurate and I'm doing something wrong?
simulate this circuit â€“ Schematic created using CircuitLab
A high voltage (logic 1 = 3.3V) indicates no water and a low voltage (logic 0 = 0V) indicates water.
The water will be fed into this container, and then this pump will pump the water.
I tried different codes, using the SPI and the normal GPIO, but it still returns a crazy reading.
