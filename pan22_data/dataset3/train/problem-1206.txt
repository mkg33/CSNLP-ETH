Restart ssh (service sshd restart or service ssh restart, depending on your distribution) and ssh will only be accessible from inside the VPN.
Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add this directive (assuming the VPN IP address for the server is 102.168.10.1):
Now, the last step is block all incoming traffic with  iptables -P INPUT DROP
The risks of someone having my 4096 bit private RSA key are pretty minimal.
If you have a VPN service configured on your server, you can make SSH listen only to the VPN interface.
Now you need to restart the service with /etc/init.d/knockd restart
Change the default 22 for anything else, and restart the sshd daemon.
At this point, you can try to open ssh port, using the script, do this, if you have console to get inside your server if you block out.
To change the SSH port, you can change the Port directive on /etc/init.d/sshd_config.
If your server has a vpn connection, perhaps you can set your ssh's server ListenAddress to the local vpn endpoint, instead of the default of all local addresses.
Depending on why you want to block port 22, it might just be good enough to move your sshd from port 22 to any other port, like 22222 or 12345.
To open and close the ssh port, I have one script in my pc:
You can have more than one active port, just by more than one such port line in the config file.
to /etc/ssh/sshd_config and reloading sshd config like
I have a Debian 8 server with a public ip and block and open access when I want using knockd:
