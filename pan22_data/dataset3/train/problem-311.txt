I'm running SQL Management Studio 2008 version 10.0.2531.0 on 32-bit Windows 7.
I've been having issues running anything in SQL Management Studio on Win 7.
Anything with heavy user interaction such as editing a row in the result set where i have to click a cell freezes up the front-end.
Running a query is nearly impossible because it takes nearly 2 minutes just for the IDE to parse it and another minute to run it when the query itself completes instantaneously outside of the IDE.
Basically, doing anything through the Management Studio interfaces completely freezes it up for a few minutes.
if you have other devs in your area and it works for them and they have rights to login to your pc try this as it may be a profile related issue.

I had similar issues with Visual Studio 2010 on Win7.
Eventually tracked it down to the Entrust Security Manager software which had made itself the default certifcate manager on the system.
Change the default certifcate handler back to the Microsoft one and the problem should disappear.
Most likely the same issue as the finger-reader software mentioned above.
Check and disable (if ON) the following settings in Internet Explorer options:
Also tried running in compatibility mode without any difference whatsoever.
