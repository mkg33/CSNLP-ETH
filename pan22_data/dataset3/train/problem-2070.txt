I wouldn't mind copying it file-by-file (and that way I could see if there are any files corrupted by the errors dd sees), but I'm not sure how to do that and keep it bootable and keep the same UUID.
I then tried it again on just the boot partition (instead of the entire disk) and got the same results.
Unfortunately the disk it's on has a few errors, so dd aborts when I try the usual
Tonight I'll try dd one more time and check the disk outside of gparted so I'll (hopefully) at least see any error messages.
Reinstalling shouldn't be that hard, as long as you mainly tweaked in your home folder (or know what you changed outside of it) and may still be the cleanest sollution (and you will get the most recent software)
Last night I discovered the conv=sync,noerror option for dd (and it reported 2 errors), but when the transfer was done the disk wouldn't boot.
You can basically copy all the files to another disk and try to re-setup the mbr.
The final solution turned out to be relatively simple (none of the dd solutions worked).
But my question is:  Is there another way to clone this drive (including keeping the same UUID) besides dd?
I had gparted check the disk (it ran "e2fsck -f -y -v /dev/sdb1"), and after a few minutes it reported an error and crashed - I couldn't get the error info because the screen was frozen.
Hm cloning a broken disk is probably never a good idea.
I've got an 8.04 Mythbuntu installation I need to clone to another disk.
When plain dd fails you can try with dd_rescue instead, because dd_rescue does not abort on errors on the input file.
I know I could reinstall from scratch, but after all the customization and tweaking I've done that is a very last resort.
