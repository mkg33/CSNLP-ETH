So then we recently got the DISH Hopper, and I noticed that I can plug in a USB Drive, so I backed up my 20GB of data on it, and the DISH Hopper box stated that in order to use the USB Drive with the cable box, I need to format it to a DISH Hopper-friendly format, so I let it do just that.
So what happened is that my 32 GB USB Drive was initially 32 GB, more like 29.82, but still.
I tried deleting the Volume on the 28.82 partition, and expanding the volume on the 1GB, but it did not let me.
but it says that I only have 1 GB of storage on the drive.
When I used the Hopper to Reformat, on the Disk Management, it shows that they are both Primary Partitions, both healthy.
So i decided to look at Disk Management, and it shows that it has 2 partitions, the 1GB portion, and a 28.82 portion.
I've tried everything I could in terms of using the Disk Management that was on my Windows 7 already.
Can somebody help me recombine the 2 partitions into one, thank you.
Anyway, I use this for everything, school, personal, educational, everything.
I only have access to the 1GB portion in terms of standard point-and-click.
