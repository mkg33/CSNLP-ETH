The following could be condensed onto one line or embedded in one of the other solutions.
If you create more than one directory per day, you can add the current time to the file name.
So instead of reinventing the wheel and having to shave off all of the corners again, one creates unique temporary directories from a template slightly differently:
But of course it doesn't take much thought to realize that this trivial mechanism doesn't scale well.
Assuming your directories always start off at "dir1", and that there are no files named $dir* (iE they are all sequentially numbered directories), you can get away with this one liner -
find the "biggest" dirname first, get the number and increment that:
Addendum to the other answers: If you need the dirs to sort correctly by name, you may also want to pad the new dir number (NUM) with leading zeros to a fixed length.
If you just want to incrementally create directories that are listed in the correct order, may I instead recommend folders that are named based on the current date?
This assumes that NUM starts out at least 1 digit long and will not exceed the fixed length.
See man date on how to tweak the output formatting of date.
It will create directories with the names like dir-2014-03-02 (YYYY-MM-DD, so as to appear in alphabetical order).
This counts the number of files starting with $dir, then adds one to that number and creates a new file.
