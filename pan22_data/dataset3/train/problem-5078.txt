When connected to corporate VPN all http requests are normal and as expected.
Have you tried monitoring your network traffic on the iPad when your VPN tunnell is open on the desktop versus when not in VPN?
Also, it's possible, that after your router there's some big router that can shape your speed using QoS - VPN trafic can have bigger priority than your direct connections.
The proxy one might be possible, but really should be a remote possibility.
The only things that should affect your web browsing over what should be a slower connection (the VPN) actually being faster than when you're disconnected would be a proxy server and/or DNS.
Some VPNs offers compression, if you are downloading compressable data - your VPN connection may be faster than native.
Check if you're using DNS over the VPN compared to responses when disconnected.
It's possible your work DNS is faster than whatever you're using without the VPN.
If this is the case and the VPN tunnel shuts off these ports, it might explain how the request are answered faster.
When not on vpn using either my laptop, desktop, or ipad all http requests appear to be extreamly sluggish.
(Use a packet sniffer to help determine what is happening with timing on your DNS lookups, or use nslookup or similar tool to see where your requests are defaulting.)
Since a VPN connection locks off several ports that are normally available, my first thought is that you have service running that might be hogging your regular bandwidth.
Therefore, you're sending slightly less data through the connection, which means it can complete requests faster.
My network topology is a linksys WRT310, and a ubee modem, all set to stock settings, thoughts?
I doubt this accounts for it, but one feature of a VPN is to encrypt the traffic passing through, and one side-effect of encryption is that the encrypted data is often compressed.
I am thinking it should be impossible for the VPN to run faster than the native connection it is using.
