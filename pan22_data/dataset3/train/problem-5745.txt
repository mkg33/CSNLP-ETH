Again, not one issue so far, and I have used them in my last 2 properties.
I would recommend going for 500+ speed, and pass through (this allows you to plug into the mains through the powerline).
As per Phan's answer, I use this for the exact same purpose.
I just used a linkseys router and it had the jacks in the back.
They connect / communicate perfectly (and it is plug and play).
My router is connected to another powerline one downstairs.
You can also plug in switches / hubs etc into these which is what I have (my 2 NAS drives into a switch which is plugged into a powerline).
I actually have set up a wifi connection in my house and I took my computer away so it would stand alone.
My printer is connected to a powerline adpater in my room upstairs.
Your printer will wired-connect to one adapter which is plugged into an outlet while the router will connect to another adapter which is plugged into another outlet.
These adapters will talk to each other through your house's electrical wire.
