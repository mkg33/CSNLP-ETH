Without long mode support, the virtual machine will not be able to run 64-bit code.
Please don't hesitate to let me know what is missing in my post, for finding solutions.
I don't know much about hardware and virtualisation, so there might be some necessary info I'm not giving.
For more details see http://vmware.com/info?id=152.
Intel VT-x might be disabled if it has been disabled in the BIOS/firmware settings or the host has not been power-cycled since changing this setting.
Then, when I click OK, my VM exists, and I get back to the VMWare Player home screen.
I managed to create the VM (gave username, password, configured network etc), but I can't install Ubuntu Server.
(4) Update the host's BIOS/firmware to the latest version.
(3) Power-cycle the host if you have not done so since installing VMware Player.
Go in to your bios/efi and enable VT-X (or virtualisation bit/whatever it is called in your BIOS/EFI).
Binary translation is incompatible with long mode on this platform.
I'm trying to create a VM, using VMWare Player, with an ISO image of Ubuntu Server 12.04 (LTS).
The machine I'm doing the installation on has an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU, and runs 64-bit Windows 7
(2) Power-cycle the host if either of these BIOS/firmware settings have been changed.
This host supports Intel VT-x, but Intel VT-x is disabled.
For more detailed information, see http://vmware.com/info?id=152.
This virtual machine is configured for 64-bit guest operating systems.
(1) Verify that the BIOS/firmware settings enable Intel VT-x and disable 'trusted execution.'
