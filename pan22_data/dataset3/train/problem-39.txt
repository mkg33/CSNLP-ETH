I don't really care what access each individual in the group requires, but I do care about what the group needs as a whole, so I can give appropriate access before taking the sysadmin priv off it.
I am tracing the said group right now, but there doesn't seem to be any activity going on (could be that no one from the group is currently using the database).
You can get the groups for a given member by executing:
This may be able to be wired up using a user-defined event.
I just want to confirm that this is the right way to do it for this type of login, or am I missing something?
Some of our user accounts have sysadmin privs, which of course is a major security breach.
I have successfully done traces on individual user accounts, but my question is how do I trace a database login mapped to an AD Group?
Unfortunately, the group is not presented in the LoginName column => it is the individual user account (DOMAIN\user).
What I do for individual users right now is to select the appropriate events in the SQL Server Profiler and filtered the LoginName column with the name of the user surrounded by a pair of %.
We are currently undergoing an PwC audit on our database logins.
