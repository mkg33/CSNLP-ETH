Occasionally you'll get something that eludes identification, but a little bit of deductive reasoning should help you figure it out.
Most, if not all of the devices should have plug-and-play IDs.
A tool like SIW (System Information for Windows) may also be helpful, I believe it's largely an automated system of identifying things via their plug-and-play IDs.
Using something such as DriverMax will make reinstallation a breeze.
Of the programs that are useful I find Drive Magician to get the best results but it certainly isn't perfect
Run MSINFO32 and do a File - Export, save the text file onto an external drive (eg a flash thumb drive) before formatting the hard disk and reinstalling.
Another take on this is to backup all of the drivers on the PC before you reinstall.
Its better to find out what Windows has already discovered than trying to identify it afterwards with no drivers.
As you did not say you have already reinstalled, I hope this is still applicable.
You should be able to look them up at PCIdatabase.com and from there, determine the make and model of the device.
