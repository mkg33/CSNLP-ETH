        When a virtual machine reads sectors of a hard disk image, the differencing hard disk subsystem checks the block bitmap in the differencing hard disk.
        For example, consider a block that holds sectors 4096 through 8191 in both the parent and child hard disk image.
        For a write operation, all data is written to the differencing hard disk image.
        Write Operation for a Differencing Hard Disk
The block bitmap is marked dirty for all the sectors written to the particular block.
        Note: Versions previous to Microsoft Virtual PC 2004 only stored the absolute pathnames.
The differencing hard disk subsystem reads the sectors marked dirty from the differencing hard disk and the sectors marked clean from the parent hard disk.
A single cell represents a bit in the bitmap and a black dot represents the particular sector in the block has been written to by the virtual machine.
        Read Operation for a Differencing Hard Disk
The first sector of the block holds the bitmap for the block.
When a differencing disk is being created, pathnames for both types of platform locators on the respective platforms should be initialized if possible.
