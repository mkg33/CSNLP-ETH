You can download and run a tool by Sysinternals called Process Monitor which is among other things is a file and registry monitoring tool.
You can run the utility as you are running the msi file and you should be able to see all the events that are happening on the machine.
That is a good article you found and in the event that the article gets removed I will summarise the contents here.
You should be able to any registry accesses by the process.
Note that Process Monitor can capture hundreds of thousands of events within a few seconds so try and close any other processes to remove background noise.
If there's still a lot of events to go through then you may have to filter further.
This free utility is easily searchable on the web.
I suspect that, like in the article you found, that you will find the bloat occurs under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\ and whatever software that msi relates to.
Once you have your trace, use Process Monitor's filtering capabilities to filter on those events performed by the msi process.
