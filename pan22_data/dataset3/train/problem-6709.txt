You can also righ-click on a svchost.exe process in task manager and seleect "Go to Service(s)" and taskman will switch to the services tab and highlight the relevant services.
With sysinternals process explorer, you can hover over a servicehost.exe with your mouse and see a tooltip of the services hosted within.
Many services run inside an instance of a generic host process, svchost.exe.
Please note that a single svchost.exe can relate to a number of services in the [Services] tab.
None of these will tell you how much of the cpu time of the host service process is dedicated to a particular member service hosted within.
That will bring you to the [Services] tab with 1 or more highlighted related services.
You can use tasklist /svc at a command-line to get an enumeration of the services running inside of each instance of svchost.exe along with other processes.
Go to the Services tab and right click on a running service, then click on Go to Process.
It will take you back to the Processes tab and highlight what Process is being used by that service.
