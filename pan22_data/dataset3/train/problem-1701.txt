Most routers today, even el-cheapo ones, come with some basic traffic monitoring capabilities, QoS and what nots.
So, you may be able to get away with just setting up the router to monitor/log the traffic.
Although primarily Linux based, it comes with a Windows version too.
Putting a spare machine inbetween can be a pain, I recommend using the old faithful 100mb Hub inbetween your offices and hook a laptop with Ethereal or Wireshark this will let you see all traffic going accross the link.
This can be run from a live CD so no need to install and you can setup a router between your users and the "citrix thing".
Disclaimer: I haven't used the Solarwinds tool so I can't say "yea" or "nay" for certain on it.
If your routers are capable of exporting Netflow stats, I've had good results with that in the past.
Alternatively, you may want to try using something like Wireshark.
You may want to look at your existing routers first.
There are various tools available for analysing and presenting these, but Solarwinds have a freebie (http://www.petri.co.il/solarwinds-real-time-netflow-analyzer-free-download.htm) which may be good enough to get you started.
You can then use this to investigate your network traffic so that you can then make an informed decision about what steps to take.
Ok, if you have a spare machine, look at doing something like PFSense.
