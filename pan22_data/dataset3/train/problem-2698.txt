One for everything in the scene that changes normally, and one for the object you are trying to keep uniform size.
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb147302.aspx to render these and you'd still get them settled properly into the 3D scene.
If you want some objects in the scene to follow normal size changes during zoom, but others to not change... You could use two view (or projection) matrices.
The solution is to scale the object in every frame, to increase/reduce it's size.
Depending on if you zoom by changing camera position or changing FOV, apply this concept to the view matrix for the former, the projection matrix for the latter.
Suppose we want the object to be 1/4 of the size of the viewport.
I haven't tried this but theoretically you could create the matrix without the 1/D projection transform.
Suppose we want an object to appear that it has constant size, regardless of the camera's position, in a 3D perspective projection.
Simply keep it's position (or FOV) a constant distance (or value) but in alignment and orientation with the other normally zooming matrix.
