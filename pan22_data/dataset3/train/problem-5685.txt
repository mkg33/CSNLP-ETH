I disabled the anti-virus software and then applied the windows installer 4.5 update but no luck, the installer still hangs.
I would prefer looking at the .net installation logfile located at C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1\Logs and verify at what stage the installation has hung.
I can't speak to your specific problem, in a similar situation I would suggest using Process Monitor to see what happens when you run the installer a second time.
Yes, Aaron's blog pointed out by Eleasar is also the right step to follow.
I agree about the network thing; I think the installer does... something with Microsoft servers, and sometimes that doesn't work and the installer hangs.
In fact it's been like that for 30mins already and using 0% CPU.
Googling for process and file names, will help you identify what isn't related.
I really don't think disabling network is the right solution.
Everytime that happened to me, disabling the network adapter allowed the setup to continue gracefully.
For those like me searching for an answer and stumbling upon this, what worked was
I was trying to install .NET 3.5 SP1 to one of our production machines with Windows 2003 SP2.
I have always run Windows Update to install all the necessary update but have never faced any issues when using WSUS or stand-alone installer.
The installer is hardly about 70 MB in size and should not take long time to download either.
However, the installer just hang at around 80% with message "Setup is loading installation components, This may take a minute or two".
