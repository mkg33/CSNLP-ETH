As far as i can remember in older versions of Windows you were able to modify the thickness of the window title bar so that minimize and close icons become smaller and the top of the window narrower.
First you have to open up the control panel and go to Appearance and Personalization
Sign out and sign in with your user account to apply.
Click on the small box next to Title bar and adjust your Title bar size.
I don't have Win 10 so please try and let us know if the same works.
Whether that also changes the title bar size I don't know.

There is a way to modify the Window 10 title bar height using Windows Registry Editor.
Then select Display,"make text items and other items larger or smaller"
How can i modify the theme used in Windows 10 (not choose another theme but modify default one).
In the right pane of WindowMetrics, double click/tap on PaddedBorderWidth to be able to modify it.
Type in a data value of 0 (zero) or between -1 to -1500, and click/tap OK. (see screenshot below)
I know that you can change the font sizes through the settings app (typing in font size located it quickly) .
