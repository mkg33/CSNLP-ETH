Why is it not pinging or redirecting to my server?
I opted for DNSimple.com because of the API and reasonable pricing for DNS hosting, I changed the name servers to dns simple's supplied ones, ns1.dnsimple.com and ns2, configured the Google Apps service and created a cname record to point www to my old server IP address for the meantime.
CNAME should be an alias to A record which in turn points an IP address.
Even though the answer from a nslookup on ns1.dnsimple.com is:
DNSimple.com does not report a problem with the domain, and I have other domains in there configure in much the same way, that are working fine.
A little background, the domain was registered with dns.pt, the main registrar for domains in Portugal, they do not have a DNS service, so when I rented my web server last year I also configured it to be a DNS server.
I'm not an expert on DNS matters, but i have configured a few domain before and have a reasonable knowledge of how it's supposed to work.
Problem is, www.pmcosta.pt does not work, but mail.pmcosta.pt works and goes to Google Apps.
This was all done last Friday, way over the set TTL!
I'm using the standard windows DNS management, can I just remove the pmcosta.pt node?
But this one is over me, I've tried everything to try and identify whether this is a configuration problem, or if it is DNSimple.com having an issue.
Alternatively, you can set up pmcosta.pt to have an A record pointing to 173.248.133.202 and have www point to pmcosta.pt as a CNAME.
You have set up www.pmcosta.pt as a CNAME to 173.248.133.202.
Could this be because I have still not de-configured DNS hosting on my web server?
Dig command shows that you are using CNAME to directly link to an IP Address.
Long story short, I now moved my email to Google Apps and my web site will soon be migrated to azure, so a web server is no longer needed.
