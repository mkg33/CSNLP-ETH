Therefore, i wrote a small python app by myself, just abused matplotlib for this task.
It's much more powerful than just labeling time-series data, but you can just do labeling with it.
You can also import a pre-labeled CSV if you're really just trying to refine labels.
I also need such a tool to annotate data but did not found any suitable tool.
I used matplotlib.use('TkAgg') and SpanSelector with my own onselect(xmin, xmax) method called for this task.
You can use the hosted version of TRAINSET at https://trainset.geocene.com or you can deploy it yourself by following the readme at https://github.com/geocene/trainset
I'm using axvspan() function from matplotlib.pyplot.
Also, I suggest you set the sample rate frequency to 1Hz.
Main disadvantage is a difficult configuration of text labels.
We had this same problem again and again at Geocene, so we came up with this open-source web app called TRAINSET.
You can use TRAINSET to brush labels onto time series data.
I am currently developing a set of tools to annotate and detect patterns in time series data: https://github.com/avenix/WDK
You import data in a defined CSV format, then label the data, and export a labeled CSV.
