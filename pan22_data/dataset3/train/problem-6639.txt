I say that because I have noticed it is possible to have a node on a WLAN who's traffic is routed correctly in and out of the subnet, but not within the subnet itself.
Unfortunately, this means there's not an easy fix on the Pi side -- you could ask on our bigger sibling site Super User why a node on a WLAN would be able to access the internet but not other nodes.
You can verify this for yourself by setting up wireshark on the Pi and including a filter like this
If you don't trust that, you could see the same thing from your laptop if you get wireshark up, then reconnect the Pi on the same side of the AP (for reasons explained above WRT intercepting traffic).
You can receive all the traffic (since it is in the air), but generally speaking you can't decode it (you can if you first intercept the initial connection of the device whose traffic you want to decode).
Anyway, it is not as if the Pi is not sending the ping, or sending it to some made up address.
Probably you want to be armed with the wireshark test first, so you can report that the connection attempts are definitely being sent.
Keep in mind that all local traffic does have to go through the router -- one reason for this is how WLAN encryption works.
In my experience it was an unusual event and always corrected by reconnecting, which is why I think it has something to do with the DHCP lease -- but I never followed this up.
You'll see the pings going out but nothing coming back in.
I'm presuming the ping fails because it times out, and not because of a firewall you've set up (if it were the latter, it would fail immediately and say it was prohibited).
That being the case it kind of has to be a problem with the AP/router, excepting the fact that it may have to do with some nuance of how the pi has negotiated its DHCP lease.
