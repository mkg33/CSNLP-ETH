I don't know if you still have this issue but I had something similar in Windows 8.
If you can't or aren't willing to reboot now, you can always reset wuauserv with the following BAT script (right click & run as administrator):
The NetBalancer program was a great help in identifying the problem.
I think microsoft did something in the mid of 2014 - this post also starts in Nov 2014, yours in Oct 2014...
I found the following article: https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/4a782e40-bbd8-40b7-869d-68e3dfd1a5b4/windows-update-scan-high-memory-usage?forum=w7itproperf&prof=required
Hopefully you have already solved it, if not this might be worth a try.
Although its early days I have turned automatic updates back on and so far so good.
In my experience, when wuauserv starts eating memory, the best thing to do is to wait until it finishes installing the updates and then reboot.

I think there is one for Windows 7 here but do check it is compatible before you run it.
At least I know what to stop if the problem comes back again.
Any file named "svchost.exe" located in any other folder can be considered as malware
The original system file svchost.exe is located in C:\Windows\System32 folder.
I had data transfer of several hundred MB per day and using NetBalancer identified the issue as the Windows update service (wuaserv) so I disabled it and then ran the MS Fixit option for Windows update.
svchost.exe is used as a common system process, some malware often uses a process name of "svchost.exe" to disguise itself.
Official answer from microsoft is pending, hopefully the give us a patch sometime...
We have this issue too at a customer with about 60 PCs... we had to disable the Windows Update service for now.
