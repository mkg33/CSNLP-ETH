Worst case, your RPi won't start, or will keep rebooting.
However, that last line from jaromrax's answer is important even if the odds are small: if your smartphone happen to lack any kind of overcurrent protection, you may damage it by connecting the RPi to it.
An RPi doesn't act like a real USB device when connected to micro USB plug: it won't "enumerate" (a fancy USB slang meaning "to configure a connection") and thus will not negotiate the power it will draw.
By default, USB spec limits unconfigured devices to 100 mA, and USB OTG is no exception.
Technically, if your smartphone respects the USB spec (which I'm willing to bet is the case of well-known brands), you lose nothing by trying it out.
A smartphone often doesn't have that much, so it may actually stick to the spec and provide only the bare minimum (which is plenty for typical OTG applications like keyboards or flash drives).
However, regular USB hosts (like laptops) usually have loads of energy to share and in practice will provide at least 500 mA to any device.
