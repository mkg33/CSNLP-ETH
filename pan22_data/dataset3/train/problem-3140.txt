Thank you so much for your help guys, I gladly appreciate it
I just finished developing a program for Quality Control and the signal from the routers is too far and the switch/hub I'm talking about is right there at the quality control area.
To use a typical home gateway wireless router as a plain bridging access point, just disable its DHCP Server feature and plug one of its LAN ports into your switch.
Is there a type of bridge adapter that I can connect to one of the switch ports so I can receive internet from there to our tablets?
This is exactly what an access point (or "wireless router" in layman's terms) is.
I'm experiencing a major problem and I thought of this silly question.
Our Network Administrators are out of state and I don't have access to the routers credentials.
instead of connecting to the routers or Access Points.
I have a 5 port switch connected to the company's Ethernet cable.
I have a printer and a PC connected to that switch.
We also have 2 access points in this huge building, but unfortunately our intranet WiFi sucks!
and the inspectors are using tablets to connect to the WiFi and the signal keeps falling and breaking.
