First, you're lucky, as it doesn't care (or, correctly, know) anything about protocols.
In fact, the names could be even dynamic, and don't need to exist befor beeing queried.
There is no way to retrieve all existing hosts under a specific domain.
If you want to forbid some program to phone home, a moderate amount of traffic sniffing will probably reveal any hostnames it uses, and you can put them into your hosts file manually.
To block anything behind example.com., you have two options:
the hosts file is only about hostnames (or domains).
you might want to run your own DNS applying filtering properly.
I Assume with hosts file you're talking about /etc/hosts or it's os specific equivalent, if not, my answer won't be of any value.
You might want to try a different and more complex approach if you really need to block a domain in its entirety.
Running your own DNS isn't rocket science, and there are lots of friendly resources on the net.
I use this method to kill seriously sketchy popup websites that most adblock software wont even stop.
Its cheap and dirty but it works as you are telling your computer that this domain is located at your 'local IP' thus it never does anything but timeout.
You cannot use wildcards according to hosts file specifications.
The cheapest is to use a Raspberry Pi hardware to install a DNS service (be sure to run DHCP on Raspy or set your home router accordingly, or use static IPs).
On the other hand, if you want prevent users (humans) watching youporn, don't bother, they are probably smarter than you, and will circumvent your actions faster than you can deploy them.
Might be a old question but clearly still was never answered.
