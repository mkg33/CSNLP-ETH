For some reason, a local application of mine filled in its own version of MS Sans Serif making the fonts look really tiny.
Even working with different languages doesn't have any impact on output.
Response by Ian Atkin helped me a lot, in my case "right" font file names were slightly different, maybe because of other regional settings:
Open the Start menu and type regedit and press Enter.
This is a known bug that affects users with a high resolution display.
In all such cases, I get the correct result,  so, in fact I don't see the issue on my machine.
I am using Windows 7 32 Bit SP1, I have downloaded the application MemSet4.1, and it comes all fine on my screen.
I think, you should look for the Display driver installed in your machine, and if correct driver is not installed and default from windows is used, then you need to install the correct display driver.
Right-click on the desktop, click on Personalize > Window Color > Advanced appearance settings and change the font sizes there.
Or you could just set everything to the default theme and see what happens.
The solution of @ian-atkin didn't fix it but helped me discover these font locations which led me to my issue/solution:
Changing the DPI settings doesn't have any impact on its display.
During installation, Windows 7 installs a larger font set which is 125% of the normal size.
Locate the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
Restart Windows and the problem should be resolved.
If you then choose go back to the standard font size (100%), Windows will keep some of the large fonts even though everything else is adjusted for standard fonts, causing some programs to display incorrectly as the DPI is too big for the window size.
Changing screen resolution also doesn't cut off the content, as you have shown in your screen.
Thank you very much Ian Atkin, maybe my little note will help others as well
