Under cherokee, I just "run" Django sites (sites are stored in /web/):
Looking around, there are literally hundreds of different ways of managing this.
And then I'd connect to the socket at /web/mywebsite/sock.
This approach has worked well for me under Cherokee but now I'm moving to nginx, I don't have something there holding my hand for process management.
Up until recently I've been using the Cherokee HTTPd which has the option to launch back-end applications like Django sites but I've just switched out to nginx.
But as I'm on Ubuntu (and probably always will be) Upstart seems to make sense...
I have several django sites sitting in /web/ (and they're the only directories in that directory) so if there's a cheaty way that I can get this one upstart script to launch them all (with the same settings) and monitor them, that would be super-extra-awesome.
I recently recorded a video about configure nginx and django(fastcgi and upstart) - http://linux.dyndns-work.com/video/ubuntu_server10.04_install_django_nginx_fastcgi.ogv/
Cherokee also runs this as a user of my choice, in my case www-data.
Could somebody give me an example of a upstart script that runs the above and will respawn it if it dies?
But I prefer nginx and uwsgi(also upstart init script) - no link, i can post a maximum of one hyperlink.
I host a few Django sites on one of my Ubuntu servers.
