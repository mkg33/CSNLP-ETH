So, whilst +trace will help you to see what WOULD be seen if you were asking Google for the FIRST time and it had no cached entry, it may give you a false idea that Google will be telling everyone the same as what your +trace result was, which it won't if you'd asked previously and have a long TTL, as it'll serve that from cache until the TTL expires - THEN it'll serve the same as what your +trace revealed.
Not bad if you have a short TTL, somewhat rubbish if you have a 1hr one.
Something important to note here, which I notice many people don't ever include when talking about +trace is that using +trace means the dig client will do the trace, not the DNS server specified in your config (/etc/resolv.conf).
More detail - so if you've already asked for an mx record using dig -t mx example.com and your /etc/resolv.conf is 8.8.8.8 then doing anything inside the TTL of the zone will return the cached result.
In a way, if you're looking for something about your own zone and how Google sees it, you've sort of poisoned your DNS results with Google for the TTL of your Zone.
So, in other words, your dig client will work like a recursive DNS server would, should you ask it.
