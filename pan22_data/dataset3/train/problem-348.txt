All outbound traffic from an instance is explicitly whitelisted on AWS per default.
Without knowing any more details about the role of your instances for the rest of your infrastructure, this is what I can envision happening.
C. If these are Internet-facing servers, you could disallow all outbound connections to any IP whatsoever except for their primary services (Dovecot, NGINX etc.
A couple of security companies sell their solutions on the AWS Marketplace (such as country blockers) for those of us who need paranoid security.
Instances with mission-critical security and/or compute-instances would run in the private subnet and be only accessible to a management instance on their private IPs.
You could make instances on your private subnet accessible on the outside using VPN.
This way you would not need to worry about the IPs of some mirror repositories, you simply prohibit all of them until verified, and run automated updates for minimal effort.
A. use a topology with a public and private subnet.
), and use Puppet for automated upgrades (from a repository downloaded to your VPC by your management instance).
