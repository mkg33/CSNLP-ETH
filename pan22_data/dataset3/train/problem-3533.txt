tmux-launcher should be an executable shell script somewhere in your path:
One drawback is that you must type return after the letter that selects the window to create.
After understanding better what you are trying to do, I think a short bash script is the best way to go (sorry, I don't think a tmux-only solution similar to screen command classes exists):
So, my general advice is to explore the tmux command set to see if there is a tmux idiom available for what you would accomplish using command classes in screen.
As far as I know, tmux does not support command classes like this.
In tmux, you could select window 12 using "Ctrl-b w c", where "Ctrl-b w" is the default key binding to invoke the choose-window command, and 'c' is the shortcut for selecting window 12 from the interactive menu of windows.
Here's an example from the screen man page, where windows whose indices are higher than 9 may be selected:
If you have a specific task in mind, I encourage you to post it as a separate question.
However, it might be possible to accomplish a task for which screen command classes are suitable in a different way in tmux.
The command class 'demo1' lets you select window 12 using "Ctrl-a Ctrl-B 2" (or would it be just "Ctrl-B 2"?
