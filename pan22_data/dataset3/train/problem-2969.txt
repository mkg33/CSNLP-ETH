When WebFarm1 (remote desktop) navigates to http://WebSite1 - windows credentials are requested
when a client PC navigates to http://WebFarm1 - it works fine (but obviously only shows default website)
Any help or ideas would be hugely appreciated as we've moved to this server farm now and we are getting some remaining issues which I believe are a request of this problem.
We have internal DNS records which resolve URL to the load balance IP.
We run multiple websites on each server (Same sites).
This was working correctly on our previous setup but we have new servers and a new load balancer (I've not been involved to much in the network setup, but we're all stumped).
When a client PC navigates to http://WebSite1 - it works fine
We are running IIS 6.0 on Server 2003 on 2 identical servers.
When WebFarm1 (remote desktop) navigates to http://localhost - it works fine
My guess is the windows credentials are being lost as the server is either trying to connect the other web server or the url request is being directed back out to the load balancer and then back in.
But I don't know why this would cause the credentials to be lost.
Not really sure what's going on so I'm going to just list my setup then my symptoms.
