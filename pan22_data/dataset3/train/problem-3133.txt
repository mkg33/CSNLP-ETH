and some functions won't work like LEDs, iDRAC etc, but in general it's a way to go.
It will be a matter of controller and controller's firmware more than server brand/model.
On Dell's R210, R220 and T130 I've successfully used Sandisk's consumer grade SSDs for years.
Today I was shopping for the most basic dell rack server which is the R240.
Also, you'll probably have issues to find disk trays.
Ironically, they are still using HDD 7200 RPM, with no option for SSD in their selection; and we're approaching 2020!
I've done this with PERC's R410 and R710 controllers.
I ended up buying it used on a famous refurbished hardware shop.
Moreover, it's OK to use non-Dell branded SSDs inside Dell servers, you won't receive support (of course!)
And regarding the optional first question, Dell sells servers equipped with SSDs for sure, maybe you should look to more expensive models.
