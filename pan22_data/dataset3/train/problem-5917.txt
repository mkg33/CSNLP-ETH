Limit the number of FastCGI threads spawned and also limit your PHP memory usage.
Problem is they often comes out of them box badly configured and need tweeking.
You can probably tune Apache or get rid of it entirely and replace it with one of the lighter web servers like lighttpd or nginx servers.
Check if you have the latest version of the VMware Tools.
Another good question would be, do you need a VPS?
I think that you have the OOM Killer doing its job.
Normally if you are on a VPS, it is because you need customization.
Most control panel comes with apache, apache for ssl, mail server, anti spam, mailman, SQL, ... they are built for "reseller" in mind.
Check how much memory is allocated by the VMware balloon driver.
As for customization, look for a company that has many other services and not just web hosting, like hosted Exchange, SharePoint, VPS, ... so that whenever one of your client need something you can't offer, you are not caught letting him go.
What you will need to do is to tune your running services.
With that kind of traffic, your server should more than suffice with 768 MB of RAM.
If you don't have any customization, I would highly siggest you look for a multi-domain plan or reseller plan on shared hosting.
