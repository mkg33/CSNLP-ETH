On your router interface facing HP switch, it is running as access/untagged port.
So all ingress traffic on that router interface is VLAN 69; meantime router will remove VLAN 69 tag of the egree traffic to switch and when traffic arrives on switch, it will be VLAN 8.
Hope I understand what you are asking here (your writing is long and my memory is short :))
However if you have traffic marked with other VLAN, like VLAN 10 and send the traffic to router as the interface facing router is tagged/trunk port, router will not be able to understand it as the edge interface is expecting something without VLAN tag.
The HP untagged VLAN on a tagged interface functions similarly as the native VLAN you configure on Cisco switch trunk interface (actually tag/untag makes more sense than access/trunk technically speaking), the VLAN 8 in your case.
There is no native VLAN mismatch just like you connect a laptop to a trunk interface with certain native VLAN configured and switch does not complain about mismatch, right?
