If you need to do something Linuxy, you could use a LiveCD or stick a tiny distro on a thumb drive.
All distros I have used have had no problems reading NTFS.
Both the OS and applications from repositories take less time to install and applications are automatically updated.
VirtualBox (www.virtualbox.org) is a free way to do this which works very well.
HOWEVER, a better option is tp run Linux in a virtual machine, as it makes switching between OSs much simpler and easier.
There is one huge reason to run Linux as well as Windows, you can browse the internet without worrying about viruses.
If you choose to dual boot, there are programs like Wubi (used for Ubuntu) which make installation very simple - it creates a virtual "partition" to install Linux into, and if you decide you don't like it, run Wubi a second time and your system is back to normal.
Here's a take on it: if you don't really think you need to run it, it would probably be better not to dual-boot.
And Windows is somewhat harder to use LiveCD style or from a thumb drive (just because it's not really designed for that).
Use Linux for web browsing and Windows for other apps abd you have a secure system which runs whatever software you want to use.
IMHO there isn't any reason today to waste a whole disk on another installation, when you can run both operating systems at the same time with one boot (that of Windows).

You could do a lot of stuff in Linux, but you might need to boot into Windows for a few things (like some gaming).
If you were a Linux user, dual-booting just might be helpful.
