Try using a powered hub or using one of the back ports.
I had a similar problem plugging my Motorola Droid into the front USC port on a Dell desktop.
Moving an optical mouse causing the led to turn on would even cause it.
I'm also having this issue with the front USB ports on my antec 1200 case, so I'm going to throw my guess in and say it's faulty wiring/grounding on the front panel.
The problem was related to the Droid pulling more power than the front port supplied causing he reboot.
It definitely makes me think faulty port in this case, since you said sometimes when you touch it the PC will restart.
If the problem stops, you need to open your case and make sure the front panel is connected properly.
You might just want to just check the cables are properly pushed in at both end of the USB port, however in your case I wouldn't get your hopes up.
Luckily for us the laptop in question was still under warranty - I would ask if this PC is still under warranty, but the things you have done to it make me think not.
I've seen this before, and the end result was a faulty USB port.
It would reset when applying extra load on anything using 5 volts.
I had a computer many years that had behavior similar to this.
If your problem is with your front panel, try the back panel.
When you plugged something in it would do exactly what you are describing.
