Also, if it's really a major issue, you could look at migrating to Win7 ?
Copy one thing at a time, they're really not built for such things.
If you have a 4X SD card, it will take over 30 min and a 2X SD card will take over 1 hour.
To them, your HDD is a raging beast, your unzipping happens many orders of magnitude too fast for it to bottleneck.
Without write caching and with write verification on, writes under Windows usually occur right around 1/2 the rated speed of the card.
Let's take a look at your numbers: 20 folder * 6 files * 5MB = 600 MB.
You see, a simple copy and there are a lot of programming questions behind it.
I know that this job is killing the performance (on every OS).
Speed of HD cards is either measure by 1X/2X/4X/etc (where X = *150kb/s) or by class.
This sounds like you were copying several folders at the same time which is not good especially for slow devices like SD cards.
There was an issue with slow file copying on Vista.
On the progressbar and estimated time, it's... not often correct.
Basically, you're asking too much of the SD cards.
Or is this no issue because to copy-process  captures the needed space in the target-drive for a given file before the transfer starts?
I'm wondering if it is  not possible to detect the bottleneck an serialize the copy-jobs automatically?
(You can turn on "optimize for performance" rather than "optimize for removal" in the hardware options to get better speed out of the card but then you need to manually "Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media" from the system tray icon).
Therefore if you have a Class 2 (13X) SD card, you can expect the 600MB copy to take a minimum (600MB / 2.0MB/s) * 2 = 600 seconds.
