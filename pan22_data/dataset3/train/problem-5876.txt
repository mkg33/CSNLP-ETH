For information, I've a 3Model B Rapsberry Pi and have installed raspbian with Kernel version 4.9.54-v7+.
I setted up a mirror port on a Cisco Catalyst switch and configured my Raspberry Pi to work as an Access Point (with hostapd).
I configured a bridge between my eth0 and my wlan0 interfaces with brctl.
To sum up, my purpose is to use a laptop connected via Wi-Fi to analyze packets going on a specified switch (and if possible to have multiple clients connected through Wi-Fi).
I'm setting up a Raspberry Pi as an Access Point (Wi-Fi) and I'd like to use it to monitor a switch traffic.
Unfortunately, you're probably just going to have to fire up wireshark on the rPi directly and do your business from there.
My problem is that the mirrored traffic isn't transmitted through Wi-Fi.
I may think that it could also be a limitation of the Wi-Fi
I have a sneaking suspicion I know what you're trying to do -- you want to be able to plug an rPi into one of several span ports on different switches and sniff the traffic off each one from the comfort of somewhere that isn't a freezing cold DC.
