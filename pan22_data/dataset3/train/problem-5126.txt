Well I ended up using parted magic and used "Erase" -> Internal Secure Erase
Finally, after some angermanagement, I went to re-erase it a second time and afterwards I recognised that the "enabled" and "locked" had been gone.
When I executed "hdparm -I /dev/sda" the Program saw the harddisk and told me that "Security" was enabled and locked.
WARNING: Please read other sources and the warnings about setting the password to NULL, especially on Lenovo-Laptops!
Errors (uncorrectable error count / ecc error rate -> which caused  windows update errors like 800f0922 -> it was just a guess that something like internal wiping could help to recover my SSD)
I followed https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase and only got outputs alike
I had to unlock the drive using a short standbytime.
According to the Input/Output Errors all my other tries failed, only this worked.
Read here what caused "SECURITY_SET_PASS: Input/output error" on my system:
I did not read https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase before ;)
But I never set it and according to some Sources it had been set to an empty value with security enabled.
I waited until the program told me the Harddisk internally finished.
I had my Samsung PM830 (MZMPC256HBGJ-000L1) cleaned because I tried to get rid of S.M.A.R.T.
When I restarted my system I was prompted a password.
I started another laptop (asus eee 1000h) without the harddisk, waited for parted magic to boot.
But may this help someone who thinks that the harddrive already has been bricked.
