RPKI is not the way forward as it does not protect against route leaks.
If you need configuration help I suggest you create another question asking for specific configuration help.
We usually find that most of the common route leaks are not in the 1-2 digit range.
Ask your peers what AS macro they will be announcing and build filters for them using IRRToolSet or rpsltool or irrpt.
A lot of this information is available on the RPKI Wikipedia page.
At the moment (until RPKI is more widespread), we generally just filter common bogons and apply a max-prefix filter to exchange peers.
That's very hard to catch anyway, unless you filter all your peers by building a prefix/ASN list or filter by radb, etc.
More specifically Route Origination Authorizations are used to validate a prefix to an AS.
At some point you just have to trust the routes you're receiving.
Most leaks end up being closer to 10k-100k+, which is easily caught by a fairly low (100-500) max-prefix filter.
It's also worth noting that RPKI won't work for everything, because not everyone is using it.
Encourage them to have correct information published in an IRRdb.
We also filter certain ASNs, ones we are certain will never show up in most peering sessions, such as Level3 or Cogent, or should not be transited over an exchange.
Your assumption that using RPKI is the way to go is absolutely correct.
Obviously bogons will not be valid because they're not assigned to anyone, so that problem will take care of itself.
Don't forget to update your own aut-num object in your nearest friendly IRRdb to reflect the adjacency.
