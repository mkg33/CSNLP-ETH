What are good papers/books to better understand the power of Modular Decomposition and its properties?
A survey of the algorithmic aspects of modular decomposition.
I have heard that it is possible to find a Modular Decomposition of a graph in linear time.
I'm particularly interested in algorithmic aspects of Modular Decomposition.
What about a not so efficient but simpler algorithm?
There actually is a (relatively) simple recursive modular decomposition algorithm that works in linear time.
About "A Simple Linear-Time Modular Decomposition Algorithm for Graphs, Using Order Extension", Fabien de Montgolfier provided an extended version of this paper on his website.
Philippe Gambette has a webpage about bibliography of modular decomposition algorithms.
Is there are an relatively simple algorithm for that?
See: http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~mtedder/TedderModular.pdf
If you are interested in variants or generalizations of MD, you can find some papers about Homogeneous Relations in his website, too.
It explains how modular decomposition works and how to apply it.
In this book there is also a lot of information about convexity in a graph.
