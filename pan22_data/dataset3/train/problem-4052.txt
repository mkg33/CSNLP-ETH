I know this is an old post, but the best way I could find to automate the backing up from my controllers was to use SNMP in a script run from cron.
Use a script to login to the WLC and run the transfer command:
Below is an example template I've put together that is commented out for you to play with.
Expect may be a good candidate to consider for the job.
You can use this to upload the config from the WLC to another server via TFTP/SFTP/FTP.
Does anyone know of a way to automate configuration backups for Cisco WLCs?
The example file name and location is /var/log/script-log/config-log.txt
Obviously replace the items within <> to fit your setup.
Hopefully someone somewhere may find this helpful.
It will log into a WLC, grab the running configuration and append it to a file of your choice.
You'll need to modify the file name and location to a file of your choice (with adequate permissions) as well as the username, password and IP address of your WLC.
I've seen links to the web interface which appears to do a one-time tftp copy of the config to a remote host, however I'm looking for a way to schedule the copy.
While the link points to WLC 6.0, the example was run on 7.4.
I am looking for a way to backup the controller configuration file via an automatic process.
Finally you can edit your crontab to execute the backup script using a desired interval.
# Run configuration backup every night at midnight
