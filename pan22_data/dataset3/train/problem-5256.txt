The problem I'm experiencing is that the firewall will only forward inbound traffic at a very low rate: approximately < 2 Mbps.
We recently updated the Intel ixgbe driver from version 2.1.4 to 3.7.14  due to stability concerns with the 2.1.4 driver (lock-ups) and this seems to be when the throughput problems began.
One thing you can do is to disable iptables by flushing all rules and set default FORWARD policy to ACCEPT.
There's some tuning to be done clearly, but they demonstrate Gbps speeds.
Iptables is really an efficient firewall for Linux systems.
On reverting to the 2.1.4 driver (re-compiled for an updated kernel, with IXGBE_NO_LRO and IXGBE_NO_NAPI) I was able to get ~Gbps throughput (well ~900 Mbps with iperf over TCP with 3 threads).
This was for a load balancer (IPVS) and not a NAT firewall.
I have not yet seen any breakdown on time spent per kernel networking function such as switching vs routing vs firewall vs whatever.
As an advice, be careful and not disable iptables on a publicly accessible machine unless you know what you are doing.
This way you can eliminate any concern about your iptables implementation.
We have a Linux firewall with two outward facing 10Gbe adapters (Intel 82599EB) and one inward facing 10Gbe adapter (Intel 82598EB).
I also tried the 3.7.17 release, but this gave similar performance to 3.7.14.
Several months ago I put a bunch of effort into optimizing Linux for wirespeed Gigabit routing with lots of small packets.
This solves the immediate problem, but I would prefer to be able to use the current version of the driver as I'd like to keep up with bug-fixes etc.
However, a direct connection from the firewall to an "inside" machine gets ~6 Gbps, while a direct connection to the firewall from an outside machine gets ~1 Gbps.
After that, you can look at the network driver and try to debug the problem if it persists.
It can handle a huge amount of traffic without begin the bottleneck given that you have written a good ruleset.
Specifically, how can I find out where the kernel / iptables / network driver, etc.
