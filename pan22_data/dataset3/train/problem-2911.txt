The thread How can Outlook prompt to "send and save to folder" provides some additional solutions, listed below.
So set up a rule that picks up just those you want (or use the except bit of the rule to exclude certain emails instead), get it to copy those to your Sent Items folder and then you can disable automatic saving of sent items so only those handled by the rule are saved.
First one is the three VBA samples from E-Mail: Determine a folder for sent items:
If you don't mind a commercial solution, there is Sent Items Organizer Add-In for Microsoft Outlook
There is no way to do that with "out of the box" Outlook configuration.
You can configure a rule that triggers when a message is sent.
Have you considered setting up a Outlook message rule?
However, there is a way of writing some VBA to achieve something similar to what Lotus Notes does: http://www.outlookcode.com/d/code/setsavefolder.htm  You should definitely pay attention to the notes in the article that describe when this functionality still wouldn't apply.
For a safer option, set the rule up to add a "DELETE ME" flag on those you wish to remove - then you can keep automatic sent-item-sending enabled (potentially safer, you won't accidentally not save something you need!)
and can easily delete them all manually by just sorting the sent mail folder by flag.
