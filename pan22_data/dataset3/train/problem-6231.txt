Answering exactly how to do this is really not possible until you have a specific router/platform picked.
Yes, the easiest and most secure way of doing this is to create a separate network (subnet) for them and to put a firewall device between that subnet and the rest of your network which limits connections to just a single IP address.
Should I create a different network all together and only allow a certain route between the 2 networks?
I basically want to bridge them in and give them access to only a specific IP and port so they are not using my internet or gaining access to any other items on my network.
I would like to bridge my neighbor in to my network wirelessly using CPE's, but I do not want them to have full access.
Ideally this would be a router with several different interfaces so the subnets can be physically separate or with support for VLANs and tagging.
I do not know all the networking terminology so I'll try to explain what I want to do.
Most consumer routers cannot do this type of setup out of the box.
If so, can only one point me to the answer on how to do that?
I would look either for a router which can run OpenWRT/LEDE or pfSense.
