Observe that if we take a graph G, pick some edge, and subdivide it twice (i.e.
Question: Does G have an independent set of size k?
Input: A graph G, a 3-coloring of G, an integer k.
(You can add exactly one of x or y to any set which was independent in G, and the reverse is not difficult either.)
So the question if graph G with m edges has an independent set of size k, is equivalent to the question whether G', which is the result of subdividing all edges in G twice, has an independent set of size k + m. But note that it is easy to get a 3-coloring of G', by partitioning G' into three independent sets as follows: one contains the vertices which were also in G, and the other two classes each contain exactly one of the two "subdivider" vertices for each edge.
This can be proven by a reduction from Independent Set.
A perhaps more general statement (with an easy proof) is that the following problem is already NP-complete:
replace edge {u,v} by a path u,x,y,v where x and y have degree two) then the independence number of G increases by exactly one.
Hence this procedure constructs a graph G' with a 3-coloring of it, such that computing its independence number gives you the independence number of the original graph G.
