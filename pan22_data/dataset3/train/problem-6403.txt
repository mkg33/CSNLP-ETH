If you want to copy, move, edit or erase files from the lxss folder you need to do it inside bash with command line tools.
Only files that are on /mnt/* are really manipulable from the windows explorer.
There are some Window sshFS ports that'll achieve the same thing.
Note: This is a new feature implemented in Windows 10 build 18342
The solution could be to start ssh-server in WSL (there might be a reinstall necessary) listening on localhost and then mounting WSL filesystem as a drive using, for example, win-sshfs or you can just use Bitvise SSH client to connect over ssh and manipulate files by sftp window.
You can also map it to a drive or folder, just as any other network share.
As has been mentioned above by [onoma] files in WSL directories have attributes that would be gone if one manipulates it using explorer or text editor run under Windows system.
You'll need to start the ssh daemon via "sudo service ssh start"
I use SFTP NetDrive to mount the WSL filesystem into windows as as a network drive.
The topic has been partially discussed here: How can I SSH into “Bash on Ubuntu on Windows 10”?
Yes but is not recommended to manipulate that folder from the windows explorer.
Works like a normal network share and it's safe to manipulate files.
