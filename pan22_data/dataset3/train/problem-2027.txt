Needless to say, nothing I tried worked, which leads me to post here
sudo ln -fs /opt/vc/lib/libGLESv2.so /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libGLESv2.so
sudo apt-get install -y libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
Next I found a guide saying there needed to be an rpi-update.
That didn't work, so I thought maybe it couldn't find packages I already had installed.
I had run one at the beginning, but I decided to try again.
in raspi-config, go to advanced > memory split: 256
sudo ln -fs /opt/vc/lib/libEGL.so /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libEGL.so.1
Neither worked, so then I rebooted and did some more searching.
I found some posts saying it was an opengl problem so I tried to install new opengl packages
I would like to build mpv from source for the raspberry pi.
After this point desperation and frustration sink in and further attempts go undocumented.
sudo ln -fs /opt/vc/lib/libGLESv2.so /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libGLESv2.so.2
I tried exporting the variables that were used in the install
sudo ln -fs /opt/vc/lib/libEGL.so /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libEGL.so
