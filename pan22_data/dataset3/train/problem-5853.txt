This software category is called Configuration management database CMDB in ITIL framework terminology.
This type of software must be contain updated information about apps/server dependencies in order to be useful; in a complex environment with several systems this can be a challenge.
with the grow of the number of servers and applications in our environment, we are facing a problem when we need to reboot some server and do it, thinking that is safe, and then we realise that some forgotten application, had a weird dependency to the server that no one remembered.
So,to prevent this situation, we are looking for some software, that does something like add all apps and its dependencies , so you can later select one app and see whom its dependencies are(software or servers), or select one server and see the apps are you breaking if you reboot it.
