/usr/share/X11/xkb/geometry also contains other geometries.
I believe the keyboard in the picture is a “pc104” keyboard.
… there’s a little keyboard button at the bottom right that shows the input source on a standard looking keyboard:
When adding “Input Sources” (keyboard layouts) in Gnome:
The standard in Sweden is pc105 (which as a differently shaped Enter key, and an extra key to the left of Z; see IBM PC keyboard for more information).
Here’s what the teck layout looks like, for example:
This is not a super big deal, but we’ll get back to that.
On my system they are defined in /usr/share/X11/xkb/geometry/pc.
As you can see in the first picture, I clicked the keyboard button while “English (US)” was selected, but there’s also “Swedish” available.
My first thought was to try to make Gnome’s keyboard display thing show a pc105 or teck geometry.
In debian, GNOME used to default to values defined in /etc/default/keyboard.
Four your case, you should have XKBMODEL=tech in this file.
dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration allows you to configure this file using menus, but does not support multiple layouts like swedish + english(us).
However, I have some trouble to get GNOME to follow xkbmodel as set by keyboard-configuration.
Since I own such a keyboard (a “Truly Ergonomic Keyboard”) I got curious and wanted to know what that geometry would look like rendered on the screen.
Clicking the keyboard button with “Swedish” selected does show the Swedish layout as expected, but still on a pc104 keyboard like before.
I found gkbd-keyboard-display, but it seems to only support choosing “layout” and “group”.
As far as I know, pc104 and pc105 are examples of two “geometries” in XKB.
This question is mostly for curiosity about keyboard stuff in Gnome and/or XKB.
The below was done on Ubuntu Gnome 16.04, but I believe things are they same in later Ubuntu and Gnome versions as well.
Next, I found out about xkbprint, and managed to use it to display both pc105 and teck:
