Most of the ones you have to buy have what you need which is basically filter the incoming and outgoing traffic.
You can exempt yourself from the block by giving your computers static IPs that aren't blocked by this rule.
If you are serious then pop down to your local tech store or browse amazon and get a new device.
Is it a combined WiFi router, or is it just an access point?
I would like to have in place a setup where I could still use Spotify, but have it blocked for our guests.
We use a standard wireless router from our telephone provider (Telefonica), the brand is "Comtrend" (Unfortunately I'm pretty blank when it comes to access hardware and such).
The cheapo comtrends that telefonica most probably supplies to its customers cannot do what you want.
How much control do you have over your WiFi / LAN settings?
When guests log in to their Spotify account over the wifi, the bar gets thrown out.
If you can block the great unwashed from accessing 78.31.8.0/22 then you'll block off Spotify's IP range.
