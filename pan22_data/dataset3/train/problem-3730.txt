This could be done with a user of least privilege and then correct specification of the sudoers file to only allow access to the service of interest.
Or you could get really fancy and hook inotify via something like inotify-tools; but that is likely overkill for this.
Use this to detect a change in the game config file[s] (the uploaded/modified file is passed in as the first argument to the script- $1), and if they are changed, restart the game server.
pureftpd provides pure-uploadscript, which you could use to restart the game process:
However, I do not recommend this - you should use a controlled remote session to restart the service.
Assuming you are using, or will use proftpd then you can use the module mod_exec and execute a command when the file is changed.
Otherwise you could use some bash scripting and cron to check the mtime of the config file and restart the server if it changes to something newer.
I'm trying to make it so that my friend can change a configuration file for a game server through FTP, and then when that's done execute a shell script that kills the server and then restarts it.
