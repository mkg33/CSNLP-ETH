No, this will open one instance of windows explorer window,
but that also is just opening a new instance of explorer window in my w10, and not starting the overall process.
Edit: explorer command starts the explorer process, but alt+ctrl+del is still not working, any help?
That way a crash in one explorer shouldn't take out all other windows.
this doesn't start the explorer process, say, if we have killed the explorer from task manager or from batch file using "taskkill".
I have seen "start explorer" command in a batch file, which, the developer of that file says, should start explorer as a process,
the developer of the batch file maintains that this is the correct command to start the explorer process and, he says, there should be some setting in my box that is preventing this command to start explorer as a process.
A good thing to try for more stability is in Explorer > Folder Options and check the option for "Launch folder windows in separate processes".
If there could be a command to start "explorer" process again or to start the Task manager then that would help a lot.
Is there a way to start windows "explorer" process from command line?
Because of some problem in my Vista OS, explorer process crashes frequently (i can not see TaskBar after that) but using the open windows i can access the cmd.exe ( ctrl+alt+delete does not work).
