It was an internal kernel build and not distributed to the public.
Unless you need to install very specific, redhat only, propri√©tary drivers, you'll be much, much better running this (much better performance, much better hardware support, much less bugs).
As you can see in rhel release page https://access.redhat.com/articles/3078#RHEL7 , the 3.10.0-693 is the kernel version for current rhel 7.4 release.
If you need this fix urgently, you'll need a Red Hat subscription and to open a support case with Red Hat.
It is clear from the comments that Red Hat is still testing it internally.
As you can see, this bug is not yet marked as fixed.
The 7.5 beta is out (http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/News/Red-Hat-Enterprise-Linux-7.5-Beta-Out ) and probably includes the kernel branch you need.
Otherwise, you can wait for the fix to be released, at which time it will also become available for CentOS.
Is it possible to get kernel-3.10.0-832.el7 (or newer) without Red Hat subscription?
The problem is, solution mentions that bug is fixed in
You can also see that this release was out on 2017-07-31, which means the 7.5 should not last much now.
You won't see this particular kernel version outside of Red Hat.
My advice is generally to run a current kernel (nowadays 4.15) from one of the third parties repositories such as "el-repo".
I am using Centos 7.4 and have encountered a bug, which I found a solution for: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1502601
and my CentOS 7.4 has kernel-3.10.0-693 and will yum yum updateupdate only to newer kernel-3.10.0-693 version.
