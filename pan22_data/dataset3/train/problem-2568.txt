Second, you must check, if SELinux protection doesn't deny any requests.
If SELinux deny access to some files from apache, you will se 403 Forbidden error in your browser.
Files from directory /var/www/vhosts/default/httpsdocs should be labeled with httpd_sys_content_t label (you should execute chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t).
This is default action for apache if apache doesn't know, what to do with special file type.
I'm setting up a server with Plesk, and we'd like to be able to provide a publicly-accessible copy of phpMyAdmin.
However, it's serving phpMyAdmin as the actual PHP files, not as executed PHP.
What's the best/correct way to enable PHP execution on that directory?
In /var/log/audit/audit.log you will se some avc:  denied messages.
One way would be to add a  directive to control/configure that directory
In default RHEL apache config, php is loaded from file /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf and file /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf contains line Include conf.d/*.conf, which includes all files from conf.d dir.
To make this change premament (to survice filestytem relabel), you should execute also semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/vhosts/default/httpsdocs(/.
You wrote, that apache return files intead of executing them.
First, you must check, if php module is installed and loaded into apache and properly configured.
