Most probably Pictures folder is mapped to the temporary user profile that was created.
Today she let me know that Windows Photo Gallery had lost all photos.
If it is hidden, it will be there, but the icon will be transparant.
Under the General Tab, Uncheck Hidden, and click OK.
A friend has a problem with her Windows 7 computer.
Right click on her directory, and select properties.
If it does not point to the correct folder, change it.
How can I make her user folder visible again, making Photo Gallery work again?
Except that her User folder stayed hidden, but I didn't notice this last week.
If you haven't done so already, in Explorer, go under Tools -> Folder Options -> View Tab -> Advanced Settings -> Hidden files and folders -> Show hidden files, folders and drives.
She can login, all files are there, but the folder is not visible inside the Users folder.
It is not hidden when I open Explorer, and I can open the folder, double click any image and then browse the pictures using Photo Gallery.
Browse to C:\Users and see if her user directory is shown.
It turned out that no pictures were lost, but Photo Gallery couldn't use the pictures folder anymore, because it was hidden.
I've used regedit to restore the profile, and she can login again and everything worked.
Except when I open Photo Gallery none of the pictures from the Pictures folder are visible in it.
Check where the Pictures folder is pointing to by right clicking Pictures Folder -> Properties -> Location.
