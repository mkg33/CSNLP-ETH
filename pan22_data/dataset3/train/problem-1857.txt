I had this problem recently, I had set my own internal ip address, then when I used another wireless point it didn't work, it took me ages to realise I had also set the router/gateway address to what I used at home.
"Airport has a self assigned IP address and may not be able to connect to the internet."
If it still doesn't work replace the wireless network card.
Since you say this issue occurs only sometimes, this leads me to believe its not your network settings (which should take effect all the time).
If all your drivers are up to date and the problem continues I suggest you try a reformat.
In Network in System Preferences go to Airport then Advanced.
To do this, open System Preferences... >>Network Select your Airport name, click Advanced... at bottom right, use the '-' to delete unneeded preferred networks.
My Mac OS X system is mostly getting the wrong ip address from any router.
I've got the feeling it happens after the laptop goes into stand-by mode.
It should say Configure IPV4, pick Using DHCP so that your computer asks the router for all it needs.
The IP address 169.254.59.233 is not being provided by your router but is being created by your computer in an attempt to communicate with your router's DHCP server - and failing.
You should see a weird-window popup, select TCP/IP.
It gets an IP address starting with 169.254.59.233, when it should be getting a good, old 192.168.1.5 or something.
You should check the wireless connection to make sure it's actually attaching to the network and the authentication details are correct.
I've read people think it's because the router isn't handing out ip addresses, but it works just fine on any Linux or Windows laptop.
Please check the list of  preferred networks and delete network names you do not use.
