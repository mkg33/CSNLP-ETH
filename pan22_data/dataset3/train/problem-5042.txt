Off the cuff suggestion (I don't have a database server up at the moment to test, sorry):
I would also try and avoid the use of * in the select.
Subqueries used as expressions must return at most one row and one column.
Where this is a problem is if you were to go on and do something like a delete or update as the server would not know which row needed to be updated - so it doesn't like it.
I added GROUP BY label_id to make the original statement work.
Also, if you only need one result, is there a distinct column you can use such as an ID column?
This will return every column and you have no control as to how that can affect the rest of the statement.
It would seem that the query you are sending is returning more than one identical row.
A Count(*) option will tell you how many records there are - if you are expecting 10 rows and there are thirty there is a problem - and the select 1 will return the first of the rows that it matches.
You could also try a SELECT TOP 1 or SELECT  LIMIT 1
I would be tempted to look at a DISTINCT statement which should only return the rows that are not duplicated, each row would be distinct.
