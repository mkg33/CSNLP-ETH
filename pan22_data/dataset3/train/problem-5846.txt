The Internet Time Sync is turned on and set to sync with time.windows.com.
This just happened again today, putting the date to 20th September 2010.
You don't happen to double-click the clock to get the calendar up to check on dates?
I used to do this all the time, and if you scroll months (say, to check a date in September) and then accidentally hit OK instead of Cancel - you overwrite the system time.
They both have service pack 3 installed and have the Time Zone set to GMT.
Both computers are relatively new HP machines (Both purchased this year, but at different times).
Luckly, Win7 changed the behaviour so you can click the clock to get a read-only calendar up.
I happens on at least two different computers that I know about, both are at different sites but in the same geological location and use the same ISP.
We have a few computers that run Windows XP and every now and again they put the date/time one month forward in time.
This is causing problems as the software that runs on these PCs date stamps records in a database.
I have ran a virus scan on both PCs that showed nothing.
