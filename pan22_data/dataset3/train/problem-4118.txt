Assuming there is actually a gateway on each network, and you are just trying to define a specific behaviour (regular host traffic going out the private network, but public facing traffic sending it's return traffic to the gateway it came in on) - you need some kind of policy routing based on source address.
In linux, you should be able to handle this by creating a second routing table that specifies the gateway on the public network side, whatever it is, and then a policy routing entry that says that anything with a source address of  should use that routing table rather than the system default one.
What's probably happening right now is traffic is coming in on the correct interface, and then, if it's a non-local address, it's going out the default route to another gateway, which is probably a firewall that's dropping the packets because it's not seeing the other half of the session.
You don't apply a gateway to an interface as such - you apply a gateway to a routing instance - generally, unless you've defined multiple routing tables, just one.
The reason it works from other devices on the same public network you are using is because they don't have to go out the default route - they have a more specific interface route to use, which gets the return traffic to where it needs to be correctly.
You do not want the two default gateways you have specified now  - that's going to create strange behaviour - drop the public one from the configuration.
It should go in it's own routing table via the iproute2 mechanism.
Google for "iproute2 policy routing" and look for "simple source routing" or somethign similar - it should get you where you want to go.
