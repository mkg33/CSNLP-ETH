There is no option to re-size the files during restore.
You would have to shrink the files in production before taking the backup.
No, there is no option to adjust the file size of database files during the restore.
Outside of that I would suggest letting the developers tells you what tables they actually need "fresh" data from in production, then just pull that out or a sampling of it out.
However, depending on the method they use to develop and test their code they could always come up with their own test data.
If this is a copy of the database on the development instance you can always tell the developers if they want it to give up space (aka start dropping the other databases on that instances they don't need).
There is the option of exporting/importing the data using SSIS but that takes time and it would probably be cheaper to buy a new larger hard drive and take the test server down and exchange it's drive.
The backup is made by dumping the data pages directly to the backup device.
