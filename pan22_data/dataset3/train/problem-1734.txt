I found that none of the steps advised above (or on other sites) was working.
This is my experience: A zombie network-share folder triggered this problem.
It seems that there's a bug with Windows updating views within libraries.
I was trying to work in Libraries\Dissertation Research, which includes several folders located on various drives.
However, the folder I was working in was part of a "Library."
I'm a little late to this party, but making the following registry change fixed my Explorer update problem with no reboot:
Then I restarted Explorer by executing a bat file with this in it:
I found that if I switch to working in the original file location, I no longer have the problem.
Open explorer --> right click on Documents --> in the documents library pane click the Restore Defaults button --> click Apply
The proposed "Folder Options > Click the Search tab > Check or uncheck ANY option" workaround is effective for me, but it works only for current Explorer window, so closing and reopening one will bring back the bug.
I switched to working in D:\Dropbox\Academia\Dissertation.
After I delete that zombie(the X1500 yellow stuff below), auto-refresh works again immediately.
