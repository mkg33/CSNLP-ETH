The service is on, "netstat -tulpn" shows 10050 in listening mode, the data itself is transmitted to the zabbix server but...that server still think that the collector is unreachable (it even shows the red "ZBX" button in configuration-> host).
Sometimes your hostname could be misconfigured on the client or the server.
Suddendly, the zabbix server stated that zabbix agent on the collector was unreachable.
Network load on the computer itself (Zabbix client or Zabbix server).
To get more clarity, move mouse cursor over the red "Z" and you will see an error message.
I should add that there are no firewalls and that the entire process is (and has to be) on public ip and both the machines are CentOS 7.
I had the same problems with hosts on a remote network passing on an IPsec tunnel and the network load was too heavy at some moments (backups and other processes).
This is a bit more of a troubleshooting process, but the most likely reasons are:
I have a zabbix server which monitors two machines: the server itself and another one which collects some logs from other machines and send data to the zabbix server for monitoring.
