I wonder if anybody knows how serious are these issues.
This might not yet be a full blown issue with the HDD/SSD, but i suggest changing it ASAP.
I keep getting these messages in one of my servers kernel logs (which is responsible for file operations).
Looking at it, a normal SATA controller gives you more information than a a 3Ware port.
I have had numerous 'ata exceptions' in the past (on software RAID), which was almost always a precursor to failure.
Replacing the mainboard with the same type didn't help).
I cannot use smartmontools because the disks are handled by a 3ware card which has it's own (very limited tw_cli utility).
As for the 'buffer error', I've never had that one, so I can't speculate.
With that command, I was able to determine that 'ata exceptions' I kept getting in my logs were the result of interface/cable errors, because the CRC counts increased (which ultimately required replacing the disks with a different type.
If you see reallocated sectors within smart you should change the drive in my opinion.
You can access the smart information using (for example):
With the following you can obtain some interface error statistics:
