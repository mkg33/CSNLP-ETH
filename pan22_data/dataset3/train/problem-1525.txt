Did the user leave on good terms or under a cloud of suspicion?
I have googled 'Decommission Windows User', but there doesn't seem to be any documentation or best practices...
In an extreme case, could deleting their files be considered destruction of evidence?
On the technical side, disabling the account (not even deleting it) will generally block most access.
You can search for topics like "Termination Checklist" for samples.
Some starting points are in that blog from Joe Schaeffer.
I already have procedures in place to remove a user from our domain when they leave their role.

Part of this is a legal or human resources question.
need to do if someone leaves the company suddenly.
I have to say "most" because today's mobile, connected world there are a lot of things being cached and synchronized.
In cases of "urgent dismissal", I'd recommend having a checklist (which can then be scripted) that covers all of the technical and manual steps that you (the IT department) and others (people like HR, physical Security, etc.)
Is email involved, and if so, is it subject to potential litigation?
One important technical issue to be aware of, is that ActiveSync (the most common way for phones to access Exchange) can allow access to the mailbox after the account is disabled.
Should I go further, for example, by deleting their user folder on their PC?
The user could use cached credentials to log in to a computer that is disconnected from a network.
Do other users taking over their role need access to files?
That checklist can then be vetted and approved by management or legal as well.
In many cases, it's as simple as removing the user from AD.
