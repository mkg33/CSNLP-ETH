The reason this is if the service is compromised in some way, processes on your system may be able to be started with elevated privileges.
The best way I have found around the port requirement where non-root users may not listen on ports less than 1024, is to use IPTABLES, with the PREROUTING chain in the NAT table.
Taken from http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/misc/security_tips.html#serverroot
For example, if you choose to place ServerRoot in /usr/local/apache then it is suggested that you create that directory as root, with commands like these:
In typical operation, Apache is started by the root user, and it switches to the user defined by the User directive to serve hits.
This way you can maintain the security of least required permission, yet still answer on the popular ports.
As is the case with any command that root executes, you must take care that it is protected from modification by non-root users.
You can create an htdocs subdirectory which is modifiable by other users -- since root never executes any files out of there, and shouldn't be creating files in there.
Typically you should run as many services as non-root users as possible.
Not only must the files themselves be writeable only by root, but also the directories and parents of all directories.
When you install the httpd executable, you should ensure that it is similarly protected:
It is assumed that /, /usr, and /usr/local are only modifiable by root.
