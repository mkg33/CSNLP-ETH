Right now, I'm testing my computer to see if it will work for a "virtual show": (http://robovirtualevents.com/) and it tests cookies, among other things.
Firefox setting: In Tools->Options->Privacy, checked Accept cookies from sites and Accept third-party cookies, Keep until they Expire.
I have cookies enabled in my browser settings, but cookies are not functioning - in for example, trying to remain logged into websites (like Yahoo mail).
I don't remember the details and it may have involved removing cookies (which I would have assumed would come back when I clicked to remain logged in again).
Possible hints: I did something extra to clear the cache just before this problem appeared.
I usually run Firefox, but have noted that this problem exists no matter what browser I use.
I've always remained logged into Yahoo mail and other sites and could even shut down my computer and reboot - remained logged in.
I clear history when exiting and I also have my browser set to clear everything in the cache when it closes.
