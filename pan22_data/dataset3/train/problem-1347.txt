Totusoft LAN Speed Test, when used with their LAN Test Server product, is a software way of testing throughput of cable runs.
Cat5 is often installed by amateurs, but has been installed and "working" for years.
Proper cable testers and certifiers like a Fluke or LanTech often cost over USD$1000 and people who have them are few.
If you don't want to buy specialized hardware, you can use iperf to be sure your cables transmit at maximum rate.
I think the major problem you are facing is that to test the physical properties of cables you need low level hardware access for the software which a standard laptop or PC NIC won't give you.
Buy a Fluke cable tester, they're what everyone else uses.
Aren't there some sort of special network cards, or USB cat5-testing devices, one can plug into a computer and test the cat5 with software?
Their products are free for basic features, and quite cheap (~$10) for registration to get the advanced features.
If the obtained rate is significantly lower than expected, it can be due to packet retransmissions caused by bad cables.
So you can use something like this hardware (https://pockethernet.com/) and I think you can use your own software if you're not happy with their completely adequate software, or buy one of the well know hardware testers like Fluke and EFXO.
Since you say some cables are installed and working, you can use something like https://github.com/jwbensley/Etherate to make low level Ethernet software tests.
Are there any utilities or simple tools or techniques to easily test a CAT5 cable, to see how well was it installed?
