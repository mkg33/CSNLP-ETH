This means all applications that need to initialize OpenGL or DirectX fail to do so.
I sometimes use my Windows 7 server box (running Windows 7 Enterprise, 64-bit) for development.
You can even drag and drop files between computers.
I would recommend that you keep the server's monitor where you can see it well and use 'Mouse without Borders'  to access the server machine from the same keyboard and mouse that you use on your main workstation.
Space on my desk is limited however so I like to use Remote Desktop to remote into it from my main machine (Windows XP 32-bit).
Note:  My XP machine has an ATI Radeon HD 4800 video card, if that makes a difference.
When doing anything that requires proper video card drivers (such as initializing OpenGL or DirectX) it all works fine when logged in directly on the Windows 7 machine.
When I remote into the Windows 7 machine from my XP machine however, Windows 7 uses "RDPDD Chained DD" as its video card display driver and the ATI Drivers fail to load (or if they were loaded, crash).
I have an ATI Radeon HD 5450 video card with drivers correctly installed.
In Server 2008 R2 SP1, there is a new feature called RemoteFX which can allow some rendering through a remote desktop connection, but the server is required for this feature to work.
