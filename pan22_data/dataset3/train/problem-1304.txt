You are incorrect in assuming that data from your desktop PC to your server has to transpose the network to the far end router and back, it does not work that way.
And the configuration you are asking how to set this up with two subnets, two broadcast domains, or two networks, in this case the references are all basically the same.
If your connection speed is slow, and DD-WRT is doing it's job handling the switch functions, the cause of your lag/slowness is somewhere else.
What you have here is one large broadcast domain, broadcast packets will tranpose the entire network, not normal host to host (IP address/MAC to IP address/MAC) communications.
The DD-WRT router is acting as a switch (not a hub), assuming a simple host to host interaction, the connection between your desktop PC and server will not leave the DD-WRT router (switch) except to the ports which are connected to each device.
If for some reason the DD-WRT device is acting as a hub, not a switch, that could be the issue... but unless your DD-WRT device is EXTREMELY old, that is not the case.
