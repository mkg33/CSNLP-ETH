If there is a problem or the user is away and someone else needs access to files, then a manager can ask for the password to be changed for the day and the user can set their password back the next time they are in.
If you have the power supreme, you are in a position where everyone from the lowliest grunt to the CEO has to trust you not to misuse it.
Administrators can always change a user's password.
True, as an admin there is nothing technical to stop me changing a users password and accessing their account, but I would always get written authorisation from the HR manager (the person's own manager is not good enough) before doing this.
So making it well known that "we don't know your passwords and we can't access your account without changing your passwords (in which case you'll know about it)" is a good thing.
There is a benefit in administrators trying to crack users' passwords to prevent weak passwords being used.
There may be legal obligations too, in terms of data protection, use of personal information, and so forth.
Irrespective of the reality behind it, anything that helps to reinforce that trust will make things a lot easier for you.
