I thought maybe I could put an if statement around the brick spawning code that checks if the location is null.
I am using a 2 dimensional array to set up the game board of an arkanoid-like game I'm making.
I'm open to completely revamping if need be, but I really feel like the 2 dimensional method is the best path.
For now, I am just trying to remove the locations that have already been spawned at.
Other than the first one, they need to spawn touching another brick.
I haven't really used 2d arrays before, but someone suggested this would work better for me than the list I was originally using.
My problem with this method is that it has to choose a location, check if it is null, if it is then it has to check if it is touching another brick, and then finally place a brick if it passes both parameters.
I'm hoping someone has a good suggestion on how to do this because I can't seem to come up with anything solid.
Once we get down to only a couple of locations left to pick though, it could go around for a very long time checking non-null locations before it finally finds the right locations, potentially bogging down the game significantly.
My problem is that when a brick spawns, I need to remove that element from the list of options for the random brick spawn location.
