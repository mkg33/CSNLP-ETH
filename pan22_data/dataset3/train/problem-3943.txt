I have a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, but am open to any other/additional hardware.
Each box would need high-quality AD/DA conversion - there are analog/digital signals flowing in both directions.
Basically, there are at least two raspberry pi's in this setup - the first is at the distribution hub, receiving input from a musician to send to the mixer (not shown) and also receiving an audio feed from the mixer to send to the musician.
I'm a software engineer, so any code that needs to be written for this should not a problem for me.
Really, there are two distinct flows of audio between the distribution hub and the receiver.
I've only done very basic things with a raspberry pi (see: lighting up LED's).
I want to create a cleaner stage wiring method for live musicians.
The second box (that is powered over Ethernet) receives an audio feed from the distribution hub for the musician's monitor feed and also sends an audio feed (their instrument/mic) to the distribution hub.
I'm obviously not looking for a full solution here, just something to get me going in the right direction.
Here's a diagram of the signal flow and conversions necessary:
The following diagram will likely explain my situation better than I can with words:
So the complete topology would look something like this: one distribution hub, multiple receiver boxes (one for each musician), each connecting and powered over ethernet.
