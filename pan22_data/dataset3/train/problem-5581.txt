Each VLAN is a network, Basically according to your diagram you have 9 networks, with a Router you don't need to do routing with a layer-3 switch, However maybe you don't have 9 ports on your router for your 9 networks, in this situation, you can use a technique called router on a stick by creating virtual port for each vlan, here is an example.
Then you run a common routing protocol on all the layer-3 devices.
The real way to do it is to configure IP routing on all the layer-3 switches, and configure the links between the layer-3 switches and the router to be routed links, not trunks.
You either need to manually configure routes, or you need to run a routing protocols between the layer-3 devices.
Unless you enable routing on a layer-3 switch, it is only doing layer-2 switching, not anything with layer-3.
Routers, including layer-3 switches, need to know where to send traffic, otherwise the traffic gets dropped.
How do you suppose that the networks on one side know where to send traffic destined for the networks on the other side?
