So I checked the CPU whether the fan was making noise or any wire was obstructing the fan etc.
You could compare it to a generator generating energy, or kind of like a formula 1 car, it goes from soft to loud and then it ends with a click.
I had a roommate in college with a computer like that.
Since I bought this computer, every time I boot up, I hear this weird noise.
I've definitely had a laptop with a fan that went bad and sounded sort of like that.
I can remember such a noise as you described it, but can't really put it anywhere...
Then I came to know that the SMPS was the culprit.
On the other hand, if it's always sounded like that, you probably just have an unusually loud fan (and/or hard drive).
Based on your description, and this is just a guess, this could your hard disk starting to spin.
During startup boot, it made huge generator like noise, and then slowly stopped after the desktop comes.
Some GPU fans are turning at 100% during boot because the driver hasn't kicked in yet (to throttle them).
I'm assuming it's the processor, it's an Intel i7 920.
This just happened when I started google chrome, my pc had been turned on for an hour, i just went to take a shower, a shave and breakfast, and when I came back, this happened.
Best thing would be, however, to open the PC (only if there's no guarantee on it anymore) and listen carefully from where the noise is coming.
Was fun when I was trying to go to sleep, and he was pulling an all-nighter.
I also had (same laptop, it was getting old at this point) a hard drive sound like that sporadically for a few days before it died completely.
If you've had the computer a while, and you've never heard a noise like this, you might want to back up, just in case... ;)
So really, I want to make sure that this is nothing bad.
My PC was almost a year old with AMD Radeon on-board and 4GB RAM.
And... apparently it was already determined to be a loud hard drive.
