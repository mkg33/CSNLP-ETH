And If you were on SQL 2008 I would use backup compression as it is kick ass.
2008 can do backups with compression that can dramatically increase backup speed.
Good article by Brent Ozar as to what ramifications this has on your db's and backups
Have you implemented differential and tran log backups?
I would only do it on backups that are copied to standby machines and restored so you'd know you have a bad backup.
Not that I'd recommend it, if you turn off the verification option, it will cut the time  dramatically.
50 minutes seems a bit long for 30GB, but if your disk array is under stress, I could see it taking that long.
One of my clients backups went from an hour to 10 mins once we turned on compression in the backup job.
I don't know if Instant File Initialization would help in this.
However I would check if msdb backup history is big like SQLChicken said.
The best way to improve it is through the use of a third-party backup utility - for instance, LiteSpeed from Quest, or SQLBackup from Red Gate.
That said, how often are you running full backups?
