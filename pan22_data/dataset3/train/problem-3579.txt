Or might be due to some db data threshold level reached in that period.
It's hosted in cloud (AWS EC2), so it may be related to spectre / meltdown patches by Amazon as that's what changed in last 2 - 3 weeks (unrelated ?!).
One thing I suspect from this is may be it's related to oracle's cache.
Once any query hangs up, even if I run the same query in another session, it still hangs up.
So when I run the following commands before each query execution, I didn't get any query hang up.
Also we were facing this kind of strange issue only in last 2 - 3 weeks.
We have a very complex view that finishes execution only on first time, but hungs up when run from the same session second time.
AFAIK, only thing I can be sure is that something is badly wrong with oracle's buffer_cache and shared_pool in our version.
I figured that running the exact same query second time is when the problem occurs.
So If I kill the active sessions that's running the hang up query, then I can run the query successfully only for first time but stuck with same problem from second run.
If I simply change any select column or where condition, then it runs for first time and hangs up from second time (see the above commands).
This problem doesn't happen for tables or simple views, only for this complex view (didn't tested other complex views).
complex view - view with nested views, lots of inner and outer joins, multiple union all etc...
