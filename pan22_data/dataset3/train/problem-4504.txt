Get you current local network IP and, run http server like this:
As long as your localtunnel is running, others can access your local node server.
Rather than doing all the configurations (Setting firewall, forwarding port etc) I used localtunnel which is an utility for exposing local node server over Internet.
Note down your_port which in my case was 3000, and start your node server.
Most likely your node application is binding to the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1 instead of the "all IPs" 0.0.0.0 since this is the default behavior of listen.
For more configuration options/help you can go through documentation:
Next look for node.js in the list and click change settings > Make sure private access is checked and then click ok.
Open another terminal and type following command for running localtunnel.
After that configure your node app such that your node server should be running on localhost.
You can use it for development,testing,sharing purpose, just don't use it for production.
Specify both port and IP in your call like server.listen(80, '0.0.0.0'); and try again.
After this , in terminal you will get an URL which you can use it for development/testing purpose.
This URL will be available on Internet so you can share it with others too.
