SPF and DKIM records would identify outgoing mails from example2.com's script as legitimate because the SPF record points to the right server address, right?
It is possible to filter traffic based on user, so that only the mail server userid is allowed to send traffic on port 25.
Then.. Is it possible to stop a website hosted in your own private server sending emails (via PHP mail or sendmail) with other hosted domain's name ?
On Linux you can prevent the mail server being bypass with a firewall rule.
As a result, I am a long way from using DKIM for email validation.
Suppose Example2 is hacked and the attacker writes a PHP function to send email using PHP mail function or sendmail and he is sending email with @example1.com domain addresses.
This would be missing the DKIM signature, but DKIM is frequently/usually not configured correctly.
DMARC helps for those domains that publish a policy but is not widely deployed.
You may want to permit traffic on port 587 as that should require authentication.
The above does not deal with the fact that the script could just look up the MX for the destination and bypass your mail server.
I am most familiar with Exim4 which allows for a number of options:
There are two websites hosted in the same server, example1.com and example2.com.
There are various options that can be used depending on the MTA.
