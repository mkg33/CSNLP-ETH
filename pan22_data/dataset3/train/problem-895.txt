Then go to chrome://plugins/ to make sure that it is enabled in Chrome.
I went to the ubuntu software center, found flash under the installed tab, and uninstalled it.
Make sure to backup your whole .config/google-chrome/ folder just in case.
I don't use the standalone flash package anymore, just the pepper flash version included with Chrome, just in case you are wondering.
I fixed it by deleting the folder PepperFlash in .config/google-chrome/ and .config/google-chrome/Default/Pepper\ Data/, for some reason there is a copy of of the .so file for the pepper flash plugin, which is not really needed because there original copy on /opt/google/chrome/PepperFlash/ should be loaded as well which may be causing a conflict or something.
I had an issue after updating ubuntu on an older pc.
I'm using a different version but maybe this helps you anyways.
I didn't see a pepper file or anything that some other people had issues with.
It is now working as it did before the update and flash is no longer crashing.
You may have to reinstall the Adobe flash plugin even if you already have it installed.
