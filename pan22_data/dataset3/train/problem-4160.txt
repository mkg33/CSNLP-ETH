A valid IP address would look like 192.168.x.x for home networks.
View the MS article here and see if you fit the criteria.
You could also be experiencing winsock corruption.
The computer seems to connect to the network OK (I have tried both wired and wireless), but I can't visit sites and can't ping web addresses.
They have a fix you can download to another computer and carry over to the affected computer.
The computer that can't connect to the internet (XP) is old and failing, and shows no warning before it completely runs out of battery.
Anyway, now when I start the computer up it takes 5-10 minutes after logging on to display the start bar and icons.
I think that before this I had been browsing the internet, but I can't remember for certain.
If you don't have a valid IP address, this could explain why you can't connect to anything.
I have never encountered something like this before, and whilst I am no noob I am also not a sysadmin, haha.
I have 3 computers and one device (Xbox) on my home network; 2 running XP and one on Vista.
Thus today, I started it up forgetting that I had unplugged it the night before, and it just ran out of battery entirely whilst I was using it and died.
Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you for your time.
Pinging the router fails, as does pinging another of my computers on the network.
The problem I am having may or may not have been caused by this 'hard' power off).
