The amount of heat generated by your computer can only be altered by either using more efficient components (ones that generate less heat) or by removing components.
Computers are designed with certain cooling requirements and expected airflow patterns.
You might install some software to adjust the activity level of your computer according to your own activity on it, thus saving on electricity and heat.
Here's a guy who built a water-cooled concrete slab heat pump to cool his PC.
Heat is a byproduct of inefficiency, if you swap your CPU for one that consumes less power (look at wattage ratings) and remove extra items that consumer power (and in turn generate heat) then you'll find the temperature savings.

So unless you want to bring home a block of dry ice every day to offset the generated heat then there's not a lot you can do.
PC Cooling systems are intended to dissapate heat, not lower the total heat output.
Components without fans will give you the best readings (the ones with fans will blow the heat away); take a look at your monitor, printer (laser especially), power bricks, and power-supply and find the worst culprits.
One example is SpeedFan, that can control the speed of your fan.
Reduce that cooling, and you could end up with fried computer.
You might be able to put the bad-guys on a seperate power-strip and kill power to all of them when you're not around.
Another is your computer's power management options.
Disabling them will help keep heat in your system but could cause problems (fans are there for a reason; hot chips are unhappy chips).
Now, with all that said, try buying a cheap infrared thermometer and use it to determine where the heat is originating.
Don't alter your system's cooling unless it's to increase it.
As the other posters said, you have to remove the heat from the entire room.
