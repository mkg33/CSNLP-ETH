I've read that you can tell the storage space it's connected to a battery backup (the computer is plugged into a UPS) or use an SSD cache array, but I don't know the pros and cons here, nor the PowerShell commands to do so.
During transfers I see about 1.5 GB of memory in use, and only 3-4% CPU.
It's a bad idea to use file copy as a progress indicator of anything.
I'm wondering what my options are for speeding up the write speed to my storage spaces that's using parity.
I'd suggest NOT to use any third-party DRAM & SSD cache.

I assume the write performance should be a little better than this, right?
You can use Windows built-in SSD based caching software or configure tiered storage spaces where your SSD will act as a WBC or performance tier.
Consider adding SSD drives as WB Cache or switching your Spaces to tiered configuration.
Format-Volume said "the specified file system is not supported."
Microsoft clearly recommends to only use the “Parity” Spaces layout without WBC for archive-like scenarios in which only reading takes place almost exclusively.
If adding SSDs is not an option for you, consider using "Two Way Mirror" (aka RAID10) configuration, this will significantly increase write performance.
I set up the storage space using PowerShell because I was attempting to do ReFS with parity, and though it's an option in the GUI, the GUI was giving me trouble.

The write performance you achieve is absolutely normal for your configuration.
So, it's an NTFS volume at 26.1 TB, provisioning type is fixed, resiliency is parital, physical disk redundancy is 1.
Stick with DiskSPD or you'll get random & unreproducible numbers.
With such a powerful processor, I wouldn't expect parity calculations to slow it down too much.
