On the High Performance setting, the system's GPU solves 111,330,057 keys per second using the distributed.net client.
Additionally, and this is a useless data point, the system decrypts data encrypted with RC5-72 13% faster on Lenovo Dynamic than on High Performance.
My conclusion is that the GPU generates frame rates between 10 and 11% higher on Lenovo Dynamic than on High Performance.
Here were the temps in F at the end of the test: //  CPU Pkg 197.6 // GPU 161.6 // HDD 114.8 //
Here were the temps in F at the end of the test: // CPU Pkg - 194.0 // GPU 149.0 // HDD 113.0 //
A benchmark app was run with the power management set to "High Performance".
Dynamic Graphics is a Lenovo setting to automatically boost graphics performance for multimedia intensive applications.
Lenovo's Dynamic Graphics technology can boost discrete graphics performance five to 10 percent by automatically adjusting chipset frequency depending on workload.
Note using the 3D Settings in nVidia Control Panel you can select which of the two graphics processors in the Y580 will be used by a given program (e.g., Intel or nVidia).
Also, you can also increase performance still further when running under Lenovo Dynamic Graphics by installing nVidia Inspector - allowing you to overclock the GPU and memory of the 660M chip.
On the Lenovo Dynamic Graphics setting, the GPU solves 126,623,174 keys per second using the distributed.net client.
The system was literally at room temperature when the boot started.
I was curious just like the original poster, so I ran benchmarks on my Lenovo IdeaPad Y580 when I first got it back in November.
