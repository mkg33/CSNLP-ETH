I'm not even sure how to replace it if that'll fix the problem.
Long story short, one of the fans has decided it didn't want to work anymore, or at least work to its full capacity on any regular basis.
It's 3 or 4 years old now and way out of warranty.
I wouldn't be against getting a new one since this one is old, but I'd rather pay $10 for a new fan and replace it if that'll do the trick.
Still, no idea why the fans aren't showing up in programs but the overheating, and my need to see those fans is now gone.
So I can't even tell if the fan just needs some help, or if it's dead, or really what the story is.
I didn't see any lint or dust in the fan initially but I figured why not look again, went through the whole process and hidden VERY well was a string of dust and lint about the size of my thumb.
Well, my left fan just kicked in, so I better submit this before the laptop shuts down.
HWMonitor, SpeedFan, hmonitor, I8KFANGUI won't install - driver problem.
The left fan (underneath the ESC key) works fine, but it's the fan on the right side giving me trouble.
So to diagnose if the fan is completely dead, I've tried a couple fan monitoring programs - none whatsoever can detect any fan.
I decided to bite the bullet and open the laptop up - twice, actually.
