This was on an mx350 but imagine it'd be the same.
At this point, I don't care too much about the ADF working, I just want to disable whatever sensor is tripping this error message.
Recently, it keeps saying "Document in ADF" when I turn on the printer.
On the underside of the lid are two white tabs - give them both a gentle pull.
For me it wasn't the ADF on the back, it was the one on the top.
I called technical support and they told me that parts are not even being made for my Pixel MX340 my only option was to upgrade...
I found this thread online, where a user has the same problem.
I've opened up the feeder device, as much as can be done with fingers alone.
I ran a sheet of paper through about six times, just to see if some dust might be getting in the way, and I've blown out the feeder with air.
On mine one had a little give and after that was fine.
I asked if there's a way to disconnect the ADF and they said no that I probably had a bad sensor... so as determined as I am I figured if it's broken and I have nothing to loose by taking it apart and trying to fix it... so I took off both top pieces and pulled the wire for the ADF sensor...NOW I can still use my printer...
This is particularly annoying, as it blocks all functions on the device - I cannot print, even though printing has no interaction with the document feeder.
I've tried clearing this multiple times, but as soon as the feeder wheels stop turning, in an attempt to clear the document feeder, it just pops up the same error again.
