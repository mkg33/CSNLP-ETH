These should not be affected by what you want to achieve.
There is a chance that the new install will see the RAID volumes as "foreign", depending on the RAID controller.
But whatever you do first check how the old RAID was set up and check if your backups are up to date and work when you try to restore.
But you do want to find out how those data drives are set in RAID.
The RAID configuration is stored on the RAID volumes themselves, so there is no need to worry about copying it.
You could just clone your 60gb drive or even use something like easeus to move from a me drive to another.
With a reinstall of the OS all programmes and games and such will need to be re installed.
When you install the OS on the new SSD, all you should need to do is install the driver.
In such a case, all you need to do is import the volume and they will come online.
How you would do so depends on the RAID controller's software.
But as mentioned above doing that separately should not affect the raid setup itself as long as that isn't handled by the OS level.
