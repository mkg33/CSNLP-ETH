While typcial Windows passwords are protected in a way they cannot be reversed (given time and resource maybe) it is possible that an extremely bad decision has been made to change this default config.
My view on this is that the bigger risk is colleagues when a user walks away from their desk and leaves their screen unlocked.
The domain administrator does not have access to any other users password and can't logon to the domain as that user, unless the user has given the domain administrator their password.
In normal circumstances your answer would be no, he/she does not have your password.
And I believe if you login to any PC using different credentials it'll kick the other user out.

Open access to Windows, data, email and any system with SSO.
They only way the network admin should have the user's login credentials is if the user told the admin what they are.
If he is a domain administrator then he can log the user out using his credentials though.
In addition to what you have just added within your edit, the network administrator can only have password if he has access to the domain controller and can install his/her own software to brute-force the passwords (very easily if the password is weak).
