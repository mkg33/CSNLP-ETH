If you ever move your stripe to another computer (e.g.
The only times you'll be hot-swapping them will be if a drive fails or if you intend to destroy the RAID array.
If you're running RAID0 and a drive fails, you're out of luck.
You already installed the driver for the asmedia card.
because the old one died) you can access the stripe from there.
In the screenshot I only got the option to create a mirror since I already formatted the volume.
Replace the bad drive, add it to the array, and then format the array.
Best of all, you do not need a special configuration for this.
RAID controllers usually detect disks by their serial number, so everything has to be specifically configured.
After this you should be able to create a stripe using windows disk manager.
After inserting two disks, you will need to go into the IntelRST controller after the BIOS (I think it's Ctrl+I on most systems) and create a new RAID drive from them.
The drivers will take care of rebuilding the array from there.

If a drive fails, and you have redundancy (RAID1 or RAID5, which with two drives the only possible one is RAID1), you'll need to remove the bad drive, put in a new one of the same or larger size, and then open the IntelRST control panel and add the new drive as a hot spare to the RAID array.
However with a raw partition you should be able to set up a stripe.
