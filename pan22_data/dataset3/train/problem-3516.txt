... the beauty of a simple csv file is that you can actually open it in notepad or a spreadsheet and usually find the line which is "broken" and fix/delete it.
You can then read them from disk later on one by one i.e.
But I need the dataframes to be independent, meaning that if one dataframe is corrupted, the others are untouched.
If you want to get quite involved and be able to specify names for each of the panels you create, you could look at the h5 file format.
you don't need to read the whole dataset into memory.
Pickle, on the other hand, is a little more complicated to debug.
You can write a similar function to make accessing the saved h5 file.
Iâ€™m looking for a way to save house prices data by city, for example a pandas panel with one dataframe per city.
On a side note, if you want to minimise the possibility of corruption, you could consider saving each panel/DataFrame (whichever method you go for) into separate files, and then make copies/backups.
Here is an example of a function that would save such a dataset:
This really is a flexible way to save data, and it can be compressed with one of the best known (widely-spread) algorithms in the open-source world: gzip!
For the meaning of the parameters, head over the documentation.
This allows you to group datasets in named containers.
I tried using pickle and csv, but once a line was corrupted I lost the whole file.
