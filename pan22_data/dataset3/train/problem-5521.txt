If you want to find what other characters are available, look at the file /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose (change the en_US.UTF-8 directory to match your locale if necessary) and search for <dead_greek>.
The four repetitions of dead_greek are for various combinations of the <dead_greek> key with the Shift and AltGr keys.
If you want to add more key sequences for greek characters (or for any unicode character, in fact), you can create an .XCompose file in your home directory, for example:
Now you can try typing your <dead_greek> key followed by the letter e or p, and this should print ε or π.
If the xmodmap command above returns nothing, it means that you do not have a <dead_greek> key assigned.
Okay, these characters aren't actually Greek, but they look like they do, so who cares?
If you just want a few Greek characters (e.g., for math equations), then I highly recommend using XCompose.
And there are actually a lot more key sequences predefined.
If you are not sure which key the keycode corresponds to, you can run the following command and type all keys until you find the one with the right keycode:
In this example, we add two key sequences for ∂ and ∇.
By default, XCompose is configured to use a special <dead_greek> key.
You can check what is your <dead_greek> key by running the following command:
If some apps ignore your personalized key sequences, you may need to add the following environment variables to your .xsessionrc script:
To assign one, first find the keycode of the key you want to assign using the xev command above, then type the following command (replacing 191 with whatever keycode you want):
On my system, the <Multi_key> is the Caps Lock key.
You will probably want to add this command to your ~/.xsessionrc script so that it runs automatically every time you login.
The include makes sure you keep the key sequences defined for your locale.
