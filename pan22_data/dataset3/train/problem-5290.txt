Additionally when you introduce capacity consuming user sessions (queries for example) competition gets worse.
I would seriously consider running oracle on a dedicated server without the virtualisation layer.
If it's mostly from system, then you probably have a driver or hardware device that is taking up too many interrupt resources (network card, maybe?)
Also use a hardware raid10 with at least 8 disks, the more disks the better.
Oracle is built to have and use a multi-CPU platform.
Oracle is quite a beast and needs all the resources it can get.
However in my opinion you are limiting yourself with oracle running in a virtual environment.
If the CPU utilization is from iowait, then you're wasting your money until you upgrade your storage system.
If the CPU utilization is from user, then the answer is most likely "yes".
I am pretty sure any upgrade in CPU (count) will have performance benefits, as long as you add these to the virtual machine also.
Oracle has several core processes which all have to compete on CPU time if there is too few of them.
That is, say you have 4 virtual machines on a 32 GB server and you assign each virtual machine 25 GB of RAM.
This greatly depends on how much parallelizable is Oracle's work, i.e.
Generally speaking, a DBMS is a highly parallel application, so it should benefit from having more CPUs; but some workloads might not benefit from it at all.
Additionally if you run the application services in the same server, there is no question about it.
Having more than one core for the database engine will help in performance.
