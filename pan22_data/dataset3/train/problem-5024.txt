There is nothing syntactically wrong with your sudo configuration, however, using the -u flag may be interfering with your intended behavior.
sudo means "super user do", meaning "perform this command as the super (root) user".
If both of these checks succeed then you are allowed to execute the command as the root user.
If you always wish to execute wine as user randeel rather than the effective sana user you may want to investigate the runas_spec for sudoers.
Try single quoting the entire /usr...vbs area and adding that entire command as your command alias in sudoers(also single quoted)
If you are not logged on as the root user of your system, using sudo will ask you for your password, and check that you are in the sudoers file.
Have you attempted to run /usr/bin/wine as yourself via sudo?
I think sudo is having trouble with the command-line args.
Adding yourself to the sudoers file does not prevent you from having to enter a password to use sudo, it enables you to use sudo in the way you are experiencing.
