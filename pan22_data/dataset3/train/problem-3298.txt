IMHO going from a 2.93ghz to a 3.06ghz is negligible.
Comparatively, Dell asks only for $80 for the same upgrade on the Vostro line (as of 9/24 on Dell Direct, even less markup on the reseller site).
If you are one of the extremely few video/graphics professionals for whom the diffence might matter at all, you wouldn't be using an iMac.
I'd spend the 150 on an external drive, some software, a decent mouse etc instead.
Because it suggests that the cost of the upgrade is a high profit item for Apple (higher profit suggests less value for the consumer).
In my opinion, a better use of the $150 is to purchase AppleCare for $169, I believe, for the iMac.
From my experience, there is no noticeable difference on CPU speed.
I would rather spend on memory and it does make big difference if you use Adobe CES and lots of video editing (iMovie).
We're looking at a 4% performance difference (unless the chip is from a different family altogether and has other benefits besides clockspeed - bus speed, cache size, etc etc)
The difference between 2.93 and 3.06 ghz might be measurable if you run very specific benchmarks or hour-long renders or encodings, but it's not perceptible for any human use of an imac, not even in games.
