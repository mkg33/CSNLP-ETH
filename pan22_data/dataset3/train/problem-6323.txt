Use Clonezilla, but then also use DHCP server and Active Directory to handle workstation names using their MAC Addresses.
It might take a bit to index the MAC Addresses and map hostnames to them, but it will help you out in the long run, as when you need to reimage the server, it will automatically get the same hostname again.
If you already have a Windows server, this may be an inexpensive solution for you.
The cleanest free option though would probably be, http://unattended.sourceforge.net/
If set up correctly, it will automatically set up the hostname when each server boots up.

CloneZilla can do network deployment, but I'm, not aware that it can change workdstation names.
I have used "Ping" a few times for imaging windows workstations, it's free and is pretty simple to use.
As you can see it also has the ability to deal with workstation naming, hotfix, application installation, and even joining to an existing domain/workgroup.
Windows Server 2003 R2 and above have Windows Deployment Services included.
