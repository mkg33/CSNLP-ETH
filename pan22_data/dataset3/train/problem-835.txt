Note that you actually may be able to step down Wordpress from an xlarge to a large instance if you tune the data layer well.
When I did that a few weeks back, the performance of an EBS volume mounted to a small instance was about half as good as a single hard drive on my laptop.
You can improve EBS performance by striping multiple EBS volumes into a software raid configuration
Try measuring the file system performance of the EBS volume where your MySQL data is stored, using something like iozone.
Moving your MySQL instance to Large or better gives you much more memory as well as better IO performance.

Presumably your MySQL instance is saving data to on an EBS volume.
Assuming you have used mysqltuner well, the problem may well lie in the data storage hardware.
I would try creating a software RAID first, and then consider moving to a larger instance.
