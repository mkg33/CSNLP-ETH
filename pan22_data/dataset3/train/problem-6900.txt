Most likely cause is a dialer or VPN that is open, and which causes a long timeout before it attempts secondary connections.
Another possible cause could be that someone is listening in to your signal using the man-in-the-middle method, and is causing the delay this way.
I can't test with the wifi adapters on Linux, as there are no drivers for them.
I can't find anything in my network settings which look likely to be the cause.
Whats disturbing to me, is the ping of 800ms to your router.
This means almost a second gets lost in one-way traffic!
You can check if someone is mimicking your wifi network by using the following command in a cmd:
My laptop can connect without issue from the same position, either by using its own wireless adapter, a usb adapter which has issues in the desktop but is fine in the laptop, or usb tethering through my phone.
I've tried different wireless adapters, and even using the usb tethering on my phone, and they all have the same result.
To me it sounds like you are not connected directly; There is, intentionally or not, some software or hardware that "hijacks" your signal.
Can you do a tracert to your router and to google.com?
This may not be higher then 20ms on busy occupied routers!
I've tried disabling 11n on my router so I know it's connecting by 11g, and it had the problem, and I tried setting it to 11n and it had the problem.
Also, verify that you are connected to the correct wifi network, and that the MAC of your router matches to the MAC that you are connected to.
I have a specific desktop which seems to have consistently high packet loss and ping regardless of what connection it is using.
I'm connecting via wifi and this computer usually has a ping to my router of around 800ms and packet loss of around 20%.
The computer is running Windows Server 2008 R2 and Arch Linux, and the problem only exists on Windows for usb tethering.
