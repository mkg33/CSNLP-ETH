Regarding what I believe is what you want to achieve
Live media is not the same as a properly installed operating system, and sure you'll need a variant of the ext filesystem for installing your Linux distribution but on your hard drive, many live media does not have this requirement and they will work fine from a fat 32 drive.
Easus Partition Manager can achieve such a task, you can grab it for free if you keep it for personnal home use.
Additionally I think it isn't possible to convert fat32 to ext3 and I'm also pretty sure that ophcrack can boot from fat32 because normally most live systems have their actual filesystem inside a squashfs file on the boot medium and most linux kernels work fine with fat32 (especially those that have to read password hashes that are potentially stored on a fat32 filesystem).
You can create a booting flash drive running ophcrack with Unetbootin, ophcrack is officially supported.
You can grab GParted Live and boot into it on any system to format to ext3, and then to actually use the filesystem within windows you'll need an appropriate driver.
You can use any tool suggested here to format your drive, many support different filesystems but if you need a live media, you'll most likely just need fat 32, and the good old windows format dialog will be enough for this task.
I think everybody has gotten it right in some way, but I think there still are bits of information I'd like to add:
As far as I can tell, you just want to boot a live image of said distribution to do whatever you need to do on it, without installing it or making your computer dual boot, so you most certainly want to stick with the fat 32 filesystem and you would just have to use a proper tool like Unetbootin (as somebody has already suggested) since it will do all the work of creating a live USB for you.
