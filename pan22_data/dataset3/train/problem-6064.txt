f10 is the equivalent of bubbling within the same major-mode.
Combine this with uniquify for even better results.
Check out the different buffer switching methods on EmacsWiki.
These old text editors have surprisingly good documentation.
It's not in part of emacs, but first hit in google seems to work.
(It probably use as much screen real estate as ECB, and thus not a valid answer to you.)
You can select which buffer you want by clicking on the appropriate tab.
You can type any part of the buffer name, so you can get to any buffer by typing a few characters only.
(This actually simulates the default behavior of XEmacs.)
Look at buffer-stack and buffer-stack-suppl here emacswiki.
I find it a lot quicker to manage the buffer-list as an MRU (most recently used) stack.
tabbar-mode puts a series of tabs (like in a browser, not like tab-stops) along the top of your emacs editing window.
Personally, even thinking of buffer-names is distracting to my workflow.
I have only played a little bit with tabbar-mode as its tab display gets written over by StickyFunc-mode.
