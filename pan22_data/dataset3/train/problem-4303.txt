I am setting up a test environment, made up of various Linux boxes, and I have the need to launch an instance of Firefox on a remote machine via ssh.
There are ssh clients/X11 server bundles out there, something like this.
It then runs a script, which tries to launch Firefox on the remote machine.
3) If xorg is already running on remote hosts, just allow local Xorg connections (xhost +127.0.0.1) on remote hosts, and start firefox with one of the following commands (first one should work, if not, try the second one):
2) Start vncserver on remote hosts, and run firefox in there
However, since the ssh session is a from a non-GUI environment, there is no display.
a virtual display in the remote environment for Firefox to run in?
1) Run Xorg on your host and display firefox here (ssh -Y user@remotehost)
Just ensure your $DISPLAY points back to where you are connecting to and lauch firefox in your console.
The source machine is a Continuous Integration server and it creates an ssh session to the remote machine from a non-GUI environment.
The remote machine has Ubuntu Desktop (11) and Firefox installed.
Is it possible to have a headless X-windows display?
