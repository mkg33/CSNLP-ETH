the pagefile is not SLOW, if the OS is reading the pagefile, its because the ram is not enough for the opened apps.
Quite often, one of the applications I use freezes (“does not respond”) for a while, in extreme cases for few minutes.
When I sort the disk table in perfmon by read or write, the file read and wrote the most is the pagefile, but it's still quite low rate (I don't remember the numbers).
If you defragment the pagefile, the performance improvement will be minimum.
btw, disable Superfetch in services, it frees a lot of memory.
During this time, the HDD light flashes constantly and perfmon show that HDD is used 100% of the time (OTOH, CPU isn't) and that pagefile is being read (which is to be expected when switching apps), but at a very slow rate.
I use Windows Vista, and the computer is quite ordinary two years old laptop.
also, if you can pay the upgrade,  Windows 7 have a much better memory management,
