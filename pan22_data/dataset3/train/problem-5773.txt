Documentation on the website is VERY detailed, it's huge: https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual
Rule Set 2.0.5 won't be just installed, It will be heavily modified or configured.
Otherwise it will block most of applications and clients.
Application code audit won't help you, it's not about the code, it's about operation:
So, ask client to provide copy of rule files from the server, do not try to use the files from official site - it's useless, it's always modified according to client needs.
Then check all the rules one by one (yes, you'll have to learn how rules are written), check where it can interfere with your app, test it on your system, look for audit logs of modsecurity to see where is the problem, rewrite your app, or add new rules.
Client must provide existing rules that permit or restrict requests or write the new ones or provide a very detailed information about what they block while testing the system in parallel with you.
Create document, list how requests and responses are to be sent and received - content, structure, authentication etc - everything - strict document.
