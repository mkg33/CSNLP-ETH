So theoretically, you could build up a script doing a copy of an older version, taking a snapshot and subsequently copying the newer version, but you would lose the original snapshot time stamps.
You should consult the documentation (and/or EMC support) for a supported way to migrate over a volume together with its snapshots.
I do not know much about the EMC Clariion, Symmetrix or VNX product lines (I do not work with EMC products), but most likely, the files served through SMB are not stored on an NTFS file system.
So, if you can get a block-level access to your LUN on the storage level, you can directly transfer the LUN to a new NAS device, and your shadow copies should safely migrate.
Even in a Windows implementation, shadow copies are not "file metadata" but a group of copy-on-write references for occupied file system blocks.
The Explorer is accessing the snapshot history which the NAS is offering via the Shadow Copy interface.
File-level migration will not transfer shadow copies.
Robocopy can't do that as it does not implement calls to the Shadow Copy APIs.
What you can do is use the "previous versions" path to get access to a different file share snapshot and use robocopy on that.
You should instead do a file system level migration, this will preserve your shadow copies if the shadow storage is located on the same logical volume, or on the same NAS volume.
