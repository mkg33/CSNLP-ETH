In fact even more evidence suggest the process is the same.
Mirror is grayed out because the volumes are using GPT and not MBR system.
Now installed, I want to setup mirroring inside windows (raid 1 effectively).
I don't have one myself but going through the web, found these two tutorials which are pretty good in my opinion.
I have two of the same exact drives in the server.

In disk management, I right click the partition and add mirror is grayed out.

If you want more space in this case, you should have used 3 x 2TB disks and use Raid-5 using Diskmgmt.msc in the server.
I might add that these are for Windows server 2008 but may also work on server 2012.
I KNOW if you go with 2TB drives, Use DiskPart to ensure you convert your system (primary) hard disk to MBR before installing windows, it will 100000% work fine for you.
But then MBR doesnt work on anything bigger than 2TB.
I do not know about Windows Server 2012, however the old advice used to be that the disks had to be dynamic disks which is a process that can break dual boot:

that would have brought your space to 4TB in total {(2+2+2)-2}.
In device manager you need to convert the drives to dynamic and then the right click option will allow you to mirror them.

I have a dell c1100 server and it gave me a hard time installing windows server 2012.
Personally for a basic file server, Software Raid will do ok for you using Windows server diskmgmt.msc.
