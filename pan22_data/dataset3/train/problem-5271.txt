Just don't by connectors that say Cat5 on them, just get one that is not labeled.
In other words, of some 1-3% of 100 crimps that are a bit weak, or even faulty, a 6E will make no difference.
Note, that the connectors will be even less of a factor if you are working with longer than 6 foot cables.
Cat 5E v. Cat 6 connectors will make a negligible difference.
This will occur over about 3/4", or 1% of the overall signal path.
What really makes a difference is a good strong crimp to bind the 8 strands to the metal of the connectors.
I'm seriously considering buying 300 feet of Cat6 cable, trimming it, and selling it for cheap at my college.
Chances are, that you will find that the process variation in crimping vary so much, that any degradation will be overwhelmed by the spread of attenuation/crosstalk between your best and your worst construction.
The metal conductors in the connectors are not twisted, so there is some mild signal degradation no matter what.
Since the cable itself is Cat6, is it worth it to pay $20 more for a pack of 100 Cat6 connectors than for 100 Cat5E connectors?
I assume since the basic design for the connector stays the same, there only a few micrometers more worth of gold on the connector, and the majority of the time is spent along the cable, that it's not, but I would like your input.
The math suggests that you are building 6 foot cables (72 inches).
I've been told by a few people in reputable electronics stores that the ends aren't so much what makes a difference as the cable itself and the way it is stranded.
