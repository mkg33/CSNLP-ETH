I have Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics 2nd edition by Eric Lengyel and it's a great refresher on math related to games.
Sergio you might want to aim more toward a Game Development math book like
Also like Ron Warholic said, stating what your math comfort level is would better help us taylor a specific book.
You may face few calculus examples which you can ignore them
Do you understand things like vectors and matrices?
It's been my constant desk companion since school.
Essential Mathematics for Games and Interactive Applications, Second Edition: A Programmer's Guide
The one thing you need to make sure to do regardless of the book you choose is to do the exercises!
I really liked Eric Lengyel's Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics.
They cover an extremely broad range of material, and the author has been praised for his teaching style.
If you are the type that gets scared or frustrated by equations I would look elsewhere for reference.
The Best world class course in linear algebra is MIT's one with the great Gilbert Strang
The only downside from a programmers point of view is that it is very equation heavy.
I'm in the process of using these videos to brush up on my own math skills.
Not a book, but you should check out the math curriculum over at the Khan Academy.
It starts with a very basic introduction to linear algebra with vectors and matrices and works through more advanced things like illumination, visibility determination, computational geometry, and game physics systems.
For fun you could even implement them to allow you to see how the math maps to code.
Instead of the classical Linear Algebra you would learn in college.
