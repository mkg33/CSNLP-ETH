You can't be hurting the battery if it's not in there (unless you don't use it for months).
After so many dead batteries or those that only hold a charge for 30 mins or less, I have started unplugging my laptops and netbooks once they are fully charged.
Many modern machines have power save modes and/or can underclock the CPU when on battery power  so you will get reduced performance if unplugged.
I have found that especially in the case of Apple devices this can make the difference in having a usable MacBook Pro and one that must stay plugged in at all times.
(Although it usually is configurable, but why bother).
Lastly, some of the recent VAIO's have had their batteries recalled so you may want to see if you're on the list.
This has produced a lot better result than leaving them plugged in.
When my battery is fully charged and I'm not going to be moving for a while I actually take it out of the laptop with the laptop still plugged in.
Also, batteries only have a finite life, therefore whilst it is good practice to do a complete charge/discharge cycle at least once every so often, the more times you run the battery down from start to finish - the less total capacity you will have.
I would always leave a laptop plugged in whenever I can.
