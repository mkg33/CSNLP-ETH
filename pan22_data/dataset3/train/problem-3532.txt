Hardware ratings are one thing true throughout another.
Those are the "max speeds hardware rating wise" as far as the bandwidth you pass through interfaces....that has a lot of  factors including network environment number of hosts, protocol, bandwidth of the links connecting the ports with downstream and upstream devices....you get the point.
You will get a lot of interface errors and that will cause re-transmissions.
Speed is set to auto when out of the box, If I recall correctly Those you generally get a combination of 24 or 48 10/100/1000 ports along with either one or two 1 GB or 10 GB SFP slots which I would use ass trunk ports.
ARP frames are really no way to measure an interface speed.
The default speed and duplex of a Cisco 29xx fast ethernet switch interface which was reset to default settings would be Auto.
One problem could be that one side of the link is set to Auto, but the other side is set to a fixed speed and/or duplex.
That will cause serious problems on the link, and it could look like your link speed is very slow.
See this Cisco table for the combinations which can cause duplex mismatches.
