Next you'll see the call from Entitiy Framework, where LoggedUser.Instance.UsrID is a GUID:
The TBL_ChangeTrackerPerLoggedUser's name is a bit confusing as it has nothing to do with the ordinary ChangeTracking-Mechanism, it is just a simple table where you can look up wether there were made any changes to DB or not (because Azure has no Query Notifications, right?).
But when i take a look at DB at this point, SProc has been executed successfully:
Now, when i process this code I get an EntityCommandExecutionException telling me:
Should i simply catch this Exception and act like it never happened?
I use a Azure DB(MS-Sql) and administrate the DB with Management Studio for SQL Server 2016.
The error occurs on the client side, after your procedure has executed, to explain the 'magic' you see.
You use an API that expects a result set (SqlQuery<...>(...)) but your stored procedure produces no result set.
So...is there any advice or explanation you can provide to understand this kind of magic?
