I first plugged in my 3TB Seagate (ST3000DM001) to a motherboard SATA port that is 3TB capable and formatted the drive.
And happily the Syba mentioned does work as described.
I expect it would also work on CentOS 6 but, I have not tested it yet.
My reasoning is that the USB errors I had gotten with a 3TB drive had been identical on CentOS (2.6.32) and Debian (3.2.0).
(I did not think to try it first without formatting.)
However, the choice of dock is of paramount importance.
I am using ST3000DM001 3TB drives and smaller drives with a Connectland DOCK-3UBT3 (same as Syba above) on Debian Wheezy/Sid, kernel 3.2.0.
The first dock I got, a startech unidock2u, showed the same errors, even when I formatted the drive first, and despite being advertised compatible with drives up to 4TB and Linux.
The post above is the only one I've found that recounts success using a 3TB with Linux.
Two 3.5" 3TB drives at the same time work OK also.
But it does work afterwards perfectly in the dock.
I found it online as "Syba CL-ENC50038 Dual Mode SATA III HDD Duplicator and Docking Station" but the picture shows it labelled/branded "Connectland", and that is what I have also.
