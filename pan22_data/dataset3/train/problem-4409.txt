In other words, you could be pressing every key on the keyboard at once, and all of the keystrokes would still register.
For anyone still having this problem, I've run into a similar issue recently, and I found out something interesting.
After switching to a different port, the problem was resolved.
If you want to ensure that you never have to deal with this issue again, I suggest purchasing a das keyboard, which has N-key rollover.
I found this out after moving my computer, and apparently plugging it into a different port than normal, where two button combinations that normally worked no longer did.
How many keys I could push was actually affected by the USB port I was using.
If that's what's happening you have either a hardware fault or a spectacularly rubbish keyboard.
To my knowledge, this can actually be a limitation in the hardware, so you might have to get a new keyboard.
It is unfortunate, but you just have to find the dead combinations and avoid using those keys for gaming.
Almost all consumer keyboards have combinations that don't work.
This is a hardware limitation, as the other answers suggest.
I used to have the exact same problem gaming with an older logitech keyboard that had a 3-key rollover.
Does it work correctly in other computers and/or with other operating systems?
However, even cheapo keyboards typically support 3-key rollover in which case you should not be able to hit a jamming combination with just two keys.
