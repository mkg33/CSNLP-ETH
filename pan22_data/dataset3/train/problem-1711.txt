Google is creating a bigger and bigger push to get all websites hosted securely over SSL and using "scare tactics" such as highlighting to the customer that the site is "Not Secure".
My technical issue is that I have a website engine hosted as a single site in IIS as part of an Azure Cloud Service.
I've had a few ideas on how to do this, but none seem ideal.
I'm sure that they'll eventually grow the weighting of a secure site in their rankings.
I have 1,000 or so different domain names (not sub-domains) pointing at the website and the engine determines which site to display to the customer.
Another factor to consider is that sites can come and go - so the regeneration of SSL certificates is going to be required at reasonably regular intervals.
However, getting an SSL certificate which copes with 1,000 domains is currently not available (to my knowledge the most is 250), so I'm trying to find a way to get around this.
Has anyone dealt with something similar to this before or have any ingenious ideas on a direction I may be able to take and investigate further?
