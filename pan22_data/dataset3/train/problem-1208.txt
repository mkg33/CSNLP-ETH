iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE
iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -o wlan1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
However, I cannot write a book within this answer, so I'll keep it short and simple.
Then it sends the package back into the tunnel called tun0.
This line allows the traffic coming from the tunnel tun0 going to the interface wlan0, but only if a connection was established previously.
The second line here is basically just the way back for the package.
I assume wlan0 is used as the primary internet connection in this guide, so this is main route between the router and the VPN tunnel.
In a nutshell, those rules allow packages coming from the VPN tunnel to flow into the rest of the private network and back.
This makes the Pi accept packages on this interface and gives access to the internal network.
This line says to accept all traffic forwarded to the wlan0 interface.
This rule basically takes the package, applies NAT, but after the decision how to route this package is made.
It also applies masquerade, because the rule does not know the IP of the device.
Without it, you'd need to use this command for every device connecting.
To understand this, you must understand the principles of routing.
