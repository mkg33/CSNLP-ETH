And restoring this image to a system of different hardware config could render the system unstable due to driver issues.
You can backup the image of your partitions to a USB drive or DVD and restore it later.
Look in to creating a disk image using a program called Clonezilla.
You can just replace the internal hard disk by a new one and store it somewhere safe.
You can make an image of your entire hard drive, save it to a USB drive, and at a later date restore the entire image.
Other than that, if you restore the image it will overwrite the whole drive, so anything saved on it will need to be saved elsewhere before restoring the disk image.
Some caveats of this are that it most likely will not work on any other computer, since it copies EVERYTHING and significant hardware differences probably won't be taken nicely.
It will backup the system while running and even restore to different hardware easily.
It can also convert the backup to a VMware or Windows virtual machine.
There is a list of free tools at http://www.thefreecountry.com/utilities/backupandimage.shtml
A paid solution would be Symantec Backup Exec System Recovery 2010 Desktop Edition.
There are commercial tools like Acronis True Image, Nortan Ghost or Nero BackitUp & Free tools like Clonezilla, PartImage(I got this one always on my pendrive) etc.
I used Clonezilla to roll out a disk image from one computer to 50 others, all with identical hardware, and it worked beautifully.
