A workaround is to block it at the system level by e.g.
It is a bit overkill since it also changes menu items, but seems to work well and is compatible.
And look: even when Firefox has focus, Ctrl-Q does not reach it.
On Linux with Firefox Quantum, there is currently a bug that prevents extensions and explicit configuration from changing a builtin shortcut such as ctrl-Q.
To disable the shortcut without installing extensions:
I'm using Mozilla Firefox for Ubuntu(version - 39.0)
The system gets keystrokes before applications do, so I used the Settings/Keyboard/Application shortcuts to define Ctrl-Q to start some non obtrusive application.
installing the script from https://github.com/sasawat/firefox-ctrl-q-workaround and assigning it as the action of ctrl-Q as a global shortcut.
Because Firefox itself does not allow to change the Ctrl-Q shortcut, I decided to steal that key combination away from Firefox.
I use Xubuntu, but plain Ubuntu probably has a similar function.
I want to change the quit short-cut which is currently Ctrl+Q.. To some other keys, because sometime while closing tabs with Ctrl+W., I accidentally close my firefox.
In the electrolysis era I have come to rely on menu wizard to modify existing firefox hotkeys.
I chose the Whisker application menu, but pick whatever.
