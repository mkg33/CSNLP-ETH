I'd like to upgrade the drive to an SSD but can't afford one at the size I need.
Would using a hybrid SSD for this purpose give a significant speed increase?
However, if you have machines that are suspended and resumed frequently, those suspension files might stay in cache longer (as they would be the most commonly-accessed files), giving you the boost you're looking for.
I have virtual machines running off an external 7200rpm hard drive connected to a laptop with eSATA.
Multiple VM's, if started up and shut down frequently, might spread out the reads and writes too much to allow the hybrid drive to make much of a difference.
I'm not sure how intelligent or aggressive the caching mechanism is on these drives, but as far as I understand it, the longer you use a drive, the more accurate the caching algorithm would be at keeping the right files in flash cache.
Performance metrics from http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/index.php/site/comments/seagate_momentus_xt_500gb_hybrid_ssd/ suggest that for a single VM, the performance increase is definitely there.
Hybrid drives attain their speed boosts by caching frequently-used sectors of the hard drive into flash memory, speeding up reads.
Hybrid drives provide increased performance when there's a segment of the drive which is commonly accessed, and therefore which can be cached in flash.
I would suspect that for a single vm, that would be faster, but for multiple VMs, each time a VM got started it would flush out most of the flash cache back to disk anyway.
