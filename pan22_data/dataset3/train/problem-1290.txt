That said, I have Cox High Speed, and sometimes, I get a completely different IP's when i reset my modem.
If you're using a public proxy, then your external IP is fixed by the hot-spot provider, so it's not at all under your control.
To change your external IP without a proxy you would have to disconnect from and reconnect to your ISP.
At which point, you may get a new IP address from your ISP, tho it may be in the same range.
A proxy/VPN server is the only solution, where your external IP is then fixed by the provider (never by yourself).
Your operating system itself can't change this one.
However, a good proxy/VPN service doesn't need to be slow, especially if you use a commercial solution where you pay for speed.
You may be able to unplug your router/cable/dsl modems and let it sit anywhere from 2-20 minutes, then plug it back in.
Again, the site offers clients for Windows and Mac.
The IP you get through DHCP is just your internal one, normally something like 192.168.x.x, not the external one.
With DHCP, you're not going to be able to control the IP address you're going to receive.
As you're on a public wifi network, you have no control over this.
The external IP address normally changes when the modem/router is rebooted.
For an Ubuntu solution, see How to using UltraVPN service from GNU/Linux.
For an Ubuntu solution, some text editing is required, as described in Hotspot Shield with Ubuntu and using the Hotspot Shield for iPhone Website.
If these are not enough, then quite a few commercial solutions exist with guaranteed bandwidth for prices starting from as low a $5 per month.
