To access your files, select your rene user folder and press Command I.
I'm puzzled: today I have tried to to connect to to my Mac at the office.
So I connected using my local admin account and succeeded.
Once you've recovered all the files you want from the rene folder, remember to go to Disk Utility and run Permission Repair to restore the directory to the default permissions.
Go to the permissions and sharing section, click on the little lock icon, enter your password, and add your logged-in user as having full read and write access.
Once you've done that, you can follow the procedure I listed above.
Main issue is: the network user has files on disk that are extremely important.
You should now have full access to all of that user's files.
Then, click on the little gear icon underneath that and click Apply Recursively (or something like that).
(When you type, you will not see any password characters or anything.)
You will then be able to log in as root or System Administrator on your local computer.
It will ask you for your current user's password and then for a new root password twice.
To do so I use my company's active directory user account (this account has admin permissions on the Mac).
