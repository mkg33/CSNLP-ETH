But why my routing table is not giving the same result without network bridge?
To share the internet connection in the local network I need to connect wlan0 and eth0 by network bridge.
I have the internet access, hence the routing table contains entries, that all outward packets should be passed through wlan0, hence packets that come from local network as well as generated by me should be passed through wlan0.
Often in the context of software "network bridging" you must explicitly allow traffic to pass.
This is not the same as routing, in routing the computers on the ETH0 LAN would have a different network address (be on a different IP subnet) to the computers on the WLAN0 segment.
A network bridge connects two parts of a network together.
Bridging is a layer-2 function (it works on MAC addresses)
Some desktop operating systems can do this but they need to be configured to forward packets across LAN segments.
For example my computer is connected to a local network throught eht0 and to the Internet throught wlan0.
In that case the couputer would have to perform routing not bridging.
Routing tables only apply to routing, not bridging.
If other computers on the eth0 LAN and other computers on the WLAN0 network use the same network address and subnet mask then you do inded need to bridge the two segments.
Notice in the above sample fxp0 and fxp1 are connected using the bridge0 interface.
The network bridge is often an additional interface that must be turned on.
I'm trying to understand network bridging (not hardware but software implementation), but get some misunderstanding.
Bridging links two parts of a single LAN, each part uses the same IP network address (i.e they are the same IP subnet).
Routing is a layer-3 function (it works on layer-3 addressing such as IP-addresses)
