Basically it seems that to connect one's Mac to the Synology NAS, you have to provide an IP address.
Or you connect to your router and in the router you configure a so-called static DHCP mapping (refer to the manual of your router for how to do that) so the router always assigns the same ip-address to the Synology.
The instructions are pretty straightforward but there is one unsettling part: search for "Enter the address of your NAS server."
Static DHCP mapping is the method I use for my devices:
First of all, they don't explain how to determine the IP address of your Synology NAS.
I found the instructions here: https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Backup_Restore/How_to_back_up_files_from_Mac_to_Synology_NAS_with_Time_Machine
Through this utility you can also connect to the web-based management interface of the NAS and (in case the NAS isn't setup yet) push the latest firmware version to the NAS.
Doesn't that mean that your Mac's connection to the Synology NAS would break whenever either the router or the NAS is restarted, since it is based on this IP address?
Synology provides a utility called SynologyAssistant (Windows and MacOS) that shows you all Syno devices connected to your network and their ip-addresses.
I am considering buying the Synology DiskStation DS115j after discussion at my previous question (how can NAS work if it is not connected to Internet?).
Second of all, a bigger concern is that if I'm not mistaken, that IP address can change whenever the NAS reconnects to the router (for example, if you restart your router).
Try find.synology.com from a browser and it should find the NAS for you.
When you get into the NAS you can configure the ip-address to a static fixed ip-address.
Before I did that, I wanted to read through instructions about how to set it up with Mac's Time Machine, to make sure it would be easy.
