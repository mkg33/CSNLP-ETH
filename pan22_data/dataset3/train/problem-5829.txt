This was no issue in QEMU/KVM from the commandline; the VM shared the connection with the host and everything was great.
I just wanted an easier time of things so I decided to migrate everything to virt-manager.
I have been running Windows 10 in a VM for a number of months now (it is a requirement for school).
I am on a laptop, so the only way I connect to the Internet is over Wi-Fi.
I got tired of not being able to easily do things like pass USB devices, not having properly configured Spice settings, etc.
Is there any way to get virt-manager to work with the wifi adapter in my card?
Currently running Debian 9 'Stretch' Stable branch
When I select my wireless adapter it is also listed as a macvtap, which brings up a warning saying this won't work properly, and then refuses to do anything else.
I am not sure if this is the correct forum for this question but here it goes anyway.
I did write a script, but it seemed like the 3 computers I share this VM on (Gentoo, Debian, and openSUSE Tumbleweed) all had different configurations for their QEMU setups, which made my script useless.
Even if someone has a good tutorial on how to get spice working or something where I could fix the script (which works) so my VM has the proper screen resolution would count as a win.
I read somewhere that it is not possible to share the connection on a wifi card, which does not seem right since, like I mentioned, it worked when I would launch the VM from the command line with QEMU.
I did get it to work with a USB wifi adapter, but if I forget it at home one more time I'm going to go insane.
This is the script I made that launches the VM when I do it manually:
