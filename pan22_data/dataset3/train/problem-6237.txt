Also send out free copies to review sites or lone reviews (individuals) If they like your game they may put it up and if you get lucky and get onto something like kotaku.com your sales could be greatly improved.
Two more sites for promoting are http://www.gametunnel.com/ and http://www.gamerelease.net/
I would create a post in several forums that I know of -
There is a ton of activity and you can post your game, mod or add-on.
It doesn't HAVE to be on the web, though this isn't going to be as effective.
Aside from that, I would get active on http://www.moddb.com.
If you sign up on gamedev.net and pay a yearly fee one of the perks is listing your projects in their showcase - http://www.gamedev.net/community/gds/.
Dont forget you can also write a press release, there are many sites out there that let you publish them for free, then many companies have the chance of seeing your press release.
Visit www.altergamer.com - I'm the admin&manager there, use the contact form and give us some details - if we are interested, we will be happy to review your game.
There's also word of mouth - distributing it to friends, work colleagues, family.
There's also forum signatures for most general use forums; especially gaming forums.
Gamedev has a board on it's forum for game announcements (the Your Announcements board), which is pretty active.
On the other hand, it's a gurantee that someone will play it.
If you're working on something really really slick, you might want to think about writing in to some of these websites and see if they would write a post / review your game.
We are strong supporters of new and fairly ambitious projects.
