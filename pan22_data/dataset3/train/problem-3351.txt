The shareware PC Port Forwarding is all there is for redirecting outgoing traffic with an easy to use GUI under Windows.
The product you are looking for is NetCat and does exactly what you need.
Is there a way to filter all traffic going TO port 80, so that it instead goes to 3128 (squid HTTP proxy)?
I recognize this doesn't answer your question, but you should really put a real firewall/router appliance in place to do this: I would recommend either pfSense or Smoothwall.

As far as I know, Microsoft has not exposed the IP stack in such a way you can add custom routes/translations without writing a custom driver to sit in the network stack.
For other browsers, such as firefox, you may need to configure the proxy settings independently.
Assuming my Windows (xp, vista, 2003, 2008, or windows 7) computer is connected directly to the internet and has no router in between...
I found this port mapping software, but you need another computer because it can't redirect outgoing requests.
This article from Microsoft ( http://support.microsoft.com/kb/819961 ) discusses configuring a proxyserver for the system.
If it has to be a Windows box for whatever reason, your best bet is ISA Server - though typically it handles in-bound routing better so this may not even be possible.
