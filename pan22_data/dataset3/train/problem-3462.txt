I've had to learn the hard way that dedup might be great in theory, but doesn't work out for me in practice.

When playing with the zfs and zpool commands on whatever OS and version, it always makes sense to refer to the manpage or zfs help command of the system you're currently on (and not to some possibly outdated guide).
For example, ZFS in Solaris 11 has encryption, whereas OpenIndiana does not implement this (yet).

By the way: Here's a more recent version of the Oracle Solaris ZFS Administration Guide (targeting Solaris 11).

When it comes to the general concepts, though, both "forks" of ZFS are still very similar.

Not necessarily in the best order, and by no means complete, but thought it might make a good addition for anyone hitting this question:
See the zfs upgrade -v and zpool upgrade -v commands to see the ZFS version history and the version you're on.
Once you've had dedup enabled for a large dataset for a while, it can become very hard to go back to non-dedup land.
If deduplication is one of the features you're interested in (as most ZFS beginners are), I'd advise you to read this excellent blog post on ZFS dedup first, before making any premature plans.

The YouTube links especially require a little filtering on your own, but many from those hits are related to ZFS or speak to it, at least on the first page or so of returns.
A customer just asked me for this, so I compiled a short list of links I have found useful over the years.

One more thing you have to be aware of is that ZFS exists in various versions.
Due to Oracle's shiny new closed source policy, some features that exist in Solaris 11 did not make it into OpenIndiana.
