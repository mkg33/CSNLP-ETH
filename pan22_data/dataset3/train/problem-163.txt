I've got an interesting problem to solve with the printer on our network - we have a network of Windows 7 clients connecting to a Windows Server 2008, and we use group policy to assign our colour printer (a RICOH Aficio MP C2050) to the clients, which works fine.
It will then revert to black and white for the next session.
I can't see a way to set printer settings in the group policy editor - does anyone know if this is possible?
I was changing the printer settings on the printers connected to the server itself, not in the print queue admin... all is well now it seems, thanks for your replies!
What I usually do (modern 2008+ might have better ways) is set the default setting to black and white (you do that on the print server printer default settings) which will get used by connecting clients.
I agree with Oskar on this one, I think the easiest way would be to create two print queues and to deploy them via the GPO.
In the Print Queue you should be able to open the printer head into advanced and then the button for printing default, depending on the driver/printer they should be an option for greyscale/black and white.
Then instruct the users that to print in colour, they have to explicitly set the printer to do that (as they wouldn't normally print in colour so it's simple exception handling).
If it can't be done in the group policy editor, then perhaps a login script could solve the problem?
However, to try and save toner, what I would like to do is assign the same printer twice to the clients, once as it is, defaulting to colour, and another where it would default to black and white.
I've also tried to find black-and-white only drivers for the printer but haven't been able to either.
But your way should work as well if you set up two print queues on the server for the same printer, and use different printer default settings?
