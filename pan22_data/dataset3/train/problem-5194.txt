VAOs/VBOs are not mandatory in compatibility profile OpenGL
I have this code where I can draw as many rectangles I want without no VAO/VBOs warm up.
Basically, are vao/vbo usefull only for loading data into the shaders, since I'm gonna need constant data, wouldn't be better to premake the shaders and use them whenever I need them, or do I need to do it the VAO way.
If it were core profile it would be illegal for glDrawElements to source it's data from a client memory array, and drawing would fail.
Aside from sourcing vertices via gl_VertexId, in a more general sense VAOs/VBOs are not needed in this case because:
A buffer object would have to be created, and a VAO would be necessary to contain the ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER binding.
I've understood that VBOs are basically buffers that hold different kind of data that will be sent to the GPU.
In the compatibility profile VAOs and VBOs are not needed because the compatibility profile provides other ways of drawing, including:
How can we be certain that this is compatibility profile OpenGL?
It's only in core profiles that the requirement to use VAOs/VBOs was introduced.
Also when I'm looking to change the layout origin to upper left it logs me that it needs input data oO..
