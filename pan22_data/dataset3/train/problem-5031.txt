If you have them on the same server, consider moving the distributor to it's own server.
I have an MS SQL 2000 server that uses transactional replication and a request to user System Monitor and check if replication is doing ok and not affecting performance of the server.
Any tips on what counters to chose from, how to interpret them, any good links in this direction ?
Several of the agents have a Delivery Latency counter which will tell you if the replication is behind or not.
The high number of VLFs were caused by the log expanding over time using too small a growth increment (so we probably had external file fragmentation issues too).
If they are separate then there shouldn't be a lot of load on the publisher.
The higher the number (you'll have to see what your environment produces) the further behind your subscribers are.
We've had replication performance issues caused by too many VLFs (virtual log files) within the Publisher's transaction log causing internal fragmentation.
Check these articles for further details and how to resolve the issue if your environment is affected:
Replication should have a huge number of specific counters to choose from.
You can check the number of VLFs by running DBCC LOGINFO against the Publisher database.

As for effecting performance on the server if your distributor is running on the publisher that can cause performance issues, especially if you have a lot of Subscribers that will impact the load on the publisher.
