As I understand it, in SPDY push the server serves up an HTML doc, looks at it before sending it, and decides I need images/css resources X Y and Z, so sends them over as well.
Or is there basically no point in trying to cache static resources if your clients are using spdy/3 browsers?
Go and node spdy implementations allow you to play with server push.
According to the resources on the Chromium developer website this is one of the disadvantages.
AFAIK nginx/apache modules don't yet have this features.
How does it know to not bother, if they're already cached by my browser?
That way you will achieve a very high efficiency and first page loads will effectively look as repeated visits with cache due to server push.

It is not possible for the server to know whether the client already has the resource so it could be a wasted transfer.
I hope they add it soon based on application-provided headers or similar.
If you really need to optimize the first page load time:
(Obviously not every client will be, but i'm interested for this case)
