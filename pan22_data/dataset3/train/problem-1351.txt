Example (I named the scrip search.bat and placed a file named a.txt in C:\Program Files)
If you want to include the subfolders inside that folder, you can use -foldername:(C:\Path)
Usage: file.bat file_to_be_searched.extension "C:\directory\not\to\search"
For each line (all characters) of the output of the command dir /b /ad C:\, which lists the directories in C:\, do:
If you want to search the folders in a different location you'll have to adapt the script.
If the folder name is unique (at least in regards to the area being searched) you can just use the folder name like so: -folder(Program Files)
A way to do this inside the Windows search is by using -folder(C:\Path).
If wanting a program, I would recommend AgentRansack by MythicSoft.
You can adapt the script so it doesn't search multiple directories, adding more if statements.
Note the "" in the directory, you must use it for the script to work.
: I forgot to mention, this will only search the folder on root, that is, C:\.
It's kind of a hassle to work with directory names that have a space in it such as C:\Program Files so it's not a simple script, but here it is, worked for me in Windows 7:
Alternatively, if you don't want to use a third-party software, you can indeed do this by command-line.
It is free, fast, and powerful, with a small footprint.
