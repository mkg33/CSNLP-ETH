I know that my hard drives are still intact, because I created a partition on my Data drive, which is NOT my normal boot drive (C:).
If you are using a desktop, this is generally done with a jumper on the motherboard.
My question is: How do I enter the BIOS without a keyboard or USB device?
: I also have no ability to type into the grub > prompt.
And here are three problems that cause me to drive insane:
Though, the trouble actually started when I disabled the Secure Boot option in the BIOS, but since I have no way to enter the BIOS, I cannot re-enable this feature.
During the installation, my PC just randomly crashed, and booted into
The one thing you can try is to clear the CMOS settings, this should work as long as Secure Boot On is the default option.
If you are using a laptop, you should find a coin-cell battery that, when disconnected, should clear CMOS.
Since you don't have any ability to type anything, you're pretty much out of luck.
So today I tried installing Ubuntu 17.10.1 alongside Windows, using the free tool called Wubi.
I hope there is a solution suitable for my problem.
