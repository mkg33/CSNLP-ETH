Disable DNS lookups on the server by editing /etc/ssh/sshd_config and making sure "UseDNS" is set to "no".
Run "service ssh reload" (or whatever causes your ssh daemon to reread the config), then try again.
It's usually in /var/log/auth.log (Debian/Ubuntu) or /var/log/secure (RedHat/CentOS).
It seems that I could bypass the issue by forcing a login name like so.
If it's because of a saved key, you should be able to delete it from your ~/.ssh directory in the known_hosts file.
Another thing you might check is looking at the contents of /etc/hosts on the server to make sure that nothing is wrong there.
Incidentially, it doesn't happeen to finally prompt you after a long period of time, does it?
you have free disk space on your client (and on your server)?
I guess it was just a "glitch with OS X's DNS lookups" and it was expected to be tolerated...if someone else had this problem and solved it I'd love to know about it.
I have had problems where on OS X the hostname lookup acts like it fails; the connection just times out from waiting so long, or when the prompt does come up it's been waiting so long it gives about ten seconds for you to enter a password before dropping the connection.
Essentially, the client is doing the reverse DNS on the server, or vice versa.
Any problems with connecting usually are logged there.
On the other hand, it should give a warning when the host doesn't match what's recorded.
Just find the entry and delete it then it should prompt you again.
I never could trace it despite people suggesting adding the host in question to the host file.
