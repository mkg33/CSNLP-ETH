Several years ago, I purchased a Catalyst 4506 at a business liquidation, and it's been merrily humming along running my office network (I know it's tremendous overkill, but as I was the only bidder on it, it was only $75 in 2010).
I can't find a descent description of the consequences of this.
It also came with some other cards with GBICs, but I've never used those.
Recently I decided to look into adding a WS-X4448-GB-RJ45 48-port 10/100/1000 card, but it says that the GB bandwidth is shared with 8 ports.
From what I gather, essentially only one port can use the full 1Gb at a time through the fabric, but what happens if two ports in the same block are communicating (like 1 <-> 2 @ 1Gb), do they get full speed?
Also, if several ports in a single block are trying to push 1Gb, what is the effect on the speed?
I could see this having consequences for VOIP, so I want to make sure.
I'm not keen on upgrading to a 4506E, since I doubt I can find one for $75.
Are they all throttled to like 1/n, or do they take turns at 1Gb?
Anyway, thus far, I've been able to teach myself enough to make it work for everything we need, including updating the system over TFTP, and I added a WS-X4248-RJ45V PoE card.
It came with Supervisor IV, and two WS-X4148-RJ 48 port 10/100 line cards.
