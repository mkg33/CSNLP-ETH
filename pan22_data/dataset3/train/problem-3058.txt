Used to compare online algorithms with the performance offline algorithms.
In Page replacement algorithm, one method overweights the other by less page missing.
Less page missing illustrates "less running time".
You can add randomness to your algorithm, and combine it with all of the above.
Besides, competitive analysis is a method to compare
Bijective analysis is a way to compare two algorithms (Spyros Angelopoulos, Pascal Schweitzer: Paging and list update under bijective analysis.
I have two more for the list, which are somewhat similar.
J. ACM 60, 2013): Roughly, Algorithm A is better than Algorithm B on inputs of length n if there is a bijection f of the inputs of length n such that A performs on input x at least as good as B on f(x).
Then you will get, e.g., worst-case expected running time (worst-case instance, but averaged over all possible sequences of random coin flips in the algorithm) and worst-case running time with high probability (again, worst-case instance, but probability over the random coin flips in the algorithm).
A good reference book is "ONLINE COMPUTATION AND COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS" from Allan Borodin.
