Of course, the best thing is to not need console access at all.
The source code and binary is long missing from the site, so I uploaded an archive I had to Launchpad: RemoteUnlock on Launchpad.
From your story, it sounds like the user deduced that her computer had been messed with by IT, rather than having been informed.
Chances are that a note that said something like "I'm sorry, but we were forced to log you off of your computer in order to perform some required maintenance.
Fiddling with belongings, changing anything that didn't absolutely need to be changed, etc -- all big no-nos.
Administrators not being able to dismiss a locked screen without logging the user out is one of the worst GUI decisions that Microsoft made with Windows.
And don't email it; leave it on a PostIt stuck in the middle of the monitor.
I could also build a steady rapport with the user which helped to defuse those sorts of situations.
The simple rule that I always followed was to respect that you were, in effect, entering someone's personal space, and to act accordingly.
When you do need console access to click one button, you always have to weigh the unknown impact of shutting down all of the user's running programs against what you need to accomplish.
I think the most important thing is to leave a note.
Signed, IT" would have at least ameliorated the situation.
You need to inform them that something has changed before they notice that something has changed.
I also liked to have the user around, so I could explain what I was doing and ask permission to do anything that would persist beyond my presence there (including logging off, etc).
This question is about when you do need access, but you should make sure your admins have as many tools and as much knowledge as possible about remote administration to avoid needing console access.
Fortunately, someone created a way to get around this, called RemoteUnlock.
