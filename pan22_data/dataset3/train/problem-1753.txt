You will need to change your default web browser in Win 10   from Edge to something else.
SBIE Beta v5 does not support Windows Metro Apps or the Edge browser at   this time.
Be mindful that this is a Beta version and may have bugs and/or errors.

Every time I try to start a program in a sandbox, I get the following error.
I understand that Sandboxie requires extensive work in order to function when a new version of Windows is made, but I have seen Sandboxie work on Windows 10 with Firefox, and that is what I am trying to sandbox.
SBIE 2204   Cannot start sandboxed service RpcSs (-1) cycling every 30 seconds.
I have uninstalled and reinstalled Sandboxie multiple times with no luck.
The latest Beta version (5.01.3) of Sandboxie should work on Windows 10.
