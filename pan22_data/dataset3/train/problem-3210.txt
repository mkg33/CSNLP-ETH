This would also probably be a good match for your sister, since Amazon basically ships anywhere and also has tons of other goods besides books.
I bought my dad an Amazon gift card certificate for father's day.
For gadgets and geeky stuff in general, a ThinkGeek.com gift certificate could also be a good option.
The gift certificate will let her micro-loan the money to someone in another third world country who needs for money for their business.
I've been participating for two years now, and it's very rewarding to know the money is being put to good use, over and over again.
Send her an email Christmas card telling her that you've put money towards a gift that will be waiting for her when she returns home to visit.
Gift certificates can be given in multiples of $25, and are truly 'web only'.
check http://ircalc.usps.gov and wonder that you actually can send small cell phone in padded envelope to Siberia for about $6-10 only.
Since your sister is in a third world country, she would probably enjoy the giving aspect of the gift.
Over time, the business owner will slowly pay the money back, and at that time your sister can choose to take the money out of Kiva, or re-loan again.
I know it's delayed gratification, but she is an adult...
Buy a subscription to a electronic news, book, or audio service like New York Times Reader, O'Reilly Safari, or Audible.
How about sending her a $25 gift certificate to Kiva.org?
