You can then run you command with my_command_exec %expanded_list%
Instead, I used mingw's 'ls' to dump the list to a file, then replaced newlines with spaces, copied and pasted into cmd.
Enclose pattern with quotation marks if it includes spaces.
Maximum size of cmd variable is 8191 characters  (XP onwards), so it's possible to overflow it!
I had to pass 100 files in a directory to a program, and couldn't type *.ext.
I suspect the answer will be no, but has anyone dealt with this or come up with any way to make this easier?
Put it in batch file and run with myBatchFile name myPattern.
You cannot count on the utility to always give you complete list.
If that is the case, then this might do the trick for you:
This is old, but with the Linux subsystem for windows, its pretty common to have bash in your PATH now.
Occasionally, the cmd shell's inability to expand wildcard paths can really be an inconvenience.
This will give you a list and also put it in variable named expanded_list.
On the other hand, maximum cmd line length is also 8191 so you would not be able to execute it anyway.
