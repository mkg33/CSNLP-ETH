Copying the DLLs into the same folder resolved the problem.
also ms has several app compatibilty updates to r2, so if you haven't hit windows update and download.
Make sure that you have the 32 bit sql server client installed and functioning properly.
I had the same problem, but Ricardo Pardini's hint with Process Monitor was the solution, I found out that the service (even at the time of just installing it) was looking for a dbExpress DLL which was not in the application directory nor in the search path.
Old Delphi applications can benefit a lot from this.
It's probably trying to read something from the 64 bit version of windows rather than the 32 bit version of windows.
also can you run the app directly without the /install parameter?
If it's just a POS (Plain Old Service ;) ) you can follow the instructions here http://support.microsoft.com/kb/251192 to manually install it as a service.
That way you will get around a failing install routine if the application itself works.
You can also try to run it using the compatibility mode.
Other than that post the appcrash which should tell you which DLL to put in wow32.
Without access to the application or any trace why it might crash I can only offer some general ideas for what might help.
