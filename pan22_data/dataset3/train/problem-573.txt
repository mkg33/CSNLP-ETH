However, doing that, I get the following error message, right after it finishes copying:
The easiest for me has always been to use a dedicated external harddrive, and just format it as Mac OSX only.
The asr command line suggested does not work under Mavericks, at least not in my case.
I've downloaded Mac OS X Mountain Lion today and wanted to backup the installation image to a USB drive for later.
I've created a new empty partition of at least 8 GB size on the external drive using Disk Utility, and tried to restore the InstallESD.dmg image to this new partition, via the Restore menu.
I was able to get around the Cannot allocate memory error by simply mounting the .dmg and having it mounted when I do the restore.
Sure its annoying not to be able to swop files with a PC but i think the drive you put your disk image on shouldn't be used for general storage, it should be stashed safely in a safe.
To verify if it worked, go to System Preferences Â» Startup Disk, and check if your installer appears:
In your terminal, enter the following line, but replace the path to your OS X installer image and the target partition:
Now, you can boot into the installer from your USB drive too.
Now, you should get output similar to the following:
It could be that there is a checksum mismatch for the disk image, or you experienced a bug in Disk Utility.
(I get the error message File copy is not supported anymore.
You can try to use the asr command-line utility to copy the image yourself.
