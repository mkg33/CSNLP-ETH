Sometimes, if the application is possible to install via GPO, the deployed MSI installer will replace the version installed using other methods.
To avoid going around to each user station, I was curious if there was a way to uninstall a specific application at a specific location using a GPO.
In this case, it's possible to remove the application by first installing it.
All user PCs at my office have what we will call Application 1 installed.
Therefore I will need to uninstall Application 1 first.
This application is installed at the same location on all PCs.
It was NOT installed via a GPO, but was installed manually while the computer was being set up for the user.
The company I work at is switching the applications they use in Operations due to a recent upgrade in hardware equipment.
We are planning to replace Application 1 with Application 2 at some point, but they cannot coincide on the same PC at the same time.
If the application wasn't installed with Group Policy then it can't be uninstalled with Group Policy... unless you can script the uninstall and set that script as a startup or logon script.
