I struggled for some time with this exact same problem.
I got a hint at doing it by the comments on this page Video Streaming with Flask
Well i've same issue, add camera.close() and work!
I've verified it by running the exact code with the debug flag set to True (and I get the mmal error) and set to False and everything works as expected.
Flask alone in a seperated app handling the camera only => nice streaming.
So even with one python process handling flask and threads, the camera crash.
My first assumption based on the Failed to enable connection: Out of resources (other than memory) part is that the pi was was not receiving enough power.
I am trying to create a live streaming camera with my Raspberry Pi and the Pi Camera module.
I'm suspecting flask to have clever thread/gevent in background which causes this.
I have chosen to create it with Flask so that I can use the Python API for it.
I got a several threads application using opencv and picamera.
So I got a 5V - 2.5A micro USB power adapter instead of the 5.1V - 1A adapter that I was using and it still shows this error.
I believe that I've solved it, though I have to be honest, I don't understand exactly why it works.
