If you still need this MD5 and/or SHA1 check sum generation functions, then you can have a look at what I was able to do so far: https://github.com/kwilczynski/puppet-functions
If you're not fixed on MD5 hashes, you could use the sha1 function.
It shouldn't be to difficult to create your own function:
So from a high-level what I'd want is something like md5("http://$environment/$url").
As per what  @tore said, it is actually not that hard to write these little functions and extend Puppet DSL a little.
This files contains the function for sha1 which can be used in Puppet DSL.
If you know a little programming, maybe you can submit a patch to the Puppet team to add support for MD5 ?
Otherwise you have to write your own function or you use the Ruby manifests (rather than the Puppet DSL) which are supported since Puppet 2.6.0.
Is there a built in function like Crypt::MD5 that I can use?
I would like to name a file based on a MD5 sum of certain characters.
I hope you will find some of these functions handy :)
