take out items by disabling them (such as hdmi on your lcd's etc)
Hitting scroll-lock switches me to the correct one.
I switched the keys to numkeys, which is just my own preference - you may have your own choice.
Setting up a batch file to run NirCmd was the easiest way for me, using the setdefaultsounddevice command, ie:
I prefer this as I only need to change my sound output if it is set to the incorrect selection.
It is possible for them to get out of sync as there is no check(need a command to get the current default device).
I modified Bob's answer to also change the active microphone; useful for me since I have wireless USB headphones that are both an audio device and a listening device, but I just recently got Windows 10 where it can be useful to have my webcam listening for "Hey, Cortana...".
The following script allows you to create a shortcut on the desktop that toggles between two devices.
For each function, on the second SysListView321 line, enter the index of the microphone you want to use, similarly to the audio device.
The icon and script name toggle to reflect the current device.
Auto Hotkey script as a toggle using the scroll-lock key.
The only problem - I cant figure out how to switch between more than 2 audio devices with just 1 key.
This is an old question, but I ended up spending some time on it to get what I wanted.
I am using this simple autohotkey script with nircmd utility.
Most games need to be restarted if you want to change the sound output.
The script may need modifying for the correct device names and uses nircmd which needs downloading.
Very useful if i am already loading a game and realize it is wrong.
