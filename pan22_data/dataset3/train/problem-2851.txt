It's becoming a real hassle to manage the video files on my network drive.
You could try running something like psexec to initiate the copy command from the remote computer.
Your computer is the medium over which the files will be copied.
Instead of copying the file locally, the network computer sends the file to my remote computer, which sends it back to the same network computer.
This means the files are being transferred over the network completely unnecessarily.
Time passed, and the need for a Windows NetWare client emerged, and NCOPY went away.
Moving the file doesn't incur the penalty, just copying.
Which is to say, anything written in the last 20 years behaves like that.
Note: This is the case with both Windows and Linux (using Samba) network folders.

Everything else in the known world works the way John and joe described.
I noticed that copying a large file from one location on a network drive to another location on the same network drive takes much longer than copying it locally.
On a trivial historic note, w-a-y back at the dawn of corporate networking, when NetWare was King, Token Ring was common, and Ethernet generally involved coax of some kind, Novell ran into this problem.
Like a Move, it was pretty fast (compared to copy).
The NCOPY command theoretically told the server to copy a file from point A to point B instead of what the DOS COPY command did, which was copy the file over the network to memory before writing it out over the network again on the new location.
