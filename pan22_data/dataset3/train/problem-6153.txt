If none of those techniques worked, and it was my system, I would cut my losses and build a new system... so I had something to work with, then in my leisure time replace components in the failing system until it works, then sell the refurbished system.
There might be a huge dust collection in your computer if you haven't cleaned it regularly.
I suggest running SpeedFan or a similar utility to monitor the temperature of your components (and make sure you fans are running).
Are the fans correctly running to evacuate hot air from the CPU and from the case?
If you're still having problems, try running a burn-in test (a bootable CD that goes through and exercises your CPU, GPU, RAM).
If that doesn't indicate any particular problems, Brian's suggestion of blowing out the dust is a good idea.
I have had some cases where the fan (were in power supply and cpu) was blocked by dust bunnies.
How can you tell the power supply is stable and tested?
Hopefully, it will crash again and identify the failing component.
If you're getting CMOS error messages, it's worthwhile to check if the CMOS battery is misbehaving.
If it crashes seemingly randomly, then it's probably a motherboard or power supply issue.
It could be that the CPU fan/radiator is not correctly attached and thus the CPU is not cooled correctly.
