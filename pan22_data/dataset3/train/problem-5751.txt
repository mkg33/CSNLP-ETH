You could try pinging the broadcast address and see who responds.
I have a Belkin Universal Repeater that is behaving badly, so I factory reset the repeater.
Another thing that can help is if anyone have any download link to the Belkin "Wireless Range Extender Management Utility".
I have tried changing my gateway address to either IP to no avail.
You'll want to make sure you're in the right subnet from your workstation
This is most likely caused by invalid settings that I have.
On the pre-reset setting, the router was set to 192.168.1.1, and from the user manual, the default is 192.168.2.254.
If the device is reachable and responds to arp requests, then you can try to use "arp -a" in Windows to get a look at the ARP cache which maps your IP's to MAC addresses.
Found the utility that will "find" the device (as well the information on IP address).
Usually the device will look for a dhcp server or for a gateway of some kind, and you can figure out what its IP is from there.
My problem right now, I can't connect to the router web management page.
I do have information about the MAC address of the router.
But the most sure fire way will likely be the Wireshark route from David.
I am currently wired to the router, but don't have any information about gateway (router) IP nor subnet mask used.
What I've done in situations like that is to isolate the device and a computer on a single switch, then run Wireshark or the like to snoop what packets are being emitted by the device as it powers up.
Is there a way to find out what is a router IP address from it's MAC address?

I seem to have misplaced the CD that comes with the package.
This device is a real pain to work with, avoid at all cost.
