Note: gcache used to store only writesets in circular buffer style.
So at the peak time of the system execute those queries that you said in your question.
Note: In my opinion for more certainty add 20% more to writesets data bytes per minute.
In this case for example consider 12 MB instead of 10 MB.
My question is, will running the select sleep(60) in production block all reads on MySQL (by keeping the mysqld thread busy)?
How can i calculate the best gcache value in production?
Well, now you can decide How much time you want to keep changes to server.
In the post, the talk about doing the following to get the values needed for the calculation:
After that use this formula to find writesets data bytes per minute
When you execute Sleep function, it only block current session and not related to another sessions.
I was trying ti figure out how to calculate the right gcache for my server and came across the following post discussing just how to do that:
For example if writesets data is 10 MB per minutes and you plan to keep changes data to 24 hours you need to set gcache size to 14400 MB.
Usually a service have a Peak time that users have huge interactive to it.
