The ALU has the function of performing an operation on two numbers.
Modern CPUs are probably too complex for me to even say how many potentially final, sub ALUs are actually at the end of the unit.
The answer assumes the ALU will finally complete the process from two inputs and a sole output.
Going deeper, to the threshold of execution where the process results in the product, we'll see it end at the arithmetic logic unit.
I used computers as a analog for us; consciousness is the product of the process of information which comes from memory.
In the CPU core, if the process is the execution of the procedure, we know the processor is working the data from its register memory.
I've occasionally thought about this from a philosophical perspective by trying to apply it to humans in order to think about our experience of some process.
So, that's why I say yes, if our view is limited here, there's only one process in memory at a time.
This isn't an answer to the question, but I hope to get you thinking about the different levels and types of memory, and remembering that there's a physical machine at the bottom of it all.
That wasn't helpful for me, but I think it applies to your question because in a simple case, the answer would be yes.
