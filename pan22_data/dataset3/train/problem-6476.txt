Well, unless the machine is under your desk, having to get up and walk to the server room to sit down in front of the console when you don't have to seems inefficient.
I disagree that there is a security risk of directly logging in, there's nothing more secure than physically logging into the server.
I don't know if I'd go so far as to say it's stupid, at least comparatively speaking.
I don't see any reason other than convenience for using remote desktop over the console.
There may be a few security related reasons to avoid using remote desktop, however.
Some things are better to do when you're right in front of the server, some are better from a remote command line and some are better from a remote GUI - it makes sense to have all of these tools in your arsenal, so think 'better for using RDP when appropriate' rather than 'an idiot for never using it' ;)
Also there is no more implicit risk of having remote desktop enabled for your server assuming you have correct account lock out policies and proper security for an internet enabled server in general.
But why should I just administrate it via Remote instead of directly manipulating it?
I mean, I understand that it's kind of a risk to directly log on.
