In case anyone has this problem with newest version: syb0rg answer is great but
Check what process are blocking the partition /storage to be unmounted
Otherwise you can kill that process with kill -9 $PID.
Resize the partition (this case partition 2 till the end)
OpenELEC resizes /storage on first boot after creating the SD.
In case some PID are returned you can check what process is associated with that PID running ps -ef | grep $PID.
=> “umount: can’t umount /storage: Device or resource busy”
If you see something like -sh it is your ssh session that is in the  /storage directory.
Check if these processes are in the systemd tree and are controlled by systemd.
The first code line checks for /storage/.please_resize_me file.
So... to resize storage to fill the SD you need to:
Now you can safely unmount the /storage directory via
In most of the case will be /dev/mmcblk0p2 (which is partition 2)
I tried to kill it, but everytime a new process blocked the mount.
Check with fuser -m /storage if there are still process blocking that directory.
I have to kill + umount in the same time with the pipe (in this order) :
Now you can resize the partition (I will report again since some commands are changed)
Show partitions (we alredy now which partition we want to resize)
If you want to resize /flash is a completely different story.
