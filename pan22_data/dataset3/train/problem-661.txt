If you need something a little more bare-metal there's always dd(1), but that's nowhere near as user-friendly...
There are couple limitations I don't like, such as you can't restore the image onto a smaller hard drive, even if your image only has a small amount of data, and also related, if you restore onto a larger drive, you will have a partition which is the same size as the partition you backed up.
The backup can be compressed quite small, and can be stored on a USB stick or USB hard disk for later use.
You really can't do wrong with dump(8) and restore(8).
With this DVD, you can restore the system to the point at which the mksysb snapshot was taken.
I've used System Rescue CD to make a bootable image of my machine.
I am looking for a way to make a clone of a partition on a DVD where the client will actually be able to restore the partition himself without much hassle.
The mksysb command creates an installable system image from a partition and the mkdvd command can be used to write this image out as a bootable DVD.
On most modern systems you can even send the output directly to a DVD device.
