There is actually a poorly supported protocol for doing something like that.
Your computer's temporary local address is never exposed to the outside world directly.
Any traffic destined to its home address goes to its home network, then gets tunneled to its current location.
You basically get an IP address on your "home" network (not the same meaning as a residential/home network), and your device gets a local address of the network to which it is actually connected, then it creates a tunnel between its current network and its home network.
In order to be able to connect to the outside world, you need your computer to be assigned a local IP Address from that router.
Your ISP IP address will probably be relatively stable meaningful it won't change too often, if at all.
The outside world can then 'see' your computer as having the IP Address of that router, not your own computer.
Your outside IP address is determined by your ISP or whoever's ISP you're connecting to.
You computer's IP Address is never going to be exposed to the outside world.
Some VPN services do offer static IP addresses however so that might be an option.
That will happen fairly automatically if you don't change your default settings.
Reading between the lines - as you appear to have some confusion as to how IP Addresses actually work - then the simple answer is No.
You will always be connected through some routing device somewhere - whether that's at home or in a coffee shop.
