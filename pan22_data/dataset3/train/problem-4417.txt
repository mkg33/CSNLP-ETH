Maybe I've just been using Linux too much lately but I'm really starting to hate Windows.
When I booted back into Windows, it boots right into one of the standard user accounts.
So many things seem to break with every update and what's worse is that they have been breaking in such a way that they can't be reversed like they use to be able to... rant over.
I have no way to log into the admin account, nor run an elevated cmd.
I can't run anything in the standard user account as administrator because it asks for a username and password and I only enabled the account, I didn't add a password.
I signed out of that user and tried to log in to the admin account but it only shows the one account, not the other user, nor the admin account.
I figured I should give myself an admin account so I needed to enable to built in account.
I stupidly didn't think to make sure there was another admin because I figured I could always use the built in admin account if needed.
This is on an old computer the kids use and I was tired of them getting viruses.
I think Microsoft has really been screwing it up lately in their poorly executed "Windows as a service" philosophy.
I read on how to fix that but of course it requires admin privileges.
It won't accept a blank password and I can't add a password without elevated privileges.
However, I failed to take into account that Microsoft seems to be determined to break everything that used to work great in Windows.
I added a standard user and at the same time demoted the only other user from an admin to another standard user.
I rebooted to recovery mode and enabled the admin account via the registry.
I tried to go back into the recovery mode but now nothing works because now that I have enabled the built in admin account, it shows no admin accounts as being able to be used for recovery.
I can't get access to an admin account on Windows 10.
