It's even lower level than what @Milliways describes, the entire card including all partition information is not erased but overwritten.
That's why the first step after writing a disk image, is to expand the partition and file system, so it can reclaim the data that comes after the disk image.
Or does writing the image to the card take care of all of this?
I've downloaded my raspian disk image, and I'm going to write it to my micro sd card for use with my raspberry pi.
It doesn't matter if the card used to be FAT32 or NTFS or ext4 or just gobbledygook from /dev/random, afterwards it will contain the image data in whatever partition is used.
The first step in putting an OS on the Pi effectively erases the card and installs new partitions.
I know some of these questions may be nooby but this is my first question x)
Any data that is on the card after the size of the Raspbian disk image, will be retained BUT you'll have difficulties to access it because a) there is no more partition that contains it b) there is no more filesystem with inodes that point to the actual data.
I'm going to use Partition Image 0.6.8 to write the disk image to the card.
I absolutely hate FAT32 because of its 4gb file limit.
All OS use a small FAT as boot partition ~100MB, and most use the remainder as EXT4.
