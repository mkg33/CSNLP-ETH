As you can see, after a couple of failures, the server eventually starts and it works fine after that.
I have a need to start a script on an http get request from an external machine and I'm using Node.js for this.
I do have one thought: this machine has a static IP but it's assigned via DHCP.
If the problem is that network.target (and network-online.target) is up but the IP I'm trying to claim in the Node script is not yet assigned, presumably I need a service to wait on which will guarantee that the IP address is fully configured.
This appears to have solved the problem (which suggests my suspicions about the DHCP address not having been assigned may have been correct).
I changed the IP address the server was listening on from the specific one in the question's logs to the wildcard, 0.0.0.0.
This isn't a perfect solution (because I still don't know how to wait for the DHCP-assigned address to be available), but as it doesn't make any practical difference for this particular case, it solves the immediate problem of logged errors.
Everything is working except that it appears the the server is being started too early in the boot process:
Could this be the problem, and if so, is there a suitable service to depend on?
As well as After=network.target ..., I tried network-online.target, but it makes no difference.
