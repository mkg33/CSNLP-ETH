If you want a consistent order, feed the output through an extra sorting stage.
I have been working in UNIX/Linux since 1984/1991 respectively and the first command I was taught was find.
At the same time, what is the sorting order in which files within an individual directory are listed?
You shouldn't rely on a particular output order from find and instead should use sort and other means to specifically control the order.
Here are some helpful tips for sorting find output.
Linux/GNU has put pretty much everything you need into the current find command so play around with it.
find will be traversing the directory tree in the order items are stored within the directory entries.
and the output consists of multiple files across multiple sub-folders, what is the default order in which directories are listed?
This helps quite a bit when you need to post process the results.
At the same time within directory A, files are listed in a funny order.
See how first the contents of directory B is listed, then that of directory A.
Another way to do this without characters in the date/time string is.
what is the default sorting order for entries returned by the linux find command?
The -printf option gives you lots of options to enable more complex sorting and file info presentation.
However, some file systems will re-order directory entries as part of compaction operations or when the size of the entry needs to be expanded, so there's always a small chance the "raw" order will change over time.
This will (mostly) be consistent from run to run, on the same machine and will essentially be "file/directory creation order" if there have been no deletes.
Using -printf you can customize and delimit the results the way you want.
