So even if the collision occurs, it will not have an effect to the physics if the appropriate rotations and/or positions are "freezed"
If I try to attach a Rigidbody to one of the objects, it works, but that makes the Rigidbody object behaves weird, like going up and down, and changing its rotation.
An ad-hoc solution to this problem is to work with Triggers (eg OnTriggerEnter2D) and restrict Rigidbody constraints.
Moving an object without a rigidbody or a character controller is also not optimized and will slow your game down, you can check Is Kinematic if you don't want forces acting on it and it will still be more optimized
Otherwise you can work with the intersection of the bounds:
the problem with that is that it has to be placed in a coRoutine or inside the Update() method.
Is there a way to check for collision without having a Rigidbody attached?
I am trying to detect a collision between 2 objects, each one of them has a Collider component.
In the script I have the method OnCollisionEnter(Collision other) where I want to check if the collided object is the same as a pre-defined variable, but when they collide, nothing gets called.
Or if not, how can I make the object with Rigidbody not moving weirdly, and rotating?
if for example you want the object to move only along the 'X' axis and rotate on the 'Y' axis.
