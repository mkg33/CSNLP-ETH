I have WampServer installed, and I installed Microsoft SEO Toolkit, I guess that has the IIS dependency.
You'll want to edit the existing binding, and simply change the port number to a different one.
Now every time I start WampServer, I need to go to cmd and type iisreset /stop, or else WampServer will not get online.
press ctrl+f and search for "Listen 80", change this line to "Listen 8080" (u can change this port as what you want), and then close and save the httpd.conf file.
This will stop it from grabbing port 80 after a reboot.
Open a web browser and enter "[];, this will open the WampServer configuration page where you can configure Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
How can I remove iis or whatever to "open up" my port:80 ?
