It therefore seems that the only current recourse is to change the Optimize over adapters specified below if latency to SteelHead is more than setting higher than the number of milliseconds it takes to reach the SMC.
While this might not otherwise present a problem if it were possible to create a policy only optimizing wired adpaters using  Adapters to Optimize, the client PCs are often in an office w/ a Steelhead (and where pings and hops take >250ms to reach the SMC) but where creating a rule that would not apply to wireless adapters is impossible because the office lacks reliable wiring.
When setting policy on an SMC with reference to Location Awareness - > Latency-based location awareness -> Optimize over adapters specified below if latency to SteelHead is more than: <#> ms:
Right now, PCs with the SMC software installed are typically in locations where traceroute hops take >250ms to reach the SMC, yet the Optimize over adapters specified below if latency to SteelHead is more than setting is set to 10ms.
