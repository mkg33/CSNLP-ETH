If it is the exact same motherboard, you shouldn't have very many problems.
Should that happen, consult this knowledgebase article.
(Alternatively, disable AHCI in the BIOS by switching your SATA controller to "legacy" or "IDE" mode.)
Vista and presumably 7 handles motherboard change much better than XP.
My Vista installation survived a change from Core 2 Duo / i965 to an Athlon Dual Core / AMD690G and back without any problems.
(Advanced Host Controller Interface; used by SATA controllers to enable things like Native Command Queuing.)
Though I recently changed motherboards and didn't worry about changing to generic drivers.
You should be fine without any preparation at all - simply run it on the new system.
If it is a different motherboard following the information in that link will probably be good.
If you enable AHCI (via a BIOS setting; it may be enabled by default, but unlikely) on the new board and you were not using AHCI before, it's likely 7 will fail to boot.
Probably a lot of the hardware will redetect with their new IDs, but since all the drivers are already in place it will be fine.
One thing to beware, though, is if you're changing from non-AHCI environment to one that supports AHCI.
Keep in mind that nowadays if you significantly change the hardware windows will want you to re-validate.
In general you should be ok swapping the hardware out from under 7.
