I am exploring VBA in excel and would like to know how to get a hold of the Series and Point names from my stacked columns chart.
If you have a stacked column, you can hover over any column and excel will show you a little text box with 'Series "< series-name >" Point "< point-name >" Value: ##'.
As for making your vba run: You create a chart_mousemove event actually in the chart itself (open the chart page in the macro/vba editor (alt-F11) once you're in the chart) and then it will run each time you move the mouse over the chart.
But are you sure you need to accomplish this task with VB?
You would need to set up a hot key or button to run it.
VB is usually set up to create charts, rather than read them.
from http://www.vbaexpress.com/forum/showthread.php?43451-Chart-Series-Selected-Index will give you the selected series name.
I would like to be able to either click or hover over any column in the chart and execute VBA code to find the series and point names.
The most challenging task for me is to trigger the VBA script by a hover or mouse click and identify the active part within the active chart.

If I hover my mouse over a point in Excel 2010, the popup appears just as you want:
It's like using events in windows forms, if you've ever done that.
It's not a task with an easy answer, as you can't trigger a macro to run when clicking on plot elements.
