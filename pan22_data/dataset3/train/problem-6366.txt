Really, why aren't these defaults as I want them by default?
In our case, these built-in defaults happen to be:
default installation of phpPgAdmin "crashes" when it stumbles upon a database it has no connect privs, I had to modify the source a bit.
... that is the implicit defaults plus test1=c/test2 granted explicitly.
Is it a popular practice to run one PostgreSQL server for one app, not just one database on the server per app, even if it is a small one?
Now, it is important to note that this is not the same situation as it having no privileges granted whatsoever.
Sure, I can just REVOKE ALL [...] FROM PUBLIC after creation, but is there a way to automatize it?
And despite numerous bug reports, it's been doing so for at least six months now (I can't remember any date of the reports, but one of them stated that six months had passed).
While I have no problem with =CTc granted to owner in these defaults, I'd like not to have =Tc granted to PUBLIC.
In the latter case, the column contains just {} (which by the way displays as empty, too, in postgres=# \l, AFAIR).
