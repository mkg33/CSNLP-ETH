Throughput is the amount of data that can be transmitted during a certain amount of time.
I did a speed test at BandwidthPlace before and after connecting the VPN and didn't see any appreciable change.
Additional latency can make certain protocols perform worse.
Assuming you have a sufficiently fast processor on both ends of the device terminating the VPN, you shouldn't see much of a change in throughput at all.
I realize there are a lot of variables here, but is that figure typical?
I'm trying to troubleshoot an extremely slow file transfer (5kb/s up) to a work server over the VPN.
A network admin at work has told me that I should expect to see a transfer rate reduced by up to 55% when I am connected to the VPN at work.
Most VPNs do not really drastically change the size of the payload, and don't add that much additional overhead.
If you are trying to use CIFS over a VPN, you basically have to give up on the idea that you will be able to see your full capacity used.
What is more likely is that your VPN is simply increasing the time it takes for a packet to be transmitted from the source to the destination.
Windows file sharing (CIFS aka SMB) is extremely sensitive to latency.
An overhead of 10-15% might be reasonable, but a 55% overhead is not.
Probably the best tool to test performance is iperf.
