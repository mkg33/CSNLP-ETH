There are plenty more best-practices regarding datastores to read up on, more reasons than I can state here.
This would allow you to share the load between EX servers easily, especially as you grow.
I used the Exchange Storage Calculator and entered 150 mailboxes and a few other values and it suggested creating 4 mailbox databases.
I'm migrating from Exchange 2003 to Exchange 2010.
Spreading out your mailboxes across databases is good to keep database sizes low.
Everyone has bad users who don't know what the delete button is.
As for targeted moves, there is a way to move users into specific databases.
Users do not like being without email for the 8 hours it takes to recover a 25GB database.
I've read several places which suggest using multiple mailbox databases but don't really explain why.
If your organization is unlikely to grow, you could argue that you don't need more databases.
We used a PowerShell script to perform the migrations, which may expose a few more controls to manage this.
The 2003 mailbox database folder size is around 22 GB.
Search Microsoft for "Exchange 2010 Best Practices."
I believe you need to use Exchange 2010 tools to do the migration, and you can pick the target database.
There's a single Exchange 2003 server which isn't a domain controller, it's only running Exchange 2003.
If anything goes seriously wrong and you have to run offline utilities to get things back, you will thank yourself for keeping smaller databases.
Having multiple datastores, even a 'can behave themselves' and 'delete broken' prevents one runaway mailbox from breaking everyone's mail when the DB fills up.
However, scaliblity is a huge reason to split out your datastores.
You should really push to buy the resources to make it a cluster.)
