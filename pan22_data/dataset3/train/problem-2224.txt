Officially, the best way to do this on the Pi is the Adafruit Web IDE.
Two ssh based solutions (so you need to have sshd running on the RasPi, i.e.
As both machines are on the same network, synchronization usually takes only a few seconds.
You can make use of the KDE IO slaves to access files over ssh/ftp and many other protocols.
Unlike all the other solutions, this is recommended by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
Once it is installed, you need to install the ftp plugin.
Another method I have used in the past, although not as nice, is to install Dropbox on both the pi and your computer, and then edit on the host and have Dropbox sync the file to the pi.
The nice thing is that Dropbox will keep a copy of all the files versions over the last 30 days for you, so if you are not using a VCS, you will have access to previous versions.
I have previously used Kate (the KDE text editor) to edit files over ssh.
It sounds very much like you're asking for https://etherpad.mozilla.org/
Then you can use ftp or my fave, sftp (over ssh) to navigate the file system on the remote machine.
