You can use your normal account to get access and look around to see what's wrong.
You could log in using your linode user because the credentials are in the /etc/shadow file, but the ssh daemon was using the default settings which allow password authentication for everyone.
Since the shadow file from linode doesn't contain an entry for the vagrant user, it won't allow you to login with that credentials.
This will allow you to see any errors that are presented in the console.
From the info provided, I can only make assumptions as to what, and I'd like to avoid that.
If everything was ok, you could just reload the ssh service to pick up the new configuration (the one from your backup that disables password authentication).
However something must have gone wrong during the restore.
The reason why you couldn't log in as vagrant any more is because you backed up /etc which contains shadow.
If no errors are present, it will at least allow you to log in using the console (as opposed to SSH).
Something in /var/log will point you towards the right direction (most probably /var/log/syslog).
However, if you open the virtualbox management window with the vagrant box shut down, you will be able to start the virtual machine normally.
