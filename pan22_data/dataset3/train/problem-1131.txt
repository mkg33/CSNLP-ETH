Here's a blog post (disclosure: my blog) that describes how to use it.
The command you're after is M-x string-insert-rectangle which then prompts you for the string to insert.
Of course the cua-mode method works as well (and works similarly).
I integrate CUA mode with the following (because I prefer not to have transient mark mode):
One of the nice thing about it compared to the the C-SPC method is that you'll get visual feedback about the rectangle you're selecting.
To see the power of CUA mode it's totally worth watching this three minute video.
So you need to set the mark on the top left character in the rectangle and extend the region to the bottom right character in the rectangle.
In emacs these kind of columns are referred to as 'rectangles'.
In Emacs-24.4, the base support for rectangles has been improved a bit, so instead of using C-SPC followed by C-x r t, you can do:
The first is rectangles (as mentioned in another answer).
All these commands require that the region contains the the rectangle you are operating on.
Another option, which provides very nice rectangle/column editing commands is CUA mode.
