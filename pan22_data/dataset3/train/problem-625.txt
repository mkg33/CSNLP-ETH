It's certainly a pleasure to type on, but has caused my Mac to crash so often now that it's impractical to use if I want to get any work done at all.
If you're running Snow Leopard, don't get the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000.
The Model M class of keyboards, historically made by IBM and now by Unicomp, are incredible from an ergonomy point of view.
I've got a bunch of Kinesis ergonomic keyboards and am currently typing this (on my iMac) on a Kinesis Advantage.
Great keyboard, especially if you're suffering from RSI or similar, works fine with my Mac and even comes with Mac key caps.
There is also a native Mac driver for mapping command/ctrl/alt, hotkeys, etc., but the keyboard will still work as a standard USB device without it.
I've got a Tactile Pro 2 which is an absolute delight - apart from some key ghosting.
The MS Natural 4000 is truly the Cadillac of keyboards... pleather palmrests, good key action, extremely sturdy and well-built.
They may be able to customize what's printed on the keys for you if you ask.
If you are a serious typist, it's well worth the investment.
Nobody's recommended the Microsoft Natural line yet?
They have a PC layout, so you'll need to swap Option and Command in System Preferences on the Mac.
