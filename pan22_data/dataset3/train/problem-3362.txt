After boot of the machine you will have to initially load it with data.
There is also a bunch of software (the file-system and device-drivers) to consider that "convert" the raw RAM into something that the OS will see as disk-storage.
Saving/Reloading the RAM-disk content may be less than trivial.
RAM will always be faster than whatever peripheral bus-system (like SATA) can deliver.
Having said that: Normally it should still be several times faster as the fastest storage solution you can attach to the motherboard.
How fast a RAM-disk really will be totally depends on the quality of that software.
On shutdown of the machine you will have to save the content (if you need it for the next run).
This is something you will have to take into account, especially if you expect frequent reboots.
But when you are dealing with a RAM-disk you are not purely dealing with RAM alone.
If the system crashes you loose the RAM-disk with being to save anything.
There may be some corner-cases where specific usage-patterns will make the difference smaller or almost zero, but without more detail on what you are going to do with such a system it is impossible to say if that will apply to your situation.
