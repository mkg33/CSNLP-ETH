ASA users have been asking for this feature for a long time - it's good to finally see it delivered :-).
Find the one that meets your needs (here’s a starting point) and put it in front of your ASA.
While the ASAs do basic routing, they do not have all the capabilities of a dedicated router.
If you're using the ASA 5505, you should review the 5505 RAM requirements listed in the release notes.
Good news is that four years later (April 2014) Cisco released ASA software version 9.2(x) with new BGP support!
According to this document, the dynamic routing protocols supported by the ASA 5500 Series are:
(In the same way, Cisco routers have firewall capabilities, but nothing like what the ASAs can do.)
Cisco considers its firewalls—the ASA models—to be a separate product line from its routers.
Don't let people tell you firewalls can't do routing.
As you know, they have a huge selection of routers.
You likely want EIGRP if your network isn't too big, it is all cisco, as it is simple to set up.
Cisco can't do it, because ASA's are poor firewalls.
Which may be a substitute for whatever you are trying to do with BGP.
