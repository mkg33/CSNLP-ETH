I have already googled the message, and I have plenty of disk space available on the SVN server (it's about 4% usage of 150 GB).
You also get this error if  the disk is full, I discovered.
On the computer with the problem, try deleting manually that directory, do not commit, but update your svn in your local machine, redo the changes on that directory, it is one directory.
Eventually figured a method to do this (as well as getting everything currently unrevisioned under proper version control):
About the only difference I can see is that the broken working copy is connecting to the server by an IP address where all the others are using a server name (although this resolves over DNS to the same IP Address).
I reckon there must have been some corruption in one of the .svn files for that working copy.
I have noticed that when I try echo $TMPDIR at the command prompt on the SVN server I get nothing.

What is making this a little confusing is that I only get this message from one location when I do an svn diff (that I've tested so far) - this error is not coming up when I try from three other computers (one of which is testing against the exact same repository, the other two are different repositories on the same svn server).
I'm hoping that I don't have to scratch the broken working copy and checkout a new one - unfortunately, this is a legacy project and not all changes have been properly revisioned.
I was able to fix this problem by running the script provided here:
