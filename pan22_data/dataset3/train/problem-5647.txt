After that all you have to do to install your repository then is rpm -ivh http://repo.domain.ext/path/to/file/XXXXX.rpm and all configuration is automatically placed on the system.
If you are trying to configure an in-house repository (a very typical scenario) then you would be best off creating an RPM package to deploy the repository configuration.
take a look at dag createrepo package available on rpmforge:
Use createrepo --update [folder] to rebuild your repository metadata as needed.
For example I have a sources folder for our EL5 machines:
This is the standard approach used by just about every other major third party EL based (RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux) repository including epel, remi, ius and rpmforge.
this package will give you all tools to fullfill your needs
Once you have the RPM package it can be placed inside of the repository for which it belongs.
This is the same approach I've used in house for distributing our internal repository along with the relevant GPG signing key.
