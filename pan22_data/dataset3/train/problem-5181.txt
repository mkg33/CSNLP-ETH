I'm sure there are others out there running images on USB3, right?
I've searched and there is a posting on VM's player about making a change to the header file to increase performance, but its a very old posting and doesn't apply to the latest players.
I suppose you mean read/write when you say up/down.
Your write speed should be similar and not half of your read speed with a HDD, so you have a problem there.
I've ran some benchmarking tools and my UP speed is 35 - 40 mbps and down speed is 85 - 90 mbps.
The performance is very slow and I cant seem to find the culprit.

I have a virtual image I'm trying to run over USB3.0 on an external drive using VM Player.
I'm thinking this is sufficient to run the player.
If you're using a flash drive (memory stick) the speed difference is normal, but performance on small read and write is very bad (except on some expensive flash drives that are using SSD controllers) so the performance you get is normal.
