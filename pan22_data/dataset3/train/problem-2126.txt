A thorough description of Network Manager can be found here https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkManager
If using XFCE you can create a Desktop Launcher which has the command
Perhaps I also need to get wireless working through the 'Network Manager' GUI too (both would be nice for easy of configuration'.
If you remove the Desktop Launcher the Panel Item you've just created will remain there.
I've read that Network Manager won't work if you're not root.
The gnome gui works, and I get a tray icon, and can click Add for VPN and Wireless.
Then try to run Network Manager again, and the options should no longer be greyed out.
I am new to RP & have been searching for 24 hours for this.
Primarily I'd like to get VPN working through a GUI.
I would assume that if one is not using XFCE that a similar solution can be used on the RPi's default desktop.
I ran into the same problem using a wired network connection.
I'm sure I'm missing some crucial step or binding or something.
I edited my /etc/network/interfaces file and removed the line "iface eth0 inet dhcp" and rebooted, this gave Network Manager control of the network interface.
You can choose to move this new Desktop Launcher to any Panel by right clicking on the Launcher and selecting 'Create Launcher on A Panel'.
However - the windows that come up have every textbox greyed out.
It seemed to install its own drivers when I plugged it in and I used the wpa_gui to successfully connect to a wireless network.
