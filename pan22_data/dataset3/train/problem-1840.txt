I actually made something for this using AutoHotkey a while back and figured I'd share it here as well: Mouse Wheel Emulator
Double click Tap_Three_Finger_ShowItem and enter the value 1 instead of 0.
They removed the ability to emulate a middle click.
I had a similar problem with a UX31 Zenbook from asus.
In the tab ELAN under Options (one finger/Taper, you will find the three fingers option you are looking for)
I ain't sure if it's related to updated windows or different driver, but now I can choose middle click in Settings -> Devices -> Touch Pad -> Three-Finger Gesture -> Taps (or in four fingers tap)
Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Elantech/Smartpad
Perhaps try the latest ALPS touchpad drivers then?
It also emulates mouse wheel scrolling by moving the mouse around while holding the left and right mouse buttons.
Then open "control panel" and "mouse" (in the small or large icone list)...
Double click Tap_Three_Finger and enter the value 2 instead of 0.
Hope that it will help because it was a bit cumbersome for me...
Once Elantech driver has been installed to replace the asus driver.
Though I reckon you're looking for a hacked version of the drivers that support it for sure
I think this works better than the solution in the accepted answer by using mouse chording which prevents unintended mouse up events.
