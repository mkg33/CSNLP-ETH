I think it is caused by system auto find a .com in the hostname and think all of the unknown domain name will be in .com domain.
If it was configured on your local machine it would probably be listed in /etc/resolv.conf.
In your case it sounds like ndots is set to at least 2 - it looks like www.blah.com is still having extra lookups done.
Usually ndots is set to 1 - so that server would get extra help, but server.local wouldn't.
the answer it gets back is "silly, you mean server.example.com, and btw it's 1.2.3.4".
To accomplish this, there are a couple of settings that can be configured.
Again, this is probably being set by your DHCP server when it hands out a lease.
These settings could be on your local machine (possibly set by your dhcp server, if you have one); or they could be on some upstream name server, so that when your system asks upstream "What's the address for server?"
It's nice to be able to ping server and have everything Just Know(TM) that you meant server.example.com.
Say that your local domain is example.com, and you have a machine called server.
In your case, it sounds as though "com" has ended up in the list - I'm guessing so that people can enter "yahoo" and have "yahoo.com" returned.
The other feature is the search list - a list of domains that get appended to the hostname to try to find a match.
The two things that control this lookup are a setting called "ndots"; if the hostname has "ndots" dots, it will not have this helpful extra lookup applied.
