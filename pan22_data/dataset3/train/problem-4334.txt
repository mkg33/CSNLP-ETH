I was going to try this for codes of the form A12.3;
Can anyone provide specific techniques with using ICD-10 codes in Machine Learning?
Append the second two digits to this number, i.e add 12 from the example above, to give 10012.
Anyone can provide a useful link to see various approaching to modeling such features?
I've used ICD-10 codes using one-hot encoding / dummy variables as you describe in your Q.
This should give you numerically comparable distances that you'd get from analysing the ICD10 codes as a tree, i.e.
Some ways I've used to make it more manageable RAM-wise:
I have usually used a simply approach of creating multiple binary column representing ICD-10 codesâ€¦ which can get extremely long.
By that I mean that the numbers at the high end of one letter code shouldn't be nearer the lower numbers of another letter code than they are to other members of the group.
This creates a very sparse binary design matrix which has a large number of features as you say.
Are there other techniques or ways to use ICD-10 codes in ML?
all codes that are near each other on one branch are numerically near each other on another branch, and shouldn't spill over too much.
Take the first letter, as a position in the alphabet, add 10 and then multiply by 10, giving you 26 values between 100 and 360
(Out of interest how long are your unique code columns, and number of row samples?)
