Otherwise, I use Suspend to RAM on both Windows and SLED Linux without issue.
If you hibernate your device, and then reboot into Linux, the NTFS file system is invariably corrupted with real data loss.
A sleeping laptop can be woken up to a boot prompt/screen lock screen, at which point an attacker can capture the drive's encryption key via Firewire port or by exploiting a Windows, application or other OS vulnerability.
These apply both for hibernation and suspend (to RAM):
This may seem far-fetched, but tools are easily downloadable to do these things, and any attacker targeting you is capable of this.
If you're using a laptop, and you need to use full-disk encryption to protect customer or other data, you absolutely must enable hibernation and disable sleep.
One reason not to let your computer go into hibernation is if you want to access it remotely (Remote Desktop.)
Hibernate is ok, but it takes too long to return, so unless I plan to leave the device without power for longer than a week, I exclusively use suspend to RAM.
If your computer is capable of S3 Sleep (ultra-low power consumption) there isn't a compelling reason for a desktop to be placed in hibernation.
If you have a dual boot environment and you allow the other OS, say a Linux variant, access to the NTFS partitions, then hibernate is astonishingly dangerous.
Just keep in mind, that there are cases, that it won't work as expected.
Hibernation has a high user impact, as it generally takes 1+ minute to wake up.
If you have a VPN connection, you'll have to reconnect after waking up the computer.
