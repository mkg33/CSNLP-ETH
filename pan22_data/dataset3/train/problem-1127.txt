From there all you have to do is set the resolution of the VM (right click the desktop - screen resolution).
When I RDP onto the machine I can get a large desktop to work in.
Change the resolution within the OS of the VM to the resolution of host machine
Am I missing a setting somewhere or is this a restriction of using the VM connection?
Just set it to the exact same resolution as your real machine and voila.
It looks and feels the same way an Remote Desktop Connection would.
Still no shared clipboard or anything but at least you aren't squinting at the screen trying to view a desktop you have to scroll to navigate.

When I connect to a machine from Hyper-V Manager I get a lovely window to work in, but when I switch it to 'full screen mode' I, rather disappointingly, don't get a larger desktop just a big window with the same size screen sitting inside it.
In Windows 8.1 / Server 2012 R2 Hyper-V just released last week, there is a new feature called "Enhanced Session" which combines the features of Hyper-V with the Remote Desktop features (such as audio redirection, smart sizing and the ability to run full screen sessions).
You need to first enable it for the Hyper-V server, then enable it for the VM and then turn on the enhanced session for the Hyper-V session.
If you go to the full screen mode that you've described where it fills the screen but then gives you the same sized virtual desktop you're halfway there.
