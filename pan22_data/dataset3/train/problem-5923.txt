Other research has indicated that the DisplayPort to HDMI adapter must also support audio.
Yes, DisplayPort supports multi-channel audio and many advanced audio features.
After searching many sites, I learned that the video driver (vs. audio driver) is responsible for the DisplayPort audio; while updating my video drivers (Intel HD Graphics 4600) I specifically noticed in the log it installed an Intel audio driver as well.
After this driver update I'm able to see the TV/audio device listed under Control Panel->Sound (LG TV/Intel Display Audio), as well as under Device Manager as Intel Display Audio (in addition to my regular audio device).
I wound up on this page however because my DisplayPort audio wasn't working.
Odds are if you're using a laptop with a common video device like Intel or AMD, they implemented audio over the DisplayPort and you just need the drivers for it.
It looks like it can be used as a passive pass-through to HDMI with an adapter.
From my testing it may technically be possible to do audio over the DisplayPort protocol, ports and cables, but on a MacBook Air 13 inch, Mid 2011 model it is not possible with DisplayPort - it is possible with HDMI (presumably it is using PCIe-to-HDMI and not translating DisplayPort-to-HDMI).
Thunderbolt is a combination of DisplayPort and PCIe and is the same formfactor as MiniDisplayPort.
As others have mentioned, it's up to the manufacturer to support/implement audio over DisplayPort.
Clipped from Wikipedia (buyer beware, but this type of technical information tends to be truthier).
When using a DisplayPort cable (MiniDisplayPort receptacle on one end, fullsize on the other, I can only do video, System Preferences > Sound does not give me the option to output sound to my TV/Monitor (this is the same monitor that I can output sound to when using a HDMI adapter, a Dell 3008WFP).

DisplayPort to HDMI adapters also include the ability to support HDMI audio.
I can do audio out on my MacBook Air when using a Thunderbolt-to-HDMI adapter.
I just got it to work on my macbook.. Just had to tell the MAc to send audio over Display Port vs headphone jack under settings > Sound > output.
