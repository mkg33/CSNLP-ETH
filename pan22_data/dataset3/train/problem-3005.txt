Hah, a reboot may not even work, as that may need tools from /bin too :)
Actually, you could probably go back to those fine backups you are keeping and restoring the appropriate areas you are missing if you do not want to reboot.
Imagine you accidentally use mount --bind to hide /bin so that umount (and most other binaries) is not visible any more.
otherwise, if you have a spare partition, you can use dd to copy the root partition there and get /bin files back that way.
last, if you network works, you can just copy the command back from a similar system.
If you don't want to reboot, I would try to scp/wget a copy of /bin/umount from another machine with the same os and run that.
Fortunately /bin is actually rather small, it's only very basic utilities and shells.
As long as you have a root shell still open, you should be able to use the tools in /usr/bin to download the package that would have had mount in your distribution (eg apt-get install -d mount on Debian), then extract the file from the downloaded package manually (dpkg-deb -x mount.whatever.deb /some/temp/folder) and then use ./umount in that folder.
if you root filesystem supports snapshot, you can take a snapshot, and copy the /bin files from the snapshot which should be copied to a partition (forgot you cannot mount it).
