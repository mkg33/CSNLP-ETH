But you must tell host A and B how to reach a remote network, and this is the role of the "(default) gateway" parameter which basically says "If don't know how to reach this network, send the packet to this address" I.E.
But when i try to ping from one netwok to another i can't.
So for example if the two host were connected to a switch, they could interact with one another if in the same VLAN.
Host A -- Interface 0 [Router] Interface 1 -- Host B
You don't have to add route on the router, since both networks are directly connected so the route to the two networks are already present in the router forwarding table.
I can ping any interface on both netwoks as long as it's on the same network.
I made two networks on packet tracer an linked them with a router
The most basic topology you can build involving a router is
I know that the problem is in the routing table of the router, I couldn't configure it graphically.
When two host use the same router they have separate IP addresses assigned to them, but these host can talk to each other locally.
When configuring two IP addresses on a router you wouldnâ€™t really need to ping the Two IP addresses configured on the same router.
If two host are in separate VLANs they cannot interact with each other unless a router is in between those two host which is called router on a stick which can route the packets between two host in two separate VLANs.
The ip of router in both LANs is 192.168.0.254/24 and 192.168.1.254/24.
