I am working with a commercial application running on XP using IIS 5.1.
I may do that; however, I'm worried about performance degradation.
I would not set this for all users, but for the small number of users that used this application, it might solve their intermittent problem until the application can be rehosted on Windows Server 2008.
Microsoft suggests you can reduce the problem by turning off HTTP Keep-Alives for that particular web site:
By default, IE6 and IE7 use 2 persistent connections while IE8 uses 6.
This is caused by Microsoft artificially limiting the number of connections (10) under IIS 5.1 under Windows XP, but in this case, there is really only one user (albeit a few tabs open at a time).
Perhaps in this case IE8 itself is generating multiple connections in an attempt to be faster, but those additional connections are overwhelming the artificially limited IIS 5.1 on XP?
When you do this, a limit of 10 concurrent connections still exists, but IIS does not maintain connections for inactive users.
Assuming that is the case, is there an Internet Explorer option, registry setting, or policy I can set to force IE8 to behave like IE7 with respect to persistent connections?
However, I also notice that IE8 appears to handle this differently than IE7.
Periodically the application is returning an IIS error "There are too many people accessing the Web site at this time."
If you use IIS 5.0 on Windows 2000 Professional or IIS 5.1 on Microsoft Windows XP Professional, disable HTTP keep-alives in the properties of the Web site.
