I´ve tried to onnect creating a VPN connection using the OS X itself (you can do it from the network preferences), I´ve tried using FortiClient for the Mac, I´ve tried using VPN tracker, and nothing happens, this last wednesday we did a test connecting an Ubuntu machine using my account and it all went Ok, my Mac is a recently bought Mac with Mavericks, so, no major additions or modifications have been made, any idea?
), I just can´t connect, my PC peers do connect with no problems, and we all are behind a proxy, today I tried to connect from home, my initial thought was that the proxy was impeding a proper connection, but just the same, all I got was a -104 error, which I found is an error for a long connection name, in the office I just have nothing, no connection no nothing.
I´ve tried to connect to VPN using an account I was given, this account doesn´t have any shared secret, as fas as I know , they don´t provide any shared secret, their main argument is that my PC peers do connect without any problem using FortiClient, with only the gate, user and password for that purpose, I´ve been struggling really hard to connect to VPN, I downloaded FortiClient 5.0 and I just can´t connect, even when I ping the server (and all is Ok!
o have you had a similar experience trying to connect a Mac to VPN in such conditions?
