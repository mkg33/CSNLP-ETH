But, there is some concern that, if we do, people might accidentally leave their interactive sessions idle and block other jobs from being run on the machines.
We're considering using Sun Grid Engine on a small compute cluster.
Another option would be to limit which machines can run interactive jobs.
We basically designate some nodes as "interactive" and put a queue on them that oversubscribes the node resources, so many users can log in at once.
The issue isn't just theoretical, since we previously tried using OpenPBS and there was a problem with people opening up an interactive job in a screen session and essentially camping on a machine.
We'd like to allow interactive jobs, since that should ease the transition from manually starting jobs to starting them using qsub.
But, it doesn't seem like the request ever got implemented.
It looks like this was requested as an enhancement (Issue #:2447) way back in 2007.
Is there anyway to configure SGE to automatically kill idle interactive jobs?
The users can basically camp there as long as they want, but if they want to get access to some real resources they need to submit a proper job.
Right now, the current set up is pretty crude and just involves having people ssh to an open machine to run their jobs.
