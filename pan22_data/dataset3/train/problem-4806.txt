In summary it means that the process hangs (waits) until the I/O completes.
The suspended processes are in blocking state or are blocked.
Blocking can be achieve through either hardware or software mechanisms by the operating system.
This Wikipedia article covers it in passing, focussing on non-blocking I/O:
The running process can also ask the operating system to suspend their execution by the sleep command as in Shell and perl.
The second meaning is used in the context of the operating system (as usually called the kernel) that is seen as the supreme manager who manages resources.
What does the term block mean wrt computer science?
When different processes or threads ask for (through system calls) resources (CPU, disk, network, memory, ...) and the resource may not be available due to multiple competing threads or processes are asking for the same thing.
the curly bracket { a block of code; } delimits a block of code.
The kernel will put some process or threads into suspension (wait queue) and only allowing some processes or threads working on the resources (execution state).
Of course, non-blocking I/O doesn't help much if the next step is to do something with that data.
In addition to indicating a form of synchronous signalling, in a programming context 'block' can also mean a section of code grouped together.
I have seen it being used in multiple occassions but never understood what it means.
First meaning of block is easy in computer science: a block of source code in a computer language.
