Separation of logical drives only makes sense if you want to isolate different kind of workloads (i.e.
BTW: benchmarks are fine for rough orientation, but to really allow for the conclusion that the new disk subsystem performs better than the old one, you would need to average performance data (throughput, number of requests, request times, disk queue length) from the old and the new arrays and compare.
File server workloads could be nearly anything - from mostly idle to badly-random-read-write-hammered.
"Performance" is something that heavily depends on workload and is really hard to get a reliable forecast for.
But if the users were fine with the old RAID5, they probably would not be unhappy with the RAID10.
If you do not need this kind of isolation, performance will benefit from the larger number of spindles in a single logical drive.
you do not want workload A to slow down workload B under any circumstances).
Although I would not bet on a vast performance improvment - SATA disks have rather high seek times and sustained random load (especially when involving random writes along with random reads) might slow throughput down to a crawl.
