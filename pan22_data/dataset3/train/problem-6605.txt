It is in general true that for purely data science and statistics exercises R offers the best and fastest (especially if using the data.table package) tools and methods, that otherwise would be heavier to implement in Python (I assume by Python we all mean Pandas, though).
The only reason why it can be required is just that the rest of the company uses it to big extents and they do not want to replace it with something new.
Most data scientists do in fact use R to perform their models and calculations, or just to see how data behave.
Once the exercise is complete it is time to make it available to the rest of the people who have to use it (i. e. to deploy); to this aim it is oftentimes preferred to submit the code in Python for two main reasons:
Plenty of infrastructures and databases support underlying R code, hence portability is not really a problem, especially if one just has to submit the results of the calculations (to that extend, nobody really sees the underlying code anyway).
The above said, it is still true that one can easily translate R code into any other language, provided methods, libraries and packages are available (in Python most of them are, so that is no problem at all).
Java is of almost no use for the pure data science itself (although the Stanford University has a collection of machine learning NLP libraries written in Java, as far as I remember - but please check).
