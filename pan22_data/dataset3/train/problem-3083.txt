I had a short test run using mplayer.exe and the utility successfully switched to High performance and back to my default power plan while having a memory footprint of about 9.3MB (on Windows 8.1 x64)
The best workaround I can think of is to set up 2 power-profile shortcuts, and remember to swap between them before & after watching video.
You just have to make sure to set Turn off the display to Never in your High performance power plan.
Now all I need to do is figure out how to kick this in from across the network, when we're streaming from the DVR.
Both Firefox and IE have full screen display modes.
(Unfortunately the app doesn't support to switch to a specified power plan other than High performance)
I like power saving, so the default behavior is OK, but it shouldn't kick in when I watch fullscreen videos.
The problem is it also turns itself off when I watch long YouTube videos in full screen.
Disable this "power saving feature" as it becomes counter productive whenever it turns off your displays while you're in the middle of watching a video/movie.
Instead turn off your monitor and other displays using the power button on the display whenever you go AFK.
Can you try setting the display mode of the browser to full screen (not maximized) before playing the video und check what happens then?
You could also a small utility called Full Throttle Override to automatically switch power plans whenever the Flash Player (or your favorite video player) is launched.
Maybe power saving looks for apps running in full screen mode but does not find any, because it's only the plug-in that's in full screen.
In power options the monitor is configured to turn off (go to power saving mode) after 10 minutes of inactivity.
(I added  FlashPlayerPlugin_16_0_0_296.exe, for example).
I suspect there's some arcane reason that apps don't inherently have access to the power-saving settings, or it'd be a big no-brainer for Windows Media Player to have a "disable power saving" switch.
