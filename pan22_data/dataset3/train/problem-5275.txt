When zimbra was not correctly shut down, it is possible that there are stale pid-files.
This information can be found in the zimbra log /var/log/zimbra
What I did was I changed my clock and after that zimbra stop showing monitoring results including service status as well.
But unfortunately in Zimbra Administration I get this error message: "Some services are not running".
I installed Zimbra Collaboration Open Source Edition 8.5.0 in a Centos 6 Virtual Machine.
In Server status there are some services which are not running like: amavis, antispam, zimbra, zimbraAdmin, zimlet.

I followed the steps list in the post and finally my zimbra start to work fine.
Zimbra is up and running and all the services are up and running.

Stop zimbra, remove the stale pid file and then start it again.
