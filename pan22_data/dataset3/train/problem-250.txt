Please use the Zlib license, or something similar, instead of the GPL.
The Zlib is very liberal and allows developers to use your code in closed-source projects.
You won't be losing anything by letting them profit, and they'll be more grateful and richer; thus, more likely to donate.
All that said, purely in my own opinion I find it "anti-social" to use non-commercial or even GPL licenses.
It is 100% legal to sell copies of modified GPL software - you simply must provide the source to the modifications or any other modules linked to the GPL code.
Projects like Lua, zlib, libpng, Box2D, Bullet, and so on are pretty key to the games industry and happily exist (and some even get funding) despite being very liberally licensed.
Note that the GPL does not ban the use of your code/data in commercial projects.
The GPL is perfectly suitable for game engines, and data/content can be put under the GPL as well.
In the case of data, the GPL simply has some clauses that don't apply.
This will bring benefits for you, as developers will be more likely to use your engine if they know they can make money off of their project.
It prohibits changes to the MPLv2 licensed code without redistribution of the MPLv2 code but is non-viral.
The CC licenses let you pick the exact "features" you want, including true non-commercial usage clauses if you want them.
Mozilla Public License Version 2.0(MPLv2) is a FSF-approved open source license.
It's also feasible to use these licenses for code, as well.
Restricting what people can do with code only results in them rewriting something they might not have to; you don't get a dime from them either way, and at least with a liberal license you have a chance of building a reputation as being the author of critical components in popular games (which leads to great job offers).
You might consider the more content-oriented Creative Commons licenses for your data.
I'm currently using the Zlib license for a library I developed.
