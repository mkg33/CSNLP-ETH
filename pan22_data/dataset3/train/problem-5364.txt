What does a service at port 80 have to do with anything?
in mysql.ini file port was defined to 3307 I have changed it to 3306 and its works great.
In a DOS shell, run 'netstat -a' to check if mysqld really is listening on port 3306 - and on which addresses.
The rule was that it was OK to allow my PC (given by the IP address) to use TCP for ports 8080 and 3306 for Local use.
Even connecting back to localhost:3307 will get blocked if it isn't opened in the firewall.
3306 may have been opened by the installer already, which is why it works.
Title suggests problem connecting to port 3306 (which is where mysql usually hangs out).
I suspect the problem is that mysqld is running OK (since you connect using PMA) but the client attaches special significance to the name 'localhost' and will try to use a filesystem socket instead of a network socket.
Try connecting to the address/port listed in netstat (use 127.0.0.1 NOT localhost)
I added a rule to the Norton Internet Security program.
I was using Windows 7, PHP and PhpED Pro 6.1 in October 2011 when I had the problem of connecting to the MySQL DB on my PC.
