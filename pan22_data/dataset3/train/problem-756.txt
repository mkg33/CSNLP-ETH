You are not using 4096 bits encryption key to encrypt the communication.
I have a Debian server with OpenSSH_6.7p1 installed and I use 4096 bits key to encrypt the communication.
It also depends on the version of the clients you are using.
Comparing with p2p is very unfortunate (I don't think you run the p2p only from your server).
They might not accelerate the encryption, might use outdated ciphers or so.
(I guess it is not since my p2p download speed can be up to 20MB/S)
You are using probably AES256 symmetric cipher, that is already accelerated in Intel processors (if not, provide verbose log which will tell you what are you using).
It would be much slower, if it would be able to pass even something.
No matter I download or upload a file from/to a client (I tried WinSCP and Syncback and they are on the whole the same) in the same LAN, the speed is usually 1-2MB/S.
You are using 4096 bit key for authentication, which is something completely different and it is done only once per connection!
