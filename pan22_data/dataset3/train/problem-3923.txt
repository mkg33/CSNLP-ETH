Set the VMs network interfaces as bridged to the physical adapter of the host server.
or you can set up multiple port forwards to different IPs, like that:
If it works, you can set up DynDNS or other service to map hostname to your (current) IP address.
Once you know the IP address of your target host, you can set up the port forward.
From your post I can guess that seen from the outside your network has one public IP address, then a router, then the internal network with private IP address space (192.168.x.y, 172.x.y.z, 10.x.y.z).
You have two parts that you need to take care of - the internal network and the port forward.
The VMs should either have static IPs, or DHCP reservations set, so that each time the VM boots, it gets the same IP.
Then test with your router's real (external) IP address first.
Once it works, you can either set up a single forward to access one host within your internal network, then RD to your other machines
From your post I gather you are familiar how to do this in your router.
In this way they will be able to directly connect to the internal (private IP) network, rather than go through a hyper-v NAT.
