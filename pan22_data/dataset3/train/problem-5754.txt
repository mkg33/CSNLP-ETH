Or alternatively if you're running your own incoming mailserver, generate a SMTP error with a message reminding them that it is an unattended mail address.
Better to include a email address as well in the Reply-To: header then and not be reliant on the quirks of e-mail clients...
Other mail clients will generate the reply with an empty To: field and still others will simply use the From: address when the Reply-To header is invalid.
It depends a bit on the actual e-mail client how it deals with a Reply-To field without a valid email address though.
If the recipient still replies despite the big hint in the To: field of their email message your options are then to either accept and silently discard  all messages for that mailbox.
Some will generate a reply with  that No Reply in the field of the recipient, but hitting send will of course fail as that's not a valid recipient address.
It is not uncommon to use a header with something  like Reply-to: No Reply and a similar warning in the actual message.
