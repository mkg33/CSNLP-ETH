In the linked server dialog box, on the security section, do you have "Be made using the login's current security context" selected?
Is your windows account set up on the server you're trying to connect to?
There is no setting you can change which would make this work.
You have to figure out which account runs the sql server service.
if you have access to any windows 2008 server on the domain with a domain user, you should run this CMD command to check what is register already (read access is allowed).
If one would exist, it would be by definition a bug, as it would break the domain policy on constraining delegation only to trusted accounts.
to use a linked server without kerberos the only option is SQL Logins.
And any other work around I would give you would put me in a position to help you violate your domain policies.
if that's not an option you should really try to fix up kerberos auth.
So unless you make the AD change to mark the SQL Server 'in the middle' as trusted for delegation, you won't succeed doing a double hop.
if it is a domain account, you should ask for someone to register the SPN for the user.
you should check for setspn -l sqlmachinename and see if it is registered, and the sqlserviceaccount.
Since this registries should not have duplicated items you first need to remove and then register the new one.
Then ask for someone in the network to register this spn's (as the service needs to be restarted after the register you should make this only on a time window)
This is indeed a case of constrained delegation (ie .
Since it seems you understand the technical problem, I'd recommend you knock at the right doors: the masters of your domain and/or the stakeholders of your requirements.
