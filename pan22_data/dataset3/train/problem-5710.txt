Anyone else experience this, or have any ideas how I can fix - please let me know.
Will initiate reinstall which could take ~45 mins.
Trying to reboot and it just hangs on grey screen with Apple logo and spinning grey dial.
If you have a user replaceable battery - take it out, and hold the power button for upto 15 seconds.
A grey bar slowly fills up about 1/3rd and disappears, leaving me with same grey boot screen with Apple logo & dial.
I can boot into Windows using BootCamp not a problem, and I've tried entering Safe Mode on Mac by pressing Shift key.
If that doesn't work, and your computer still won't restart, this third link recommends attempting a restart while holding down Command + Option + Shift + Delete which will bypass the device that is selected in the Startup Disk control panel and boot from the first bootable device found.
Worst case scenario would be booting from the Snow Leopard disk and restoring your last backup, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Simply insert Snow Leopard CD at boot and hold down the 'C' key.
In the end I called AppleCare and they informed I should reinstall Snow Leopard again.
This second link details what's stored in PRAM that will be reset to defaults.
Went to restart, and Mac just hung for ages with pinwheel spinning.
This link from Apple describes more of the details, but essentially, you just hold down Command + Option + P + R after powering on the computer and before the grey screen appears.
Tried all the various options suggested by people below but didn't work.
This has happened to me after a recent Security update from Apple.
Resetting PRAM and NVRAM often solve issues like this, and it's certainly worth a try in this case.
I wouldn't lose any files/BootCamp partition etc, but would need to carry out System Update again.
