Just use the gateway IP to go from one guest to the host.
I did the following steps and it worked fine with me finally (on CentOS VB):
Then this VB should access the Internet and could be accessible from the others (VBs and local machine).
This is how I connect vbox guests in NAT mode only (tested on VirtualBox 4.2.4).
I think what you're looking for is "Internal Networking" , connecting internal VMs each other.
Then you need to configure port forwarding on guest B so that all traffic received by the host on port 1000 go to guest B on port 1000.
In conclusion, you don't necessary need host-only mode to connect multiple guests but I don't mean to say that host-only mode is not the best option for your use case.
You need the host-connection LAN type (something like that in english version) on guest machines and bridge-connection on your host-machine.
For instance if guest A wants to reach a guest B service that listen on port 1000, A has to use the gateway IP (for the first NAT interface it is 10.0.2.2).
Then use port forwarding to "proxy" the host traffic into the other guest.
This might not work for every service but it seems to work just fine for ssh, salt, ...
The NAT adapter will be used to access the Internet while the Host-Only adapter will be used for networking access between any other VBs and the local machine as well.
