OK, the OP mentions that he is using the VPS version of Ubuntu.
It's a local VM, as krowe suggested, on a VirtualBox running Debian.
Changing the default shell to /bin/bash solved the problem for me.
Then under Features select Disable switching to alternate window
You may want to just try shutting down VMware or maybe just unplugging your keyboard would also work but my desktop starts up really fast so I usually just do a full restart.
Tab completion is provided by the shell you're running on the server, not by PuTTY itself.
I used the same connection, so the issue had to be on the server side.
I had an interesting variation of this, where it worked for root, but not for my personal user.
You can fix it by using /bin/bash instead, using the following commands:
This makes me suspect that he is running a virtual server and because he is having this particular problem I'd bet that the server is being hosted locally.
In my particular case, this problem happens every time I try to install the latest Kubuntu release using the VMware quick install feature (which also fails BTW).
I know this is an old question but I've run into this problem a few times and have found that the real solution is not server side at all but it's on the client side and this is the first thing that comes up when I searched for a solution to the problem.
It even happens when the server I'm connecting to is a remote server.
As it turned out, the difference was that root had /bin/bash in /etc/passwd, while the personal user had /bin/sh.
When I've encountered this in the past it is due to a problem with VM tools.
It is annoying because you'll need to completely restart the host OS but afterwards you should be good.
Please edit your question and provide more details including what shell you're using and what specifically happens when you try to use tab completion.
