I've convinced the owner that it may be time to look for a replacement unit.
So I'm looking for a wireless bridge that can be powered by PoE.
I don't know how much money you're looking to spend, but I've been really happy with my Cisco 1130AG.
I previously had a Linksys Draft-N AP that I ended up rebooting every night and still remained unstable.
A few years ago, we made use of Apple Airport Extreme base stations mounted on the wall to provide a WiFi bridge to our LAN.
This worked out well, because we merely needed to supply a network jack, and didn't have to have an additional power outlet installed nearby.
I can highly recommend the wifi bridges from WiMo, they also support POE.
Just in case anyone finds this thread while searching for Airport Extreme base stations over PoE, it turned out that the intermittent deafness was caused by having all of them plugged into a network switch that was itself failing intermittently.
The 3Com injectors are still highly recommended: Far cheaper than alternatives, solidly built, and have been working for years.
This particular model makes use of 802.11af (Power-over-Ethernet, or PoE for short) to power the base stations.
They work for 1-3 weeks after a power cycle, but then silently fail.
Of course, it cost like 8 times as much and doesn't support N.  (They have some now that do, I think.)
Lately, in a completely intermittent way, the base stations have been going deaf.
There are couple of good brands especially designed for !home usage like that shop.
