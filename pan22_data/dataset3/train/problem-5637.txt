Every other delivery after that will see that mailbox is already locked and delivery is not possible at the time.
To prevent simultaneous deliveries that can broke mbox structures, each delivery first try to lock the mailbox for exclusive operations.
I didn't understand what's happenening .. Can you explain for me ?
As far as you have used mbox as mailbox format, each delivery should be performed as sequence of operations.
When delivery is failed postfix postpone the message in the queue.
Message should be stored, indices should be updated and so on.
I've the following error message appeared 3 continuous for the same mailbox
Sure if delivery will be failed again for some reason, message will be postponed in the queue and warning will be recorded.
That is why you have see three warnings in the log - first delivery have locked the mailbox and next three are failed.
Time by time queue is processed and each message is delivered again.
That's means that postfix have try to deliver four messages to the user's mailbox at the same time.
Cause messages from queue are delivered one by one and each delivery happens only after previous is complete, there is no new warnings in the logfiles.
