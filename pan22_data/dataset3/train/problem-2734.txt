The server that you're trying to connect has to have Teamviewer automatically start on windows logon (that option appears when you install the program) so it can create the teamviewer as a service and then allow teamviewer to automatically "turn on" the computer.
When setting up unattended access on newer versions of Windows Server, I had extreme problems with getting it to work without first having a logged in user on the server, and minimizing the RDP session or closing it resulted in this annoying error message about The screen cannot be captured at the moment.
I know my answer is pretty late but I let this in case someone else is having the same issue.
For Teamviewer version 12+ they have this option in top menu bar under Actions > Send Ctrl + Alt + Del.
(You need to reboot if the installer asks, so if is a server it's pretty hard to do it)
The Server ID can be found by clicking the blue exclamation mark right next to the User ID on the main panel.
This works on Windows Server 2012 R2, and most likely older as well.
There are two kinds of TeamViewer "ID":s. User ID and Server ID.
