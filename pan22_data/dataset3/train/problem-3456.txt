I followed the instructions of a similar post regarding this subject, but it does not quite work.
I am trying to create separate pools for multiple users and websites, so that they run under a separate user and each site is protected in case one is hacked.
Here is a list of all Apache mods that I have enabled:
I'm going to have about 30 users running about 60 sites.
Note that I have reloaded php7.0-fpm and apache2 after each conf file saved.
If a hacker breaks in, the damage needs to be isolated to just one user.
In addition, when I view the /var/run/php directory, I see:
Here are two example pool.d conf files I have in /etc/php/7.0/fpm/pool.d
In my "/home" directory, "www-data" is the group owner for all users and their websites:
I am using Ubuntu 16.04, Apache 2.4.29 and php7.0-fpm.
I need Apache to run the websites as the user (instead of www-data).
The problem: It seems that only one site works properly this way.
In addition, here are my two Apache VirtualHost files:
It needs to be done in such a way so that if a hacker breaks into a Wordpress site, they cannot use www-data to access and infect the rest of the users and their websites.
