But instead of using these as the rdiff-backup source, would it be better to let rdiff-backup just backup /home/%user%/Maildir (many, many small files)?
I suppose that if the external drive were to fail it would be better not to cripple the 2nd backup system as well!
I am researching a remote off-site backup strategy.
Also, you can use ssh -C to compress the ssh connection and save some bandwidth.
Currently the mail server writes pax Maildir backups to an external drive.
Can rdiff-backup incrementally backup compressed archive files?
rdiff-backup does analyze files for differences, but if they're compressed archives, it may not be able to find any differences and thus be forced to store the entire new file again.
Backing up 12GB of data would take weeks over dialup, and even the 2GB difference could take days.
The major limitation is that the upstream pipe is only ~50 kb/s, so with that in mind the incremental backup capabilities using file differentials of rdiff-backup seemed like the proper tool.
Finally, if possible, you should get some more bandwidth; that's barely better than dialup (or maybe it is dialup?).
