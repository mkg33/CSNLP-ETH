If you storyboard your slides first with pencil and paper, then create all your slides first, with their titles, you'll know before you start designing specific slides which slides will have arrows.
You also can use the Format Painter to apply a specific format to other arrows.
Then, you can copy arrows from your sampler slide to all the necessary slides.
What designers do is mostly what you're doing, they copy from another slide.
Set the arrow style up as you like it and set it as the default.
Now if you want to draw an arrow DON'T use the arrow, use the line shape instead.
In powerpoint 2007 I end up using a same kind of arrows a bunch.
Here is a solution to this problem but it's kind of corny and nonintuitive.
Before you say, "Right click the >> Set as default line"...
But every time I create an arrow I have to re-format it or I have to copy the arrow from another slide.
You're right that Office counts lines and arrows as similar objects.
Just select the "right" arrow which is formatted the way you want, click the Format Painter, then select the "wrong" one.
After that, you can just copy from within the slide if you need several on a slide.
As an answer I'll accept, "No, it's not possible, microsoft is stupid."
Does anyone know how to set the default "arrow" shape.
More specifically, they create a "sampler slide" with objects of all types that are formatted the way they want them.
So the next time you go to make a line (no arrow heads), you get your nicely formated arrow...
This works in PowerPoint 2010 - don't know about 2013.
