I've been using a program for years called SyncMyCal that will do what you need.
You could create a new Google Calendar account which would only be used for syncing your work account.
It works, however all events from my work calendar on outlook syncs to my default General Calendar.
The free version only supports manual syncing, though.
I haven't tried this, and I don't know exactly how you have everything set up, but could be worth a go.
I have a Google Calendar called Work that is not the default calendar.
Google Calendar Sync only syncs with your primary calendar.
You can use some other free WebDAV based syncing service like Synqya  that allows you to sync your Outlook events with any of your Google Calendars
Select outlook calendar from different profiles and mailboxes
Is it possible to have it sync only to that calendar?
PS : I am the co-author/contributor to the application
I am trying to sync my work email to my Google Calendar.
Then you could share out your work calendar to your personal calendar for viewing online, and import them both in to Outlook for local viewing.
This app could be your solution, worls well with all outlook configurations (tested in corporate and general configurations)
