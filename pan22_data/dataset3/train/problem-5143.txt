There is new section on the Foundations site http://www.raspberrypi.org/jam/ which also has a page on how to host your Jam http://www.raspberrypi.org/jam/how/ including getting sponsership.
Since I want to help the community I want to make this event available for free so more disadvantaged people could join.
So to recap, how could I get this event started and how could I apply for a sponsorship?
Personally I would look for local businesses to sponsor, its good publicity especially if you can local press involved.
Is there a way I could apply for a sponsorship and raise funds?
For my junior year in high school I want to host a Raspberry Pi Jam to "decorate" my college application and help out my community.
Since would a junior in high school (17 years old) I am not going to have enough money to do this all by myself.
The jam would probably be aimed towards younger teens  and their parents, if they wanted to see what is going on.
Also, if you can link to any helpful projects to do with raspberry pi beginners that would be great!
