Depending on your PC and BIOS model, this entry can usually be found under Advanced Settings or Integrated Peripherals, and then SATA settings / Disk controller settings / IDE settings.
I suggest a reinstall because you changed the motherboard.
You should check that on your computer, depending on what it was before, then it might be either Legacy or AHCI.
Next time if you want to prevent a full reinstall you would had to run a sysprep inside Windows before installing the new mainboard.
The BIOS battery died, and it wouldn't keep the settings anymore.
I exchanged the BIOS battery, and had a look at the SATA settings in the BIOS.
Changed the setting back to the newer AHCI mode, and Windows booted again without a glitch.
sysprep remove know device and when the PC restart it start the redetection like when it install.
So its a last command you issue and you close the OS.
Windows Boot Manager would start, but Windows would crash and start the boot repair, which would fail constantly.
I recently had an issue with a PC that wouldn't boot Windows anymore.
A lot of driver change would happen, even if it would had boot a clean install would remove anything there from the old mainboard.
The boot mode (Legacy / UEFI) is not the only BIOS setting that can prevent Windows from starting.
