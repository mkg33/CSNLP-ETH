It seems to me that private/public key merely do not match.
Try to generate a new pair and scp public key to server.
So I compared my output from env in both sessions.
Unfortunately I have different keys for different servers.
I guess this is essential  for key resolution based on the result.
I found this is the working session, which was absent in the non-working session:
You can, for example, start a sshd in debug mode on port 2222 with /usr/sbin/sshd -d -p 2222, then connect with ssh -p 2222 user@remotehost.
Secondly today I again have this error in only one XTerm session, and everything work great in 6 other xterm sessions to the same server/hose machine.
If you can start a sshd on another port in debug mode, it will tell you immediately why the key is being rejected (my wild guess is that your home directory is group writable).
There should be no newline in between the format definition (ssh-rss, ssh-dss, ..) and the public key itself.
To be honest, sometimes it works even if there are bigger rights, but it should not.
Key names tell us that public key is RSA key and private key is DSA.
On that occasion, renaming my id key to "id_rsa" helped.
I pasted that assignment into the non-working session:
These things are always much easier debugged from the server side, if that is possible.
I recommend to check authorities on ./ssh and userÂ´s home directory, on key file and on authorized_keys file, as noone else then owner should be allowed to write and read there if you want ssh passwordless connection to work.
In my case, the problem was in incorrect format of authorized_keys file.
