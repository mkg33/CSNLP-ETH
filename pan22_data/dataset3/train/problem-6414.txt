I would like to know of addons which actually enhance firefox's performance, both intentionally and unintentionally.
These websites tend to have a fair amount of javascript and css, and probably a large dom tree which may even be growing dynamically through javascript too.
The javascript and extra stuff which you already mentioned and slow external web sites.
In some cases, if it's still not enough performance, you may also consider using Opera browser with it's Opera Turbo mode.
I believe you should try AdBlock Plus and FlashBlock.
RequestPolicy and Ghostery help with the second part, where Firefox is waiting on part of the webpages from other servers.
(Or to be fair, end user speed is not their primary goal).
The worse offenders are those with heavy javascript, use heavy facebook integration, websites with non performant javascript, excessive javascript and websites with too many advertisements.
If you have a low bandwidth connection to the net then this will help.
Often from add servers who do not seem to care about speed.
It prevents flash movies from automatically starting.
I find that firefox tends to have major performance issues with certain websites.
NoScript and AdBlock and will help a lot with the first.
AdBlock Plus and NoScript will both block the types of annoyances you mentioned.
