If your data is tabular you can try working on some feature engineering or improve on your preprocessing method.
As long as your network does not overfit and able to generalize well this should not be an issue.
If this is the case do not worry too much since other people might also face the same issue.
What is more justified is augmenting the train set with external data given that it is available(If this is the case please cite external data when producing your report especially for academic reporting).
If your data is image you can try adding external (anything except your own dataset test set) apply unique data augmentation ideas.
I assume that the result is going to be compared within academic scope.
I don't think it is justified to train with test set.
If you are able to solve it that is great since that imply that you are able to design network that is capable to generalize very well, but if not as long as you are able to explain the issue you faced, less desirable result is quite understandable.
