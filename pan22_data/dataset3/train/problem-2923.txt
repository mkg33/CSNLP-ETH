Not quite what you asked for, but for the benefit of anyone else trying to connect to a server that doesn't support key authentication, you can use sshpass to type in your password for you even with sshfs.
Additionally, you will see people list another means of evoking sshfs:
If you are using a recent Linux distro (ie Ubuntu and others) ssh-agent may already be setup for you.
You might need to ssh to the server once first to confirm its key, but after that this should work with no manual interaction.

sshfs -o ssh_command="ssh -i /home/me/.ssh/somekey.pem" user@host:/path/ mnt/
For example, if you put something similar to this in /etc/fstab:
