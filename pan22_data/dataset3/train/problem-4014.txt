I found bug trying export Opera bookmarklets into Chrome : Opera bookmarklet should not be contain  empty folders and folders without name (otherwise while Chrome stops importing process after empty folder / folder without name position)
Try to use Transmute -- this tool supports all major browsers (without intermediate exporting the bookmarks to HTML from the browser) and some other formats.
As far as I remember, Chrome installer has no Opera bookmarks import feature (supports only I.E.
Opera 35.0 appears to have no Import/Export option under settings, and they have deactivated Opera Link, so there is no way to do this except through other 3rd party software.
The advantage to web based book marks is that they are always available, from any browser, on any platform, and never need to be imported/exported.
An alternative solution would be web based bookmarks.
Foxmarks does have web based bookmarks, as do other web services.
In addition, it features some other handy stuff which you may also be interested in.
