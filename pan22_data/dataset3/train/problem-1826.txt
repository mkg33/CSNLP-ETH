I take care not to upload any pictures that may attract perverts
I choose the public option for all my albums in Picasaweb, these mostly (>90%) contain pictures of my children which I share with my family.
You can't change your mind later, as people might have copied them to somewhere else.
You most likely won't have legal remedies either as the internet is international and offending parties may be anywhere in the world.
As soon as your pictures are publicly visible you lose any control over what happens to the pictures, how they are used or in what context or in what form or state of modification.
you wouldn't go about giving photos of your kids to strangers in the street, right ?
Ever so often somebody I don't know adds me as a favorite, at current count I have 7 people in my fan list (non of whom I know) and only three of them have any public albums.
So making something private is not just a good idea, but a smart way to keep photos from getting into where they shouldn't - technically.
What would you recommend, private by default or continue with public?
As it was said, if you worry about private photos getting into the wrong hands, don't post them online, private or not, its ONLINE.
Keep in mind that ANYTHING you put online, is retained.
