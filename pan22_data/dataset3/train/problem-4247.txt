This is a tool that will allow you to create an ISO of the current system.
After this, you have you virtualized image that can be 'played' with vmplayer.
It'd probably be easier to create a fresh VM, install Ubuntu on it, and then back up your dev box and restore the backup to the VM.
You can then boot off the ISO and get that enviornemtn as a LiveCD.
Then convert the physical system to a virtual system, after tweaking configuration settings.
That said, is there a reason you couldn't just open up VNC or SSH access to your existing dev box, and access it remotely?
I did this previously on a Windows XP machine, but I guess you can do it in Ubuntu as well.
That'd give you a VM you could run on any machine where VirtualBox is, or could be, installed.
Install vmware-converter (free product) in your Ubuntu box.
Then, perhaps, use that ISO as the file system of a VBox VM (obviously, it would have to be Ubuntu, and probably 12.04).
I'm running Ubuntu Desktop 12.04, and I was wondering if it was possible to somehow take my whole filesystem (everything under /) and create an ISO from it.
To make an ISO directly you should use Remastersys.
If you want to make a VHD (virtual hard disk) from the physical disk, they only tool I know of would be disk2VHD.
Basically, I've spent a lot of time configuring my development machine, but need to be able to work on it from whatever computer I happen to be at.
If possible, that might well be a simpler option -- at the least, it'd save you some suffering every time you want to use the dev box from a new machine.
Another option might be to clone your OS into a VirtualBox disk image:
