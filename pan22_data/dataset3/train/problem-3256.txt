You can not use the VGA output connector on your laptop as an input.
Is there an easy way to connect the PC to the laptop such that the PC displays on the laptop's screen?
Then 'play' the captured image in real time on the laptops display.
or you can somehow convert the  presumably vga connection on the laptop to  dvi/hdmi
It may be possible to engineer a bidirectional VGA port that has automatic directional override, but it's either (a) too difficult or (b) too expensive, otherwise most laptops would offer the feature, and then it would already be common knowledge.
So basically the laptop's internals are not being used, we just want to use its display for a connected PC.
to assume the laptop and monitor have one of the following connections yes:
to record what would normally appear in the screen.
Normal VGA is uni-directional, so even if you managed to physically connect the PC's VGA-out to the laptop's VGA-out, it would be the electrical equivalent of driving two cars towards each other -- in a single lane!
The laptop does work, it's just too slow to be useful.
1)  serial to serial  (like the old printer connections)
It may be feasible to disassemble the laptop and hack the screen's connection to the mainboard, but chances the manufacturer put their own twist on whatever is driving the display, and you won't find a simple "VGA signals go in here" place to wedge in your PC's VGA output.
from VGA) and turns it into digital information (e.g.
Note that such a device might be more expensive than a new monitor.
My son has a PC with no monitor, and an OLD laptop (circa 2002).
