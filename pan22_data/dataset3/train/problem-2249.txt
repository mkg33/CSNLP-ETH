On a domain controller, the first and second DNS servers should be other domain controllers.
If it is depending on the offline server for DNS, you will have this problem.
Make sure the secondary DC can see itself as a DNS server for the domain.

In a deleted answer, you commented that "1st and 2nd they are configured fine and both DCs are pointing to themselves and clients can do nslookup on both server".
Also, a trick to log a client in when the DC is down is to simply pull the network cable when entering the password.
Whenever I've had problems with authentication, removing the Ethernet connection will force the PC to use cached credentials.
So long as that user has logged onto the PC before it should at least get you logged in to troubleshoot, then reconnect Ethernet.
It may be a timeout issue at the client that has previously seen the primary.
If your clients are set to DHCP, then why don't you just add the secondary DC as secondary DNS server, assuming DNS is also running on the secondary DC?
Try an ipconfig -flushdns on a client and see if it makes a difference.
All of your clients should have at least 2 domain controllers as their DNS server.
