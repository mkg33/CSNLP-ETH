Set up your monitoring system (with 1,000 servers you MUST have a monitoring system) to log reboots (or better yet, all traps) into a database, from which you can extract and manipulate the data in any way you see fit.
Probably the best answer is to use the tool you are already using to monitor your servers.
If you don't yet have one, do that first, then ask yourself the same question.
Seems to me that this is easily met through SNMP traps.
Run hourly and you probably won't miss too many reboots.
SCOM will tell you for Windows and a syslog server will tell you for Linux but most centralised management tools will allow for you to script a report such as this.
Heck, if you get email alerts, you could just make an outlook filter (If an unreachable alert is close enough to a reboot for you).
However, a single-use approach would be to run nmap -O against all servers to use TCP's timestamp fingerprinting feature: http://nmap.org/book/osdetect-methods.html#osdetect-ts.
The beauty of storing the traps in a database is that you can run all kinds of queries against it and generate any reports you want.
If you are using monitoring software and then there are probably ways to get those reports (at least if it something open and not 100% GUI (Unless the GUI Provides the functionality)).
What centralised management tools do you already have?
