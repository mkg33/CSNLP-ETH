But don't take everything you read or hear for granted - try to understand to logic and learn to test everything yourself.
Also, reading Oracle documentation and trying things out is critical.
If you work with other DBAs, ask them questions and try to learn from their experience and share your own learning.
Be curious about operating systems, storage, networking etc.
Know what's there are working on - it will affect you.
The top 5 things every Oracle DBA should know and practice regularly:
Learn to establish good relationships with these teams in your organization.
While you are at metalink, learn your way around and try some of the new stuff there.
tahiti.oracle.com should always be the starting point.
Also, learn to work with developers, understand their pains and educate them about how to properly work with a database.
Be patient - there are many programmers and a few DBAs, so this is never-ending.
