I want to list these subsets so that two subsets adjacent to one another in the list are as close to one another as possible in that their intersection is as small in cardinality as possible.
Suppose I have a collection of $m$ subsets of $\{1,\dots,n\}$, all of size $k$.
For $v \in V$, define the set $S_v = \{ e \mid e \in E \mbox{ is incident to } v\}$.
Without knowing any further restrictions on the parameters, the problem is NP-hard.
Although mikero proved that your problem is hard, there is a fast general algorithm that gives reasonably good solutions to this kind of problem (where you want an ordering of a set of "objects" such that if two are consecutive then they are "similar").
If you want adjacent sets to have "as small an intersection as possible", simply complement each of these sets and the same reduction also works.
It's an simple but non-trivial algorithm: first take a spanning tree, then apply a function called prepostorder to it, and we're done.
Your question suggests that you think this problem can be done in $O(m^2)$, and now I'm curious why.
The result is as follows: given any connected graph, in linear time we can find a cyclic ordering of its vertices such that if two are consecutive then they are at distance $\leq 3$ in the graph.
Then $| S_u \cap S_v | = 1$ if $u$ and $v$ are adjacent, and $|S_u \cap S_v| = 0$ otherwise.
Then an ordering of $\{ S_v \mid v \in V\}$ in which adjacent sets have "as large an intersection as possible" corresponds to a Hamiltonian path in $G$ (for sensible measures like maximizing $\sum_i |S_i \cap S_{i+1}|$ or maximizing $\min_i |S_i \cap S_{i+1}|$).
You can pad out each $S_v$ with distinct junk items until each set has the same size.
This is taken from TAOCP section 7.2.1.6, and in particular implies that the cube of any connected graph is hamiltonian.
