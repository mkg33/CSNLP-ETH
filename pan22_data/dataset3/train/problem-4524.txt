If your servers can't handle your load (and you don't want to buy and administer more), that's when you want a CDN, but it doesn't sound like that's your problem.
There was a page I saw a while back with a script that measures users ping and sends them to the nearest server.
the Enterprise package supports something they call Regional Routing that would be your solution I guess.
You can take a look at http://www.neustar.biz/services/dns-services/managed-dns-packages too.
It accomplishes this by becoming the authoritative DNS server for the various domains you administer, and then for incoming DNS requests, it then hands out the IP addresses of your web servers, correctly accounting for load and locality.
Amazon sells this as Latency Based Routing but I assume other large DNS providers offer similar tools.
All you need is for the authoritative DNS server for your domain to pick the optimal server for a given user based on where their DNS request is coming from (and potentially what the current load is).
Same as mentioned before with Akamai offer, the DNS service is smart enough to point to the geographically closest IP.
Akamai, for example, while also the largest CDN, offers a product called Global Traffic Management that is completely separate from its CDN offerings that provides this very service (for a fee).
Also, F5 Networks sells a geographic load balancing router, but it's expensive.
An easier alternative is to provide different DNS records per continent.
