We use a virtualised red hat server for software development, and one of the things I have to do is check who's hogging the CPU and see how we can try and avoid it.
I'm not great with linux, but I do enjoy the limited exposure I have.
Your output above shows that bzip2 is the highest user of CPU at the time you took the snapshot.
Here's some starting points to hopefully ease the hunting: Top columns, SysStat and other tools and Using top more efficiently.
I gather it's all internal kernel stuff, but it seems to run at at least 20%, and usually higher.
To begin with I'd pay more attention to those values than the other screeds of detail to tell you when your system is busy or not.
A good starting place for system load (at a glance) is the top-most three numbers on the right (type w if your top doesn't show this) from the w man page system load averages for the  past 1, 5, and 15 minutes (the same applies to top).
They're basically how long it will be before the system can being to process the next command in the queue ... 1.01 seconds, 3.26 seconds etc.
I can decipher the users and processes easily enough, but if the system column is using (say) 50.8% of CPU, how can I find out what it's doing, and try and minimise it?
top is wonderful but also a little tricky to understand, mainly because a system is so complex.
I'd recommend some further reading on interpreting a system's IO, RAM and CPU monitoring tools.
If you have a dual core CPU for example the CPU running at 100% in top for one command isn't actually a problem usually - it just means that one command is using one core fully but the other core should be able to take over and serve other commands without delay.
