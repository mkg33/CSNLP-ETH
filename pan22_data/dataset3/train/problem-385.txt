Also, it may be a good idea to make backups of your history file in case it borks out or something.
Then again, it's a good idea to make entire hard drive backups as well...
I currently have history going back 18 months now and my places.sqlite file (which retains the history) is over 150 MB (6 months ago it was about 100 MB, so for me I add 50MB every 6 months).
Note that, with such large sizes, an SSD is HIGHLY recommended.
The issue is that Firefox will change that setting automatically unless you lock it.
This technically doesn't set it to keep history forever, but it'll retain a heck of a lot of entries.
If you don't have one then consider using a ramdisk + symbolic links instead (a ramdisk that saves data at timed intervals or at shutdown).
The tl;dr version is, use mozilla.cfg to lock the variable places.history.expiration.transient_current_max_pages to 2147483647 (the largest value accepted).
I had the same issue and I discovered a hacky way which you can read about here:
Note that mozilla.cfg does not work in Portable Firefox, so in such a situation I recommend using Portable Pale Moon instead (which does work with mozilla.cfg)
