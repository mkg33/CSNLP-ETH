Your both computer and laptops are connected to your switch.
First, Assign static IP address with correct default gateway to both PC and laptop rather then dynamic IP (If you have DHCP).
You should still be able to ping to another workgroup as long as they are in the same network.
you need to make sure IPv4 is working first before testing IPv6 within your network.
First thing I would do is that enable IP4 on your windows 7 laptop.
Your network should be something like this to make them communicate each other.
Laptop- IP: 192.168.0.10 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 DG: 192.168.0.1
Disconnect your laptop and computer from mobile hotspot (let's test physical LAN port first as they might become conflicted if you have both wifi and physical LAN connected).
Desktop - IP: 192.168.0.11 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 DG: 192.168.0.1
Router (Default Gateway) IP: 192.168.0.1 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
On this switch, you also need a router which is your default gateway but you did not mention what router you have in your question.
