I got PHP 5.2.12 to compile fine, but ideally I would like to use PHP 5.2.6 to emulate the web host's environment.
I have tried several times now, deleting the folder and files and starting from scratch with a fresh download, still the same ****.
If you don't use those options with PHP 5.2 you will just get a server 500 error and an unhelpful error message in the error.log!
I'm sure I've seen this error before but I just can't remember what I did as I always forget to write things down - I usually find hours of frustration is solved by something silly.
I have already installed Apache 2.2.14, PHP 5.3.1 (using mod_fastcgi) and MySQL 5.1.41 - this is working great, but I am now trying to install PHP 5.2.6 (also using mod_fastcgi) so I can use it for testing on other virtualhosts as my host uses this version.
But I seem to be getting errors when running "make"... there are alot of errors so I have shown the first and last bit (had to log it to a text file it was so long).
Thanks for your help LapTop006, when I find time I need to write all this down in a tutorial.
I assume I need some compile flags/options to get this to work.
For some reason PHP 5.3 doesn't have those options, and I based my ./configure options for 5.2 on the ones I used for 5.3.
With PHP 5.2 it appears I have to also use these configure options [--enable-fastcgi] and [--enable-force-cgi-redirect] for it to work with mod_fastcgi.
"configure" worked fine, here is my configure command...
I followed the same procedure in CentOS 5, and earlier versions of Fedora, and it worked fine.
Do I need to provide any more information that could help?
