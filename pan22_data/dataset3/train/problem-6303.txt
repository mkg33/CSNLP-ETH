During each rebuild this directory gets cleaned and, after build process ls gives me empty output.
By cd .. and cd (directory) you move up and back into the (newly created) directory, and the files are there as you expect.
I have a directory, containing files generated by compiler.
Your script is most likely removing the directory, and not just the files which are there.
So, when you have cd'd into it, and the directory is removed, you do ls on a directory which does not actually exist.
Note those are back ticks, not single quotes around the pwd
The best alternative is instead of cding in and out of the directory, is to add the directory name to your ls command, and run it from the parent directory.
It looks odd, but it is short and refreshes the directory:
create an alias refresh="cd .. && cd -" that will go a directory up and then again cd into the previous directory
After I cd out of directory and then back to it ls works right.
if you are sure that you will need a listing again you can have
once the ailas is create store the alias into your ~/.bashrc file by doing
It would be better if you did not remove the directory, but instead of cd ..; cd - you could do cd $PWD.
