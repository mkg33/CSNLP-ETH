localhost is in fact the loopback address of the container itself, not your host server and there is nothing listening on port 8081 there (causing the 503).
My suggestion is to use docker only for you service and use a standard apache (or even better nginx) for proxying.
- CNAME: *.mydomain.com is an alias of mydomain.com
I am stuck getting started with containerized virtualhosts.
Apache is serving fine, apache info page shows at mydomain.com and web-app shows at mydomain.com:8081
Changing to these values either gives the same 503 error, or results in the page continuously loading, returning neither an error nor the page requested.
I am at a loss for what to try next, any help is appreciated.

I have also added the following DNS records with digitalOcean:
