Then you have sub-tables with specific attributes for each contract type
A schema idea would be great, a tutorial of something similar ideas and technology would be even better.
Something that won't over complicate simple crud transactions?
However, if I understand you, I think you're looking at the subtype/supertype pattern.
A sequence would be nice but if you designed using, say, Object Role Modelling then you'd generate this pattern/schema
Until SQL Server supports sequences (next version "Denali") then you'll have to have a common table.
I'm a developer treading into the database world so bear with me please.
I'm creating a Contract database with separate tables for various types of contracts.
I have 5 tables but would like to share a common 'Identity' field between them, so that there will be a unique contract # for any given contract regardless of type.
Doing this requires either having a single table that you insert new rows into and get the values from there, or you write your own sequence process until you can upgrade to SQL Server "Denali" which supports this out of the box.
My application will be using a Sql Server 2008 R2 server..the app itself is Silverlight 4 using WCF Ria services for CRUD transactions.
