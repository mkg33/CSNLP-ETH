I have some Git (private GitHub) repositories cloned locally, I never work on them but I need them to be always updated because I run the software contained in these repositories (or I use some part of these repositories as dependencies of another repository, no submodule, sorry).
So, I'm looking for a way to keep these repositories always updated.
It strikes me, though, that if the repos are updated automatically in the background (w/o user initiation/intervention), you'd want some report/log/email to be generated when the repos are updated, should anything fail or other unexpected conditions occur.
There's some good pointers in other comments : cron, a launch agent of sorts, etc.
Then you need a way to periodically run the update command, which can be done a variety of ways.
IMHO, this problem smells like it needs a proper dependency management tool or package manager.
It sounds like you may need a combination of tools.
I use Git Tower to manage my Git repositories on OS X, so I'm looking for an answer which let me use that software or simply the Git cli.
First, you need a way to keep track of the repositories that need updating and update them in one fell swoop.
It also should be noted that blindly updating repos and then copying/packaging the updated code for use elsewhere is somewhat risky.
Git's main purpuse is not distributing your software, but you could always run git pull before reloading your code.
