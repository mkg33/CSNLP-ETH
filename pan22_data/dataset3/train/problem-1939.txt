There should be an option to switch between UEFI and CSM (compatibility support module, which provides the older BIOS functions; may also be labelles as BIOS or Legacy).
When I choose "BIOS" I can boot to DOS without problems.
Only UEFI compliant operating systems can be booted with this option.
Apparently, "fakebios" and "loadbios" options are simple emulations to work around video card issues.
I have played around with grub for a while but I have found that it does not have full BIOS emulation.
I can't however boot to DOS from the "UEFI" boot selection.
My question is: Is there any way to boot to DOS while having the option in the BIOS set to "UEFI"?
Unfortunately, I cannot provide specific instructions of which key to hit or what specific menu this setting is located in, without knowing what specific box you have.
Not without accessing the firmware settings (a key at startup, which either flashes onscreen right at the beginning of the boot or must be found in the manual or online).
I have a system that has an option in the BIOS to choose boot type as "BIOS" or "UEFI".
No, it is not possible to boot to DOS while the option is set to "UEFI".
When I choose "UEFI" I can boot to an EFI startup.nsh script without problems.
