I tried to reinstall yum using rpm following the instructions here
But I access my server with KVM console, so I logged into my server to reinstall keyutils but yum is not working now.
So, I followed the instructions from here and removed the file, but I think i did not linked the libkeyutil with the previous version so when I restarted SSH, the server denided the access with a message i.e.
Unfortunately I restarted the server machine (I though it will configure itself), now apache cannot be started, it gives me the following error
If you did haver the compromised libkeyutils.so.1.9 library then you really should wipe it and reinstall from a known good backup.
I contacted cPanel for some issue, so they informed me that my server had been compromised and /lib64/libkeyutils-1.2.so.2 is the direct indication that the server has been hacked.
Can I get back the file i removed (which is /lib64/libkeyutils-1.2.so.2) ?
If you did not have the compromised libkeyutils.so.1.9 library on your system then you can download the CentOS 5.9 rpm for the libs from here or use wget to get it.
