The best way to remove it is by temporarily moving the sheet to a new workbook via right-click on the sheet-> Move or Copy ...
I solved it by deleting the sheet which had, at one point in time, had a pivot table on it.
Somebody posted an answer stating that they thought pivot tables were causing this message even when there is no external data.
That might work for you if you have many worksheets with many formulas like I did.
I was able to find the problem in a round-about way that might help someone else.
When I did that, I found where the external link existed in my document and was able to fix it.
There you delete the pivot table and move it back and then you can save the template again without the bug and without the need to delete the whole sheet.
(I would have written my contribution as a comment, if my reputation allowed it.)
Here's the comment I had intended to leave on their post:
By the time I verified for myself that this was correct, that answer had been deleted.
I decided to open the spreadsheet from a new computer and when I did that, I got a message that said the system couldn't update links and there was an option to look at the external link.
Pivot tables can cause this problem and even cleaning all fields and resetting all the formattings does not undo this problem (bug) and the error still comes at each save until the sheet is removed from the workbook.
