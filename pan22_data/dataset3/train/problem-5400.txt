), or to migrate (as both servers need to be running, and there's only one box).
The main reason for the upgrade is to lose the XP machines, so if we could connect the new machines to the existing server it would work for me...
I know that in the past there was the http://server-name/connect option for non Pro type OS's, is this still the case with 2016 of do we need to volume license for Pro?
Sorry about all the questions, but I'm a software guy and I'm panicking here.
I've backed up the users and profiles directories, which I'm guessing is where all the user data is held, but I don't know how to re-implement the base settings on the new server.
I've found (through Microsoft) that it's not possible to do this 'in-place' (though if anyone knows different then please let me know!
I'm the only IT guy on the ground and it's fallen in my lap to sort this out.
I have a 2008 R2 server which I've been asked to upgrade (for work) to 2016.
The boxes that connect to the current server are all running XP, and we have bought in a load of new Win10 boxes, but they are all Home Edition.
Is there a way to export / import settings and user data from one system to the other?
My server experience is limited to Apache, and I'm in way over my head on this one, so any help at all will be greatfully received.
