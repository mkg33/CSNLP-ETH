Child applications aren't automatically deleted and the IIS Manager can't display them in the tree, so that's your problem...
Step 1 - Create a temporary app pool - let's say "temp".
I understand that you can remove these phantom applications by recreating the application in IIS and then hitting Remove.
I have an application in one of my application pools that has a virtual path of '/Site/login.aspx'.
I did a combination of two answers listed above since I did not want to tinker applicationHost.config manually.
A quick and robust way is to use a PowerShell script to get all applications, test whether the physical path still exists and if not, delete the application:
That will get rid of the application from the pool but in this case I can't recreate the application due to the /login.aspx in the virtual path
    Move all the phantom applications to this temp app pool.
Step 3 - Use Powershell from one of the answers above -
I want to remove it but it no longer exists on my computer and it's causing me issues setting up AppFabric.
This is probably safer and simpler than editing applicationHost.config.
