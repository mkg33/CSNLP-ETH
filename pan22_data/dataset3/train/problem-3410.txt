Unfortunately, I cannot increase the disk space on this drive.
(virtual machine ID 17292200-wd22-dd22-d23-dddddd2222)
Whereas the total disk space on this drive (E) is 280 GB - the free space is only around 23 GB.
The VHD file for this VM is 128 GB and there are two AVHD files of 58 and 75 GB.
If you don't care, you can re-import the VM with a new ID.
I restarted my Host server after shutting down three guest VMs.
Based on the scenario and the discussion in the comments, I would attempt to import the exported VM as Hyper-V exported it.
I understand that the error is caused by the unavailability of the required disk space.
I exported this VM to D drive and then tried to add the copied AVHD files but it gives me a similar error.
Please provide read/write access to the attachment.
You will want to delete the previous machine's configuration from Hyper-V before importing the VM, if you want to keep the same VM ID.
You may need to adjust the location of files in the .exp file.
After I restarted the machine I tried to start the VMs and got an error stating the the VM failed to start.
However I have another drive (D) that has 400 GB of free space.
