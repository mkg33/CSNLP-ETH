If this box is simply going to throw a windows event when SMART reports a failing drive then it's far too late.
You replace the failed hard drive and the rebuild the RAID.
A hard drive is many times more likely to fail than any other computer component.
Most adaptors or onboard controllers will send warnings via syslog, windows events or email.
With the proper RAID setup you are protected against data loss when this occurs.
Measure the marginal cost of a RAID setup (probably less than $500, assuming a low to medium-end server) with the value of your data.
By going to a RAID, you're protecting against the one problem that's most likely to happen.
Evan talked about being off-site and offline, and I'd add redundancy to that list.
With out RAID protection when you hard drive dies (at it will die at some point) then you have lost your backups.
Redoing the backups has to take longer (man hour cost) than a raid controller and a few extra SATA drives.
It absolutely makes sense to use RAID on your back server since you plan on storing the data on the server, and not tape.
I agree with what's been said already, but if you are using a raid with parity there's going to be a way of monitoring the health of the drives and your backup data.
Not using RAID at all may be acceptable, depending on whether you're using your backups as a de facto archiving solution or not.
Having said that, I second what Evan Anderson said above.
You need to have multiple copies of your backups in case of failure of your backup media, backup job, theft, loss, dropped media, etc.
