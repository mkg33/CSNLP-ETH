The precense of xt_time in the kernel, and being available in the distributed Debian kernel
I suspect the fact that is no in the stable kernel is a big enough warning to deter most people.
If you are willing to roll up your sleeves and do some back-porting, you may be able to get it to work for whatever kernel you are currently running.
Probably, but like many of the obscure features, it probably isn't being used by many people.
Building/patching a kernel is not a trivial task to be undertaken lightly.
The main functionality of netfilter is fine, and the most of the docs from years ago are just as useful today.
It appears to be compiled in and functional on the current Debian Lenny kernel.
If you want to donate some of your time to the cause, I bet they would accept some help in getting things up to date.
does seem to indicate that it can be applied and is functional.
If someone doesn't want to write or update documentation, then nobody will.
It appears to have been in there since October 2007.
It appears that a equivalent feature (xt_time) is now part of the kernel.
You could send them a nice email and ask them to at least put something on the page about the old system being obsolete.
I believe if you are looking at using xt_time without a lot of work, then you need to be looking at 2.6.24+.
