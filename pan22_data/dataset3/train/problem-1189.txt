I've tried <M-Right> and <T-Right> but those don't work either.
I've tried everything, setting the option key as "Normal", "Meta" and "+Esc" in the profile settings.
I'm having trouble trying to map the alt-key bindings on vim in iTerm2.
There are posts on superuser and stackoverflow but they use the old version of iTerm2 (v0.x).
Your right arrow mapping, for example, can be typed like this:
Since Mac OS X uses the option key to insert characters, regular <A-[key]> mappings won't work.
I use map <C-l> <C-w>l (and likewise for h, j, k) instead, as it keeps my hands on the keyboard.
The only things I've managed to get working are <T-up> and <T-down>, or when I just use Macvim.
Most vim users would suggest, however, that you not use the arrow keys for this (or anything).
I want to map shortcuts for switching between buffers like this:
Note, however, that you can't copy and paste the above, as ^[ is one character in vim, but is here represented with two characters.
I'm using iTerm2  v1.0.0.20120203, and Mac OS X 10.7.5 on a Macbook Pro.
