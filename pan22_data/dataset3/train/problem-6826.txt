But this doesn't tell us much, it certainly seems possible that someone could develop a tool for SmartOS to reverse engineer it, but the tools you mentioned do not seem to do that.
When you have ZFS root pools you can just create a new BE, make your changes, lucompare and send that to DIY monkeyscripts which can spit out your Puppet modules.
One unreasonable way I've found that could work for Solaris global zones would be to create differential flars (one from the beginning, then one afterwards), then extract the differential flar's cpio archive and pass it to a DIY monkeyscript that would create a Puppet module.
I wasn't able to find clear docs on the manifest functionality via Google searching, but this seems logical to me.
The core puppet tools do not do reverse engineering, from what I have read about blueprint, it is limited to systems based on rpm/deb packaging systems, which is not used by SmartOS.
This is an area where I've been met with a great deal of frustration in Solaris.
But again that doesn't help with non-global zones.
Given great packages like blueprint, does Puppet have the ability to reverse-engineer a machine config?
I'd use blueprint except I'm not sure it works on SmartOS/Solaris.
I am not aware any tool that does work for SmartOS.
