I was given an old server from work that I wanted to convert to a home file server.
You'll want to use the one without any number on the end.
So I wanted to just do a clean install of Ubuntu server.
Run dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<name from above command> bs=1024 count=1024 to clear the partition table.
1 is obviously not helpful here, 2 just gives me a blank screen, and 3 tells me that "No root file system is defined."
Go to the bottom and find the entry for entering a shell.
Problem is, when I get to the partition screen I don't get the normal options.
Run cat /proc/partitions to get a list of what drives have been found on the system.
You should see one there that is pretty obviously the system disk.
If I were to make a guess I would say that the hard drive is most likely encrypting and perhaps that is causing the problem?
The installer should see it now as a blank and unpartitioned disk.
I can probably get the root password to the machine if I have to.
I have no interest in the data that's already there.
Instead of getting the normal options, its skips straight to the confirmation screen and I have 3 options:
You'll get a warning about returning to the installer, then you'll be dropped to a shell.
