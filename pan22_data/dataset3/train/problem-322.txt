Photoshop Organizer was running in the backbround, and when I killed that process, cut and paste worked fine.
Open Task manager and start end application one by one til you find the one causing the issue.
I often find that if I try more than one browser I'll find one that handles the copy and paste of the custom background formatting better.
For example, on some websites IE8 recently began replacing spaces in the filename with with plus symbols when downloading files.
It turned out to be Photoshop Elements Backup that was running in background that was the problem.
Hope one of these suggestions makes things a little easier for you!
Third, if it's not a massive table-formatted selection, try pasting into Wordpad (instead of Notepad), then copy and pasting from Wordpad to Word.
This extremely annoying problem was completely resolved by pasting the URL into Firefox and downloading the file from there.
Wordpad can often preserve significant portions of the formatted structure of your paste selection.
Second, if you're using a firewall, try denying Word 2007 access to the internet.
Some of the data that you can copy from Excel/Word can be extremely large because it saves all of the markup as well as the plaintext.
I've got three solutions to suggest (apart from going back to using an Abacus or your fingers).
Notepad will strip out ALL formatting and it may take you much longer to fix your pasted text from Notepad than the original wait pasting directly to Word.
Its a frustrating mix of no web-page formatting standards, browser/OS ability, and an overly-helpful Office 2007.
I know this was an old link, but I just had the same issue.
I had the same issue - copy and paste within Office 2007 (any program) was taking forever.
First, try to select/copy/paste with a different web browser.
