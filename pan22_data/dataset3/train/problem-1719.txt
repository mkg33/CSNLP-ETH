increasing the frequency is not going to damage the motor.
Here is some info on selecting the right frequency
Because the motor is being turned on and off, if it is not mounted properly there will be more vibration then when it is fully on (connected directly to the battery)    Obviously how much vibration is "normal" is not something that can be asked or answered unless you have a way of measuring that, and specs of the motor that reflect how much vibration there should be.
I'm driving a 24V motor like this using this motor driver connected to a RPi B+.
I tried to increase PWM frequency until 10 KHz and vibrations seems to reduce but I'm afraid this can damage the motor.
The frequency is how often the motor is being turned on and off, and the PWM value is the amount of one time period the motor is either on or off.
Can you suggest me the right values to use for the given motor?
I'm controlling it with Python and PWM with the following snippet:
The motor spins but produces a lot of vibrations so I'm not sure I'm doing it the right way.
