So it's not something to install on Mom's computer and walk away.
ZoneAlarm does offer more refinement and reporting of what is running and trying to access the network, though.
Where Zonealarm or other firewall products step in is to give you better visibility and control over what's making connections, in particular outbound connections.
For home systems, for example, you normally have a limited number of systems inside the network, and those few systems are in turn shielded by a NAT'ed router.
It's been awhile since I used ZoneAlarm but that's what I remember of it.
I often wished the controls to Windows' built-in firewall were like ZoneAlarm.
Average users will just click through whatever pops up.
Plus ZoneAlarm gives you more control, which means it's more confusing for the layperson.
As Bart points out, the down side is that you can get bombarded with "Do you want to allow xyz.exe to access the internet" and it can be confusing for a technical person, let alone someone who just wants to surf the web in peace and safety.
If you want to keep people out then the Windows firewall is just fine (arguably you don't even need that if you're behind a NAT'ing firewall/router).
As I recall it was more involved to set up (it would prompt me when any new program or updated program was trying to access network functions) and you would allow/disallow individually; it gave statistics on what is running, and you could "shut down" network access for everything with a click.
They both perform similar functions, but man...process explorer is nicer.
I thought of it as kind of like Process Explorer from Sysinternals is to Task Manager.
Windows firewall works, but reporting tends to suck, and it's not quite as fine-grained.
