I have a home server with several programs with web interfaces running on it.
so what i want to do is somehow give my computer a second ip on my local network, make traffic on one of those ips go through my vpn, have traffic go through the non-vpn ip by default, and bind the one sensitive program to the vpn connected interface.
this sensitive program has a web interface as well which currently is unreachable from outside my local network.
but if I am able to have different ip addresses I should be able to bind the web interface to the non-vpn but transfer the data through the vpn.
This program however allows me to bind it to an ipv4 address.
any ideas on how to do this or perhaps a simpler way to solve my problem?
I currently have a workaround in place by running a virtual machine with the one sensitive program on it and it connected through vpn but that wastes resources and has a drawback.
My vpn only allows one port to be forwarded however so I can't access all my web interfaces through the vpn from outside my network.
I want to access all these web interfaces from outside my local network.
