None of the IP addresses on these logs belong to me or are assign to any of my devices.
My remote sites have their own routers with their own internet connection.
We don,t really use it for anything other than an IPSEC tunnel back to HQ to use as a backup WAN link..
My OUTSIDE interface is what has my public IP address block assigned to it.
I have a Cisco ASA that gives me some sylogs that I do not understand.
So anytime their public IP is pinged, scanned, and so forth, the replies are going out using the default route learned by EIGRP, which goes over our WAN line to my CORE switch then out to the internet through my ASA firewall.
I use EIGRP to build my route tables, so these routers at my remote sites happen to not have a static default route.
My INSIDE interface is where all my private IP addresses reside for the enterprise i work for.
I often see the following logs which I do not understand, a routable IP address is being sourced on the INSIDE interface with a destination to another routable public IP on the OUTSIDE interface.
As soon as I add a static default route at each remote site the problem, so far, goes away.
