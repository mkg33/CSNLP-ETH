I'm using the Cloudbees Docker Build & Publish plugin to build container images and publish them to a registry.
Using https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Amazon+ECR with the Docker Build and Publish plugin works just fine.
Is there a way to generate permanent ECR login tokens, or somehow automate the token generation?
To use ECR instead of my private registry, I've ran the AWS CLI command aws --region us-east-1 ecr get-login which spews a docker login command to run - but I just copied out the password and created a Jenkins credentials of type "Username with password" from that password (the username is always "AWS").
So right now, I have to manually regenerate the password twice a day and update the Jenkins credentials screen manually, otherwise my builds start failing.
I'm trying to integrate Amazon's new Elastic Container Registry (ECR) with my Jenkins build service.
This is now possible using amazon-ecr-credential-helper as described in https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/authenticating-amazon-ecr-repositories-for-docker-cli-with-credential-helper/.
The problem is that the ECR password generates by the AWS CLI is only valid for 12 hours.
