Here's some info about it: http://lifehacker.com/198532/geek-to-live--tech-support-with-ultravnc-singleclick
It's been pretty flawless for us for connecting to remote users.
Actually it worked well but I understand that it's a more complicated solution than teamviewer, logmein etc.. (that could be used easily also for one-time-assistance)
Ultra VNC's 'Single Click' might be what you're looking for.
I've used TeamViewer in the past without any issues on Vista clients or 64 bit.
Unfortunately I dont remember how much this software costed (they bought it before i joined their team) but i think it was not so cheap.
PS I think that NetSupport created an online control of its software like LogMeIn, but i couldnt find it, maybe they've stopped.
It let's your client (user) launch an executable (no install needed) that opens up a connection (out) to a listening server on your end.
Their pricing is very reasonable and I've never had any trouble with it.
A couple of years ago in my previous job we used NetSupport Manager (I think it was v8 or v9).
LogMeIn Express is new and free -- and rather slick.
It gets around firewalls and implements a custom VNC-based system.
So when the notebook was in our LAN we could reach the computer using the native control protocol while when it was outside our network its client automatically connected to our gateway and we could see and control it via internet just like it was inside.
It had a "gateway" function that could bypass firewalls.
