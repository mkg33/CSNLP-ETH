( @keltari certainly has a point about doing a cost benefit analysis.
You didn't say why you wanted to reduce power consumption.
Running your machine at full power for an hour will cost an average of $0.11.
You can probably tweek it using power management settings and turning off the monitor/dimming the screen and disabling fancy screensavers.
Also maybe you can script the uploads and turn off/hibernate the system once its done.
Assuming a more realistic 250 watt draw including cooling, at 11c / kwh and 8 hour night you would be paying about US$6.70 per month, so you would be looking at a multi year payback on any hardware, ignoring the hassle/multistep costs.
Your computer/os should largely do this for you - particularly if its a modern Intel CPU.
Let's also assume you have a super-beefy power supply, say 1000 Watts.
If you want something with more significant powersavings (or if you have an old PC) , maybe rig a Raspberry Pi box up as a NAS and do the upload from that instead of your main PC.
Changing CPU scaling and reducing frequencies can help as well here.
If you are looking to save money, you aren't going to be saving much, depending on your region.
Ofcourse if you are paying $0.50 per kwh from a generator/off grid system the numbers may stack up differently. )
