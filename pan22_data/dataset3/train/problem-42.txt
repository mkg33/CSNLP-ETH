Psuedo code for this might be something like this...
Case 1, the user presses and holds the horizontal movement key.
Case 2, the user releases the horizontal movement key.
Assuming the user is holding down a movement key, acceleration should cancel out the friction and keep the user at maximum speed, but if the user releases the movement key, friction will apply every update until the character comes to a stop.
This is an example, not guarenteed to be most efficient.
The best way to implement this would be through utilizing acceleration, which is linked to the controls, as opposed to using methods on button release.
  Now suppose we want the player to slow down over the course of 1s, so t is a real number between
 we need to parameterize our velocity vector V by time.
On every update loop, apply friction, then acceleration, then cap the speed.
  In this case our movement varies with respect to time since the key has been released.
  In this case our movement is taken by adding the vector V to the objects position.
Lets break this down into a few cases while only considering movement in a single horizontal direct
