A lot of T1s are now HDSL circuits and use a single pair instead of two pair.
For a PRI, you often see 23 B channels to carry calls or data and 1 D channel for control.
A T1 line will normally give you 1.5Mbps in both directions.
A T1 line will give you a noticeable speed increase because you can send data at the same rate as you receive it.
In today's technological age there are T-1 approximate circuits, where they are providing you T-1 speed and guarantees, but might not be using the actual T-1 technology.
Normal cable internet gives you a high download speed (3Mbps+) but slower upload speed (500Kbps).
There are 24 bi-directional 64kbps channels on a T-1, and an 8kbps framing bit for timing.
B8ZS/ESF "clear channel" uses 64k channels while AMI/D4 uses 56k channels (8k is used for control).
Depending on the provisioning, it can provide different bandwidths and you won't get the full 1.544Mbps for your use.
According to Wikipedia T1 provides 1.544 Mbits/s of bandwidth both directions.
It can be used fully up or down, or at any feasible combination of speeds in between but always maxing out at 1.536Mbps due to the 8kbps framing bit used to keep timing on the circuit.
This is AT&T's spec for the origination of a T-1 circuit:
24 channels * 64kbps each = 1536kbps + 8kbps = 1.544Mbps total CAPACITY.
Sending mail, moving files, FTP, uploading pictures or videos, and torrenting are all uses you would see a very noticeable speed increase.
Sometimes you'll use fewer channels, such as a fractional T1.
An example would be CenturyLink's Private Line service, defined as:
The bolded part is the clarity some may be looking for.
