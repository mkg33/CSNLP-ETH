So, whenever I don't need Linux I should be able to uninstall it as any other program.
As the other guys said, what you need is exactly a tool hosting other OSs on the Windows simultaneously which for that there are very popular tools, VMware workstation and VirtualBox.
As I am planning to learn Linux thought of installing it.
There are many Linux virtual appliances ready to use, which you can run in the free VMware Player.

there is the detailed procedure for installing ubuntu via virtual box with each and every step (with images).
Alternatively, you can run Linux natively inside Windows using andLinux.
VMware fusion is another powerful tool which you can use to install linux it gives better options and features then free applications but you have to pay for it.
Ubuntu, Debian, Redhat are a number of most popular distros of Linux.
Although VirtualBox is free but it doesn't show that it certainly is better than VMware.
Anyway, there are many webpages comparing them with each other.
In fact, choosing one distro among others depends on the where you work.
Instead I want to use it when I am on windows 7 as a separate window.
