(The current name isn't even really all encompassing since the class can get the Linked List from the BST as well.)
The class is called SortedLinkedListToBalancedBST, which makes me think that it is some kind of converter utility class.
Without a better understanding of the purpose of this class, I can't comment on the functionality and implementation, but I can talk about the style:
Is it a class which knows how to convert from a Linked List to a BST and vice-versa, or is it a BST which knows how to create a BST from a Linked List?
I'm going to post a simpler review than I would if I fully understood this class, but hopefully if you clarify some things, I (or others) can come back and review it more in-depth.
You need to decide what this class is going to be and then name it appropriately.
However, the class itself has a private member of TreeNode<T> and doesn't have any public methods which are static or return some kind of BST, so that makes me think that it is just a BST implementation which happens to know how to create a BST from a Linked List.
My main problem with this code, is that I don't know what it is trying to do.
But the class doesn't even have all the functionality of a BST!
