A call to Comcast telling them you found these errors will create a dispatch ticket and get it resolved.
Check the SNR levels again, if the are now acceptable, you have a problem with either the splitter or inside wiring.
You can also setup iperf/jperf to do a long running test.
It's a server/client program, so you would have to setup the server side at a friend's house etc.
If the signal doesn't clean up when you do this, you most likely have a problem with either the feeder cable (aerial/underground) coming to the house or something is wrong at the street level.
There are a couple things to check with a docsis modem.
If you found that the SNR levels were unacceptable, you can disconnect the splitters in the house going to the T.V's make a straight connection from the aerial/underground cable coming to the house directly to the modem.
Open a browser and go to 192.168.100.1, the last time I laid hands on a Comcast modem there was no user/pass to log into the modem diagnostics.
After that, check the log section for any "T" based errors, look for critical and severe.
Mid 30's for downstream is acceptable, 45+ on the upstream is about the upper limit before the modem starts creating noise.
Go to the diagnostic section, check the signal to noise ratios, this will let you know if you have a borderline failing signal strength.
My guess is that anything that would cause these hiccups would be in the log.
