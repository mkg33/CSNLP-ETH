However in my case This feature won't run its service vmware-hostd and any manual start of this service results in immediate stop.
Have you got the same admin rights on your workstation?
I scheduled the task to run as logon after 10 seconds (1s failed).
VMwareHostd didn't start up even though 'Automatic' was selected.
I don't know how it denied vmware workstation to startup the shared VM service, but I'm completely sure the problem was originated from this software.
sidenote: I've installed VMware workstation on another machine, but everything was OK there...
C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation>vmware-hostd.exe -u "C:\Program Data\VMware\hostd\config.xml" > d:\a.log
Program/script: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe, Add arguments: /C "net start VMwareHostd".
It seemed something was stopping VMUSBArbService from accessing a file.
VMUSBArbService also wasn't started, even though 'Automatic' was selected.
Review on the log file at C:\ProgramData\VMware\hostd\hostd-##.log shows two significant notes:
To use this feature VMware Workstation Server should be running, and it should be running by a default installation configuration.
I had the same issue where the service would not start, I deleted the datastores.xml, removed and reinstalled several times with different versions of Workstation from 12-12.52 and nothing.
It looks like some component are not working very well, so maybe a new install or update can fix your issue.
Of these two my guess is the second one trying to pinpoint the problem.
I had proxifier software which routed custom packets into a given socks proxy.
For the action I executed net start from the command line.
I've double checked for any process running on port 8307.
My guess is based on running the service manually using this command:
The solution was to create a scheduled task along the lines described in this SU answer.
Just randomly I changed the HTTPS port for sharing to any other number and Sharing and the Server Service started right up...
Try to remove the software and install it newly with admin rights.
Just go into C:\ProgramData\VMware\hostd folder and delete the datastores.xml FILE.
I suspect it was my BitDefender Antivirus, but I couldn't verify that assertion.
