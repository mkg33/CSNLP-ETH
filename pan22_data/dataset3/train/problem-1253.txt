As I'm using replication on two different servers, do you think it's a good practice to backup my data on the other server?
I'm looking for your point of view and suggestions :)
I have two databases master/slave (mysql replication) on each one of my app servers.
This question concerns best practices for mysql backup with replication and large number of databases.
Is there any others points that I should consider?
First, I will backup from the slave database following the principle of stopping temporary the replication and making a backup in "read only".
Is incremental backup something interesting for me?
The main goal is for sure to answers to server crash and to build a disaster recovery process, but before all that I'm more worried about my customers that messed up themselves their data.
I think that I have here to consider two different types of backup.
Or what would be the other solutions as a dedicated server and why?
Each databases includes around 100 tables and for the moment and I arrive to around 10mo to 30mo by database after mysqldump operation (uncompressed).
Currently I get a total of 500 databases and soon it will exceed 1K.
And the second type of backup would be a mysqldump of each databases that I will perform every 24 hours.
The first backup will be a backup of raw data files that I will perform let say every week (as I'm using replication I'm quite safe).
The backup of the database should not be done on the same server than the database itself.
I have one database by customer and one "admin" database.
