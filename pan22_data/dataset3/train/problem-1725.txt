After that, it was fairly easy to start stopping services on the old mail server one every few days to make it very easy to isolate problems.
This way, if you run into problems on the new server, you can just stop the TCP proxy and restart the old service while you fix the new service.
This allows you to get away with stale DNS records around the internet during the switchover.
I can't speak for the best solution, but two things helped me to really minimize any kind of downtime.
When changing IPs, I am a BIG fan of running a simple TCP proxy on the old machine for at least a few days.
Also, you can do things like start the service on the new machine, stop the old service, fire up the tcp proxy, and THEN change the DNS.
Any suggestion is very appreciated, especially keeping into account problems related to SSL certificates, IP address, DNS issues and so on.
(this also let me move mailboxes one at a time to get the activesync users set up individually)
User account, aliases,and domains migration is not a real problem at the moment instead.
What are the steps for a safe and reliable migration of a mail server from an old hardware to a new one, being changed OS, SW and so on?
Once the new machine is installed, the software is semi-configured what is the best way to replace the old server having the lowest down time ?
