I eventually solved this by using the following advice and settings from the open-iscsi documentation:
If so, it's looking like this write error is being passed up to the domU.
Setting up in this fashion could prevent the segfault in the above situation when combined with the other suggestions.
Best practices security wise state you should have "/" mounted ro, and that any filesystems that need rw should be mounted seperately, (i.e, /var and /tmp).
The domU doesn't "know" that it's an iSCSI device, so it's behaving as though the underlying disk had gone away and remounting the filesystem read-only (see mount(1) manpage - errors=continue / errors=remount-ro / errors=panic)
Are there any messages in dom0 indicating any sort of read/write errors or scsi errors at the time of the failover?
You mention that "all other I/O is failing" at this time - do you mean the domU or dom0?
If there are directories under /etc that need writing to, they should be moved to /var/etc/path and symlinked to /etc.
After setting up the connection to each LUN as described above, the failover works like a charm, even if it takes several minutes to happen.
Um...Part of the problem is also that you aren't running / as RO.
Usually when setting up an HA iSCSI solution I use multipathing rather than virtual IP takeover - it allows greater visibility to the host and you don't have an iSCSI session suddenly disappear then needing to be restarted - it's always there, there's just two of them.
From the dom0's perspective, it won't get changed to read-only - this read-only behaviour is a filesystem semantic, not a block device semantic.
"/" should only be mounted RW in single user mode.
