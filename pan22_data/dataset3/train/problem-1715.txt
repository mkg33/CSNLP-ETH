So we wanted to conduct a 3rd-party testing on a scheduled basis (probably 3-4 times a day only), with tests like "login and change online store", "place an order using specials", etc.
The have a transactional test you can run which will allow you to script out a series of events.
I need to test order process on one of the websites.
Website has been built and hosted at this one company.
We have seen it, but the developer company doesn't believe us.
One example is Selenium, basically you record a script of actions, and it will perform the actions and give you the results.
I don't know of any third party services that will do it for you, but there are various tools you can set up to run automated tests.
One other alternative that's a bit more DIY but could be a great learning experience, is to leverage Davr's idea but run the Selenium tests via cron in something like EC2.
Gomez provides a similar service that allows you to use Selenium to script and craft your tests.
I record a small set of actions, then run them in a loop to generate performance data etc.
We use it in house to login to an online learning application and run through several processes before logging out.
Problem is, website used JavaScript to make selections and few services I tried (site24x7.com being the best) don't seem to give me the results.
The nice thing about it is that it will time the steps as well as the whole event with nice detailed charts which you can look at by hour, day or month.
Website customers are complaining that ordering is very slow.
Thus it can work with javascript, html, or flash applications with no problem.
I don't find it as robust as Selenium, but iMacros is a free addon for Firefox (and/or IE) that will let you record and perform "macros" within the browser.
