You state "computer" and not laptop, I believe anyone would assume this to be a desktop or tower PC.
Condensation will only appear if the water in the air gets in a hot/cold situation.
While powered, the internal environment of the PC would get warmer, not colder.
Since the computer runs at a warmer temperature that the surrounding environment it is unlikely to attract condensation.
Humidity (the amount of water in the air) can be a problem though.
Around 25Â°C is a perfectly safe temperature for your computer to run at.
Half the function of the ac is to not only reduce the temp, but reduces humidity in the area it is operating in.
Secondly, you need a really high humidity for this to be a problem.
There's no such thing as too cold when it comes to electronics.
As mentioned above it is usually heat rather than lack of it which is a problem for electronics.
You could look into a dehumidifier but this is most likely unnecessary unless you are in a tropical climate and would cost to run.
That being said, a PC that resides in an environment will have that environments ambient temp and relative humidity when it is not operating.
But with the case closed, there shouldn't be any water in the air in the first place.
So for cooling any further to reduce condensation damage, it will not make a difference while the PC stays in the same environment.
But note that if you have your computer case closed, cold alone will not cause condensation to appear.
You state you have and AC and do not wish to run it colder; then don't.
This is important because you may have some issues if you were to tote a portable item from a cool environment to a humid one.
