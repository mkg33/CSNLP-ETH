MonoDevelop 2.4 has an option in Preferences to override the GUI language.
So, the easiest way to change the menu language in MonoDevelop without changing the system preferences is to remove or rename the German localization so that the app will fall back to using the US menus.
Then navigate to the Resources subdirectory, find German.lproj (or something similar - I don't have MonoDevelop) and rename it.
On the Mac, applications try to follow the system wide language preference provided that they have the corresponding localization.
You'll need to run the program with the appropriate environment variables to tell gettext which translation to load/use.
cefstat is right, the actual path is Contents/MacOS/share/locale/**
Here is some documentation on gettext environment variables.
Reading this mail from Miguel, you have to change the LANG environment variable LANG to LANG=en_US.UTF-8.
I'm not familiar with Mac, but the linux terminal way would be prepending LANG=en_US.UTF-8 exactly before the command which changes this variable for the executing application.
LANGUAGE=en_US would be a good place to start, unfortunately I don't have an OSX machine to verify, let us know what works.
To do this: control-click the icon for the MonoDevelop application and choose "Show Package Contents".
