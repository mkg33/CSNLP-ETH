In-between the two above commands, check that the folder
That created a script /temp/fix.sh in a folder /temp that is shared between cygwin and wsl via symbolic links.
If not, move its contents to temporary storage and delete later
Okay, I accepted that and re-installed coreutils as a last step of this procedure (see below).
Thereby, wbash told me that it had permission problems for bin/head.
There are no permission problems with cygwin under $HOME/AppData/Local/lxss/rootfs/usr/bin and I did some tests with playground folders of wsl under cygwin.
I don't know exactly how WSL does its emulation of Linux permissions.
In the bash of cygwin I went to $HOME/AppData/Local/lxss/rootfs/usr and run the following command:
If it uses the Windows mechanism of ACL, you could reset them all by :
and without better knowledge of how these permissions are implemented,
There I moved bin out of the way and re-named bin-fix to bin.
where it emulates Linux permissions which do not natively exist on Windows.
Next I closed all wbash applications and wbash itself and went back to cygwin where the usr folder was still open.
In wbash I went to /usr/, created the folders fix and fix/bin, run the script, and moved the directory fix/bin to bin-fix.
As I already mentioned above I re-installed coreutils as a last step:
As you have verified that the problem is not with Windows,
I re-started wbash and voil√° everything runs fine and ls /usr/bin works.
