which offers both the failover and geodns capability.
I can't speak to how either would handle a DoS attack, but I suspect they're both quite familiar with mitigating them.
Once you factor in free support and the pay as you go metering, it might even be the cheaper alternative.
You probably won't go wrong choosing either - so why not choose both (or another pair of reputable DNS providers)?
The few times I've needed to contact support, their replies have been prompt and helpful.
If you can make two providers work together to provide DNS for your site, you remove your DNS provider as a single point of failure.
It's all about which solution best fits your needs.
UltraDNS's service was great from a technical point of view - and I'm sure it has only gotten better - but we parted ways over a billing error of their making.
(I'm sure they've got this issue sorted out by now, otherwise they'd be out of business.)
Not sure who your UltraDNS rep is, but I would look forward to reviewing your quote and answering any questions you have about UltraDNS and our position in the marketplace as well.
We all have different reasons for being in the industry and all offer something different.
DNSMadeEasy comes in at a substantially lower price point, as you've noticed, and I've had no complaints about their service in the five or so years I've used them.
We believe an educated consumer is the best kind of consumer!
I've used both UltraDNS and DNSMadeEasy, although it has been years since I used UltraDNS.
As you mention, UltraDNS has GeoDNS - although it's on DNSMadeEasy's road map (http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/technology/roadmap.html), as well - and I suspect their anycast network may be larger than DNSMadeEasy's, but I don't know that for certain.
Ultimately, I expect the difference in price reflects the market each is targeting.
