Sprinkle seems to be all about fluid/water dynamics.
But this time, I'm having trouble thinking of any games that use the flow of water as a primary mechanic.
I'm not yet sure if it should be a puzzle game, a platformer, or what.
Fluidity/Hydroventure is a platform game for the Wii (and later - the 3DS) co-developed by Nintendo.
Usually, when brainstorming a game, I try to find games with similar mechanics to see what is done well, poorly, etc.
I'm in the very, very early brainstorming stages of a game which centers around the manipulation of water and the terrain around it.
I heard a lot of traps and other mecanics in MineCraft does profit from water physics.
You control a small body of water and move around by rotating the stage via the controller, to collect more water and manipulate the environment.
Is there much reference material (of any kind) on the subject of water as a gameplay mechanic?
(i.e., changing the water's state between solid, liquid, gas; building up or tearing down hills to control its flow; and so forth.)
I wonder how's nobody did mention the "Where's My Water?
So, I'm asking around...  does anyone know of any games where controlling water is a major aspect?
