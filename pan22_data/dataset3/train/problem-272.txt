Please find the configuration to print the last configured interface below...
However, you can simply input the interface name again to ensure you're in the expected interface.
Technically with IOS 15.2, the answer is "yes, you can know what interface you're configuring" but admittedly my solution involves a rather unpleasant kludge-fix.
I use the following technique in some cases when I want to be absolutely sure I'm configuring the interface that I think I am.
IOS switches/routers do not have a command to show what sub-configuration mode you are in.
I know this technique is long-winded for the net vets, but it fits perfectly with the paranoid crowd which is sometimes both.
At this point, my answer is closer to proof-of-concept code, which has several caveats...
I never understood how this valuable feature has escaped IOS for so many years or I manged to never discover it.
I will demonstrate how to use EEM version 3.2 to print out the interface name that you last configured.
I need to give credit to Ivan Pepelnjak for his blog about _exit_status
I do not pretend this solution is perfect, but it gets the job done.
