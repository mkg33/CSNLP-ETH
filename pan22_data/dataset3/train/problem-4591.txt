There is, in short, no "once size fits all" answer to what is actually a very complex question.
But what does that really mean, I (like everyone else I guess) need a quiet yet good air flow fan.
The middle spot depends on your case and components.
Bigger fans will also push more air (higher CFM) for the same level of noise than a smaller fan.
Hotter components (faster processors, more disks etc) need more airflow than cooler components (eg laptop processors and SSDs).
Sure the lower dB the better and the higher the CFM the better, but it seems that if you want a quiet fan the air flow goes down and vice versa, so where's the middle spot?
I would strongly recommend you read Silent PC Review, where they review many components and you'll get a better feel for what makes a good (and bad) fan (or other item).
You'll want quieter fans if the computer is going to sit in a living space.
Generally if you're looking at fans in the 20-30 dB range then they'll be quiet enough for most people in an "office" type environment.
Significantly, the nominal dB and airflow ratings of fans often have little relation to how they behave once in a case.
It's all very well that the shopping results on newegg tell me how loud the fan is in dB and how airflow it does in cfm.
Different case designs need different levels of airflow to cool the same components.
