That page has an advertisement or a video that emits sound, so that suddenly mutes the headphone jack and puts the internal speakers on.
Also, because this laptop is much more powerful than my old computer I switched from Xfce4 to Cinnamon.
There is something with my system which I am finding extremely irritating.
Because I switched from a desktop computer my usage is a little different.
Use pavucontrol and pasystray for controlling volume settings continuously, or you can remove pulseaudio completely and using pure alsa, but it may do other annoying things.
Try to add jessie-backports repository and upgrade pulseaudio to 7.0.
Say I bring my laptop into my office, plug my screen, keyboard and speakers in, because I want to go to put some music on.
Fine, I'll fire up rhythmbox and find the playlist I want, and press play.
I did not mute it myself, but I think something muted it when I plugged the speakers in.
So I installed Debian Jessie, with the Cinnamon desktop, and my home partition was completely empty so that the configuration is now mostly the defaults.
It's a fact that pulseaudio is not so stable nowadays in all situations.
