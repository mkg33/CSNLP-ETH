L2TP and PPTP are other examples, but they are harder to make work and harder to cross firewalls and NAT.
There is nothing particularly wrong about using OpenVPN for this purpose.
IPSec is more mature than OpenVPN, but is heavier, have more overhead, and is a pain to configure and troubleshoot.
IPsec, while good theoretically, often takes more work to get through firewalls.
OpenVPN is great, but IMO, should only be used for remote worker type use cases, not for infrastructure.
They maintain an OpenVPN link so I can update, manage, and monitor them.
I have been unsuccessful looking for examples of other folks having done this.
It's a very mature technology that is baked into all modern OSes, and is a much better choice for "infrastructure" type VPN connections.
Setting up a simple management network over OpenVPN should be very easy.
I have a bunch of appliances I maintained deployed to customer's networks.
Configure OpenVPN with all security options turned on, create separate certificates to each client, configure the firewall on the VPN server to drop all connections to OpenVPN port and only accept from the IP of your servers.
