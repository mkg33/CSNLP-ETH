You split your VPN network into multiple /27 networks, each associated with a single server.
Your network infrastructure will need to have routes to all three servers.
If something here doesn't make sense or if you want me to go into more detail in a particular area let me know.
You haven't directly addressed the number of clients you have connected nor the size of your address space (nor whether your VPN is on a dedicated network or whether it shares the same address space as the rest of your office), so I'm making a bunch of assumptions that may very well not be correct.
You get three OpenVPN servers (with room for adding more since you're only using addresses up to 192.168.1.95 with this arrangement), or with room for more clients per server.
NB: written after too much gl√∂gg, so may need some syntax and/or fact checking.
An OpenVPN configuration for the first of these servers would include the following:
If it's acceptable for clients to get different addresses depending on the server to which they're connected, this is pretty easy to set up.
This is a brief overview of how you would set things up.
From the point of view of your applications, any connected client is on the same /24 network.
