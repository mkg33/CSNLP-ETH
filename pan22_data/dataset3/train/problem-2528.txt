If we are mentioning evil methods anyway: with some unmanaged switches overloading the CAM table can supposedly work, and is documented somewhere in tcpdump docs IIRC.
Simply installing Wireshark is not enough, some other action needs to be taken.
In both of the above situations, a machine with Ethereal (old name for Wireshark) could indeed snoop on the whole network.
Before that, some networks used coaxial ethernet with a common cable (and no hub or switch) that every station broadcast on and listened to.
In general, no, Wireshark can't sense that traffic.
Although this situation applies to very few networks these days, I mention it for context and to understand why the idea of using Wireshark to snoop on others is still in many people's heads.
If you're on a switched network (which is highly likely), and unless computer A is serving as the default route for computer B (unlikely), then no, computer A won't be able to see packets destined for computer B.
Otherwise, it'll only happen when the network is explicitly configured to let it happen.
Ten years ago, many networks used hubs, which were like switches but dumber, in that they reflected every packet onto every port instead of figuring out where each packet needed to go and sending it only there.
ARP Spoofing is the only way for a computer with no special network privileges to sniff another network node's traffic, and that depends on whether or not the network switch defends against that kind of action.
However... if your network supports it, the network itself can show Computer A the traffic for Computer B, and from there Wireshark can grab it.
And let's say I am looking at a Youtube video on the computer B.
