Also the IP might a proxy (public or not) or traffic routed through something like the tor network.
While Sascha is right, if you really want an rDNS lookup, simply concatenate (remove leading zeros) and reverse the ip before performing a standard DNS lookup at reversedIP.in-addr.arpa
One IP might be used for several DNS names which is usually the case for shared hosting.
Turns out that logresolve, part of the Apache distribution, does exactly what I asked for.
For example, to lookup 074.125.140.026, concatenate and reverse it, so that you perform a DNS lookup for 26.140.125.74.in-addr.arpa.
Takes a while on my daily logs, but gets me the info I'm looking for.
Anyway, even if you could do a reverse lookup against some dns servers, all you would achieve is a misleading statistic that can be more wrong than true.
There's also an option in the Apache server to do this automatically when logs are written, but 1) I don't have access to the server settings as this is a shared hosting environment, and 2) it would slow things down for users a tiny bit.
You'll get a PTR record with the registered domain name.
