Just google for "Repair corrupt Outlook PST files."
I then used Import to import that file into the Calendar folder in his Exchange mailbox.
The import routine complains that the import file doesn't contain calendar data (the file is 5 mb).
If it is then you could look at exporting just the calendar data to another PST folder and try importing that.
I recently migrated a user on Outlook with a pop account (PST file) to Exchange (OST file).
You could also try exporting to a differnt format such as .csv which you can open in excel/open office to prove that it contains data, and you can also import into the mailbox from this as well.
We need to import his contacts from the PST file to the new Calendar in his Exchange box.
I have seen this happen occasionaly when a .pst file is damaged but I cannot see this being to blame as you have only just exported.
My first suggestion would be to open the PST file up in Outlook and check that the calendar data is present.
I added the PST folder back into Outlook and did a file export of just the calendar items to a new PST file.
TechRepublic has a good article explaining the steps.
I used this method on another Outlook user going from POP to Exchange with no problems.
