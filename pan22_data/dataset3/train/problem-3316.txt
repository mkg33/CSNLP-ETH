If you place it within the "normal" path and lock down the permissions there's always a risk that someone at a later stage, perhaps trying to sort out some other problem, changes permissions and the changes propagate to your tree, which would be most undesirable.
Firstly, I'm a software developer and not qualified as any kind of system or server expert so I'm looking for advice in order to help me prevent faults on our server.
My personal feeling is that this kind of thing should be put in its own folder tree, because that just simply makes management far simpler and less error prone.
Or split them up and store the web service elsewhere?
Should the files be stored some place else all together?
This consists of a Windows Service (.NET), a Web Service (WCF), a shared Class Library, and a Database which will run on a Windows Server 2003.
Personally I would put the web components in their own directory under C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\websitefolder to make it easier to manage, secure, etc.
I've written a modular system to carry out certain tasks for us autonomously to prevent us from writing the same old code over and over again.
Specifically the web service - naturally the local service (and required shared library) are persisted (by default and convention) in the Program Files folder, but storing the web service here just seems absurd to me (even though we'd lock it down to appropriate use only).
