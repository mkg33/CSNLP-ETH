Getting an idea why you're in there would be a start to fixing it.
I'm assuming that this.m_generator is null, since I see from your code that the other values are correct.
See this post I wrote for more details about debuggers.
I've been stuck this evening on getting a Perlin Noise function to generate by itself.
When it breaks check the values of right, left, bottom, top and m_generator.
Look in the code an see where m_generator gets set, then you'll know what you need to do to set it properly.
I don't see it listed in the rest of your code provided, so is it initialized somewhere else?
Every time I run the program without adding to different types of noise together it calls an ArgumentException error.
When the debugger breaks, you can see the call stack.
The debugger is just about the programmers best friend.
You could also put some debug prints just before throwing the exception, and seeing what the values you have for those variables are.
I've checked and re-checked the code multiple times, so I'm not sure what is going on that is making the GeneratePlanar function call the ArgumentException error.
The call stack will show you all the function calls that have lead to this function being called.
Place a breakpoint on throw new ArgumentException();.
