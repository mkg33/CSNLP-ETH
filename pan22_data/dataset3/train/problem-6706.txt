Careful: you must already have connected via ssh to these two machines previously, i.e.
6) This can be simplified, either by assigning aliases to these two long commands, or by learning how to use the ProxyCommand option of ssh.
1) make sure you have set up password-less ssh on all three machines, i.e., using cryptographic keys;
5) But you can also jump from A to V via PC like this:
What this does is to start  at boot autossh, a smart program which keeps re-starting ssh if it is disconnected; the ssh connection is a reverse tunnel, all connections to localhost:8100 on A and V are automatically forwarded to PC's port which I called SSH_PORT OF_PC, you should substitute your values for this and for SSH_PORT_OF_A, SSH_PORT_OFV.
3) Put the private cryptografic keys of A and V in /home/Your_Name/.ssh.
2) downlaod the package autossh on machine PC; then make a file called auto1 with this content:
7) While this configuration works verbatim for me, this may be because there is a little something which I take for granted in my system but which is missing from yours.
and another file called auto2 with equivalent content:
4) Now you can connect from A (or V) to PC by means of
