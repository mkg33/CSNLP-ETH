Another plus is that they have come down in price very nicely, less than $200.
The advantage is that when one link goes down, there is nothing much to do as the Linux router will fail-over as well.
One easy way of sharing the connection is to get the Linux router to round-robin the internet connections through.
Once upon a time, I used an OpenBSD box with pf to load balance accross three lines.
If there are multiple people there, you'll get some load balancing, although individual downloads won't actually go any faster.
In our student house we had 3 DSL connections that were then tied together.

make sure you upgrade the firmware as this post recommends:

I have setup the Linksys RV042 multi WAN router for a few clients and it is very easy to setup, while being very powerful.
If you know your way around Linux, you can actually configure your routing so that it uses both your connections to access the Internet.
If you're the only person working there it's of no real benefit.
You can do site-to-site hardware VPN's with it, and it will load balance for you as well as automagically failover between the two DSL's if one fails.
(There's quite possibly a better way of doing this, I'm just mentioning what worked for me at the time)
