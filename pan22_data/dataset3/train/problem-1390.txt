You haven't specified what version of CentOS you're running but perhaps a yum install mysql will provide it for you.
please help me with how to run mysql after changing root's password.
You can use yum whatprovides to help find the package that contains a particular file e.g.
I am new to both linux and also mysql but somehow by obtaining help from net I have installed mysql v5.5 on redhat.
I tried searching mysqladmin by using command "find / -name mysqladmin" but it returned no result
or download from the mysql site and install using rpm command
In this particular case /usr/bin/mysqladmin is provided by package mysql-5.0.77-4.el5_6.6.x86_64 and
It starts fine, I have confirmed this by running command: "/etc/init.d/mysqld status"
There is no such directory like /usr/bin/local/mysql now.
If you don't know where the file you are looking fore resides then you can use something like
But I am not able to change password using command: mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password' It gives error : bash: mysqladmin: command not found.
Which may find other occurrences of a file called mysqladmin so it would be up to you to decide which package to install.
I have installed required packages as well: mysql-client, -server, -test, -devel, -shared, -embedded
All I can search on net is adding to path '/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin' but directory structure after installation mysql v5.5 has changed.
