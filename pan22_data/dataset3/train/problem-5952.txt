If you REALLY want to see that D:\Pocket\Test exists, just boot up using a Live CD and browse your Windows drive to D:\Pocket\Test.
For example, on all Windows versions "Documents" folder remains "Documents", but shows its name in current user's GUI language.
You have set the folder D:\Pocket\Test as your desktop folder.
Windows has an ability to set a "localized" name for special folders.
You can delete this desktop.ini file outright, but it is re-created automatically, sometimes.
So this is why you see this folder named "Desktop".
Now Windows Vista is masking the real folder and is showing you the logical folder that is the Desktop.
You changed the real folder it (effectively) points to, but you did not change the name of the special virtual folder that Windows Explorer shows you.
You can make sure that the desktop folder is indeed your D:\Pocket\Test by right clicking the Desktop folder and verifying the path in Properties.
"Desktop" is a special virtual folder (hence the different icon).
