Ideally a script to set the system for use as a home computer will ALL of the un-needed services uninstalled or locked off.
So you cannot remove their account or turn it off.
I cannot change their settings to take back control of my home computer.
If you delete the network settings it has to reboot and if you reboot it goes back to the hijack settings.
They use accounts above Admin so as to lock me out to change them.
Anyone have any such configuration script that would free my computer?
Services are added that I don't need, password protected with their accounts and dependencies are changed so if you can turn off a service the hijack depends on it will turn off other services you must have.
A script that could put all settings and services back to original default and delete any startup or autorun scripts that could reconfigure the system would help.
The network is hijacked and encrypted and sent usually ip v6 sometimes through my ip4 port.
They also grey out the ability to change some of the services.
My win 7 ultimate computer has been professionally hijacked and configured to limit local access, windows, tools, etc.
Is there a script that could put win 7 ult back in my control and delete the services that a stand alone home computer not a client or server computer or on any group need that would prevent this hijack.
