If the connection goes through a lot of processing through routers and switches, especially heavily used or underpowered ones, the latency will increase.
That being said, geography is not always the determining factor for latency.
To check latency over time, I recommend Matt's Traceroute: http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/
Latency is dependent upon the quality of the connection between two points.
Also, for reliability's sake, you might want to think about the St. Andreas fault line.
It looks like your route to NewYork jumps on a nice backbone straight away and your physical location in New York has a very good connection to that backbone.
It's not just about distance and the speed of light: the physical implementation of each interface along the route might have a bad influence of the trip time.
Also, how is it that you're running a test FROM each datacenter?
My ISP's connection from my office to our T3 provider in our datacenter routes my traffic from Cleveland to Chicago and back to Cleveland.
Latency is often caused by the number of network hops it takes to reach your target machine, but there is a large array of factors that can come into play.
While the first datacenter may be physically/geographically closer, that doesn't mean that the path is shorter.
