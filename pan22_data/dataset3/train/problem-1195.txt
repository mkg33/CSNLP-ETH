Might want to check mail logging - may have massive useless connection log files.
Turn off mail connection logging: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/223390/huge-apple-mail-logs-connection-logging-enabled
DaisyDisk is another good tool for helping you to visualize how much disk space is being taken up by what kinds of files.
It can also help remove things left behind when you just dragged a file to the trashcan and didn't remove all the other files that might be associated with it but are in other directories.

I just free'd up over 650Gb of space by removing the log files and turning off connection logging.
I like to use CleanMyMac 3.app to take a look at my disk usage and help me clean up any disk space that could be reclaimed.
The problem for me was a deleted user account folder that was retained.
This includes unused language files in the system, huge system log files that need to be trimmed/rotate/deleted, user cache files, mail attachments, left over iPhoto junk, left over iTunes junk, empty trash bins, large and old files that may not be needed any more, etc....
In my case, the folder was called Macintosh HD/tim (deleted).
