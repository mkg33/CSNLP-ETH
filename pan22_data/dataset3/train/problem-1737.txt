While I don't know why your problem started occurring, I would suggest splitting your DHCP up by having the remote devices handle a designated segment of your overall DHCP scope.
The tunnel negotiation would succeed a few seconds later, the tunnel would be strong on both ends, but the remote clients would have invalid IP addresses.
To diagnose, I would grab one of the computers with the problem and renew the IP address while monitoring the firewall log.
8 hours is 28,800 seconds, or the default lifetime of an IPSec tunnel.
After more investigation, I concluded that the remote clients lost their IP addresses precisely 8 hours after the last time I rebooted their firewall.
This renegotiation would take more than 2 seconds, and the remote firewall would think the tunnel was broken and try to hand out a local IP address to its clients.
Or simply check the firewall log around when the users arrive, or when the systems renew their DHCP lease.
The remote office firewall was configured with conflicting settings.
The 169.X.Y.Z APIPA addresses would only be appearing as a result of a lack of connectivity between your computers and the DHCP server.
Basically, every 8 hours, the two firewalls would renegotiate their encryption.
A quick workaround (but not without issues) might be to simply configure static addresses while you diagnose the problem.
On the one hand, it was supposed to acquire and distribute IP addresses from my corporate DHCP server through the firewall.
This would also provide some backup in the event of connectivity issues between sites, at least as far as keeping the remote networks running.
On the other hand, it was configured to supply local IP addresses in the event the tunnel failed.
