It's a widely researched area so there should be plenty of research on how to best deal with 'so-so' responses.
Later I found out that "Regular", was the default response for the survey question.
I was thinking in a simple threshold-based approach (If the community has more than 50% of non-default responses, it is not indifferent), but I was wondering if there is a more principled way.
I'd recommend converting your responses to the Likert Scale and going from there.
I have data for a product rating survey, which requires the respondents to rate a product in five levels: Very Bad, Bad, Regular, Good and Very Good.
Is there a proper way of identifying the communities that are indifferent to the survey, so they can be excluded?
This survey was applied to several communities of clients.
After taking a look on the data, I observed that a lot of communities have an overwhelming "Regular" preference for the product.
Apparently, in some communities user's just didn't bother and left all the questions in the default value.
