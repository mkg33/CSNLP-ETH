Please also note that SQL actually operates not with relations but multirelations which are bags(multisets) of tuples(rows).
Set operations are the most basic and vague way of looking at the query on hand.
This is not really very insightful, because the whole mathematics is written in set language.
The structure of the basic building block - relation - is described in set language, but that's about it.
It is common wisdom that database field is firmly grounded in the two math disciplines: predicate logic and set theory.
You are doing nothing but a cross product on the data.
However, this is very fuzzy observation, and reality is more subtle.
A statement like SELECT * FROM myTable is like a set $\{ x: x \in \text{myTable} \}$.
There were various attempts at rigorous theory of multirelations, with provenance semiring being the most recent development
by cantor diagonalization) since $|\mathbb{R}| > |\mathbb{Z}|$ in cardinality.
Therefore, its algebra is not a [boolean] algebra of sets.
In any case, do any theories of SQL exist that compare it to set theory?
The fact that probably caught your attention is that the foundation of SQL - relational algebra - has distinct Boolean flavor.
Good article describing SQL and No-SQL databases as categorical duals.
$$ zicodes \subseteq \text{cities} \times \text{states} \times \text{zips} \simeq \{a, \dots, Z\}^{30} \times \{a, \dots, Z\} \times \{1, \dots, 10^5\}$$
My theory has limitations, since you can't store all of $\mathbb{R}$ as a SQL database (e.g.
I have been learning about SQL and at times it feels like set theory.
We could define a table called zipcodes with a schema city STRING(30), state CHAR(2),  zip INTEGER(5)  then in set theory we could define the zipcodes stable as:
A table could be defined as any subset of the Cartesian product.
