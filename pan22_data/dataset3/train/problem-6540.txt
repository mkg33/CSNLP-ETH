I checked my directories and saw that /dev/md3 was full (logs and websites was filling the space completely) here's what it shows:
For apache2 you could just create a folder /home/www with user permissions for www-data and adjust the Directory directive of you apache vhost file to point to that folder.
I wrongly configured it at the beginning, today I got a php error saying that there was no space left on the device.
I cleared some logs and files and saved 3gb, but I would like to ask if someone can point me in the right direction, I know that I never had to install my lamp stack as root in this folder but didn't realize, I have lot of space on /dev/md4, is there any solution to move my lamp stack and websites to it ?
The easiest way to do this would be a from-scratch setup of the server.
I would recommend you to remount the devices so that /var is mounted on /dev/md4.

Alternativly you could migrate the data directories for apache2 and mysql to /home.
