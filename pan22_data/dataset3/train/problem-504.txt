Also there's a throttle plugin for IE and FF I've used to tame many a sibling.
This is a easy and simple way to limit access to websites.
I've not used it (I do, however, use Untangle's "normal" firewall and love it) but it looks reasonably simple to setup.
Also - this will work for ANY network connection to the site (assuming the little brother doesn't go directly by IP).
Untangle for Windows might be an interesting solution to this.
It may require a more technical person to set up, but it doesn't require any extra software as long as you have a router.
One possibility is to create a separate account for Little Brother either in Windows, MacOS, or Linux, and in that account use the various child-protection applications mentioned in other answers.

Those are both hacky solutions, a better one would be to log into your router/modem, and see if it has a filtering service (most modern ones do).
You can edit your C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\host file to mess with the DNS settings for this.
