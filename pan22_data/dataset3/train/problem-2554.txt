If they work from the live distro, you are good to go, and you may start enjoying most of the amenities available to owners of state-of-the-art pcs.
Just for info, I manage a Tor network with about 4000 simultaneous connections on an 8-yr old laptop with 1.25GiB RAM.
This, and economic considerations, strongly suggest you install a FOSS (Free Open Source Software) OS designed especially to run on older machines.
A screen with the alternative Install now/Test without installing (or some such thing) will appear, choose Test without installing.
There are other possibilities, I especially like Bodhi Linux.
The rationale for this is that drivers for old hardware cannot always be found, so you should make sure they exist for your specific pc.
The advantages in keeping your old operating system (OS) are obvious: if it works, why touch it?
What operating system should I install to make it run well?
The advantages in replacing it with a newer version are:
At this point make sure everything works, especially ethernet and wifi connections, but also screen/keyboard/mouse/USB ports and, if the case, cards and CD/DVD readers.
A key test to perform is to burn the download iso for the chosen OS to a USB stick, and boot from there.
The Web site DistroWatch.com has a number of suggestions to make: the result of a search for Linux-based OSes suitable for Old computers, available here returns 19 hits, one of which is Lubuntu mentioned by @karel.
The disadvantage in installing a new OS lies in the (very likely) lack of available hardware resources to support enhanced software applications.
