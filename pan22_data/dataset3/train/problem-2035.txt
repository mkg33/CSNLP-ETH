That is to minimize line wrap deep in directories.
I can go back and look at logs, and see exactly what I was doing when.
It gives good information, but it will actually cause the load on your boxes to increase just by hitting enter at a prompt!
So you get hostname, date and time, full path, and then username on a new line, with the prompt.
This, however, is the most awesomest one I've ever seen:
This gives me the current user, current host current directory (without replacing $HOME with ~), current screen window and last error return.
Gives me sort of a built in time around my commands:
Also handy for figuring out sequences of events in several terminal windows at once.
I'm in and out of boxes all day, so all I can do to keep it straight is good.
Normally, it's red and white with the current directory in pink.
If root then it's darker grey with the hostname in red.
Since I normally have 16 or more screen windows open, knowing the current one is useful.
Though after seeing a few of these, it makes me want to make mine a little smarter!
