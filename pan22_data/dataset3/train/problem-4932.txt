I definitely think you're usually going to select one and run with it, but there are all kinds of environments out there.

Part of it comes down to what's supported, you might have PE's running older code that don't support FEC129.
FEC128 on Junos will support running individual mesh groups inside of a single VPLS instances (1 or more group of LDP signaled PE's, 1 group for BGP signaled PE's).
It's not necessarily that a single VPLS domain ONLY signals with BGP and ONLY discovers with LDP, it's the fact that you can interoperate within the FEC 128 standard (and FEC129).
You can configure them to interoperate by configuring a border PE to be a member of both the BGP signaled group, and LDP signaled group.
Here's some extra material/examples, if you're interested:
That way if you are signaling with LDP in one area, and you want to introduce BGP in another - both can work together.
