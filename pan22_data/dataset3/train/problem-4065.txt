So you're speaking about some Rock-Paper-Scissor interaction?
In either case, you end up with players forced to lean toward speed, power, vitality, etc.
Now while this can lead to stats being linear and not giving an RPS type mechanic (a fully upgraded character will have access to all stats), you can limit the player's ability to do this by making the level scaling incredibly high at later levels or just limit them to a certain level so that all stats cannot be 99.
The main thing I don't like about that stat layout is that "perception" winds up being the same thing as "intelligence", which frankly lacks verisimilitude in a big, bad way.
every character has to be either "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissor" and depending on which types are fighting you can multiply your stats with a certain factor.
While Constantin's solution for player classes is valid, another possibility is to force the player to create his own class similar to what is done in Demon's Souls.
The simplest and wide-spread way to do this, would be by using character types instead of character stats for this behaviour.
types of builds which will create an RPS mechanic.
the stone gets doubled stamina if his opponent is a scissor with a higher strength)...
The way Shadowrun's core stats shook out, if you think about them abstractly, was interesting to me:
If you have underlying abstract roles defined for your stats like that, the ways they wind up used come very naturally.
You can also add more complexity if your boost different stats for different types and/or add additional clauses (i.e.
For those not familiar, with each level the player can add 1 point to any stat (speed, magic, strength, vitality, stamina, etc.).
