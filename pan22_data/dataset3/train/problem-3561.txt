Also we host a number of Django sites, but WHM/cPanel doesn't include a built-in Django hosting option.
Downside: Many universities, including ours, disallows vanilla FTP completely due to security.
Easy enough to set the quota for allowed number of FTP accounts to zero, but cPanel doesn't like to let you create new add-on domains or subdomains that don't include FTP accounts.
We're a graduate school of journalism so we do a lot of publishing, and a lot of custom domains for our classes and faculty.
This is a major pain, but there's a fair bit of interest on the official cPanel ticket asking for Django support.
Classes and faculty able to create their own mailing lists, databases, subdomains, etc.
The upsides: Lots more self-service than we had before.
Rather than running one or two domains like most university departments, we had essentially become a hosting business for our department, where our sub-groups needed a lot of custom configuration.
We use WHM/cPanel in a university setting and it's been a lifesaver, for the most part.
You can build an apache module for mod_wsgi yourself, but every time you run easy_apache it wipes out your custom apache modules, only compiling the ones it knows about.
The additional security from the auto-firewalling capabilities of ConfigServer Firewall (a drop-in WHM/cPanel must-have) is worth the price of admission alone.
Makes a HUGE difference in how much time you spend dealing with bad guys.
Big picture: Going to cPanel/WHM is the best decision we ever made when it comes to preserving the sanity of an overworked and very small admin/webmaster team.
