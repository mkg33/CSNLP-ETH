Since you're setting your domains A records, I'm assuming you're using a publicly available server?
Without the entire httpd.conf (including includes) it's impossible to tell from here, but adding
Hmm, the config you wrote seem correct to me, so I will try to show you how to debug the problem:
Use wget X.nmagerko.me to tests, browser could be caching DNS replies.
2- Make sure that files in /some/different/path, /var/www and /some/different/pat2 are different.
Try changing the IP address to just port 80 in all instances:
above your first <virtualHost domain:80> may help?
Don't forget to reload apache after any conf file change:
1- Make sure that DNS is correctly configured executing dig nmagerko.me, dig sub1.nmagerko.me and dig sub2.nmagerko.me and looking for the IP.
This may help to solve an issue where the virtual host is listening for internal (local) traffic only.
If it is, you likely don't need to change your domain's A record (unless you're hosting your own private DNS?
Lastly, let us know of this is just you testing locally.
