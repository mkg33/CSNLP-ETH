I'm writing a short batch program to move a few shortcuts.
In this case, two folders are created: Some and settings.
The problem is that Windows returns, "Can not find the file specified".
In the example above, the Settings folder would be created in the root of the D: drive.
The file names/paths are all correct as I've directly copied them from Windows Explorer.
As pointed out by @Scott, the destination path is wrong.
Rather then hard-coding the full path, you can use the %ProgramData% environment variable which was introduced with Windows Vista:
For consistency, I recommend always using quotes; even when they're not mandatory:
The folder might not be stored on the C: drive at all, though.
I imagine this is because either it's considered a system file (think user account controls petty level "system") or that it's hidden even though you don't have to dir /a to display it in a directory listing.
The cd command doesn't treat spaces a delimiters when command extensions are enabled (by default, they are).
If you intend to create a single folder called Some settings you need to use quotes.
In earlier operating systems you would have used %AllUsersProfile% instead.
Unlike the cd command, mkdir and md treat spaces as delimiters.
The above commands wouldn't work as you probably expect in case you are on a drive which isn't C::
Even if you were able to solve the problem, there are other things worth mentioning.
The System and Settings subfolders don't usually exist, and both would be created in one go.
