That included redundant power and a dedicated T3 for our disaster recovery backup.
I don't even care too much about the quality of the network connection.
I'd rather not rent other people's hardware cause it probably would cost a fortune to rent a machine like this (tons of ram).
The company I worked for at the time rented two cabinets at Xand and we filled them with our own equipment.
Since you asked for a specific recommendation around NYC, I've used Xand in Hawthorne, NY in the past.
I just need a space with a network connection and a power outlet.
It's a little bit of a hike from NYC, but you can take the Metro North to the Hawthorne station (just past White Plains) and then a cab to their facility.
Where can I find local dedicated hosting space for my own hardware?
I have personal experience with 1 & 2 and a colleague once used Speakeasy.
Or would it only be the sort of thing huge companies would do?
I'd be willing to pay a little to get it out of sight and out of mind.
I know I can rent dedicated hosting from various companies online, but usually I think that means I'm renting their hardware too.
It's for a project I'm working on, but the thing's loud and annoying.
They are very friendly and helpful and had very good prices when I was working with them (around 2006).
