Regardless of how you lock down your system via Kiosk mode or close ports in the firewall these pose a potential risk.
Presumably I do not need to keep an antivirus running.
You SHOULD apply any security or critical updates at least, these are intended to fix security issues or exploits that are known.
I am mostly an Ubuntu user, I have a Windows 7 Home partition for nothing except:
That is why these things are called exploits or security holes, they could, potentially, give an attacker an exploit into your machine that is not a normal way of access that is closed off through your mentioned methods.
If the answer is 'no', then I further ask if there is a way to lock down all of the Internet ports so that absolutely no connections to Microsoft (for updates, telemetry, etc.)
To give you a blunt answer, no, you do not have to... you do not have to do anything as long as the applications work, but that isn't always the best course of action.
or anybody else can be made, except the whitelisted ones for Steam and GOG games?
