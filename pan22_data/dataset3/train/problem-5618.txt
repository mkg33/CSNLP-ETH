so help me pout is there any way to send a message to all cliens.
I need send a message from winxp client workstation to all.
Use the 2nd script to send the message to the domain
Use EZ-Execute to run the 3rd script against the domain
You will need something to send messages to if you don't want to use the Messenger service.
Run a script using pstools to reable the messenger service then use netsend, then have your script turn the service back off.
Use EZ-Execute to run the 1st script against the domain
If you google "Desktop Alert Software" you will find a lot of 3rd party solutions for this.
You could also put this all into one script using psexec if you are going to do this on a regular basis.

Why do you not get the service activated instead so you can use NET SEND?
I tried to use net send but here as per security policy the messanger service is desabled .
I need to communicate eache client seperatly by send alerts or warnings on required basis .
