Security permission issues (app unable to access the file)
for questions such as this, it is helpful to specify the exact Windows version+variant that is installed on both machines, and what the third party application in question actually is - then if by chance someone else has hit the exact same problem previously you might get a quicker (more accurate) answer.
With server editions it depends how you have the licensing configured and what licenses you have (for XP there is a fixed limit of 10 concurrent connections if I remember rightly).
I've ran across this problem a few times before, first was caused by an older version of Symantec enterprise (like 9.0) and the second time it was due to bad ram.
Can you copy/edit/view the file on the other server without issue outside of the application?
Server 2003 getting in the way and blocking files from an untrusted server, usually occurs with remote executed exe files though
Is there an error code (0x0000000) logged in the event viewer or provided in the error box?
The only thing that springs to mind that might be a generic issue rather than one specific to ThirdPartyApplication(tm) is that if the machine it is reading the file from does not have sufficient client access licenses.
I've also seen some CRM applications that run off the network as well as quickbooks throw this error when the following is true;
If it isn't a licensing issue then you should probably contact the creators of that third party application as your first resort: they may be aware of a possible issue and already know how to fix or work around it.
I have seen connections get "hung" in some cases on XP, such that no new file sharing connections can be opened until XP is restarted, though I have never seen this on a server edition, so the old faithful solution of restarting Windows may be a quick-fix work-around until you can find a more permanent solution.
