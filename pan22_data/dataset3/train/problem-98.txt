Since the commit charge doesn't represent anything physical it is of little importance to performance
If it hits the limit bad things will happen, such as application or system failures.
The commit limit is the size of RAM, minus some overhead, plus the size of the pagefile.
Most applications allocate more than they actually use.
Contrary to what you might read in many articles, the commit charge is not a measurement of anything that physically exists.
The important thing to remember about the commit charge is that it must always be below the commit limit.
It can be considered the sum total of the RAM and pagefile needed to store the private virtual address space allocated by all running processes, if they actually used all they allocate.
Windows keeps track of the commit charge to make sure that there is some place to store all of this potential data, just in case the running applications were to use all the space they have allocated.
Not physical memory, the pagefile, or any combination of the two.
