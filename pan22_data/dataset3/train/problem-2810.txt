Your downside is some features aren't supported but I'll gladly give up nudges, winks, and handwriting for good old text based IM any day of the week.
I prefer PIDGIN because I can integrate all my other IM accounts, and for the 'alias' feature to rename all my buddies to the nickname of my choice.
I use Miranda IM instead of MSN Messenger because the UI is a lot smaller and cleaner looking.
I would suggest that a strict multi-protocol messaging program (like adium) is not that big a jump for someone who's on pure MSN (or whichever program), but that they should consider Digsby (or something similar), which also handles Twitter and Facebook updates.
Programs like Adium and Pidgin allow you to customize and bring all your IM accounts together in one (usually much faster loading) program that makes it easier to handle.
Depending on the operating system, there may or may not even be an official client.
In the case of Mac OS X, the official client may not have the features you want, or simply you don't want to have 6 different IM applications open.
For users who only use one or two services, is there any reason to switch?
Also, it has a bunch of plugins, adding features the other clients don't have.
And mainly when it's up on my screen at work, it doesn't look like I'm fooling around.
People are always hounding about how everybody should use Pidgin or Adium or messenger-of-the-week 'x'.
