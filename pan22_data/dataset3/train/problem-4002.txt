I get a GUI login every time: How to Boot CentOS in CLI?.
I accidentally appended gnome-terminal to the end of my ~/.bashrc file.
etc., and I'm flooded with a ton of gnome-terminal terminal windows.
You could boot with a live Linux CD and then mount the CentOS filesystem, and edit the .bashrc file from there.
It either doesn't work in CentOS 7, or it doesn't work in a VirtualBox VM.)
I've tried using the answers to this question, with no success.
So, pressing  ⌘F1 switched to TTY1 in VirtualBox for me (and similarly for ⌘F7 back to GUI).
This is probably a duplicate question, but I'm not familiar enough with the login/boot process of CentOS (especially on a VM) to know what to search for.
Is there another way to edit the grub configuration at boot, or a way to get to a new terminal instance from the GUI login, like Ctrl+Alt+F1 in Ubuntu?
I'm trying to log into a terminal session without the GUI login (so gnome-terminal fails), but I can't get it to boot without the GUI.
CtrlAltF1 might be getting captured by the host, or VirtualBox might not be passing it on correctly.
That terminal session executes .bashrc, which opens another window, etc.
A couple of quick tests tells me that you can use the Host key defined in VirtualBox instead of CtrlAlt (could be the left Ctrl, or the left ⌘ on Macs).
Or is there some other way I can get a terminal session without a GUI, so I can edit my .bashrc and fix this mess?
