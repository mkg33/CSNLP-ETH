In the operations team DevOps does not trust developers to make changes to the production infrastructure.
Developers want to focus on their application and the value it delivers to the organization.
The developers must be able to trust that the infrastructure has specific characteristics: characteristics like performance, connectivity, availability, and uniformity.
The operations team is absolutely critical to the success of DevOps methodologies.
which seems to define OpsDev as "development in a company that practices DevOps" (or more cynically, "development done correctly").
Developers want to know the characteristics of the infrastructure but do not want to build it or operate it.
From a personal perspective, I would mentally substitute "development" for every instance of "OpsDev" and ignore the term; it appears to be just another instance of people inventing new terminology to describe old concepts so that they sound more exciting.
OpsDev, on the other hand, appears to have essentially no definitions.
Searching around I see things like this article that has it in the title but nowhere in the article.
To enable this trust, I believe that the operations teams are going to need to become more like developers.
OpsDev is about having a full infrastructure that is built and maintained automatically from a set of source-controlled configuration files, and then having development and test environments that are built using the same methodology.
DevOps is a problematic term because it has many different definitions.
OpsDev is not simply about having a scripted build for servers.

Again, this sounds to me just like normal, modern development.
