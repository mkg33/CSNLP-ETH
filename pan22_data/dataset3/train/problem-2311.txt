From your description you are able to output video when the internal graphic card (builtin) IntelÂ® HD Graphics 530 is working, what could mean the following issue:
I would make a guess that you have successfully "fried" your newly purchased video card.
My advise would be using a power supply calculator in order to identify how much power you actually need - I have tried to input your config into calculator and it gave me around 550W, but it could be more.
But this is only GPU you also need to consider CPU, RAM, HD, all fans and all of the connected peripherals (USB hubs, keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner, memory sticks, memory cards, etc.).
Try returning you GPU to the retailer, explain the situation and hope for their loyalty.
Plan carefully what components exactly you need to purchase, otherwise you end up wasting money on hardware.
Your power supply is designed only for 430 watts, but your GPU needs at least 400 watts (look under specification) to operate, whereas it will consume around 120W (again it could depend on the ways how you use your GPU).
Usually people purchase PSU with a thought of inevitable future upgrades as well as keeping a safety gap 150-200W just in case some numbers were wrong on the hardware manufacturer specs.
