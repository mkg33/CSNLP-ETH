They're separate and discrete vSwitches for a reason.
If they need to remain separate, you could bridge them through an external switch or potentially add another vNIC from the relevant VM's and join them into a third vSwitch.
You can have all the VMs on the same vSwitch and use multiple uplinks to the physical switch for redundancy.
Virtual machines on two different vSwitches can't communicate with each other, except through the physical network or through a virtual machine acting as a "bridge" between the vSwitches (one vNIC connected to each of the vSwitches).
You'll need to configure IP addressing, etc, but you'll have network connectivity without requiring access to to the physical network.
However, I believe this configuration (VM connected to a vSwitch with no uplink) will break vMotion, and VMs on the new vSwitch will not be eligible for vMotion.
Assuming that there's a good reason for the current vSwitch separation, another option is to add a third vSwitch, with no uplink ports, then add virtual adapters to both VMs and assign them to the new vSwitch.
