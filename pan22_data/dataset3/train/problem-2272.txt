So since I have the "Authenticated Users" group in the scope of this GPO does that mean it will hit ALL users under the OU it is applied to and not just members of the "Folder Redirection Users" group?
The reason this is there is, that because of the mentioned security change, many GPOs now will only apply, if both user and computer object have at least Read permissions.
To apply the policy, you have to explicitly add the Apply permission.
Under Step 3: Create a GPO for Folder Redirection it has me add my "Folder Redirection Users" group to the scope of the GPO, but it also has me delete and add back the "Authenticated Users" group.

As the article explains, only the Read permission is applied and only to the GPO object, not the NTFS folder.
Your confusion is coming from the difference between reading and applying the policy.
This is needed as a result of the Security update for Group Policy as detailed at the link listed at the end of step 3.
Per that document only the 'Folder Redirection Users' is set to apply the policy, but any user can see the contents.
Do the permissions it has you grant the "Authenticated Users" group when you delete and add it back prevent this from happening?
The GPO will only be applied to the users in the group in your Security Filter.

That means that any authenticated user is able to see the Group Policy.

This is so that the GPO can be read by the appropriate entities.
