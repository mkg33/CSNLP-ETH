Therefore you must learn another library/API in order to work with graphics.
I think that c++ is a good language to begin because is not very high level like Java, or Python that abstract some concepts like memory management.
Can you give me a guidelines on how to achieve that goals?
The best form to learn program games is to program games.
Be prepared for crappy programs/games, simply because you don't know better.
Fourth: Game programming, and graphical programming in general is AMAZING!
You would probably be well served to know quite a bit
Someday i want to develop Game Application in c++ and I think it is so difficult for me to achieve that but im willing to learn and achieve that goals for may personal satisfaction and also for my CV as well.
You will get good with time, dedication, and will power.
There is nothing in the standard library that does straight graphical stuff.
What are the languages that i need to learn together with c++?
These libraries have many tutorials and manuals to do basic ( and less basic ) things.
Second: C++ doesn't offer graphical abilities right off the bat.
First: Game programming is easier than it's made out to be, it's not extremely simplistic, however it is easy to wrap your head around.
I recommend you try to replicate a basic 2d game with libraries like SDL or SFML.
