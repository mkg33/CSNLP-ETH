If EditedByUser and CreatedByUser share the same interface, you can slighly simplify the method by adding a constructor overload to AllocationHistoryInfo, taking the interface as a parameter, leading to costWithMaxEditedDate.EditedByUser and costWithMaxCreatedDate.CreatedByUser, without user_fullname.
Your strong point is to name your variables correctly, so I won't spend too much time trying to rename them.
The assignement is always using the very long BuilkConstant.LogHistorySetting.GetAllocationHistoryLogDisplay called with different arguments.
What the code is actually doing is that it assigns values history.AllocationInfo depending on some conditions.
A few minor changes may simplify the code, but not too much.
This final version is still difficult to read and understand.
Let's indent the code properly and remove unnecessary whitespace:
Given that return will stop processing the method, we can now shorten the code like this.
You could try and make LINQ do more, to me it is more readable but it may not be to your style.
