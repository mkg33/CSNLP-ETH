Why would vendors by default set hardware assisted virtualization off?
A rogue hypervisor can install itself and then run the main OS, the main OS can't tell that it's running under a hypervisor (sometimes considered ring -1).
You may also see performance degradation if it's always running on extremely high load.
My guess: It's off by default because hardware-assisted virtualization incurs very high CPU loads, which in turn requires a lot more power than normal operation.
Remember, your Thinkpad isn't a server-grade system.
From Wikipedia: "With hardware-assisted virtualization, the VMM can efficiently virtualize the entire x86 instruction set by handling these sensitive instructions using a classic trap-and-emulate model in hardware, as opposed to software."
So you have to enable explicitly if you know you want to run a hypervisor.
I have a Lenovo Thinkpad X201 (64bit) but it seems this is the case with other vendors too.
if you're using virtual machines alot (especially 64bit ones - they won't even start without virtualization), leave virtualization on
I believe another reason is power-efficiency, as shutting down any parts of the processor that do not need to be used will use less power, which is especially desirable on an laptop.
I want to run some virtual machines so I'm enabling it but I'm wondering if there are negative repercussions to this that I need to watch out for in the future.
