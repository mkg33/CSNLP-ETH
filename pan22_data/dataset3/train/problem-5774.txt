In order to log in with multiple Google accounts, go to any Google site, such as accounts.google.com.
However, it is possible to log in with multiple Google Account, albeit not on the Global/Browser/Profile level (which is what you are doing now).
As such, you will always be able to access your bookmarks and such regardless of which account you are viewing on the sites themselves.
Once you have logged in with multiple accounts, you will be able to easily switch between your accounts when you go to YouTube, check email, etc.
As a matter of fact, that is also where you can add new accounts.
There, you will be able to log in with multiple accounts (usually, there is something like "Add Account" or "Manage Accounts", depending on which Google site you go to).
Note that you are still signed in as a single Profile in terms of the Bookmarks, etc.
For most (if not all) of Google sites, you can switch profile by clicking on your Profile Picture.
There isn't a simple way to keep the bookmarks in sync between accounts.
