I was told that I need to migrate to a new server 2008 with IIS 7.

With it being IIS7, you might need to alter a couple of settings (for instance, I think you will need to set the Managed Pipeline Mode to "Classic" rather than "Integrated".)
When you create a website in IIS you assign it an Application Pool, when accessing the Advanced Settings (in IIS7) of the application pool you can select the framework version to use - this first drop down should allow you to select v1.1 if it is installed.
This should compensate for some of the differences of configuration - though, you may find conflicting problems down the line that can only be managed by manually changing your sites configuration file, or some other parts of the project itself that aren't compatible.
But the program was so old that the previous servor was in 2000 and the .Net Framework is 1.1
I manually reinstalled IIS 7 but I can't change the default framework version to 1.1
