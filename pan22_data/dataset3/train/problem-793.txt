I have one deployed and it handles my routing/firewall, VLAN's and IPSec VPN traffic.
Have you looked into alternative firmware for consumer routers?
I know that DD-WRT offers all the features you're asking for.
VLAN support (double-check that), IPSec (VPN Tunnel), PPTP (VPN Endpoint), Firewall, Port forwarding/NAT.
With Cisco you have only 3 months of software upgrade.
The RV042 and RV082 are essentially the same, but the RV082 has 8 ports instead of 4 and has a faster CPU (helps with the VPN).
Just be aware that the vpn images require routers with a bit more flash.
I like the Linksys RV042 and RV082 series of routers, but they might be a bit pricey for a home router I suppose.
Looking for a recommendation on a device (or devices I guess) to do router/firewall/vpn/vlan/nat functons for my home network.
Right now, I'm doing this with an IPCop box, but I'd prefer a little less roll-ur-own.
It's free and may be compatible with your existing hardware.
I'm thinking of something a step up from the typical blue boxes (or are they sufficient?
If you want an all-in-one solution, pick up a Cisco 851.
