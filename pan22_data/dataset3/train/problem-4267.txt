In my brief testing, I was able to use the Add-QADGroupMember cmdlet to add a small array of users to a test group in Active Directory.
Assume I have a distribution group in Exchange which currently exists, and holds about 20 members.
I don't see a command called 'set-distributiongroupmember', and I also don't see anything promising in 'set-distributiongroup'.
For adding bulk users from text file use the below script, it is very easy to use and this guy has written pretty neat
The only way I have been able to do this is one user at a time:
Not sure why the teams at Microsoft made this so complicated.
It looks like the Quest Active Directory PowerShell Cmdlets can add multiple users to a group at one time per this wiki page.
(I'm hoping that if this IS possible, that I can pass an array or collection of objects to be added.)
If performance is a concern Add-ADGroupMember is by far the fastest, and as mentioned can take an array as input to the -Member parameter.
I'm scared to think what Powershell would do with 700+ command-line arguments...
Is there a mechanism available that allows me to add all users with just one function call, as represented by the following pseudo-code?

In Powershell 2, I have acquired a list of about seven hundred more individuals who need to be added to the group.
I'm looking for a function or cmdlet that can add all members at once, ideally taking only one argument referencing the entire list.
