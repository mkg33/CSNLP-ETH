The log was silent because nothing was wrong in the code itself - workers just were busy processing your requests.
Of course, "long queries" are actually quite short in high-load we world.
I have a feeling this is something to do with php.
You should identify long-running queries (using mytop or slow log feature or maybe some custom PHP logging around your SQL processing) and optimize them.
I have a dedicated box with 8 gb ram, quad core chip.
Furthermore, I don't get this on pages that have no mysql queries.
Nginx, php-fpm & mysql all latest versions running under ubuntu 10.04
If I increase the number of concurrent connections to 100, I can get up to 20% of all requests to fail.
And only a few failures on pages with moderate number of queries.
I only get this when I stress test the server with siege.
If you did not get this on pages without MySQL queries, the bottleneck was the MySQL DB.
Even 200ms query is long enough to put your server on its knees.
Bit, I'm not sure if that's got to do anything with it.
