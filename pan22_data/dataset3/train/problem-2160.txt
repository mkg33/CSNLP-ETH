You can link your Windows license to a Microsoft account.
There are many other drive clone products, some free and some paid.

So you just run the clone process swap over the drives and your all done.
The above instructions are for Windows 7, but it's the same for Windows 10.
When you log on to the new system, it'll register the license for you.
Can someone point me in the right direction to port / transfer my data and license from the HDD to SSD ?
If you bought a Samsung SSD, it comes with a free copy of Samsung Magician which will clone the drive for you.
Ive been reading up online about how to do it, but allot of the articles seem to be pointing to 3rd party software, im not sure if its the correct software to use, or an affiliate marking ploy.
Im familiar with doing this on OSX (Mac) using a programme called Carbon Copy Cloner, which creates a bootable clone of your drive.

Where as W10 / W10 pro do require licenses so i presume the license transfer process is slightly more complex.
Ive got a laptop running Windows 10 pro (originally shipped with W10 standard that i upgraded to Pro) that shipped with a 1TB HDD.
OSX's operating system is free and thus doesn't require a license.
Alternatively, you could clone the HDD to the SSD.
