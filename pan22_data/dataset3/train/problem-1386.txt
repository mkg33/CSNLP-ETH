Dell uses their own PSU so an after market one will not work with the motherboard.
If it boots you know you just need a new power supply.
If you are going to try another PSU make sure the connections match the current unit and the the watts are the same or in the same neighborhood.
If they are, some motherboards / Power Supply Units have a safety that just doesn't boot the system if anything is loose.
If it is a 24 pin ATX board you might also try jumping pins 14 and 15 as per the instructions here: http://forums.techpowerup.com/showthread.php?t=25
If the power supply does not come on that is typically the indication that it will need to be replaced.
If the light is not lit then it can be either the board or the PSU.
If the light is on then the PSU is fine and its the board.
Try swapping out the power supply with one of your other computers'.
Most dell motherboards have a LED on the board usually green.
Use an insulated pair of tweezers to jump the two wires.
Those lights go through a test pattern when you power on the machine.
Dell also has diagnostic lights called the LED pack which is either on the front or the rear of the unit.
Pull the 20/24 pin connector and look for the green wire and a black wire.
You might also look for loose power connection to the board, or loose connection from the power button to the board.
This generally involves disconnecting the power,  removing the CMOS battery (watch-style battery) and then moving the CMOS jumper to the "clear" position for 10-15 seconds before moving everything back the way it was previously.
