If you have someone with a domain, you can ask them to delegate a subdomain - so for example if they owned example.com you could ask them to point prince.example.com to you (or delegate it to your nameservers)
You may (or may not) need to find nameservers to host them on, depending on if your registrar can do this for you.
The short answer is "In the general case, you can't".
That said, there are/were some free domain names you can get - I know ".tk" was offering free domains (and there appear to be a few others as well), and believe they still do.
I've not used them, but have a look at freenom.com and see if you can get something you can live with.
If they can't, you need to have a minimum 2 nameservers set up on different IP addresses (ie external IP addresses, so you would need a system in addition to your own to be compliant.)
Domain names are controlled by registrars who charge for these, and you need to go through one in order to get your domain DNS added to the appropriate root/tld/cctld/similar nameservers.
