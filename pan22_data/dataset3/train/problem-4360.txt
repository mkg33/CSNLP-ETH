Yes, installing Cygwin is kind of "cheating" but at least I didn't need to install a full blown Linux VM, which I suspected I'd need to.
If, however, the underlying partitions fill the IMG file, you're going to have to go to Linux :-/
I want to try to be more specific with this question as I think I see others asking it, but I really can't find anybody answering is constructively (no offense).
Correct answers also would not include phrases and words that ultimately would be interpreted as it is not possible.
To help with the answer, correct answers to this question would not include methodologies that use Linux in any way.
(we all know better then to think something can't possibly be done like this) Correct answers would also not include derision of the concept as I have seen on other forums.
I've got EXT3/4 working under windows as a file system, but I wouldn't call it reliable enough to resize partitions...
Is there a way to use my Windows machine to take a RaspberryPi .IMG image file that wishes to be extracted to an "X" GB sized Micro SD card and instead extract it to a smaller GB sized Micro SD card that is inserted into the same Windows machine given the actual data inside the image is not larger then the smaller Micro SD card?
Assuming the IMG file is just the wrong size, and the underlying partitions don't fill the IMG file, the guide on doing it on This page worked for me.
You will either need tools added to windows or a linux or unix (or BSD) system.
