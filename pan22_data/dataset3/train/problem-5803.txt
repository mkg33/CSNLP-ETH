In your case I would say CentOS, as you already deployed them for the web hosts already, it does come with a fine desktop and access to different development tools.
I would recommend Debian, even if it's the older one, is very stable {that is the reason why is "old" as you call it, since before releasing new package on the repositories the stability is checked twice ;) }
Ubuntu has a slicker GUI than Debian, but that is because it was originally aimed at the desktop market, Ubuntu Server LTS was a relatively new addition.
I think Ubuntu and Mint are more popular for desktop use though so I'd say stick with Debian or CentOS.
CentOS will probably be your best bet regarding ERP stuff as it's going to be the closest to the big commercial distros that these software are designed to run on.
It mostly comes down to preference and not much else.
However, we do have a lot of machines running CentOS and RedHat and are equally as easy to use, just a little bit more of a nuisance when logs/confs/bins are all over the place.
All our servers run Debian (without a GUI) out of preference for aptitude over yum, and the far better organisation of files (/var/logs etc.)
Debian isn't older - its the same base as Ubuntu ... the same way CentOS is the same base as RedHat.
Otherwise if you want to acquire skills ;) --> go CentOS... but the time will increase as well as Unix Like OS skills ;)
Moreover it's a good compromise to "easy to use" and "reliability"...
But RedHat does come with the option of an SLA (if you can pay for it).
