If they are not part of the domain's MX records, you will need to list their individual IP addresses as part of the SPF entry to let others know they are authorized (v=spf1 mx ip4:1.2.3.4 -all if, for example, the IP address for mail.a.mydomain.ac.id were 1.2.3.4).
Second, you mention that you have multiple servers that send, but mx is the only other entry in the SPF record as an authorized sender.
The result of the test (this should be the default result of your record) was,
