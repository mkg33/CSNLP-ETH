Apparently ObjectiveFS https://objectivefs.com/ supports multiple mounts (according a support email they're replied to), although I've not tested it, and can see very little information about it around on sites in general
You should try to set it up in a way, that all of a single users connections are accessing her mails via a single "backend" dovecot during a single session.
I think the problems encountered with Maildir depend on how the storage is shared.
There should be no technical problems with using S3QL to store Dovecot maildirs, however, things will be significantly slower than with a local filesystem (like ext4 or btrfs).
For a picture of a fairly complex example setup (with replication that you might not need) using frontend directors, see http://www.dovecot.org/img/dsync-director-replication.png
Another possibility for S3 storage is the commercial object storage plugin from Dovecot Inc http://www.dovecot.fi/products/
From http://www.dovecot.org/ that Dovecot Maildir does support being accessed from multiple systems at the same time, although there might be some config regarding caching, and it doesn't mention S3QL.
This may or may not be a showstopper for your use-case.
Due to periodically running out of space on EBS volumes on AWS EC2, and looking to make the setup more fault resistant in case of server/volume failure, I'm considering moving a Dovecot maildir installation over to S3QL.
