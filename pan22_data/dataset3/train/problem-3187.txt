It appears as though Redis nodes will use their own IP when sending to the client, thusly, when the client replies (through a load balancer) the wrong IP is being used.
There are several products available , maybe some time spent on reviewing your needs and the capabilities of Google products would be fruitful.
This behaviour might be intentional by the Redis designers.
One in particular would be Cloud Memorystore as it’s intended use is with Redis.

Some food for thought: although GKE can be used with a database it is not best practice.
I have not been able to find a work-around, and I must admit it is out of scope for me.
The documentation of this product states : “ Cloud Memorystore for Redis is fully Redis protocol compliant.” [3]
If you do want to use a database in k8s, you should use a StatefulSet which will try to maintain the same pod ip.
Google does offer alternate methods of integrating into the Cloud.
Other documentation regarding Redis [2] has confirmed your assumptions of how Redis handles IPs.
I have researched this issue on the Google Cloud Platform side, as it is my area of expertise, and have discovered the following documentation[1].
