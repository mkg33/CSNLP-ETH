Since you haven't specified what kind of application the server will run, specific recommendations cannot be made.
Finally - if you just setup the RAID5 array, the array controller will need to initialize all the disks in the array.
I'd be more worried about wearing out a single drive holding my OS failing so I would be forced to rebuild the system from a backup than wearing out a drive in a RAID array that I could replace and let the array rebuild.
These days, a server shouldn't swap in most cases.
So there will be an long initial run of drive access as the array does the initial initialization of the disks.
Depending on the performance of the controller and other data going on, a background initialization may take quite a bit of time.
It might make sense if it is a VM and the memory is overcommitted, in that case the VM host can tell the guest to put some stuff into swap to free up ram.
If you really need the space, you can use RAID5, just be aware of the problems with RAID5, especially with SATA disks, along with long rebuild times and higher chances of double disk failures.
Also, consider turning off swap, depending on the size of memory.
