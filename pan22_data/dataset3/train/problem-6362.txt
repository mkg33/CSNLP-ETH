Technically everyone may not consider this exactly an answer to the question asked, but I think it is ultimately the best way to address the problem of not being able to monitor the condition of raid arrays created by Dell Perc controllers in Nexentastor/Opensolaris.
And as I was able to find two SAS 6/ir cards on Ebay for $30 each, this seems to be the best way to avoid having to use third party software to monitor the raid condition.
Also, JBOD is the preferred way to present disks to Nexentastor/Solaris anyway.
So it seems that the SAS 6/ir does support JBOD with the stock firmware- there just isn't an option that says "JBOD" in the bios setup.
A simple way to install it however is to just extract it and stick the binary in place yourself.
Since I haven't gotten anywhere trying to monitor the condition of the PERC 5i with MegaCLI in Nexentastor (I also tried Dell's Openmanage software but they don't have a version for Solaris), I've since installed a Dell SAS 6/ir controller in the 2950.

I had seen on some other forums that you had to flash the firmware on the SAS 6/ir in order for it to support JBOD mode.
But I just didn't create any raid arrays in the 6/ir bios setup, and Nexentastor saw all the disks individually.

However, I know Iâ€™ve seen many others say they are using Perc controllers with Nexentastor, so some insight into how to install MegaCLI on Nexenta would definitely be welcome.
(Reading database ... 45151 files and directories currently installed.)
This allows Nexentastor to see the disks individually in JBOD mode, and therefore Nexentastor can directly monitor the condition of each disk and the array.
Installing the package has the same output as the above,
