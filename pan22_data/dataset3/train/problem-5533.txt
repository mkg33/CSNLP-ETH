As the unit is dying it may lose voltage regulation capability, resulting in over-voltage power being supplied to the machine.
Otherwise it's probably more likely that you had a few bad drives in your array that you weren't aware of.
Anytime you stop a drive that's been spinning non-stop for years you run the risk that it may not restart properly.
We replaced it, booted up Windows Server 2003 to find out that 2 out of 4 drives in a RAID 5 configuration had died.
This can happen, which is why it is advised to have redundant power supplies in a server and/or a RAID controller with a BBU installed.
Ideally the server should be taken off line and stress tested but who has the tools to do that these days?
All of a sudden, the power supply of a server started to smell real bad.
The RAID was confirmed to be working minutes before this happened (we were using the RAID right before we noticed the awful smell).
While it's possible that a bad power supply could potentially damage components I think this is unlikely.
Assuming you have redundant power supplies, rather than just a single hot swap unit, you would be well advised to get hold of another power cable as well.
After all, there's no point in having such gear if you're not going to be able to use it properly.
Although it shouldn't happen with a well designed power supply the reality is that this does happen all too often.
How realistic is it that the power supply did this to the RAID?
If the two drives were the only two drives on a particular power line then I would suspect that the power supply may have sent more than 12v down that line.
We're also getting MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION BSOD's everyone once in a while.
If you've good cooked drives as a result you need to be prepared for other components to fail as well.
