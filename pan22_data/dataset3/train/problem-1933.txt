Worse, your system can be used as a platform from which to launch other attacks or monitor traffic from other systems on the network.
If this is a web hosting account, completely wipe all files and reinstall your website.
Also use programs like rkhunter for finding known trojans, scanning periodically and have results emailed to you.
Have you checked your access logs and viewed the HTTP Requests being used to post data to your site?
May help with tracking what is replaced down the road.
You can never trust a system once it's been breached; you don't know what trojans or other code paths have been inserted on the server.
You could also look at a program like Tripwire for monitoring alterations to the filesystem.
Sealing the breach won't stop what has already been altered internally!
If this is a virtual server or physical server, COMPLETELY reinstall the server.
Otherwise you may have trouble knowing what can be trusted on the system.
I didn't see if you're running Windows or Linux, but the above tools are for Linux systems.
After you reinstall fresh and then do all the updates, you may need to look and see if you can find where the breach occurred (or did you already find it?).
Once a hacker gets in, they can plant MANY different ways to get into your server.
Hopefully you have backups from before the breach occurred.
You need to find the exploit being used and fix it.
You need to back up your own data and wipe and reinstall the server.
