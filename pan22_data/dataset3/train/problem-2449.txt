I'm using the IEEE 2006 bibliography style with the default Word 2007 Style Set.
Now it doesn't squish the reference number column.
This appears to be a defect in the IEEE 2006 style when you have long URLs in a citation.
I edited that citation's URL to have a space so that the URL could wrap.
It forced the citation column to be wider, and squished the reference number column.
Note that you really need to change this column, and not the margins at the top rulerâ€”otherwise you'll shift the entire bibliography to the right.
I replaced <xsl:value-of select="'1%'"/> with <xsl:value-of select="'5%'"/>.
If you don't want to change the XSL style as explained in M. Dudley's answer (which simply did not work for me), you can simply change the column width by hovering next to the citation number column, then dragging it to the right when you get the cursor:
I could make the font size smaller, but I'd prefer not to.
However this did not help because of the above problem with the long URL.
All you need to do is adjust the margin in your reference list.
One of my citations has a long URL that is just about the same width as the page.
Move it to the right just a bit and everything will be okay.
I can't manually change the column width, Word won't let me.
Word's automatic bibliography is not making the reference numbers column wide enough, so it's wrapping the closing bracket onto the next line.
I did try editing the citation style XSL file (C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12\Bibliography\Style\IEEE2006OfficeOnline.xsl).
