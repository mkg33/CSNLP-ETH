To install the function in the workbook you are using, first select the Visual Basic option (first item on the left) on the Developer tab of the Ribbon and then choose Insert / Module from the menu bar Paste the function into the code pane that appears.
While there are several ways to get this done using built-in Excel capabilities or formulas, none are particularly appealing.
The function will return the rep name for the first account match it finds, ignoring any matches that might be found for other accounts in the account string.
The "picking out" of successful lookups could be done with nested IF(ISERROR(...)) functions or maybe a more exotic array formula.
An optional third argument can be used to specify the separator between accounts in the account string.
The split could be done using the Text-to-Columns command in the Data tab or using a set of string-parsing formulas.
The lookup would check the rep name against a list of 'Active' accounts (usually in a seperate tab).
If none is specified, the function uses a default separator of a comma and space (", ").
If no account match is found, the function returns a #VALUE!
The following user-defined function takes as its arguments a string (or cell reference to a string) that includes one or several accounts and a reference to a lookup range; it returns a rep name if there is a match on an account in the string.
The basic idea would be to split into different cells the "Account #" items that actually include several accounts, do a separate rep name lookup for each of those included accounts, and then pick out the successful lookup(s), if any.
