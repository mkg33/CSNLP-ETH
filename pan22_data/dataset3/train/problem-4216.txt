However, if I run nmap against this host I get this:
However, my server is running on port 8053 so I somehow need to direct those outside requests going to 53 to 8053.
However, I didn't realize that it really was kind of closed because nothing was listening on it.
You can use the strace to troubleshoot activity of your app.
My DNS server is kind of specialized and testing it properly takes a bit of setup.
So it turns out that things were working all along.
I incorrectly assumed that things wouldn't work because nmap was reporting that port 53 was closed.
Check rule counters with iptables-save -c (prefered way) or iptables -t nat -L -n -v. Counters should being incremented when you make checks.
I would check that traffic is reaching the device in the first instance - fire up an SSH session to the box and run:
Instead, any packets received would simply be redirected.
Then I set up a comprehensive test in my complete environment and saw things worked perfectly.
if there is no traffic coming in then I'd check your AWS VPC security groups and permit through TCP/UDP 53 in the inbound direction - check both the network and NIC levels
I'm pretty sure I need to update iptables, but can not find out how.
I did try some of the tests suggested here and found that things looked good.
$ dig @your_dns_server_ip -p 8053 somehost.somedoomain
I've modified my security group to accept UDP and TCP connections on port 53.
If there is no traffic - then it'll be your iptables and we can look into that, if you do see traffic then your DNS server is the issue
