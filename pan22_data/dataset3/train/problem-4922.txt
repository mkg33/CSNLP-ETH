What's the best / closest to that I can get to hiding all this info from the outside?
If you have installed nginx using apt-get in Debian or Ubuntu, you might need to install the package nginx-extras to set or clear "Server" header
There are tools out there (such as BuiltWith) which scan servers to detect what tools they're using.
Also, some cracking tools might help with deteting.
If not, there is likely an alternate package you can use to get it.
Instead of the header_filter_by_lua it is recommended to use the new directive header_filter_by_lua_block which inlines the Lua source directly between curly braces ({}).
With this it is not needed to escape special characters.
I don't want anyone to be able to detect that I'm using NGINX or even Ubuntu from the internet.

On ubuntu 14.04 if you install the nginx-extras package you can remove the server header by using:
header_filter_by_lua 'ngx.header["server"] = nil';
Throw this in the http block and every request will be lacking a Server header.
If it doesn't work run nginx -V to verify that you have the lua module compiled into your copy of nginx.
After a lot of time working out how to do a custom flavor of nginx on ubuntu I realized you can use the lua module for this.
Once this is done, you can add the lines below in nginx.conf (usually /etc/nginx/nginx.conf):
