It's probably assumed that a mobile user who takes his\her laptop home shuts it down when leaving the office and turns it on at home.
You could, in the spirit of big brother, install free tracking software on all laptops.
Other options include a small dab of rubber cement between the laptop and docking station, it'll pull off easily still, but you should be able to still tell if it's intact.
I assume that since your orgnization provides laptops for people to work from home/road, they log into your network using some sort of a VPN application.
If you find startup events outside of the normal working hours you can assume that either:
I would start by comparing the times that the login script runs to the security eventlog logon events.
If this were my problem, there are several things that I could do.
Then you would know where everybody has lately been.
What does your corporate infrastructure look like?
Look in the event log (System) on the laptops and look for system startup events.
You could also maybe pass it off to your administration as a security measure.
In that case, just look at the VPN server log and find out who never logged in.
Granted this is not foolproof, but if you find no system startup events outside of the normal working hours then it's probably pretty safe to assume that that user is not taking the laptop home.
