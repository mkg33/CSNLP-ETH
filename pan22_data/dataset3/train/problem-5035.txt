I installed a front end using CentOS+Postfix+SpamAssassin, using the following: -
This is the best place to start: http://antispam.msexchange.org/.
We found that the Roaring Penguins, even as stand-alone, scaled much better under load (100K+ messages/day) than the barracudas did.
What are all the different ways to combat all forms of spam on Microsoft Exchange Server (2007 preferred)?
The spam amounted up to 94% of incoming mail, and both the exchange server and the antivirus server were overloaded.
I'm hoping this question can become the wiki for all the ways to deal with spam on Exchange.
We found that the Barracuda offerings were much more user-friendly.
Helo response delay of 15 seconds (this one cut off ~98% of the spam; requires a lot of extra RAM on the front end)
We have used appliances from both Barracuda Networks and appliance-installs from Roaring Penguin (ie install a custom load of Linux on a server, the server essentially becomes an appliance).
After this, the internal spamfilter on Exchange went down to less than 1% of the correspondence.
It's not only specific to the server software, but also on the load on that server - spam percentage, amount of mailboxes, time of the year (around the holidays spam volumes increase dramatically) etc.
We are evaluating a Roaring Penguin cluster now and the results are promising.
in one of the companies I worked for, we had 300 mailboxes and an internal exchange server, with another server running trend micro exchange scanner.
The Roaring Penguins are much more configurable but it is way too easy for users to start filtering out too much.
