When we eval'ed several Antivirus Sophos was the only one light enough to work with our complicated software (before I can to work here).
Like Kaspersky AV for workstation and server for MS servers.
For us it came down to Symantec Endpoint Protection and ESET Nod32/Smart Security.
Both have excellent central management features, and both score well on detection rates and not sucking up system resources.
If the question is "What Antivirus works well with windows domains to have policies and updates managed?"
We went with ESET based on a bad experience with the trialware of Symantec while evaluating both.
then I'd suggest looking for security suites that will:
I'm currently working with Sophos - does a really good job and the fact that you can add Network Access Controls in it can be very useful.
It is cheap, and would not consume resources, and also powerfull, I did not have any problem with it in past years.
Long time ago I was a big fan of Panda - great install, light and seemless integration in the network.
One example of a product that can do all these things is McAfee's security suite (VirusScan, ePO etc.)
It may be worth cheking it out again (my current job did NOT eval Panda unfortunately).
Goes to show you it's good to try before you buy, which you can do with most business class AV suites.
