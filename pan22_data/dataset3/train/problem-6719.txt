You may want to look at using Scapy to generate and process the "fake" DHCP packets.
Then you can check the MAC address learned on that port and have an idea of what type of device was connected to the network.
Using a sniffer to identify traffic normally generated by routers (OSPF,RIP,VRRP,etc) could help with this task.
I have to operate on the assumption that, anything outside the box is a potential point of attack - we might be able to configure a switch, for example, but there is no guarantee that it will remain that way forever.
Also you can configure the switches to send traps when a port comes up.
As you mention, looking for ICMP router advertisements would not hurt either.
Clients could be configured to block the network access if authentication fails.
Have the system request (but not accept) a new IP address via DHCP every few minutes, and if it gets an offer from an unfamiliar source, that's your rogue router.
So, we cannot rely on the configuration of external devices to assist.
I ended up taking a few of the hints here and crafting a solution which seems to work.
I would up creating a monitoring program which monitors the box's own configuration and listens on the wire for anomalies, shutting down the nic if anything out of the ordinary is detected.
It can be used to prevent your clients from connecting to unwanted network but also helps keeping unwanted visitors out of you network as well.
