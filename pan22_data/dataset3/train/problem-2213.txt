make an executable script and try run as root if sudo isnt working for you
You never know when you'll actually need the logs from some time ago, so it's better to archive them (up to a reasonable age, e. g. 3 months).
If you delete everything in /var/log, you will most likely end up with tons of error messages in very little time, since there are folders in there which are expected to exist (e.g.
As joschi has pointed out, there is no reason to do this.
Plus: there are some services or applications that will not create their log files, if they don't exist.
exim4, apache2, apt, cups, mysql, samba and more).
So the direct answer to your question actually is "Do not do this!!!
Instead of deleting the files you should rotate them, e. g. using logrotate.
It makes perfect sense to clear the log on the master so that when  you boot the clones you won't get the master's log.
I have debian servers running that haven't had a single log file deleted in years.
logrotate can compress your old log files so they don't occupy a lot of disk space.
