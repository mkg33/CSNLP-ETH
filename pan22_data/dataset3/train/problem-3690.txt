So, your function should be able to take advantage of that... how about:
When written in binary, these are the first few powers of 2:
Notice, that, in binary, all powers of 2 have exactly one 1 bit set?
There's probably faster ways to implement that algorithm, but the core concept is good: just count the set bits, and if there's 1, it's a power of 2.
That removes all the extra memory needed for the results, and it only needs to create a String that is a size which is logarithmic to the input value.... which is quite small, even for very large input values.
... next, computers are binary machines, and binary numbers are powers of 2.... there has to be a way for the base infrastructure to make that easier?
For a start, it will end up with an array of a very, very large size.... that can't be right....
Convert the input number to binary representation in a String, and if just one bit is set, it's a power of 2.
If someone were to say: isPowerOf2(9223372036854775808) what would your function do?
