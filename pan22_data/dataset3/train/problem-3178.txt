You could try loading the text file into vim, while forcing a different encoding method
There's an off chance that there may be an end-of-file or null character preventing the tail end of the text from being shown, but no halfway decent text editor should be fooled by that these days.
It looks to me like it may have started life as some kind of standard text with substitution markers, and was processed by a utility that didn't have enough defensive coding in it - a variation on this xkcd comic.
If that's what you see as plain text, there's probably not much you can do other than go back to the original source.
vim knows several encoding types, try this repeatly cycling through them.
Remember to always work on a backup copy until you're sure it works.
It might, for example, have been generated using a buggy XSLT processor.
latin1, iso-8859-n, cp437, cp737, cp775, cp850, cp852, cp855, cp857, cp860, cp861, cp862, cp863, cp865, cp866, cp869, utf-8, ucs-2, ucs-2le, utf-16, utf-16le, ucs-4, ucs-4le
My question about the raw text file is to determine if it has a BOM at the beginning (Byte Order Mark), which would give us a hint as to what it thinks it is.
Plain text files don't contain extra hidden information.
A wrong encoding can cause problems, but if your editor loads assuming a byte-per-character encoding and that encoding is wrong you should still see more stuff in the form of garbage characters.
