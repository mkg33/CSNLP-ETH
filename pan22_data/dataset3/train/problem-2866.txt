And at the same time you didn't accept any packets that constitute new connections and instead all your rules operate only on established connections that can never actually be established:
Problem I am experiencing is I can only do one or the other.
Please read the manual page for iptables and especially the part describing -m state.
Could it be something to do with ESTABLISHED,RELATED in my OUTPUT rule for http/https?
You prettly clearly dropped all your output packets that don't match any of the rules:
I always use explicit REJECT/DROP rules at the and of the chain.
The best solution for you is probably to switch the OUTPUT policy back to ACCEPT and remove the OUTPUT rules.
I, personally, don't think it's a good idea to use the DROP policy on INPUT and OUTPUT chains and I don't care about its usage on the FORWARD chain.
I am trying to setup firewall rules on a RHEL webserver, so that my webserver can serve up web pages and at the same time download remote files using curl/wget.
REJECT is usually better for the beginning as it doesn't introduce lags and timeouts.
I've tried tweaking my iptables settings and I isolated the problem to be with outbound packets cause if I enable all outgoing, it works just fine.
Then you won't create firewalls that explicitly block your new outgoing connections and then be surprised that your outgoing connections are being blocked.
