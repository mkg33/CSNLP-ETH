is to use a spread-sheet that has company employees info & to be able to generate a contacts csv/vcard such that when we create new emails I can simply import only the most current and useful contacts ( aka the ones in the SpreadSheet)
I tried searching for sources on the structure of these formats, or to try to study them myself by creating them with my gmail by exporting my contacts and then opening them in note-pad ... but the text wall I see is very difficult to read or understand.
This is an actual CSV file extension and thusly separates your data with actual commas.
& convert that data into a csv or vcf since they are basically just text-files?
On the flip side, viewing a CSV file in Excel is just as simple.
Start by going to the "Data" tab, then select "Text to Columns".
You may also have to rearrange the columns to import properly with the client as well.
I know google has join and split, formulas that are useful for creating delimited lists ( or separating them ).
Microsoft Excel allows you to save spreadsheets as csv files.
You may want/need to try each of these to see how they behave when importing the delimited file into your mail clients contacts.
It'll ask a few things about the data before separating it into columns.
Where there is a first name column, last, email, etc.
Click the Microsoft Office Button , and then click Save As.
This creates a text document with your cells separated by tabs.
I know there are different types of formats for contact-info that are wide-spread.
Is there a way to take cell delimited data in excel, or google-sheets, etc.
MS Excel offers a few different CSV formats, which are available in the Save As Type drop down menu when you choose Save As.
This may be the trick you need to make that file you made in note-pad readable.
Open your CSV file with Excel, it'll have everything in one column but on multiple lines.
