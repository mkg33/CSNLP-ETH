If it can provide DHCP service for the wired interface, you might want to enable DHCP for the wired interface and not enter the above commands, but, instead, have the DHCP server assign that information.
If you enable DHCP on the router or other device at the other end of the cable for the wired interface, then rebooting the Ubuntu system should lead to it being assigned the appropriate IP configuration for the wired interface.
If there isn't a DHCP server at the other end, you can assign an IP address, subnet mask and gateway address with the following commands presuming that the gateway address, i.e., the router IP address, should be 192.168.1.1 and that an appropriate IP address might be 192.168.1.33
However, if you control the router or whatever device could be a DHCP server at the other end, which could automatically assign an IP address to your Ubuntu system for its Ethernet interface, check its configuration for the Ethernet interface, since it might have a different IP address that should be used for the gateway address and the wired subnet may be different than the wireless one.
Is there a DHCP server at the other end of the Ethernet cable that will assign an IP address to the Ethernet interface?
