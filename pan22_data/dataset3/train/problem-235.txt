Make sure when you use it that you are giving the fan enough room to work to its full potential.
I've used successfully the fridge to cool down the laptop for couple of weeks and I didn't have much problems, however it may have some longstanding negative effects on the hardware which may decrease lifespan of your laptop, as well as overheating your laptop, so both things are bad, so it's up to you how you want your laptop to 'die' (from the cold or hot).
The benefits over the fridge solution may include:
If you really can't upgrade the machine, use an airconditioner.
The AC will cool the machines, and condensation will be much less of a problem.
Put the laptop near the vent, and it will do what you need.
You need to monitor that, but I guess it won't be like in a fridge.
My gut feeling is that you have an intermittent problem of this type and it will get worse if not repaired.
They're not designed for cooling the laptops, but they may work better than keeping the laptop in the fridge.
When trying to trace intermittent problems, an article I read some time ago said to try blowing cold CO2 and hot air over the circuit board, because the problems would show up at some temperatures and not others.
Just freeze them in the freezer in the original sleeves (if available) and dry them before using.
Typical problems found in this way would include hairline cracks and cold solder joints.
However there is a better workaround by using cold ice gel packs.
Also, since you mentioned summer, try to keep your laptop out of direct sunlight; this may cause overheating as well.
Do not block the fan or put your laptop on a soft surface (like a bed).
