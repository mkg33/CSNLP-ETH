This works great - now I can access private.example.com only when I am connected to that VPN, but how secure is this setup?
My intention was to set up an area in my Apache webserver which I will be able to access only while I am connected to the VPN (using the OpenVPN), for various tools that I prefer to not be publicly accessible at all - so a password-based setup won't work in this scenario.
Ok, ifconfig shows me that the tun0 interface has the class A ip 10.8.0.1.
I went to update the DNS zone of my example.com domain and I have added an A record on the, let's say, private.example.com subdomain - which will resolve to 10.8.0.1.
Note: of course, let's consider that neither the Apache2 nor the VPN has been compromised by other means.
Are there any obvious drawbacks which I don't see; is this setup something that is usually used?
On the other hand, on the Apache configuration, I have added a virtual host which will listen to 10.8.0.1 (<VirtualHost 10.8.0.1:80> [...]).
I have an Ubuntu 12.05 on a VPS where I run Apache 2.2 and OpenVPN - both on the same public ip.
