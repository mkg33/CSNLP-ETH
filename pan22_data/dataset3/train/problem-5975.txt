This is one of those "I don't think that word means what you think it means" situations.
It sounds like you're suggesting that you could add another DNS server as authoritative for your "econemon.com" domain that would have some "A" records in it that the others would not.
You're calling host records within a given domain "subdomains".
It wouldn't "mess up" caching-- the caching would work like it's supposed to.
You cannot influence the client computer resolver's choice of DNS server.
It would create inconsistent results depending on which DNS server a client talked to, and that's generally bad.
A request to a given name server will return what it thinks the appropriate answer is.
That is not a common or recommended configuration of DNS.
What you're talking about are just hosts in a domain.
To answer your bullet-point questions all together:
There's no generally useful reason for doing what you describe.
A subdomain would be something like a "subdomain.example.com" domain that contained host records like "www.subdomain.example.com".
You generally want all the DNS servers authoritative for a given domain to have the same records (unless you know why you're doing that... aka "split-horizon" DNS.)
