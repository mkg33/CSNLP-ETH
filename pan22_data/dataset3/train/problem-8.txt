so I've decided to run a chkdsk, however this turned out to be a bad idea since it stalled at one file on stage 4/5 for about 24 hours, I got a BSOD with bad_system_config_info error, and whenever I now boot Windows, after a couple of minutes it becomes completely non responsive and I have to forcefully shut it down.
I've booted a portable version of Ubuntu and ran gsmartcontrol, and got the following results for the hard drive:
So a couple of days ago my 3 year old laptop with win7 was acting up (programs didn't respond etc.)
If you can get a USB-to-SATA bridge adapter and then using another computer start pulling the data off.
Here is a link to Amazon showing the adapter I'm talking about.
Even if it hasn't failed at the moment already, it will fail soon in the future.
Try to get as much data as you can from it before it's too late.
You should be able to read data off your old HD but try to prevent writing to it.
I've no idea what any of this means since I'm not exactly familiar with Linux, so basically what I'm asking is: is the drive dead, or can it be fixed?
