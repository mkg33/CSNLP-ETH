My question is whether there is a way to spoof the network/create a hotspot that cannot be discovered.
Many students have used their laptops to create Hotspots, but they face the penalty of a fine should they ever be caught.
When they find one that isn't theirs, they attempt to connect, and by doing so uncover the IP behind the network, pointing to the physical computer and port which it is connected to, and they shut it off.
Depending on the skill of the administrators and technicians, and depending on the time they spend, they will find it.
At my university we have super fast LAN internet in the hostels, but no WiFi available.
The IT technicians are obviously very secretive about the way their system works, but from what we can figure out is that they walk through the hostels and search for WiFi hotspots.
And is there any way to get around either of these scenarios?
Is this a possible way of doing so, or could they monitor the traffic on the physical port and flag a hotspot according to that?
PS: I'm not the most tech savvy person when it comes to hardware, so please excuse any incompetence.
I think that you cannot really hide such a "hotspot".
