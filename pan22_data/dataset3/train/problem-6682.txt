You can use this rescue live-CD virus scanner : Avira AntiVir Rescue System.
Download Avira (free) or use whatever antivirus you prefer, and perform a full scan first and foremost.
As a boot CD it doesn't require your operating system, and as it gets updated several times a day the virus definitions are up-to-date.
Now the problem that you're facing could also be caused by hard disk malfunction.
Properties -> Tools -> Error-checking -> Check Now -> Scan for and attempt to recover bad sectors -> Start.
If that doesn't seem to help, you can try scanning it for virus.
Unless of course you are talking about a Linux/Mac virus, which then it is a whole different ball game.
What I would do is boot up in Linux and run a VM of BartPE with an AV integrated with the USB passed through to the VM.
download NOD 32,update it first and scan the whole computer in safe mode.
Download Avira AntiVir or AVG and perform a scan of the hard disk.
It will prevent you from getting infected, and Linux doesn't understand NTFS permissions so you can delete anything you want without the whinny Windows telling you don't have rights to it.
Scan it for bad sectors - you can do it by right clicking the disk in Explorer, and selecting
First just to be safe, disable autorun - here are the instructions if you're using Windows.
I prefer Avira, since in my personal experience I have seen it catching a virus which AVG missed.
This way if the AV complains it can't delete something, shutdown the VM, mount the drive and delete it.
