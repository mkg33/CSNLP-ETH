I was thinking that how silly it is to trust some unknown/known CAs when it comes to our our certificates for our servers.
And then each user accessing my site checks the validity and the keys from  some central server (like pgp key servers).
On top of those known issues we also have to pay these guys regularly.
So I sign a SSL certificate and send to a central server.
However I understand them good enough from user point of view to use SSL and encyrption daily.
There had been many cases of misconduct, misuse, compromises and theft of certificates/ca keys from those places.
I am dumb and stupid and I do not know all the technical aspects of SSL and server/client side implications and implementations.
If so what could be a better idea than current system of issuing valid certificates.
Naturally this is not a solution to an existing problem, rather it will be a hypothetical solution for some future implementation of a currently messed up web of trust on the internet due to recent news about NSA and their criminal buddies around the world.
I am wondering why  can not we use/treat web server certificates like we use our pgp keys?
