The host itself has another two interfaces, one ultimately connecting it to Internet and another one to which a WiFi AP is attached.
Even with a plain REJECT policy for the container IP, I still manage to ping the IP of another container (and nothing else, including its own gateway - which is expected).
Since this is now layer 3 communication, shouldn't the traffic go though iptables?
Not an ideal answer if you have lot of containers but you can use the shorewall hosts file with an entry for each host, ie with a /32 network like this:
My understanding is that the bridge itself works on ISO/OSI layer 2.
I have several LXD containers which are bound to a single bridge (the default lxdbr0 or another one, it does not matter).
The data flows are orchestrated by Shorewall (which builds the appropriate iptable rules).
In that case firewalling would not affect the traffic.
The problem I have is that inter-container traffic does not seem to be affected by the iptable rules.
At the same time, it has an IP, which is the gateway for the containers (the containers all have an address from the same 10.20.30.0/24 network, 10.20.30.254 being the IP of the bridge).
The restrictions I put in place work fine for traffic between the containers to Internet or to the AP network (and between the AP network and Internet).
