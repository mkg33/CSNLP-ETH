You also need the various static binfmt binaries from qemu to enable this per architecture.
When you have everything configured correctly, you should see the following:
See this issue and consider installing the binaries in a different way or use an unstable version.
At last check in stable, Debian doesn't load these binaries in a way that supports a chroot type of environment like you have in Debian, it will look for the qemu static binaries inside the container rather than using the files on the host.
This typically won't work without something to interpret the binary.
On Debian the static binaries are available in the qemu-user-static package with one catch.
On Linux there's Qemu plus the binfmt_misc kernel module that provides this support.
From the tag on your image, it looks like you are trying to run ARM based binaries on a x86 based host.
Two important things to look for, first that the binfmt_misc and qemu-arm directory and file exist.
And second, that the flags section includes a F to indicate the binaries is fixed and won't be affected by the container root filesystem changing.
