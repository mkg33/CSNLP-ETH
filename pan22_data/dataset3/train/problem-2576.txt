On the Public network, you have things like Exchange, Web Proxy, and so on.
On these two information domains, you have separate computers, and a KVM for each desk, so that they don't need 4 monitors, just 2..
You need a bulletproof company policy first, and a legal team to enforce it.
Your public network should be protected from the internet by a double skin, differing vendor firewall, with a DMZ for the outbound traffic, and a sophisticated next-generation firewall which is focussed on application traffic flows, rather than stateful port blocking.
However, there are some things that can be done to give you some tradeoff between security and usability.
You'll need a very secure web proxy to allow you to intercept and filter HTTPS traffic, so that you can perform deep packet inspection to look for things that look like company proprietary material.
You'll have to find some software which will intercept data being copied to USB devices and network shares, and inspect that for company proprietary data being copied in either direction, and block the transfer if proprietary data is moved into the public domain.
Inside your Proprietary network, you have things like your development, test and build environments, internal Git server and so on.
Firstly, separate your network into two physical segments, one for company proprietary, and one for public domain.
A good first move would be to hire a network architect with a good security background.
You're gonna need lots of money, both to pay the consultant, and the legal team, and to buy the sophisticated firewall and inspection technology.
Once you've got it set up, hire an accredited penetration test company to assess your network, and then based on their recommendations, further secure your network.
