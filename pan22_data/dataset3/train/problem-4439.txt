You mostly use arrow functions, except in a few places, for example in the map call here:
The typical use case is not to create a toast for later reuse, but instead to show it immediately.
A common convention is to put spaces between if and the (...) condition,
no need to repeat the word "toast" in the functions.
the name of the object already implies that they are related to "toast",
I like the pattern of defining the used CSS IDs and classes at the very beginning.
Also, I would inline the definition of all these functions to reduce the boilerplate code.
It looks cleaner and doesn't require as much thinking about which objects are bound to which functions.
I don't see the need for a separate utility scope.
Using these guidelines, I transformed your code to this:
I prefer a JavaScript style that doesn't refer to this or prototypes.
Making the user of the module call init explicitly is not necessary.
I would just write these functions inline, or inline their code as well.
The toast container should be initialized when the first toast is to be shown.
as it will be used as Toast_Utils.createContainer.
to make the error message slightly easier to read.
You can replace the error handling by making the public API so simple that it cannot be used incorrectly anymore.
