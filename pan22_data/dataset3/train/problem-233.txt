I'm a bit suspicious of "enviromentally safe" disposal companies.
Much of the server enclosure could be recyclable as bulk metal.
They just paid a foreign company to ship the junk overseas where it was dumped in the open.
Unlike the rest of us, charities stand a better than even chance of talking some business, possibly even the manufacturers, out of a set of drives to get the machines functional again.
Furthermore, some of these outfits simply take entire servers and shred them, creating a pile of toxic junk that is difficult or impractical to recycle.
In my opinion, this is more responsible than shipping it out of the country into the third world.
One of the popular such companies in the US was exposed on 60 minutes last year.
Despite their age, those machines are still more than powerful enough to do some serious work as file and/or print servers, especially if the new owners use an appropriate OS, rather than going straight for the latest and greatest version of whatever flavour they prefer.
For someone who has to buy the drives the servers will have a far lower value.
If the equipment is not usable, your local government should have a safe disposal area for  where the heavy metals and chemicals will not run off into the local water table.
The only thing not to do is to toss them into the trash.
I'm guessing you wouldn't get much for them on eBay, especially as they are incomplete.
