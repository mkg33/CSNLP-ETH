Whether it is worth it is a question for you though, whether you think your application is at enough risk to warrant the additional work / cost.
Do you mean having machine from separate subscriptions in the same VNet?
You could certainly set up the snort box to be a (set of) front end proxy and let it sniff the traffic as it directs and load balances it.
You must have all of your VMs in the same subscription, for them to share a Virtual Network.
Is it possible to forward all traffic to a VM with an IDS (snort) and then to the actual VM serving the content?
Is it worth it (for security reasons) to use a VN over a simple VM connected to the internet?
With the new v2 / Resource Manager machines it isn't possible to have a machine that isn't in a VNet.
Only you can decide whether to use a VN vs direct-connect over the Internet.
However, once you go over the Internet, you'll need to concern yourself with:
You can bridge VNs across regions, and across deployments.
You can set the routing table for a VNet to feed all traffic into a particular VM.
What you can do though is create a VPN link between them and have them within a similar IP range.
I would like to set up a Virtual Network in Microsoft Azure but I have a few doubts about it.
Can I link a Virtual Machine in another Azure account to my VN?
