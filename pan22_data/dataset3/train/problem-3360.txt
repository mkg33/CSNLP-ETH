On the other hand, this could have just as easily been done on a laptop, a desktop, or a small "typical" classic PC computer, so there are probably those that would say it's not really an IoT device.
Your specific use-case is similar to that of an electronic billboard or display-only Kiosk, which many consider to be IoT devices.
When you mention "IoT", most people typically tend to think of small, independent, network-connected, single-purpose devices that are doing things not typically done by a more traditional full-fledged computer (laptop, desktop, etc.
I think you could probably tilt your odds toward it being considered as a true IoT device by making sure your solution leans heavily on the "Independent" part of the IoT description I gave above.
If you were to implement most of those things, then I think you would be hard pressed to find anyone that could make a solid argument that it is not an IoT device.
Unfortunately, there is no universally agreed-upon definition of what an IoT Device is, so any specific interpretation, including the one I'm about to give below, could be taken to task.
