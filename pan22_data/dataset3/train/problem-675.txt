The reason for this is its realtime reporting and constant updates.
So in practice, it will run every 1 second and a bit which means those percentages are not very accurate and slightly overestimated.
Note that if the System Idle Process shows just under 800% on an idle system, that's because your system has 8 CPU cores (well at least 8 threads) as that counts the CPU time of all CPUs.
More likely, it sleeps roughly 1 second between each report and doesn't compensate for the time it takes to compute the report.
The User and Kernel mode times there seem to be expressed in 1/10,000,000th of second.
wmic doesn't seem to give that output every second.
Note that "ps -W" lists both cygwin and non-cygwin processes.
You should be able to post-process that output to get the CPU-usage per second.
However under cygwin, top will not report on windows processes.
I would like to monitor processes from a cygwin shell, using top or a variant.
Is there any way to get top to work in cygwin to display all my processes and not just cygwins processes?
From a bash shell,  you can monitor all windows processes with this command line:
Teh forums I have been to recommend using ps -W as an alternative, but this obviously has the drawback of no longer giving me realtime information, but just a static snapshot whenever I type the command.
