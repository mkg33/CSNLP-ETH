=IF(A3="P",HYPERLINK("[Test.xlsx]Production!D2","NEXT >>>"),HYPERLINK("[Test.xlsx]Supply!D2","NEXT >>>"))
Any idea on how to set up a range of cells this way?
The closest solution I was able to find is this formula, entered i.e.
3)  Each worksheet contains a range of cells, where I will type entries which may or may not be the tab name of another worksheet
You find the Sheet Names in A2 & A3 turn to Hyperlink.
If the value in cell A3 = P, and I click the hyperlink in cell C3, it will take me to cell D2 of Production worksheet.
For any other value in A3, it will take me to cell D2 of Supply worksheet.
I would like in my case being able to enter “Production” in A3, be converted in a clickable link as it’s the name of a worksheet, and being redirected to Production worksheet when I click on A3, not on other cells.
Can it also be done when the destination is in the same document rather than on the web?
4)  If I happen to enter the tab name of one of these worksheets in any cell, on any worksheet, this name gets automatically hyperlinked to that worksheet, so that by clicking this cell I’ll get redirected to that worksheet.
In this destination worksheet I can do the same with the cells and get redirected to another worksheet, and so on, hopping from one worksheet to another.
I looked into IF formulas, but they cannot perform any action other than calculate, copy values, etc.
NB: From Cell A2 downwards you can write as many Sheet Names in the Column.
Note, adding these rows as ANSWER to help the OP, on his suggestion.
I know Excel automatically creates Internet hyperlinks when a cell entry begins with "http://" or "www."
So I suppose my only option is using VBA, which unfortunately is not my forte.
