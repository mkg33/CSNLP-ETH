For CentOS 5, you want epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm.
Did what the thread said and then the rest of the EPEL docs worked out.

Im trying to install an rpm file on CentOS 5 and Im not sure how to resolve this issues it brings up:

Bonus points if you tell me how I can fix the public key error.

What do the lines rpmlib(FileDigests) <= 4.6.0-1 mean?
How do I make my system compatible with this rpm file?
This suggests you're trying to install the epel-release rpm on a system for which it was not designed.
You can further run the below commands to fix the public key error.
