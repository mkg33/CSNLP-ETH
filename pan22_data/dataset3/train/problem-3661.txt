If you cant reset which is what I would do then using Wireshark may help you see what IP address the  wrtp54g has.
If so then change the PC to the same subnet - and try and access the wrtp54g on the wireshark logged ip address.
I live in a communal situation, and several years ago a former roommate set up the network like so:
It could very well be one of the lowest or highest is in the range - but it is conceivable it's not even in the 10. range - in which case the easiest solution would be to factory reset it and set it up again, disabling DHCP.
You have a fair chance of finding it if you port scan your subnet.
Connecting to the manufacturer's default IP address (192.168.15.1) times out.
It almost seems like the second router doesn't have an IP address.
Reboot the  wrtp54g and see if wirewhark sees any packets with coming from a device - it should show you the IP addresses.
Any ideas on how I get my computers to recognize this device so I can log in and check some settings?
Run Wireshark and plug your PC only into a port on the wrtp54g any one of the LAN ports should be fine.
This probably means that the Ethernet connection is connected to a LAN interface and DHCP has been turned off.
It's thus acting more like a switch then a router.
If the modem recognizes the router, it lists it by MAC address.
When I run traceroute/tracert, the first hop goes to 10.0.0.1 as well.
Running ifconfig/ipconfig on the connected devices gives a default gateway IP of 10.0.0.1 which is the IP of the modem.
It probably has an IP address, but it won't appear in a traceroutes (and could be anything theoretically).
