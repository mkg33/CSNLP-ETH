slip is better than nothing, but ppp is much easier to use.
You can buy GSM modems but the modem itself is expensive, and you're going to need some sort of data plan for it.
Unfortunately you will probably need to talk to a salesman to find the right modem for your use case.
Since Raspbian is based on Debian, if you buy a USB 56k modem and connect it to the Pi, you would probably be able to make the Pi listen for calls.
Almost all landline modems will work fine for dial in, but with GSM modems you need to verify that it will work.
If the modem meets those requirements it will work (with suitable adaptors).
I'm not sure how to do this exactly though, but it might help if you search Google for "Setup Debian as dialup server".
If this is noncommercial you may also want to look at HAM based radio modems.
The fast easy way to check is to verify that it will sind RING messages and supports the ATA.
You can get models that connect via USB, or Ethernet.
Install mgetty and read its documentation for software details.
If the modem does not support those features there is still a slim chance it will work, but it will be much harder to setup.
The modem bobstro linked to may work, but it is designed for other use cases (it is designed for continuous internet connection) and probably will not work with mgetty.
