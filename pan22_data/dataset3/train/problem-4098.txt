I found this option in Windows boot menu under Toshiba Maintainance tools
You have a few different options for checking if it wiped all partitions on the HDD.
I purchased a used Qosmio x70 which was slower than what I expected,  So I tried resetting it to factory settings but it ended with me deleting everything on the hard drive
You could connect the HDD to another computer and if there is any partitions windows will recognize them and show it in the my computer area as a HDD to select.
Whenever I try to boot now I get the "media check failed - No bootable devices found" error
Or you can use a windows install disc and install windows on it, and windows will give you an option to format the HDD before installing if anything is left on it, or just give you the option to install windows on it if it is blank.
If it did wipe everything, windows will let you know you need to format it to be able to use it.
So is there any chance I can reset the laptop to factory settings and how can I confirm if recovery partition is still there or deleted with the rest of the files
