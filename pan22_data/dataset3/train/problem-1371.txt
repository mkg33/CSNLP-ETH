note that cpu doesn't pause for the gpu to complete the drawing process.
You give "gldrawarrays" it tells gpu to draw all stuff.
By calling glDrawArrays you queue that action in the GPU.
It will get executed the next time you call glFlush which is also executed by the platform dependent SwapBuffers function.
This is perceived by the eye and can become ugly and annoying.
We tell cpu to wait until gpu completes drawing ( I don't know which language you you are using so i cannot tell you exactly which command delays.)
It synchronizes SwapBuffers with your monitors refresh rate to avoid 'tearing' artifacts.
Tearing is when half of the screen was displayed with one frame and half of the screen with the next frame.
The function returns its value immediately in next tick.
That's one of the reason why we use delay function at end of code.
Cpu goes to the next command, while gpu is still drawing.
When i call gldrawarrays with a large set of data will the function return only after drawing all the vertices or will it happen asynchronously b/w cpu and gpu?
