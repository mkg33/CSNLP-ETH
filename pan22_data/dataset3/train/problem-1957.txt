Please please avoid having an automated job to do shrinks.
What you should do is locate what is making your tempdb grow, search that root cause and solve it.
Those are just some samples, as commented on first line, this a common issue, so you should find tons of useful answers here on Stackexchange site.
Kendra Little has a full blog entry on how to do this.
Basically, some process is taking to long and is making your temdb grow until you run out of space.
You can, as a temporal solution, run a shrink on the tempdb to free some space.
According to Brent Ozar "Tempdb is like a public toilette", everyone (all kind of processes) use it and usually to do filthy things.
Also you can use sp_whoisactive to log activity on the server while whatever causes the issue is running, so you can check that log afterward and see possible queries or processes that cause it.
You have several options to find the cause, running a SQL Server Profiler trace to track down Tempdb activity.
For some specific code samples, look here and here.
If you don't do that, you will still deal with continues issues like this one.
