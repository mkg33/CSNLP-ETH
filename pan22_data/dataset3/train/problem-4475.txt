You need to create the db scoped credential and the external data source all on the same (destination) database.
So for example to access database Test2's tables from database test, execute all this on the database: Test.
The documentation says you need CONTROL permission on the database, so this shouldn't be an issue.
The IDENTITY='' should be an account that has access to the source database where you want to query from, in my example Test2.
I have set up Azure elastic database queries before by using the following on Azure PaaS databases:
Can someone else try this to see if it is just me?
Another DBA has reviewed the code and can't find any problems.
This used to work a-OK, but I get the following error:
Feels like Microsoft might have broken this feature - can someone else check they can do it?
This run, no problems and I can see the credential created when looking at sys.database_scoped_credentials.
As I have successfully set up the source databases Master Key and credential, linking to it should not be a problem.
I am using the admin login in the destination database (I changed the admin login via the Azure Portal Overview page for the database and re logged in, just to be sure).
