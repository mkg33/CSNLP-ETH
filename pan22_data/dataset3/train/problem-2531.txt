I noticed this at a client's office serval months ago.
Since I could send my mail after leaving, I chalked it up to improper network configuration and didn't worry about it.
Although some networks whitelist ports 80 and 443 while blocking all others (in which case evading the firewall is nontrivial), many other networks only blacklist specific ports like 25.
I have noticed, however, that I can not send mail from specific local networks.
Because of this, my mail server also listens on port 2525, which is easy to remember.
I have tried sending email through my phone (using cellular service rather than my DSL) just to confirm the server is currently working.
The accepted alternative to port 25 is port 587 as has been recorded in RFC2476 since 1998.
Any ideas on how I might track down the issue would be greatly appreciated.
In most cases I've seen, sending outgoing mail on 2525 succeeds even if port 25 fails.
As SpacemanSpiff pointed out, many firewalls specifically block port 25.
I can receive email, but any time I tried to send mail when connected to their network the connection would time out.
Now I'm unable to send email from home, which is a problem.
You can read all about it if you are into RFCs at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2476.txt.
Unfortunately I've recently moved, switched service providers, and am forced to use the service providers router due to the special set-up they put in place to give me DSL in the sticks--well beyond the typical range for a DSL run.
This is what we have been using for many years to circumvent the ISPs blocks on port 25.
The instance runs Ubuntu and I'm using POSTFIX+Dovecot as my mail server.
