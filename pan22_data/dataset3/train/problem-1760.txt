Also I read in internet wherein some people say the two are different.
Are www.domain-name.com and domain-name.com different?
They offered a free domain-name to me and I gladly purchased it.
DNS (the service which translate human readable addresses like "mydomain.com" into IP address like "1.2.3.4") sees www.mydomain.com and mydomain.com as two different things.
I recently purchased a hosting plan from one of the service providers.
Now I logged into their control panel and put all my files there and then my site became online and is working fine.
I observed yesterday that when I hit www.domain-name.com or domain-name.com, the site displays correctly.
Since in this case its the same server, it gets handled by the .htaccess as shown above.
I also want to know where do I setup the redirection ?
But I had thought that when I hit domain-name.com, it will get redirected to www.domain-name.com which is not happening.
If yes, how do I set up a redirect such that all domain-name.com requests redirect to www.domain-name.com?
Otherwise you would have to create DNS name pointers (called A-Records) which associate the given URL to a particular IP address.
When a request for the particular address is sent to a DNS server, it will provide the IP address that it refers to.
