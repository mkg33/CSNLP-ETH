Has a couple of built-in popular GUI add-ons like Centreon and configuration scripts to get you started, including ones for checking disk space.
Install it on some old hardware directly from an ISO.
Will output data in several different formats (eg CSV, TSV, MRTG):
You can use virtually any website monitoring service for that, e. g. the free plans from pingdom or alertfox.
All you need is to have a asp.net or php page on your server:
I'd second TheLQ as well, with seventy servers you need a monitoring tool, otherwise apart from disk space, how do you keep track of patches, anti-virus updates, cpu load, memory consumption and general hardware failures?
It'd be relatively easy to clear out any monitor settings except what you want.
Nagios can tie in easily with email alerts and (especially if your systems are quite homogeneous) you can probably get yourself to a place where you are alerted about the more common server problems as soon as they occur or even before.
If you're just after simple disk monitoring and you're an all windows house you might look into Spiceworks.
FAN (Fully Automated Nagios) might be a good option.
I am assuming from your tags that these are Windows 2003 servers?
Might look like overkill at first glance, but this kind of feature is typically implemented in network monitoring systems (like Nagios) where you could define state thresholds and e-mail notifications and a bunch of other parameters to monitor as well.
I use this tool to keep long term (ie several years) stats on all of my servers.
If your experience is entirely Windows based, configuring Nagios in Linux might be a jump (I don't know the other open source monitoring systems listed by Kamil so not sure what OS they run on).
If you are looking only for historical disk space tracking (rather than full monitoring), you can use freespace.exe from Pathsolutions:
