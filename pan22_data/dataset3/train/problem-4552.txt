Presumably suitable for USB disks rather than fixed network attached targets.
You can schedule multiple instances of execution at different times or create a batch file to execute them in sequence.
I have Windows Server Backup connected to 2x NAS devices (via iSCSI), each one is situated in a different building for resilience.
An acceptable compromise might be to back up to each target alternately.
I found a solution using the wbadmin command line tool.
WSB supports multiple targets, however the MS recommendation is to rotate the backup targets by taking one physical disk offsite, then subsequently switching them around periodically.
Instead, I'd obviously like to back up to both at the same time, but the above article suggests this isn't supported.
Perhaps to achieve my goal, I could create a scheduled task that runs a script which takes one target offline (in disk management) and brings the other one back online.
My question is specific to Windows Server Backup and I would like to find the most robust possible solution within this limitation.
Although possibly an acceptable solution, the above is somewhat clunky.
