Anyway, I asked (paid even) them to do an upgrade and three days later (three days!)
Since I am the ISP, I started doing my research only to find it's a rare error and I couldn't see any suggestions for turning range requesting off on my Ubuntu 10.10 Linode server (running latest Apache and PHP5 with APC extension installed).
I opened a support ticket and all they told me was that it was a 416 error and to contact my ISP.
I am unfortunately saddled with a software package called Social Engine.
Is this indeed a server fix I can leverage somehow, or is it something their software may be doing that I would need to look into more?
this error was found by testing the direct link to the CSS files which are located in a themes folder in the buggy software.

It is extremely buggy and the tech support is beyond awful.
When I logged into the site I noticed that the styles were all missing.
