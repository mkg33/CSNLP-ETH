I'd personally start with long blue rectangles and stylize it from there.
Also, aside from what MrCranky said, rain does not really have a color, it more just deforms the world around it, so to get accurate rain you really need to be using shaders.
Fundamentally, it looks like snow because the particles are round and they don't convey motion in any way.
As long as there are enough particles and they're moving fast enough downwards your mind will make the connection to rain.
Rain drops are typically seen as elongated droplets, even to the point at which they are lines rather than particles.
Simple solution may simply be to increase the gravity so rain drops falls faster and less "snow like"
That said, you can fake it using long streaks (like what MrCranky said) that are all in line with eachother
Find a free rain ambient track somewhere on the internet and loop it.
Rain is pretty much the opposite of the above Snow
What's really going to make it feel like rain is the sound you use.
Making snow versus rain has the following characteristics
Snow "Flutters like a Feather" and Rain "Falls with a Flop"
Think of a scene where you are looking out of a window at a rainstorm: you're not seeing individual drops suspended in the air, you're seeing the streak of the path they follow.
You're only going to be able to get so far with just changing the graphics.
You could try stretching the particles out along one axis, but I think you're not going to be able to get a rain-like effect with particles like these.
