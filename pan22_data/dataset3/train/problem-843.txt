sometimes we see queries roll back, sometimes we see them complete.
The default is to wait for the currently running transactions to finish (NOWAIT is optional).
Perhaps the service makes a call as to how far through the transaction it is and if it is quicker to rollback or complete.
It depends on whether you shut the server down with or without NOWAIT.
Consider that a MS SQL Server instance is executing a long-running query the service is stopped via services.msc or - as it actually happening - a system shutdown triggered by a UPS as the server is in a developing country which experiences rolling power blackouts.
Are they allowed to complete before the service enters the 'Stopped' state or are they cancelled and rolled back?
Ideally, I am looking for an authoritative source (Microsoft documentation) as the answer as I suspect different behavior depending on a factor unknown to me.
When this happens, the service stays in the 'Stopping' state for some time and CPU and disk I/O remains high for that process.
