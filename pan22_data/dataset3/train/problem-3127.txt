For whatever reason, even with fonts that render U+1F3C1 correctly installed, Chrome 28.0 won't display this Unicode character: .
The browsers are encountering the problem of "The selected glyph is not in the specified font".
I know this is a bit of an old question, but for those who are freshly Google'ing this, I have a solution that worked in 2013.

If not, then install a couple of "catch all" Unicode fonts: Code2000 and Symbola
Chrome 28.0.1500.95 (and probably all recent releases) performs font substitution ... mostly.
Therefore, Firefox and Opera can display this unicode character in Windows 7, but the other browsers cannot.
It's not just Chrome -- you might well ask why any of the following browsers can't display it on Windows 7:

However after downloading Symbola font from here and then:
The issue is here, with all the gory details: https://crbug.com/42984 (star it and maybe somebody will notice it?)
Firefox 45.0 on my GNU/Linux LFS 7.9 didn't show the Unicode glyph mentioned in question, also didn't display other glyphs like greek etc.
First, you must confirm that you have a font installed in your Windows 7 PC that can render the font:
Firefox now shows the glyph in question, and also displays other glyphs.
There are two directions you can go from here: you can either pull the equivalent glyph out of another font (which will often look broken but it may not be clear why to the user) or just display a character-not-found placeholder (which will always look broken, but at least obviously so).
The actual answer: It's because there's a bug in Chrome that borks Windows 7 (and higher?)

I imagine Firefox and Opera recognise that the glyph being requested is a symbol that is safe to pull from another font, while the remaining browsers are being conservative and just showing the "Uh... dunno" glyph.
Once you have a font that'll render the symbol, you can try the browser test page:
Assuming that at least one font in the Local Font List renders this:
