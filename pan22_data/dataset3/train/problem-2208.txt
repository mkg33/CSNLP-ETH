You should use autossh to automatically start and restart tunnels on failure.
I have a laptop that I use mostly as a desktop but occasionally it moves networks.
Is this possible by running a command/script on the laptop at startup?
The script could be bash/shell script, and execute via ssh, but could be more complicated to find the connecting IP from a shell script (vs for example $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] )
Or you could add a small web script to VPS (the script would update firewall), and the laptop could request that page with wget/curl when starting up.
As Hauke Laging correctly noted - ssh connection may be interrupted.
I have a vps with a static address and I want to forward ports from the vps to the laptop so that I can get to the laptop from a public address even if the laptop is behind a router with no port forwarding setup.
Everything is running Linux if that matters at all, I'm trying to forward minecraft traffic from a vps with public address and no memory to a laptop with lots of memory but no public address that occasionally moves to different networks.
In your ~/.ssh/config file you can define a port forward like so:
