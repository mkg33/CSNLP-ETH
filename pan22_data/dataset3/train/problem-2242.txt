This happens often enough that it's worth putting a CGI or similar in a few of the common places (or using aliasing to make it respond as if it were in those places), and have it trigger something to block them at your firewall.
When something like this happens, it's worth looking to see if they found something:
(try to find what they requested that wasn't a 404 error)
... and if it's a stock PHP, CGI, etc, check to see if there are any reported vulnerabilities against it).
If they seemed to focus on one script in particular, focus there, and also look to see if there's anything abnormal on the machine, such as files with modification times near when they were trying to get in.
Often, they can't get in with just one step -- they use some vulnerable program to upload a file to somewhere it'll get executed, and then issue a second command to get it to execute ... if you're lucky, it'll all come from the same IP, and you can easily find what got executed, and either find the file if it didn't delete immediately after running, or use the filename to search the internet for clues on what they might've done.
