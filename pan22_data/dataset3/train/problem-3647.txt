From the network statistics you will be able to identify the mate hogging your bandwidth and can physically confront with him to reduce his network usage.
The problem is we cannot track which user/mate is downloading and ending the FUP.
Now you know who is hogging all the bandwidth, your router may allow bandwidth management, if this is the case then just cap that device.
We are sharing an internet broadband connection with 6 users at a place we live.
You can use wireshark to see what the traffic is, e.g.
it is very difficult to track so is there something that we can allot per user some amount of space like 2 gb of downloading or restrict all from downloading so that we can utilize all the fup till the end of the month.
We get 20 gb fup ( Fair usage policy) with 2 mbps speed from the ISP after the 20 gb is consumed the speed comes down to 512 kbps very difficult to browse any page.
You can read this article here to know more about Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and how it can be used to obtain network traffic statistics using various programs like FREE Real-Time Bandwidth Monitor,Flowalyzer,Simple Traffic Monitoretc.
A adsl router is configured as wifi and we all using all 6 laptops.
Most common routers have a statistics page where it shows the IP Address or Hostname of the device and how much traffic is going from and to the device.
If they are personal laptops, they would most likely indicate there name within the hostname of the device on the routers webpage.
If not you can use the web filter on the router and block access to links containing certain words as such.
