If you do, then any AV that gets its updates over the internet should be fine.
Its reasonably priced, and does very well, and isn't a resource hog either.
We use ESET NOD32, which can run just fine without connection to a central server.
It almost sounds like you're after a P2P kind of deployment.
I believe it uses HTTP as the update method, so with a bit of hacking you could get all of the clients to update from a local HTTP server.
Do you have a caching proxy server, or do you have the ability to add one?
Of course, then you miss out on centralized monitoring and alerting, as well as automated deployment.
I have been using Symantec Corporate edition for years, and finally just updated to the latest version of Endpoint Protection, and I'm loving it.
I've never seen something like that, but it could be an interesting idea.
If you were to set very aggressive caching for their update site (should be easy to track down with some basic logging), then the updates only need to be downloaded once, and can then be grabbed from the cache of the proxy server.
