It depends both on how you are upgrading, and your hardware... if you are planing on doing an actual upgrade it will depend on how much data the installer has to move around.
This was on a fairly new computer that saw light daily use.
You could choose to back up your data, to a HD or Partition and do a clean install, which will drastically cut down on your upgrade, once again this will also depend on how much data you have, plus factor in installing all of your software.
For me it took about 15 mins to do a clean install, but I haven't restored my data or software yet, so that isn't really a fair guesstimate...
It depends on various factors such as processor speed, hard drive write speed, the orientation of the moons of Jupiter etc.
It depends on the network connection you have now and the hardware you have.
I depends a lot on the hardware, but it took Ars Technica 11 minutes for a fresh install and 27 for an upgrade install.
Usually it takes me around 30-45 minutes for a fresh install so I would assume at least 15 minutes more time as it has to migrate the old settings and files to Windows 8.
But you can reasonably expect about 40-60 minutes on a mid-grade machine.
