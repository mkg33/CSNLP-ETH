Where's the back button to go back to the page I was on (where I clicked the hyperlink).
The Back functionality is not similar to what you get in a browser.

This can be configured as per user liking through Settings >> Configure Shortcuts
go to view->page navigation->previous view (hot keys alt+left arrow)

In Evince you can use the Back Button functionality to achieve what you desire.
go to view->page navigation->next view (hot keys alt+fwd arrow)
