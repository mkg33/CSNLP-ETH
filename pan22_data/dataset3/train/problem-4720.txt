Many fans have a crappy little foam plastic filter--if dust bunnies cover that, especially on a laptop, heat can build up very fast.
Have you checked to make sure the laptop's fan is running and not plugged?
No BSOD, no error log entries, just happy computing and then suddenly I'm staring at the BIOS POSTing.
It's a temporary fix -- I might get as much as a month of uptime before something makes my system go haywire -- but now if I see more than one spontaneous reboot in a day I'll re-run the DirectX setup and everything gets better for another week or four.
I have used a few Samsung laptops and they are very reliable.
It's very possibly hardware related, very possibly overheating.
If the R560's fan is not blowing a hard enough to feel easily on a dry finger, that may well be the problem.
I have occasional spontaneous-reboots that crop up on a desktop system.
Hm ... one review says the fan is completely silent, so you might not notice if it stopped running.
The case fan is way easier to replace than the CPU fan and thermal paste, too.
Sorry to say this and whilst not a technical answer, it will resolve the problem:
I use that on my desktop and it gives different internal temps
I've even got a third-party defragmenter that lets me defrag individual files, and I can defrag every other file on C: -- but if I defrag any of DirectX's files, I'm in for a reboot storm within a day.
This is abnormal behaviour and you shouldn't need to buy anything additional to make it work and run normally.
