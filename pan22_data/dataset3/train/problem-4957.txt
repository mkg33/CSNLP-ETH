Another possibility is that it might be a firewall issue, though why the issue should occur on a working computer, I'm unsure... perhaps some entries were lost.
If you will get the IP parameters that means that your DHCP server is set and is working fine.
If it's not working contact your ISP, it's their problem.
If you get the IP parameters and it still aren't able to reach any website check if your router is available (ipconfig /all -> gateway) try to ping to that IP address
If the rules are missing, try creating them for one application to see if that resolves the issue, and, if so, create 'em all.
If you can't ping to any external IP from router check if default gateway is set on router, if it's try to ping to it.
Hopefully, you've already checked if you use a proxy for any changes.
If you can ping to router but can't ping to any external IP (like 8.8.8.8) - Login to your router and try to ping to 8.8.8.8 from the router itself.
If it will work it will mean that's something wrong with your NAT settings.
If no it means that your DHCP server is not set up(you need to find out your network, mask, gateway and set it in static way) or it may be broken.
Press the Windows key and type "firew" and click the entry for the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security CPL to open it.
Check that there are Inbound and  Outbound rules to Allow the applications.
