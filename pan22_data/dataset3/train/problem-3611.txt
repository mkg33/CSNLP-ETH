Can anybody confirm the usage of the second MX record and if I can just remove it.
So I'm wondering can I just remove that second entry?
Seams to me like when the primary is down the secondary is also down right?
Then I'm only left with the first entry and I will point that one to the new mailserver.
But there is a chance that some mail clients ( IE people that have user@mydomain.com ) may be using mail.mydomain.com for their SMTP server, and others may be using mail2.mydomain.com ( from back when the email hosting got changed ).
Many setup validation and diagnostic type tools complain if you dont have a secondary mx.
Its similar to entering the same dns server twice for your domain at providers that require you to enter 2 dns servers.
Ideally you should have a real backup mx, but plenty of people just use one.
So I have no clue why this second mx entry is in there?
While this doesnt provide any sort or backup, it does make such tools stop complaining.
I'm looking at our current DNS records in the provider config panel regarding email:
What's interesting to me is that the secondary mailserver is the same as the primary.
Since both mail.mydomain.com and mail2.mydomain.com have the same A record, you do not need both MX entires.
I'm preparing a move from our online provider e-mail to our own cloud hosted Microsoft Exchange Server.
You can clean up the mail2 A record if you don't mind spending the time troubleshooting any issues that arise from deleting it, but there will be no impact to the delivery of internet email to user@mydomain.com.
