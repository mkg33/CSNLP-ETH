then all you need to do is pass the shortened bit.ly link around to your friends/teacher etc.
I've just finished programming a charming (albeit bare-bones) XNA version of arcade classic Tempest.
I'd use ClickOnce as mentioned by Oskar - It works a treat.
Is there a better way of sharing an XNA game than by shuttling the visual studio - produced  executable around?
Given that this was a homework assignment, I'd like to be able to share it with my professor and my friends/classmates to solicit feedback.
You could upload the executable to google docs and share it with them from there, depending on the size.
For really simple hosting and small scale distribution, I would get dropbox and drop it into your public folder and bit.ly it.
(And let's be honest - if I have a question about how to add in an additional feature, it might be nice to be able to share it with folks on this site as well.)
Neither of those will work for Xbox 360 version of it, you have to upload it to creators club to share it or distribute the built XNA package.
