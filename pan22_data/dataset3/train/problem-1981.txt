It sounds like (no pun intended) you have a problem in at least one of the wires in the headphone cable - most likely the ground connection.
Tried them in 2 computers, and they would only work when halfway unplugged.
My earphones only work when I plug them halfway, but only on the laptop.
I think its something from the jack, but when I move the wire closely to the jack it works for a second and then disappear again.
Unless those 'phones are particularly valuable it's likely easiest to just replace them.
It seems that conductive dust or something can get on the insulator that isn't even visible and make them not work.
They are the 3 conductor band type with 2 little insulator sections between.
If the break is near the plug, a technician can fit a new plug for may be $30-$50, so if they're expensive 'phones that might be worthwhile.
When I do that on my Iphone 4s there is no sound and If I plug the whole thing in I only hear the background noise.
I tried cleaning them off by wiping the plug and it didn't help, but then I tried again another day, cleaning the plug more thoroughly and now they work great again.
Sometimes when the wires are broken or in a short circuit in earphones, earphones exhibit this behavior.
