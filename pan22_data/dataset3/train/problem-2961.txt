I have used the IIS SMTP option for several large web sites sending mass amounts of mail (2000+ a day).
If it'll be used for incoming mail, eventually you will be driven to another type of server due to spam problems and a lack of functionality.

Most issues I have encountered with IIS SMTP were quickly resolved with a bit of DNS troubleshooting.
I heard about hmailserver but it seems it doesn't have the pickup folder option (not completely sure though, so please correct me if I'm wrong).
Microsoft just hasn't invested a lot in the management tools or making features available, because they want you to pay for Exchange.
If this is good enough, I could probably relay from IIS SMTP server to hmailserver, so that I can still use the pickup folder option.
I also don't know if the performance is better than the IIS SMTP server.
If you opt for IIS SMTP check out this post for troubleshooting help.
That is in spite of the fact that the core of IIS SMTP is pretty solid -- it's actually what Exchange uses to handle the SMTP layer of things.
I was planning to use the SMTP server that comes with IIS7 (for a website) but then I came across this link and started to get worried (read the accepted solution), on the other hand I have a limited budget and I can't afford to buy MS Exchange or another expensive server, besides, I'm using ASP.NET for my app which works very well with IIS SMTP server (I was going to use the pickup folder delivery option, this is esp.
good for web apps so that the user won't have to wait until the message is sent).
Sorry, if I sound like I'm talking to myself here but I'm trying to find the best option and it's not clear so far.
In all cases I have had no issues (knock on wood).
