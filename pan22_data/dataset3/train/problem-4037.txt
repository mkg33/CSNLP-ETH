IIRC Windows 2008 includes the old SMTP service that came with IIS6 (you'll find it under the II6 compatibility/legacy section or the features/roles areas) though this is unlikely to appear in later Windows Server editions and isn't found in Vista at all so I would recommend against relying on it.
On older Windows versions I would recommend Cygwin's exim port, but I have had trouble with that on 2008 (last time I checked Vista and 2008 were not officially supported platforms though that may have changed by now, but I doubt 7 is supported yet).
Is it possible to install the SMTP server that you can install in Windows Server 2008 in Windows 7?
I'm developing an application that will make use of it and I want to be able to test it and try it locally.
A quick Google brings up hMailServer that seems to be free though no longer open source (you can still get the source for the older 4.x versions).
A very basic (no X) Debian install running Exim4 should fit in 64Mb.
Since I needed this only for development, I ended up using smtp4dev, which is exactly what you need when developing an application that sends emails.
A bit more overhead than running a native MTA but so much more powerful and self-contained.
Other than that, you could add a basic Linux install somewhere on your network, perhaps in a virtual machine running on one of your existing machines or a little old PC you have spare.
If it were me, I'd be running Linux and your MTA of choice inside a virtual machine using VMware Server or VirtualBox.
Just install IIS and ASP services for IIS and then check IIS manager SMTP will be installed automatically.
No, Microsoft is not including any SMTP/POP3 service in Windows anymore.
