However that is only the case if WPA2/Radius is used.
As long as there is traffic the SSID of the network will be visible to everyone.
Telling SID not to shout his name every minute does not help to keep things hidden.
People think they are authenticating to the real SID and give them to me.
Everybody still hears SIDs name and knows it is there.
With SSD broadcasting enabled there is someone a room.
Hiding the SSID was a sane advice when wireless was new and nobody had written a program yet to sniff the airwaves.
(Heck, people sell kits which can do that for actually helping you to lay out your wireless networks transmitters in optimal places).
This is not true, but heck, I can shout (broadcast) what I want.
Done, though I do not consider it a proper answer to the question.
Imposing as SID should not work if I need to identify myself (read: use a certificate).
Every minute he calls out "Hi, I am SID, you can talk to me".
The best way would be to tell your network administrator to turn on SSID broadcasting (undo the hidden SSID).
@Hennes - Can I ask you to add this information as the answer so I can upvote you/mark this as "the answer?"
(Your post mentions WPA-2 Personal, which not WPA 2 Radius).
This will improve security of the network and solve your problem in the same step.
With SSID broadcasting disabled he does not do this.
But it does not answer the 'How do I connect to a a hidden SSID network in win-8' part.
Instead I sneak into the room and start shouting "Hi, I am SID, you can talk to me".
