If you need to use a certain feature on a Cisco router, you need to enable to the licence, fair enough.
From Software Activation on Cisco Integrated Services Routers and Cisco Integrated Service Routers G2
Cisco hardware ready to use on buy but some software features need license to work actively like mpls traffic engineering or Brodging L3 to L2 vpn access solutions.
I was informed that after a reboot 'securityk9' will not work, but that turned out not to be true, its just the same after the reboot.
So now i have a 'RightToUse' licence, i am led to believe that this honor based, i.e.
However, i have witnessed licences expire, and nothing happens??
But that does not make sense, i thought Cisco were clamping down on this, to add to their billlions....
But the EULA you had to accept before enabling the RTU license says something to the effect that you won't try to use it past the 90-day mark.
Unless something has changed very recently with Cisco's licensing model, the expiration of the eval license does not cause the featureset to stop working on the appliance.
