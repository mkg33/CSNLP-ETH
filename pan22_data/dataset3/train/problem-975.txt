I was able to run a 1.28TB RAID1 configuration with just 256Mb of RAM on a 400MHz VIA board with a 128Mb CF card.
Getting newer hardware running has been difficult, so we may end up using Ubuntu for its excellent hardware support and OpenFiler on top.
As I remember when we benchmarked about 6 months ago we could get something like 40 MB sustained over a GB connection using NFS.
I dont have direct direct experience with FreeNas, but I would suggest that you try OpenFiler instead.
The current systems I have are HPaq 2 GHz P4 with a single 1.5 TB drive.
It's even more complete than FreeNAS, and has an excellent reliability track.
I have run FreeNAS boxes for nearly a year with good success.
It's just some really old hardware I had lying around.
I've been running a setup similar to sybreon's for over a year at the office with no problems.
If you are about to commit data that you care about to this product please consider the following points:
The only annoyance's I've had are with Samba user management (though I haven't tried new versions).
I also suggest that you host your OpenFiler on ESXi, and you will be able to share the machine with other VMs if the system is powerful enough and will not be heavily loaded by other VM's.
OpenFiler is a more commercialized product with many commercial production implementations.
I have recently configured a unit connected via NFS to 2 VMware hosts and so far my daily management guy can't see any performance issues.
I chose FreeNAS instead of OpenFiler because of hardware requirements.
We have experimented with more cutting-edge hardware using RAID and more drives.
I generally use them as backup devices to local storage so performance isn't of the utmost important.
You can also load OpenFiler successfully onto Hyper-V - just setup the ethernet adapter as legacy adapter.
