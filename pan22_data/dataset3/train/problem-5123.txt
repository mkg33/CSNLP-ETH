This helps making data portable and gives an extra backup:
Wi-Fi hard drive like  Corsair Voyager Air or Seagate Wireless Plus 1TB  would be a great choice to setup a bidirectional sync unit.These gadgets can be used either as a wired or wireless NAS .For instance ,
the Voyager Air is also outfitted with a gigabit ethernet port, so you can use it as either a wired or wireless NAS.This way the data across office / home stays more or less same.
You may use crontab and rsync to shedule a backup to be done at office hours / home  or come up with a really smart idea to backup as soon as an update is made.
Plug it into your router, or a small switch depending, and you're good to go.
You've now got storage that's accessible from every PC on the network, no need to continually sync files, or physically move storage devices.
Subsequent sync would update data on the external disk.
As for the synchronizing process, you would configure the PCs to sync on the fly, as soon as an update occurs on the external disk, or on demand.
Downside: you need to perform synchronization each time you have updated data on the computers.
You can buy small, 2-bay boxes for relatively cheap, and that allows for RAID redundancy protecting you from drive failure.
As I work daily on my office computer and home laptop in a Windows 8 environment, I have been using an external disk as a backup/sync unit: semi automatically, once the disk is connected, a bidirectional sync is done.
In this scenario, the external disk holds the most updated data; only in case the external disk is unavailable (forgotten somewhere), you'd be working "offline".
Solution: use the external disk as main storage, while internal disks are backup units.
Once you forget to backup/sync, you're out of sync.
