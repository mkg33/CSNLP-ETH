The extension installs directly in the Mediawiki server.
I'd like to improve them with an extension, but there are a lot of options and I'd like to have a good starting point.
All versions you list (save for Apache) are out-of-date and have one or more exploits publicly available.
I need a solution that will run entirely on the wiki server.
Aside: I would recommend you look into upgrading your Mediawiki install as well as Apache, PHP and MySQL.
SphinxSearch is only "supported" on Mediawiki 1.9+, but you may be able to shoe-horn it for testing purposes.
For what it's worth, the wiki is an internal one; we don't have the option, for example, of using the Google search extension, because it's not going to be able to crawl the wiki's contents.
I understand this is an internal wiki, but that affords you greater options for testing without interruption in service.
We're using the SphinxSearch extension and it is much better than the default Mediawiki search.
The basic search capabilities of MediaWiki (at least, the version we're running - 1.7.1) are pretty poor.
