Have in mind that resizing the partition to use 'previous' space will take a long time since the partition software usually have to copy all data from your partition (259 Gb)
Just move the partition backwards using a 3rd-party tool, then extend it forward.
You can download Visual Studios Express as a Dev environment.
Learn C++ and you can write a simple defragger that consolidates the partition, which then allows you to shrink the partition.
Yes, third-party tools use the system functions, but this takes millions of carefully constructed such functions and must be done from an environment in which it is safe to pass the disk through inconsistent states.
If you don't want to spend money on third party tools, the resize you want to do can be done with GParted and you can download the GParted LiveCD for free.
Copy all the data from your D drive to a different disk/partition, delete the volume of D and then re-create it.
Make sure that when performing the copy, both the source and the destination are NTFS, and that you take care to preserve permissions.
