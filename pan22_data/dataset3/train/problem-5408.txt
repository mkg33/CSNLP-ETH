So to do this, I would just unplug my HDDs in my tower (or lappy) and boot to an installer disc, install to the USB and you should be set.
It allows you to set aside some space for persistent storage, which will allow you to install and keep changes that you make in a session saved to the usb drive instead of the memory.
I need the USB to be bootable so that I can access it anywhere.
(Then I plugged in the Hard Drive back for normal functionality, the USB works as described by kind contributors above.)
Configure the boot disk in the VM the be the USB device, not a partition but the USB device it self.
A word of caution You may want to choose another distro or at least a DE, mostly because you're going to be out of space pretty much immediately with Gnome (Cinnamon) or KDE and a system that provides all the drivers and junk in it (Ubuntu variants are often this way, which is great in most applications - just not this one).
(I specifically wanted to have Linux Mint with Cinnamon).
I thought I will answer it through here for anyone else who encounters the same idea.
So you will probably need to strip out a ton immediately.
For this application, you can just install Linux Mint to the flash drive, with a few minor considerations:
I'm currently running Windows 7 but have Linux Mint available to create the disks.
You might want to use a bigger drive if you want the installation for more than a casual use.
I read a little about it but I can't find a straightforward method.
Here is a screenshot of what to expect from the tool.
I want to create a portable Linux system which I can keep on my 8GB USB drive and take with with me anywhere I go, basically I want to have all my programs, settings and files stored on the USB so that it can be accessed by both Windows and Linux.
