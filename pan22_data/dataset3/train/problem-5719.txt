Here is a comparison of cryptographic hash functions on Wikipedia.
Generating a hash of any kind could be thought of as a form of "Lossy Compression", during the creation of the output you loose data about the input.
Is it any differences between the different algorithms?
While MD5 is not considered secure for verifying the integrity of a file, it is still pretty much impossible to recreate the file from the hash.
Is it possible to recreate a file if you have the files md5sum?
However know that you can't know for sure you have the "correct" missing information just because you got the same output after processing it.
would you have guessed that the word I input was "Firetruck"?
This is exactly what "Brute Forcing" is, guessing every possible value that could have been sent in and checking to see if you get the same output again.
The only way to get that data back is by "guessing" and trying the lossy operation again to see if you get the same result again.
For example I have algorithm that I enter a word and it outputs:
