The parts of the humans are skeletal based, but if needed they also play an animation, or change the sprite of a body part etc.
As far as I know, it is done with a mix of skeletal and frame based animation.
The simplest but also the least flexible way would be to render the character with every weapon with every move... As you want to change weapons, you would have to create stand, walk, run and jump animations for every weapon type.
Basically, frame based animation is much simpler, but with skeleton based animation you get much smoother visuals, if done right.
Like that you could define multiple arm types (or arm layouts) and make sure that every weapon has one arm layout, it looks good.
You would still have to use multiple images for animation, but if you do it right, you can make it quiet modular.
another often used way to animate 2d characters is to make the characters out of multiple parts and then create a skeleton, that is animated.
Instead of just drawing a weapon sprite, the weapon sprite also includes the arm (so the arm can be repositioned per weapon).
For example, you could have one sprite, that represents a human (2d, side view) without its arm.
Another way is to split the character into multiple parts, that can be rendered seperately.

Skeletal animation is also often used in 2d shoot em ups for bosses, that are large and have multiple parts.
You could also split it in three sprites, body, arm, weapon.
