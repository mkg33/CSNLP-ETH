I make use of this for ext3 partitions if I need a quick boot-up (see http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/11/.
Actually, I can offer some assurance: strings /sbin/fsck | grep sig reports:
You can cancel the automatic-every-30-boots-fsck at start up.
I would not personally interrupt an fsck following a dirty umount or had any reason to think that a filesystem might be compromised: not least bnecause I wouldn't want to save new data to such a file system and potentially put that data at risk as well as cause further damage to existing data or metadata.
I don't have any direct knowledge or evidence, but to me, it would just be plain EVIL to not handle SIGINT.
If you computer didn't shutdown properly, then the fsck will run.
There's no point potentially causing all your data to be lost just to save half an hour in boot up time in my opinion,
It doesn't really take long, and your data is important.
For example, Ubuntu (since Hardy Heron) has had a user option to interrupt (and postpone) a routine disk check if it comes up during boot.
So I'll just take this as anectdotal evidence that the fsck developers are calling sigaction to handle the relevant signals.
