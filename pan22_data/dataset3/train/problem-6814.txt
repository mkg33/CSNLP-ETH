This is also a good time to reduce the number of running programs down to the fewest possible.
You will be doing this process constantly until you determine what it wrong.
What you currently have should work together as long everything is configured correctly.
Find compatible hardware and start changing things out.
The best process is one where you can walk away and do something else while it is running.
Before you move on, make sure that you can perform the test on a known working machine.
In this case, I would follow some basic troubleshooting guidelines.
You can start with reducing down to 1 stick of ram, removing extra peripherals, and disconnecting hard drives.
the best processes don't require anything more than windows, but that can sometimes be a challenge.
Get a known good blank hard drive and reinstall windows onto it.
Step 1) Determine a reproducible process for testing the issue.
If you can't figure out what is wrong after doing all of the above, then you may just need to trash the whole system and build a new one from scratch.
You need a set of steps to take that will make the system crash each time you do it.
This is where you start removing hardware until you have a bare bones system.
You don't want your test to crash all computers, just the one having problems.
Step 2) Reduce the number of variables down to the smallest set.
Add the latest manufacture drivers and any software needed to test for your error.
Step 3) Eliminate the OS/Programs from consideration.
This is the most time intensive and difficult step to complete.
Step 4) Start swapping components with known good ones.
