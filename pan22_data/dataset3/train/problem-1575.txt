Are you running the browser on the same box as the proxy?
You will usually find a detailed explanation of the problem there.
That often causes problems due to squid's default ACLs.
503 usually signifies a temporary outage and has more possible causes than you can poke a stick at.
It could be that you are behind a proxy that is unable to connect to your web site (in that case, you may see the name of a proxy application somewhere on the page); or it could be that your web site somehow can't be served to you, for whatever reason.
If this is a site hosted in IIS, you should check the Windows Application event log.
If it's just your machine that's failing, then maybe something is misconfigured in your browser, or your browser is the only one pointing to a misconfigured proxy.
If you're on shared hosting, and the problem is definitely with the site, this is a case for your provider's technical support staff.
If it really is a server error and not a Proxy error, you would have to consult your server's error log files to find out the reason for the problem.
It's hard to tell from the message what the reason is.
