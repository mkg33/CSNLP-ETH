UPS - your servers and core switches should be UPSed - and monitored so everything shuts down cleanly.
All this should be factored into a long-term plan.
Of course this adds to the capital costs significantly.
If any failure on upstream switch, It will affect to all device which connected with It.
If you want solve that issue you can config stack on upstream switches, but SG500 switches are not supported stacking.
Specially your business can have critical functionalities and non critical functionalities.
Based on your requirement, this may be okay or not okay.
And each link out to distribution switches should be a pair as well.
Your technical design should be fulfill  their business requirement and if there is no business requirement means, there is no requirement for Network as well.
Yes if your budget stretches that far, the core switch should be a stack of two switches and every server has a redundant channel bond.
Remember to allow for growth too - no new switch should be installed fully populated.
Additionally VSS also support for improve redundancy.
When you design a network, You need to consider it in two ways.
I've seen recommendations from 50% full to at least 20% empty ports.
When you design a Network you should consider about about below point.
Training - you and others may need additional training for this new switching.
Also remember to look ahead - talk to management and see if there are any plans for more space, or additional offices/desks or cameras, phones that need POE, the future uses of wireless, guest wireless, additional Access points, and so on.
Check with your business and technical requirement.
Depending on your environment, and the "cost" of an outage should indicate whether you beef up the redundancy or cheap it, being aware of the risks.
According to that your cascade design may create some draw back.
