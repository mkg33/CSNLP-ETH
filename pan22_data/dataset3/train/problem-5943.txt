The user can connect to ServerA with VPN and exchange connects however this is not desirable.
I have multiple servers in the main office and everything works fine, one of which is primary DNS server (ServerA) and one is the Exchange Server (ServerB)

To answer your above question, create a secondary zone on server A for the domain of server C.  Configure zone transfers on Server C to allow transfer from server A.
I have tried all outlook settings and duplicated settings from other working machines as well?
My problem is that 2 XP workstations in the remote location will not connect to exchange using outlook if the DNS record is automatic or if statically configured to ServerC.
On serverC DNS records all hostnames match IP addresses
Other workstations seem to be OK and configured without Exchange Proxy HTTP connection  except for these 2 machines running XP (either way this does not work either).
If DNS is configured as ServerA then Exchange also connects however this causes other issues (scanning, etc cannot connect to the workstation using ip address)
And if I understand the above poster, you will want to create a secondary zone for the reverse IP lookup zone of Server C on Server A as well.
Please help if you can assist I cannot get the Exchange working with the DNS server they should be using, any ideas of what else to try, check?
I have another SBS in another domain that is a DNS Server for the remote location (ServerC) with a secondary DNS record of ServerA
