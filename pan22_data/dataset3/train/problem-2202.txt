Bother require a client program - but that can be a flash player, alternatively, there is increasing support for HTML5 video.
I have selected a Dual Xeon Quad-Core 2.4 Ghz with 12 GB RAM, 10Gbps Ethernet, and eight 2TB hard drives to be run in RAID 10.
It depends on how many streams you need to capture / how many clients are reading the streams.

At HD rates, your 8Tb is going to fill up surprisingly quickly.
My school is setting up a professional television studio that is going to be recording a 1080p stream into a server I am expected to design with a $5000 budget.
You use above H/W for streaming you use CentOS visit following link for the setup
I do not know what format the video will be coming to me in, all I know is that they want to stream both live and prerecorded.
I apologize for the big questions, but I have never done video streaming before and need some pointers.
For live video feeds, RTSP is probably the way to go - but for on-demand video, progressive download has a lot of advantages (there are lots of free flash players for PD).
There are several options for RTSP described here.

For RTSP, you need a RTSP sserver - Darwin is an obvious choice.
For PD, just a webserver and a scripting language (PHP or Perl being the obvious candidates).
Make sure you get a proper workstation/server class motherboard because you will want to be shuffling around a lot of data.
With all of that I'm almost over budget and I still did not add a card to pick up the video.
NB if you want to maintain a low-res archive, then ffmpeg also converts formats.
You will need the higher bandwidth of PCI-X or multiple PCI-E 2.0 slots.
