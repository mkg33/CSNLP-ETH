In general, when running a minimalistic setup (i.e.
Powershell is powerfull, but I prefer a UI for most simple things.
I ran into a little issue this morning and am wondering how I avoid the issue in the future.
Do others have similar setups and have you had any experience managing a system like this?
Our PDC was rebooted this morning and didn't come back online.
It's basically a HTML5 Web client for Windows Server management.
Server core has a lot of advantages, but I would always make sure I have access to a physical system with a UI as minimum.
I do so in remote locations (1-2 servers > all have UI installed) and only deviate when I can make sure to have alternatives available.
There's a newer initiative from Microsoft called "Project Honolulu".
It's in beta for now, and release is planned for mid-2018.
It makes me want to reinstall Server 2016 as a GUI instead of Core just to ensure local vm management tools work.
My domain environment is virtualized on Server 2016 Core Hyper-V hosts.
When attempting to use remote management tools, I could not authenticate into the Hyper-V host to view the console and see what the VM was doing (turns out it was chkdsk on a 4TB volume).
Fortunately, the issue resolved itself, but this could be a major problem in the future.
no real redundancy) it is smarter to have a UI on the physical host - for the simple reason that you then have A UI.
No matter how I tried to remotely view this VM, I was greeted with authentication issues due to the PDC being offline.
Server Core 2016 doesn't allow minimalist interface like 2012 R2 did, so there aren't any local management tools besides powershell.
