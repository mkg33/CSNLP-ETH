As long as you use the microsoft AHCI driver: Check the properies of the drive in the device manager, note the "bus number".
I did all the above and my system still thought my two hard drives were removable drives but I did the following and It fixed the problem.
64 bit operations cannot cope up so 64bit os is patched to treat internal drive as portable removable drive.
Install 32bit version of windows, this issue is not there.
Check Control Panel --> Device Manager --> Disks --> double click on the disk drives and make sure that under Policies tab drive 'write cache' is enabled and there is no 'optimize for quick removal' enabled.
This is generic problem of windows 64 bit versions.

Check if you can manage your SATA devices, and Disable the Hot Plug function.
Check Control Panel --> Device Manager --> Disks -->right click on the drive in question and select properties --> then select Volumes --> populate... this will identify the drive as a hard drive.
Also, update to the latest chipset and AHCI/RAID driver.
reg.exe add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\storahci\Parameters\Device" /f /v TreatAsInternalPort /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d 0
This is directly related with how windows considered or not a drive being removable.
reg.exe add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\storahci\Parameters\Device" /f /v TreatAsInternalPort /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d 0\01\02\03\04\05
If it is Bus 0 it is this registry key for Win8/Win10:
