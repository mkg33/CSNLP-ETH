In IIS, you can do the same thing with a virtual directory.
That uses just 1 cert, so it can work with a single IP.
Here are two ~10 minute videos I put together regarding SSL headers that you may find useful while you plan out this project: The SSL Binding Issue and SSL Sites in IIS
I have 50+ sites on my server and they all need a way to access them via SSL.
EDIT: As the other answer notes, https://www.domainA.com will still not work.
In Apache, I'd alias the document root of DomainA (Say, /var/web/DomainA) to Secure.mydomain.com with an alias:
And I cannot afford to buy a unique IP for each site.
If you go the way you have proposed, anybody entering https://domainB.com into their browser will get an error message at best.
You can get an SSL cert for all 50 sites if you own all 50...
It's called a UCC or SAN cert, and will likely be expensive with that many on it.
The only issue that I could foresee is in the application pools themselves, which would likely have to be reconfigured under the "secure" web server to recognize the new URL paths.
The clients would have to integrate the https://secure.mydomain.com/DomainA URL into their code.
You may also want to take a look at mod_rewrite if you need to mess with sites that use absolute URL references.
