You should be able to step into a NetGear managed unit (with Lifetime warranty) for under $1K
If you can get past it, they are a really decent switch for the price.
They're providing POE on all ports and have a lifetime warranty.
I believe they also have a 48 port version of the switch, but I can't recall the model number off the top of my head.
These are also "fully managed" (telnet/SSH/SNMP/etc) switches.
I have used the Netgear GS748TP at several sites for VoIP implementations and have had good results with them:
That was one reason we chose the DES-3028P (it does full 15W/port).
I have a bunch of HP E2610-48 switches I'm happy with.
model FS752TPSNA  is what I have used in the past - works like a charm.
You have to deal with the web interface to configure it.

We're using the DES-3028P (24 10/100 PoE + 4 GigE) for our VoIP deployments.
Some can't power all ports at 15W (or even a fraction of that).
BTW, it may not matter, but take a look at the PoE output for any switch you get.
Though if you search hard enough, you can find one for about $1,230.
