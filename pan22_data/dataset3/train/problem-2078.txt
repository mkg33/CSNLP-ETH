When you add the new 2008 server as a domain controller, the current schema (the tables and fields in a database), including for Exchange 2003, is copied to that server, and you will even be making it the schema master.
So whether you upgrade Exchange to the new 2008/2010, when you will further extend the schema; or if you remove Exchange 2003 totally, all that will happen is that you have empty fields in the database (Schema).
Either way, the swing migration is certainly the way to go.
You did not say if you were also migrating to Exchange on the same new server, or to a second seperate server, or at all.
If you do not intend to migrate Exchange, you should probably migrate your data to your new system, and then remove it first following this document: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb288905(EXCHG.80).aspx.
So all of the fields, including for Exchange, which are in the current schema will still be there on the new server even if Exchange is not in use, and that is nothing you can do anything about: You can not un-extend a schema.
I do not believe that the errors the other guys references with regards to Exchange are a factor.
