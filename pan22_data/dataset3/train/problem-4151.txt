However, you can export Public Folder contents to a .PST file as indicated.
You cannot export Public Folder contents to a CSV / Excel document (there is no support for exporting to an access file).
HOWEVER, I don't think it is possible to run the "Export" wizard over the public folders, only over your mailbox or mail files.
Highlight an ordinary folder within Public Folders (not a contacts folder) then go through the motions of export to file.
We have used Public Folder contact lists as distribution lists (bad practice, I know), but this worked for me.
You will be prompted with the folder selector, accept this time you will be able to browse all of Public Folders and select the PF Contacts folder that you want to export.
So, for a one off, copy the public folder into a sub-folder in your mailbox (or into a PST) and then run the wizard.
If is kind of buried .. File/Options .. on the Advanced tab.
The choices for output format include csv and Excel 97-2003.
The contact name and the email address will be in two different columns.
