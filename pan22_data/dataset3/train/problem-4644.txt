You probably already have (you should have) a backup strategy in place.
Sorry I can't give much more of an example, however hopefully this is enough detail for the question.
When this is dumped, I need to create a copy of the database on Target.
I have an ever changing database on Source called MyDatabase, this database is populated once a day from a piece of software.
I think the easiest way, if you need the database to be an exact copy of the Source one (including login and permissions) would be to simply Schedule a restore of the database.
After my package has been set up, the schema becomes:
Simply make sure you Schedule your full backup of "source" have it have been populated then use that full backup to restore it Under "target".
You can use PowerShell, SQL Agent job with TSQL command or SSIS package to achive the database restore.
I have 2 separate SQL Server instances, for the purpose of the question, we will call them Source and Target.
How can I insure the changes in Table2 are picked up, and Table3 is exported and imported?
My first method was using a SSIS package, to export and import the data, however will this method work if the database schema is changing?
