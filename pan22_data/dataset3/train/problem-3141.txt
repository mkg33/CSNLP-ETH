IF you still insist on a Linux based open source firewall, Endian Firewall Community might be a reasonable choice.
We have recently started using IPCop for our visitor network, and I was pleasantly surprised by its simplicity and ease of use.
Also M0n0Wall is a good one, also based on FreeBSD.
I prefer pfsense though, because of more features and i'm more comfortable with pf firewall than iptables.
It's based on FreeBSD but that should not matter since you probably won't interact much with the operating system itself unless you want to.
PS: I know I could just fiddle with IPTables, but I wondered if there is a product that does not make me to do that.
The ones I found are all commercial and not suitable for usage in small enterprises.
I agree with the answers / comments from Kristoffer and Mark.
If you need linux for some reason there are one project called ipcop (www.ipcop.org) and another called smoothwall (www.smoothwall.org).
Are there any open source firewalls for linux that
It is a linux distro, but not really Debian based.
