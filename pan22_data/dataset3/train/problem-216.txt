If ax has some proposes in the game like it goes in and attacks all the enemies in the scene then you should do it this way.
For syncing with two animator call the ax's methods from body's animation's Animation Event.
If it just damages opponent when in attack state then go with single animator ways as you need.
If ax's animation is a sprite animation then you have to create an extra state of animation that has both body and ax animation sprite drawn combined.
All child objects and most of their components are accessible from animation.
Layers are usually used for 3D animations that share common avatar and masking them.
If it's a transformation  animation then you can put the ax as a child object of the body and animate in the animation tab with the same body animation.
Ax sprite can easily be synced that way in whichever frame you want.
In case of sprite animation, ax/prop animation is done with main animation sprites or separate object animation with separate animator.
If it's a component(enable-disable) animation you can easily do it as same above.
