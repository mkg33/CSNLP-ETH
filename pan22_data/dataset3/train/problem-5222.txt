The machine is up to date with all latest update, and it is running AVG9, also this latest update and latest signatures.
You should be able to prove this by  unplugging the network cable on the DC.
If this machine is just running as a DC then I would be recommending very strongly that you build another DC, sync it up\transfer roles and then shut down the misbehaving server.
Not sure about this specific problem, but there are some good looking comments at eventid.net

Because this problem comes back when you build another DC there must be an external factor that is acting upon the server and spiking the processor.
My DC (Windows Server 2003 R2) randomly goes offline denying all requests and writing on the System Event log an error 2019 from source SRV "The server was unable to allocate from the system nonpaged pool because the pool was empty".
I've used this MS article to successfully troubleshoot a high cpu on a DC.

MS's Active Directory team also has a more extensive post on there blog.
If after more than 15 minutes if the cpu drops to almost nothing you can start looking for external services and accounts that connected to that DC.
Any other relevant info in the logs have you installed/updated drivers or an Anti virus program recently?
