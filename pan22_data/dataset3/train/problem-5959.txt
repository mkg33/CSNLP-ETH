OWC Mercury Elite-AL Pro RAID FireWire 800/400 Enclosure Kit for 2 x 3.5" IDE/ATA Hard Drives
The Drobo enclosures that you mentioned are amongst the cheapest.
I'm also trying to avoid running a full computer case just to power the drives.
I don't want any smarts in the box - it doesn't have to be a NAS, or do RAID, or try to do anything other than take multiple hard disks and present them as multiple, individual USB hard disks.
I'm trying to avoid buying half a dozen individual cases and having half a dozen power plugs.
My ideal device would potentially contain a USB hub inside, but it could present a USB cable for each drive also.
We've all seen the external drive cases that take a 3.5" drive and present it as a USB, eSATA or firewire device.
They also sell other brands on the following page as well, Personally I don't like MacAlley's enclosures (Have had nothing but bad luck with them), but I can't speak about the rackmount model they're selling.
I own two, and only wish I would have found them sooner.
Both their cheaper Neptune models and the higher end, all aluminum Mercury Elite series are amazing.
However if you want hot swap they are quite expensive.
The keyword for you is JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks).
Span (http://www.span.com/) do various versions of this sort of thing.
I've dealt with Span a lot, and they're very helpful chaps.
However they're in the UK so delivery would be expensive to the US.
They appear to also sell a full rack mountable USB solution for only a few hundred bucks.
Here's a mini-storage tower that can fit 4 drives ... the company also sells one that fits 8 drives.
I'm looking for the same sort of thing, but I want the case to take multiple drives (and preferably more than two).

The Drobo looks awesome, but it does too much thinking for me.
