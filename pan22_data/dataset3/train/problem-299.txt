Usually, the DSL modem should stand by itself, providing connectivity to the DSL service, no more.
This router can then route multiple internal connections, as well as providing wireless access point.
My take on this is that you should always keep router and modem separate.
I don't know how the market works in your area, but in Canad, the market is open, and I chose not to go with the best-known provider.
I know others who have a combo modem installed, which includes the router, the wireless access point AND DSL modem.
Once you have an external IP connection by the modem, you should have a DSL client, such as a router that will handle the DSL on the "client" side.
And my internal router is my own business, nobody else's.
If the technology changes later on the router side, you can simply change the router, and the modem will not have to be changed.
If your provider locks you in a specific hardware/router configuration, I would simply chane to another provider.
Although it will likely end up being more expensive, keeping components separate is a better long-term strategy.
This way, you also have better control on every aspect of your internal network, be it the IP address range, the wireless protection and settings, etc.
instead, I use another one, which gives me all the flexibility I need.
