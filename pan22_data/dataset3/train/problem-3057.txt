The error message is actually rather self-explanatory:
or change the owner of the file to the user running the named process:
Therefore, the nsupdate process cannot write to them either.

Aside from the filesystem level permissions you mention above, you need to configure bind to allow these remote updates using the allow-update directive.
By default, the Bind/Named daemon does not have permission to write to the zone files in /etc.
As others have pointed out you should definitely NOT make the file world-readable, much less world-writable.
Either change permissions on that file to 640, so that the group bind has read access,
If you're dynamically updating your DNS, you should store your zone files in /var/lib/bind instead - https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/dns-configuration.html#dns-primarymaster-configuration
