There's 80 - 100ms of internet latency to cross the continental united states.
The reason non www points to a different server is because you cannot have your naked domain resolve to a CNAME.
If developers just use a small handful of basic tricks such as ajax loading dynamic stuff for individuals and appending timestamps or svn checkout numbers to urls as a "just to make the url unique" value you can get instant publishing even with 90+% edge offloading.
Thats a huge drag to your west coast users if your site is hosted on the east coast.
Which is why most companies will redirect the naked domain to the www, and so the naked domain only needs a fairly lightweight webserver even for a lot of requests.
We do this at www.huffingtonpost.com, its good for offloading ~90% of all http requests to our site (not an estimate, comes from the graphs).
The question is do you build and geo-co-locate your own clusters of squid/varnish servers, or do you write a check to akamai/cotendo/etc to do it.
Any reasonably high traffic site is going to build an http caching layer.
It may works sometimes, but it's not officially supported.
