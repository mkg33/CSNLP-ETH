After a small hiccup in internet connection, any open PuTTY windows throw up a message box saying there was a connection error.
The auto reconnect works after the machine awakes from sleep as well.
Or better yet, tell it to watch the status of the network and reconnect when internet access is reestablished?
I know there's the "stackoverflow" solution of writing a program that invokes PuTTY using its command line interface using -load and -pw.
Kitty is a forked version of putty that adds reconnect, send to tray and stored username/password.
I'm using an SSH tunnel with port forwarding to get remote access to a database on BlueHost.
Might not be as useful or convenient for you as it is for me, but I use screen in my ssh sessions and it has the option of resuming and a broken connection with screen -R so long as you connect to the same server (my uni provide 3 servers which they can allocate or you can explicitly choose).
But I'm looking for a "superuser" solution because that seems like less work.
