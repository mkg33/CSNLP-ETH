If this is the case for your provider, then no solution can be found.
Mac Spoofing exists on many commercial routers, an is intended to make it possible to buy a new home router when your ISP only allows one MAC address to connect to its network.
Here are the facts that will help you understand the scenario:
The danger lies in the fact that some networks are capable of identifying a node acting as a NAT router, by checking on the decrease of the TTL for ping packets.
Setup the router to use your ethernet MAC address, connect via your pc and register to the captive portal, then unhook your ethernet cable and plug it into the router.
If it does, you may try one of the solutions below.
Even a good, working solution, might fail in your case.
This has the advantage that you can register the pc directly on the captive portal, without having to unhook the ethernet cable: just sit at the pc, open a browser, login to the captive portal, and from now on all devices connected to the pc will be able to navigate the Internet (provided your ISP does not employ the NAT-discovery technique mentioned above).
The wireless router is : TP-LINK TL-WR740N 150Mbps Wireless N Router and supports DD-WRT if required.
DD-WRT is mostly used to setup captive portals, not to access them.
You may check whether this is your case by setting up a wifi hotspot on your connected pc, connecting to it with your phone for instance, and checking whether the phone has Internet access.
Alternatively, you may setup a pc to act as the router (this is easiest for *Nix OSes).
Thus it has no facility to access one, from the command line or otherwise.
Setting up a wifi hotspot is easy, it just depends on your OS, you may Google for it.
