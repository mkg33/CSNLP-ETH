Say you create a folder under the Inbox named "RunRules"
This allows me to read a message as it comes into the inbox, and then file it away with one key press.
No to messages, yes to messages you move to a folder.
The basic VBA used on many sites http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/rules/run-outlook-rules-startup/
If you want to run it against the folder you moved the message(s) to, rather than the Inbox, specify that folder.
You can Run rules manually, but that applies to the whole folder, but I imagine that this could be really slow if your folder has a large number of messages.
Possibly some VBA script triggered by a key press that runs all rules against all messages currently selected?
KMail has a really useful feature: you can define a series of rules which are only run when you press a keyboard shortcut, and then only on the highlighted messages.

You can help yourself with an auxiliary routine like this:
Unfortunately, there is no way to run Outlook rules on selected messages.
That link describes using 'Manage Rules & Alerts' in the File tab to 'Run Rules Now'.
