One thing to look into is the security level Windows 7 is using.
Change the policy to Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated.
I would receive the pop-up for my user name and password.
Enter both correctly, then be prompted for credentials again.
I had a similar problem mapping a drive in Windows 7 to a file share on an AS400.
just want to make a note here that the smb protocol actually checks for the date of the authentication request.
i had a similar problem and it turned out to be that i had accidentally changed the date on my windows pc in the bios and so it would not accept my credentials no matter what.
that's kind of a special case, but i figure worth mentioning as an easy thing to overlook.
By default Windows 7 is set to Send NTLMv2 response only.
under password protected sharing turn off password protected sharing
It will use NTLMv2 if it can but use a less secure authentication level if needed.
This is Microsoft attempting to make Windows 7 more secure; however, it has the added effect of blocking requests from older operating systems that do not understand NTLMv2.
