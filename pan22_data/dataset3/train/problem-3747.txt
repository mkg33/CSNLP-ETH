Open a command prompt and navigate to Excel 2010 directory
On Windows XP, Vista, or 7, I have successfully used both versions of Excel with out a hitch.
Go to Start > Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > Default Programs > Set Default Programs >Select Excel(Desktop) on Left side of the pane Then click on Set this program as default > OK.
Modified for your case it should be something like:
I have not verified this but this post documents using a batch file to control this for 2003 and 2010.
Then navigate to the Excel 2013 directory and re-register 2013
I too have a similar issue where I have an Excel addin that I need to use that is only supported on an older version of OFfice because Microsoft keeps changing the VB coding (Office XP in this case), and I have Office 2010 which I prefer to use most of the time for everything else.
You "open with" and you point to the Office 14 Excel 2010 directory and it associates with Office XP anyways...because it was installed the latest... only one or the other.
On Windows 8, it will not allow me to "open with" the alternate version of Excel.
The only way around it that I know is to manually open the version of excel, and then File->Open to the directory of the file.
