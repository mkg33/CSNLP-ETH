It's a little nasty because neither is the DB in Single User mode or readonly (of corse not) or anything else indicating the reason.
It must have a very low timeout value, but maybe you can check if you have anything getting blocked when you try to access the properties
I hope I see this issue again so I can find out if a trace reveals anything.
I have resolved this by restarting the SQL Server service, unfortunately/fortunately.
For instance, if you try to delete a very large number of rows (millions) from a table, the engine will have to log every row in for rollback purposes, which will force the log file to grow rapidly.
Again, while this is happening, you SSMS will not be able to give you the database size because it's changing too fast to be accurate.
I get this error message during deployment of a SQL Server database tools solution against the database (on SQL Server 2008 R2).
Just came across this and from a trace, apparently this got blocked by an INDEX REBUILD operation that was running
Not that I thought this would actually fix the problem, I just read that in a forum somewhere.
I regrettably did not do what  PJ Mahoney suggested re: running a trace.
Needless to say, please don't try this on live servers.
See your log file blow up in hunderds of megs or even gigabytes per second.
At least answering my own question means I don't have to see another suggestion about changing the database owner ;P
My initial idea was to detach/attach the database.
This can happen on very busy databases or even if the database is not a busy one in general, but at the moment it's executing a statement that is rapidly changing the log file size.
While this is in progress, if you try to open the database properties in SSMS, you will see the error message "property size is not available.."
Another way to reproduce it is as follows: take a very large database (100+ million rows), and execute an ALTER TABLE statement on it (e.g.
