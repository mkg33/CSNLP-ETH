About the only option you have to connect to a DNS server on port 55 would be to use an iptables command.
In other words, NetworkManager is just a program that writes the config files used by other programs and/or calls the programs/scripts to employ those config files.
As long as /etc/resolv.conf points to another machine, any other service can run on port 53 of the local box (though you'd need to be root to run it and I can't think of a good reason to do so).
If it is already in use, you might try to set the bind9 DNS server at port 53 of another local address, say 127.0.0.53.
NetManger reads a config file (in Debian variants /etc/network/interfaces) and writes the /etc/resolv.conf file when it's started (normally, at boot).
Keep in mind that port 53 is the destination port (of the DNS server), whether it's on the local machine or elsewhere.
You haven't explained what is wrong with port 53, 127.0.0.1:53.
As an aside, I think that some OSs, perhaps MAC, can be set to also read a port, say 55, in resolv.conf, or their equivalent.
