Remember, I have 2.000 files, so I can compare one by one :(
I tried and could merge 2 files, that I then downloaded to my box.
You have only those lines left that have different number of articles.
Basically, I need to compare and discover numbers that are not the same as in the first menu.
Every link have a number between brackets in the final (that number represents the numbers of the articles I have in that section).
If the site doesn't allow so many files in one go, at least merge as many files as the site allows, so that you are left with 5 or 10 files that are still manageable manually.
Open the file and select all data in A column and sort
For example, I want to find those .html pages that have a different numbers on link one (26) or on the link 5 (13) like in this menu:
It will remove all duplicate entries, meaning the entries from different files that had same article number.
Select all data in A column, go to Menu - Data - click on Remove Duplicates.
Processing 2000 files manually will be impractical, so I searched for methods to do it automatically and found this site that claims to merge several excel files into one.
Now, I have to check if there are any other different numbers than these ones in all 2.000 menu html files.
upload your 2000 excel files (you can upload many files in one go) to the site and get a single excel file.
once, a single file has been created, the links as you give above should be in A column.
