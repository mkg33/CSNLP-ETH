If effect, "mycompany.com' had not had it's own cert before so it worked fine.
Hosting companies normally provides single domain SSL certificate with hosting plan by default.
I'm posting an answer because I was able to resolve this and have now launched the new site.
But if you have multi-domain SSL certificate then it will work because multi domain ssl certificate allows to add new domain name during the validity (before expiry date) of the ssl certificate.
The original hosting company provided its own SSL via a domain it owned, "sansolo.com".
As per you said, for .com domain your hosting company has already enabled SSL certificate but if you want the same SSL certificate for your .net domain then it is not possible because the SSL is issued on, for example xyz.com and now if you need same SSL certificate for xyz.net so the same SSL certificate will not work for the .net domain, if you have single domain SSL certificate.
My company used this SSL via a subdomain "mycompany.sansolo.com".
As a result I could per-purchase an SSL certificate for "mycompany.com" and have it installed in the new site's hosting, ready for the new site launch, without effecting the old site.
So first check which SSL certificate your .com website currently have.
