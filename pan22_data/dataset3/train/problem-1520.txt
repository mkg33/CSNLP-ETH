Follow the guide that might help you accomplish the task:
Get  templates from here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-vm-from-user-image
https://www.starwindsoftware.com/blog/deploy-an-azure-vm-from-a-generalized-image-in-azure-rm-portal"
You can capture VM to image and use the generalized image easily.
More about how to deploy VMs from upload generalized image you can refer to this official document: Upload a generalized VHD and use it to create new VMs in Azure (Notice: If you want to deploy Azure VM from generalized image, you must prepare the image correctly.)
There is another way to create vm from a generalized image in Azure RM portal which using template .
After preparing Image, you can upload on-prem image and deploy VMs in Azure.
That would be great if you could share a kb/guide which is describing PowerShell actions because AzureRM doesn't support GUI for now, and I am not really strong in the shelling.
Also, You can create multiple VMs from a generalized VM image in Azure.
Azure cloud market provides you with functionally to create most common VMs but with limited VMs' customisation functions.
I am wondering in what way should I spin-up windows VM for Azure from generalized image, in order to add custom settings (from what I know it's impossible to customise the VM which was deployed from Azure market place)
To deploy generalized VM, all that you need is basically that  VMDK in VMWare or a VHD(X) for Hyper-V which will be baseline image for your deployment (depending which hypervisor we are talking about).
