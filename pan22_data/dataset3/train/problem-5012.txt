When searching for an answer, I spotted that a number of users had already benchmarked nVidia graphics card on this website http://www.userbenchmark.com/System/HP-ProLiant-ML110-G7/4272
As I am using the GPU for Cuda I will probably buy another 2 or 3 GPUs and move them all to an external case and us a PCIe x1 to PCIe x16 extender, but for now I can test the nVidia docker tensorflow containers for a total cost of 130 (pounds in my case but you could do this for dollars or euros).
Although 200 mm  long, I carefully folded it multiple times into the case so my GTX card fitted under the lid.
The Thermaltake (or chose another brand) PCIe riser came to my rescue.
Power came from spare hard drive slots (2 drives in use, 2 spaces not) and the CD power.
I want to provide CUDA support for my HP Proliant server, but the case is only designed to support single width PCIe.
It wasn't possible to put the PCIe card holder back in, but the Thermaltake anti static bag provided insulation from the CPU heat sink.
Note the most power hungry GPUs may not work in this configuration.
I think you could be able to get an external graphics card into that system, but you need to think smaller, something that has a lower power supply requirement and doesn't have any power connectors.
Any idea how to install for example an GTX 1070 or 1060?
