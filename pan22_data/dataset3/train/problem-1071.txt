At this point, it is safe to remove the power or pull the plug.
No one seems to have answered this question: "At what point is it safe to pull the plug on the Raspberry Pi?"
After shutdown, you must remove the power and then apply the power again to power up the Pi.
The red light will remain on as long as there is power applied to the Pi.
you can either pull the plug when the green led has stopped blinking after a shutdown command or you can short the run/reset pads that are on the board
If you do use the hard reset be sure to only use it after a halt or system shutdown or as a last resort as it immediately restarts the processor, if you are writing to your SD card then you can potentially corrupt it just as pulling the power while it running
As previous answers have stated, the red led means the pi is receiving power where as the green led is activity (I believe disk activity)
This website has a great instructions on how to add a hard reset switch if your willing to solder a few pins.
When you do this, you'll see the "ACT" light (the green one) blink solidly 10 times (0.5 second intervals).
Once it stops blinking, the green light will turn off.
