Union does not require any relationships between tables, but the rows must be same in both the tables.
Adding an index on columns used in a join is usually a good idea (but there are exceptions).
But as you have seen, it is not the only possibility.
You can even join on a condition that does not reference a column at all:
Independent of declared relational integrity, you want to make sure that your tables are indexed appropriately to support the (join) queries your application is made of.
In this example you get either the cartesian product of all rows in both tables, or no row at all, depending on the condition being met.
Now, if you have a foreign key declared, joining on those linked columns is called a natural join an that is the most common scenario for a join.

I hope this is the required answer, as far as I understood.
Also if you want outer join, you can do the same way using outer join or using union.
