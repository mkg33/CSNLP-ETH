Now when the 3rd party was in there I had the same issue and they said they need to add my IP so I could get access.
Without seeing the full contents of your INPUT chain all we can do is guess.
I will not even let them enter a username and password.
It is frequently the case that the last rule in the INPUT chain will be used to REJECT all packets that reach it.
temporarily turn off (if you can) iptables with a iptables --flush and test the connection.
So I am thinking I just need to add my server hosts ip to the iptable but this does not work.
look at sshd_config for restrictions given by the ListenAddress, Match, or hostBasedAuthentication directives.
Use -I INPUT to insert the rule into the beginning of the chain (or -I INPUT n for some meaningful value of n ) to insert it at a particular point in the chain so that it acted upon before anything else.
If you're not getting any tcp connection, then it's either iptables, tcpwrapper, or sshd configuration.
I now need my server host to update our ssl certificate but they cannot ssh in to do so.
This usually causes the rule to be ignored because an existing rule acts upon the packets first and with iptables, order matters and first match wins.
look at the logs for /var/log/secure and any tcp wrapper logs.
