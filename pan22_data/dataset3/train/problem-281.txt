Your button code should not be storing the states for your objects.
In this case I dragged over to the On Click in both buttons Allways On and Mouse Over the AircraftJet
I have 3 GUI buttons and 3 GameObjects I want to interact with the buttons.
And a script that is attached to the 3 GameObjects:
And I want now to make that each GameObject for example the AircraftJet will have it's own buttons events something like enum.
Now when I'm clicking the buttons it's applying it only for the AircraftJet.
The 3 GameObjects are: Robot Kyle , hero , AircraftJet
Maybe using somehow with IPointer[...]Handler interfaces ?
So the script you have shown should be attached to the camera (or some other neutral object) that knows one thing:
In the script I used enum before but now I want to use canvas and gui buttons.
Your objects should be storing the states for your objects (all the button code is get the currently selected object, get the data script, and modify the data).
I have also a canvas and under it as children 3 buttons: Mouse Over , User Call , Allways On
In general what I want to do is somehow that I will be able to click on something and select for example the AircraftJet gameobject and then when clicking the buttons it will effect only the aircraft and if i will click on the hero and then the buttons it will effect only the hero.
Your AlwaysOn / MouseOver / Use Call buttons do one thing:
In the Allways On button in the Inspector in the On Click I'm calling a method AllwaysOn and in the Mouse Over button I'm calling a method OnMouseOverMethod
On the script bottom there is the two methods I'm using in the buttons On Click events.
