I only want the server to relay e-mails from mydomain (only if authenticated) and not retain any emails on the server in user mailboxes.
But when e-mails are relayed I get the following message from gmail:
Currently I been able to relay e-mails from a particular source address, however e-mails that are send to a gmail address are bounced when relayed.
I also tried using header checks to strip all the headers that showed that the e-mail was from another client before it reached the server.
Most of the information I find is about relaying all my e-mails through gmail which I don't want to do.
If I use sendmail from the server itself, gmail does not bounce it proving that gmail is happy to receive e-mails from my server.
I use gmail to receive e-mails both from my gmail address and my own domain, but gmail no longer allows you to send e-mails from your own domain name unless you provide your own SMTP server to send via.
I just the server to act as the final MTA that will send e-mails directly to the recipient's mailserver without being treated as spam.
Therefore I am trying to configure Postfix on an Ubuntu server to relay e-mail from any remote device to the destination e-mail address on the e-mail.
