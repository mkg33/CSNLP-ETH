If it does then that's a sign that your wireless network may be the culprit.
That should give you an idea of where to begin to focus your efforts.
In the case of an all wireless network I'd wonder if you're seeing sufficient packet loss as to make DNS unreliable, which will cause the rest of the logon process to fail.
Watch the packets on the wire-- they're trying to tell you what's going on.
If they aren't then I'd start by making these assumptions true first.
If you haven't isolated the wireless network from the equation yet I'd recommend attaching an affected computer to a wired network, booting it up from a powered-off state, allowing it to pull DHCP (and, ideally, watching either in your DHCP server's management interface or a sniffer to see that it actually pulls an IP address), and see if it acts differently.
I'm assuming these clients are obtaining IP addresses from DHCP and are only receiving, as DHCP options, the addresses of DNS servers running on Active Directory domain controller computers.
By the user logon stage of the boot process you should be seeing the client making DNS requests to locate DC's, followed by LDAP and SMB/CIFS requests to determine site membership, apply machine group policy, etc.
In my opinion you'd do well to use a sniffer to examine the traffic between the client computer and the domain controller(s) to determine what's actually happening behind the scenes.
