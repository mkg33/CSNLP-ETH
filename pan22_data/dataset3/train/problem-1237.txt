LTSP and rolling your own distro or Ubuntu are probably your two best bets.
Contact some users in the respective communities that have rolled this out in their schools and get their tips/opinion/gotchas.
You'll need to buy a half-decent server and a dedicated switch, but otherwise this is a very cheap way of running a teaching room.
You'll want to go with a Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) based Linux distro.
Something like Skolelinux would probably work well.
You can load a small PXE environment from floppy or CD if your network cards don't directly support PXE.
Client machines can be controlled by the teacher with iTALC.
The 18 client machines are actually older PCs with the harddrives removed that boot from the network via PXE.
You guys might be interested in this podcast about doing linux install fests for older refurbed machines and then donating them to local schools.
You install software once, on the server, and that's it.

Server installation was a case of installing a second network card in the server machine (a reasonably hefty Dell server) and booting the install CD, everything was automatic (note that you now install LTSP by selecting "LTSP Mode" as an install option by pressing F4 on the boot screen of the Ubuntu Alternate CD - see the Edubuntu documentation for details).
We use an Edubuntu-based LTSP thin client system in our junior school's IT room.
