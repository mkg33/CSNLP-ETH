Each of them will have data which is the concatenation of disk id and partition offset
If you find any disk ID matches for the disk, delete them (may want to back up first in case?)
if the hex offset you saw was 100000, the 8 byte LSB version of that would be 00 00 10 00 00 00 00 00)
For example, if your disk id is 677a2344, it will appear as 44 23 7a 67.
Type \DosDevices\X: (or whatever letter you want that is currently unused).
For the data, enter the disk ID in LSB order, followed by the partition offset in LSB order, padded to 8 bytes (e.g.
You will see a list of Volume{GUID} and \DosDevices\:
First, look for the existing disk signature in the data of volume and dosdevices.
To do this, right click "MountedDevices" and choose "new>binary value".
Post reboot, or if you don't see the disk ID anywhere, we're going to try creating our own dosdevices entry.
The order is LSB, so you will need to "backwards read".
Look for any "unknown disk" (and any other unknowns at this point would probably be good to fix)
After reboot, check to see if there's a drive letter, if not, continue.
