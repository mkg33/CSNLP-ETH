[2] Computer science tackles 30-year-old economics problem -
this is clearly a very emerging area so surveys and established literature would be difficult to come by.
[3] Menu size complexity of auctions Sergiu Hart, Noam Nisan
however a compelling/natural area on the rise/intersection between CS/econ: try recent research into auctions which is especially significant given google Adsense advertising largely funding the rise of the company over the last decade and also their singular auction-based IPO.
MIT researchers generalize Nobel winnerâ€™s work on single-item auctions to auctions involving multiple items.
also note the large-scale economy price fluctuations and buyer/seller dynamics can be modelled somewhat as an auction-like system.
also complexity theory may be a little more abstract for this.
another somewhat similar area where some very advanced/substantial CS is applied is high-speed trading, a complex/advancing science but unfortunately it is not openly published research due to its heavy secrecy.
