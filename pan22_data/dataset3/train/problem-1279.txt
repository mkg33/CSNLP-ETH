People using these tools find widely varying degrees in terms of ease of use and success rates, so as usual, YMMV.
You've got options, but none are particularly pretty.
Its messy but you should be able to restore everything that had previously run.
But, it is so easy to mix up crontab -r and crontab -e. I just did this myself.
Now you should also execute the grep on older cronlogs to find out jobs that might be run only once in a month.
Try googling for tutorials based around sleuthkit and UFS Explorer.
It's time to start to backup this important file (with all others in /etc /var/spool /home...).
I only say that because I often forget about copies that may be on other machines, so I assume that you've already tried that.

It outputs a single instance of every cron command run by the user for the last week.
You can try to have a look at /var/log/cron and build your crontab again.
I made a PHP script that does a full recovery of your crontab, based on the log.
If your file is too heavily customized to make simply rebuilding it practical, you can always try some low-level forensics.
Try looking at /var/log/cron to see what has been running and then try to recreate the crontab  from that.
