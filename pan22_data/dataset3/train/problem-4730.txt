If I connect the second PC using the Alfa adapte directly without my own router, it gives me much better pings.
I tried editing the "Local Area Connection" IPv4 properties on the second PC, so instead of getting the DNS ips automatically (which is the main PC local ip set on the router) it use OpenDNS ips (also tried Google Public DNS ips).
To achieve this I enabled ICS on my main PC "Wireless Network Connection" and shared it to my "Local Area Connection", I setup the gateway on my own router as the main PC local ip.
I used my own router instead of connecting both PCs together because my router also has wifi and I can use it like a "repeater" for my Kindle HD and other devices that wont reach my brother's router.
OpenDNS does improve web surfing a little bit (google public dns doesn't), but I still get high pings on video games.
Is there anything else I could test to get better pings using my own router?
My main (work) PC connects to the internet using my brother's router (he lives a few houses from me) via wifi using an Alfa AWUS036H adapter and a big antenna.
To connect my second (gaming) PC to the internet, I have connected both PCs to my own router and enabled ICS on the main PC.
With this setup both PCs (and any other device connected to my router via wifi) have internet, but when I try to play online video games, the second PC gets really high pings.
