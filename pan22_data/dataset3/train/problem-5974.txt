I have this setup and it works fine with simple home router.
If you want to seperate LAN2 from LAN1 solution here would be use of VLANs on the switch.
Below is a diagram of what exists (LAN 1) and what I want to add (LAN 2).
Where it gets trickier, is if something in lan1 as to enter lan2, like printer advertisement or you want network discovery to browse you co-workers fileshare.
From your routers perspective, lan1 is the same as the Internet.
I’d like to create my own LAN with all my devices (Laptop, NAS, IP phones) connected to it.
To restrict the access to your LAN you can then use firewall on your router (you will add rule that traffic from LAN1 clients will be restricted)
They have a LAN connected to the internet, and it’s shared among everyone in the (small) building.
The router in LAN 2 will separate the differing network segments, creating a distinctly different LAN.
I have a few network devices I want to connect, but I don’t want them to be visible to everyone on the shared LAN.
But I also want to use the internet connection available in the main LAN.
Another solution would be to use classic routing, however someone has to configure the router in LAN 1 with static routing (or dynamic, but in this situation it would be waste).
