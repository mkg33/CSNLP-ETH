I managed to get all of this done, except for having a remote-root shell, which is not executing any commands and "dropping the connection" back to my ubuntu system.
I have a problem with the tool expect under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
SSH-Keys and direct root-login is not a solution for me, as we are having too much Sophos UTMs out there.
Changing the script like this, doesn't help with the dropping connection issue:
I want to automate ssh logins to some Sophos UTM Firewalls and evelate my rights directly after with "sudo su -" and the correct password.
I don't have to worry about plain text passwords, because my script runs directly out of the KeePass URL field (doubleclick executes the script and fills it with the correct passwords via agrument/KeePass {Placeholder} behind the script).
So the command I'm trying to run remotely is not excecuting for 4-5 seconds and then gets suddenly executed on the ubuntu system, without telling me what happened.
What do I have to do, to have fully functioning remote-shell?
If you want a "responsive" remote shell, you need an interact command after completing the login exchange.
