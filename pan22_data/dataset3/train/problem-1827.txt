Example query that I use to get the data for the visits chart:
It works similar to Google Analytics but it only saves and shows you data from search traffic: visitors, keywords, pages and page views.
I also don't know if I should index the date field.

PS: For the production server I was thinking to start with a dedicated server with some 16-32GB RAM because I know that giving more memory to mysql buffers is also very important.
Right now with a website that has 30.000 monthly visits some queries are slow because what I need to do is to select between dates, and then for charts I group data by days.
I am currently using MySQL with InnoDB engine and this is the database structure for the 4 main tables:
What I use right now for the date is the field "date_add" with DATETIME column type and I store date in UTC and then I convert it to the timezone of the website.
I am building a web analytics application for search engine traffic only.
I think the main problem is that I am doing too much conversions on the date_add field, for selecting, for comparing and for grouping, and also I am adding or subtracting the offset of the timezone.
So do you think this changes will improve performance?
Since it's a application that will store some large amount of rows I want to make sure it won't overload the server in the first month after launch.
