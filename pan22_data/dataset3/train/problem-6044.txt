Unfortunately there is no simple answer to the problem.
From everything you have described, the problem is interference - ie someone else has set up an access point which is trying to use all the available bandwidth or another device (baby monitor, cordless phone, microwave are prime candidates) is spewing noise and killing the spectrum.
(802.11ac works in the 5 gig rather then 2.4 gig band, which means that it is less prone to interference because its less used, has more spectrum and signals don't travel as far).
I do note that there is a small possibility that another WIFI device is transmitting on the same / overlapping frequency with your router, in which case you can log into it and change the channel you are using.
If you have an android tablet/smartphone you can download a free App WIFI Analyser which can show you what channels quietest and you may be able to use those.
You either need to track down the source of Interference and eliminate it - which can be quite hard, block the interference (again, quite hard) avoid using WIFI, or get a newer router which handles 802.11ac connections - and make sure your equipment also handles it.
It also has an idea of using multiple antennas to cancel out interference and create "corridores" which increase performance.
