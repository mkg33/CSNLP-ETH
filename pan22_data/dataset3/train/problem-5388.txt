Most of time HP installers launch automatically after extracting but to be on the safe side move to c:\SWSetup\SP73310 there you will find SETUP.EXE launch as Admin.

This is the part your're missing : Realtek RTL8188EE 802.11b/g/n 1x1 Wi-Fi adapter
Also, how likely is it the adapter just melted when my computer froze?
Check also if you by accident have Turned ON Flight mode disable by pressing FN+F10 or F11 or the one F button with the little plane on it.

2.1 if the the SETUP does not launch after extracting please follow step 3, else skip to 4.
I'm assuming the only one of those I'm connecting to stuff with is the Realtek PCIe FE one, but I don't think from what I've read that it's wireless.
Can someone please tell me a) if one of these might be responsible for Wi-Fi, how do I fix it?
Windows can't find it, I can't find it, nobody knows where it went.
or b) if the wireless driver pulled a Houdini, how do I get it back?
My computer crashed, which hasn't been an uncommon occurrence lately with this piece of rubbish, but this time I rebooted to find I'm missing my wireless adapter or something.
I suppose I could try installing a new driver, but I have no clue what I'd be looking for.
