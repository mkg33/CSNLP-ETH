The first thing I would do is come up with a list of the requirements you will be operating under due to policy, regulations, etc.
I think you're putting the cart before the horse a bit here.
Where this approach is likely to fall down is in the fine-grained access control - in other words, making sure that only some people can see some stuff, and not other stuff.
Then, with your requirements in hand, you can go looking for the right tool.
I might suggest trying to find some communities/lists that are specifically about HIPPA implementation.
Finally, I don't know of any wiki that handles encrypted datastores.
Add to that whatever requirements you have for what authentication back end you want, editing capabilties, etc.
It sounds like you need to have data encrypted at rest, and in flight, to start with, along with relatively fine-grained access control and significant capabilities for audit/logging of access.
There may already be something you can use available, but just not commonly known outside of the communities that require it.
Wikis do track changes, which is good for auditing - careful use of the various access levels might go a long way towards building something decent with one.
Maybe a wiki will work for some of it; you can use SSL with them, and most can be configured to only allow access to authenticated users.
