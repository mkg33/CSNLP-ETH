I'm migrating a clients website from one CMS to another, and of moving to newer faster machines all at the same time.
It seems to me this must be a reasonably common use case, yet I can't find any sort of help on this.
There is documentation on the MySQL website for migration.
I don't know if that change is correct or not, but I guess we'll see...
Possibly all my Google searches just drown in irrelevant answers.
The import succeeded after I changed all PRIMARY KEY  TYPE BTREE to PRIMARY KEY  USING BTREE.
The problem is that the old server runs MySQL 4 and the new MySQL 5.
This seems to me to be a common use case, so I'm surprised so little information is about it, so sorry if it's a duplicate, but I have searched.
So when i do a mysqldump at the old site and then try to run it on the new site I get syntax errors.
Most seem to agree that mysqldump is the right answer, but noone mentions that you can get syntax errors...
I also tried to use an even older syntax by dumping with --compatible mysql323, but that just resulted in
As a part of this I'm moving a MySQL database from the old server to the new ones.
