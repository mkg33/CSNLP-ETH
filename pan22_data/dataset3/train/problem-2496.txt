I clicked the two checkboxes: scan for an attempt recovery of bad sectors and fix file system errors.
I am thinking of called data recovery services but I don't want to screw something up.
It was taking a long time so I canceled it, took the drive out of windows machines, put it back into linux machine to check it.
Also, should I run a disc utility/data recovery like Ultimate Boot CD or TestDisk?
Use this Software it is the best for recovering files.
There is lots of software recovery options available depending on the data type and filesystem.
Windows said there was a problem with the drive and asked me if I wanted to run a scan.
Trying to recover data off a failing disk is going to make it worse, so you want to get as much raw data as possible (which ddrescue excels at) and then recover from a good disk.
I took it out of my linux machine and put it into my windows machine.
Once you have the raw data, the ideal is to work on a copy, so if your software fails you can try other techniques.
Don't use your HDD in the mean time or you will override files you want back.
The first thing you do is get a second hard drive and use (gnu) ddrescue from a pen drive (or equivalent,) to make a copy of your disk, ideally then doing another bitcopy to another drive.
This is important as it sounds like your HDD is dying.
