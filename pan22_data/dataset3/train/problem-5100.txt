Whether you attempt to obfuscate the passwords or not is your business, but you're still giving them the passwords.
The program that uses those parameter is responsible for the decryption.
If the script can de-obfuscate the password so can the user.
If it is a program written by you perhaps you may use this approach.
So long as the execution context of this script is the user you have to give them the passwords.
In most cases we don't keep passwords in the batch or configuration files.
By definition the user's has to be able to recover the passwords in order to use them.
Any obfuscation or encoding of the passwords that you perform is just a "speed bump" for a determined user to find out what the passwords are.
You can use NTFS ACLs to protect the files from users who are not authorized to execute them.
Assuming you're trying to protect the passwords from the users who are allowed to execute the scripts, what you're saying isn't possible.
Users who are authorized to execute them, by definition, can read the passwords (in the obfuscated form, if you choose to obfuscate them).
If we really need to do so, We are using some encryption mechanism to do that.
