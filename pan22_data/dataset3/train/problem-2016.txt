I have searched everywhere but cannot find what is wrong except a suspicious WINS entry on the remote DNS which looks like this:
The \\country1.company.com\company namespace is not specified in the DFS on our local site.
Short story One day, on client computers, the remote DFS \\country1.company.com\company stopped working and \\country1.company.com keeps resolving to a local server IP.
However, if the request is executed on the local server, the DFS resolves correctly (at least it seems).
\\country1.company.com\company is a DFS namespace in the country1.company.com domain.
Long story We have 2 physical office locations that are NOT in the same forest, but still configured such that they are in country1.company.com and country2.company.com.
country1.company.com is in the subnet 192.168.2.x while country2.company.com is in the subnet 192.168.3.x
EDIT: Not sure if it helps, we recently installed (halfway, still not operational) DFS on our local site with the namespace \\country2.company.com\company.
where 192.168.3.X is our local subnet, and both the above address are our local Win2k3 and Win2k8 servers respectively.
In DNS of country2.company.com, country1.company.com is added as a secondary forward lookup zone.
