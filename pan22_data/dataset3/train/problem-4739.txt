When the connection list came back up, the offending SSID was finally gone.
Does anyone know what he writes there to make his laptop completely forget about the Wi-Fi settings he just set up?
If you open the Network and Sharing Center, then click on "Manage wireless networks" you can remove all saved wireless network profiles.
I watched Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) in Windows 7 on Channel 9 and would love to test it out.
In the video one of the guys go into the command prompt and runs some command starting with netsh, but then zooms out so you don't get to see the rest of what he writes.
I tried refreshing the available connections list, turning the radio off and on, resetting the cable modem, the netsh commands mentioned in another answer, searching the Registry for the SSID and deleting all of the associated keys - none of that worked.
I was finally able to make it go away by disabling the wireless profile, then using the network troubleshooter to re-enable it (because "Disable" never changed to "Enable").
