Because... You have hundreds of hours of more interesting problems to solve before worrying about 1000 low-bandwidth players.
You will certainly need to resolve issues relating to timing of nodes with different ping times, lost and found connections, sanity-synchs from time to time, and many other things.
You will probably benefit from omitting duplicate data; there's no need for sending "Still moving at velocity 1.0, no change there!"
Switching from JSON to binary, if and when the time comes, will involve swapping out one well-defined part of your code.
(Or possibly keeping both, and checking if the first character of a message is '{' to decide which flavor.)
In the early stages, having text-based easy-to-read messages will be more valuable.
It will ease your debugging, and you can use ready-made solutions to get on with it.
By all means, keep in mind that eventually, to run at scale with as few servers as possible, you may need to use a binary format.
(On the other hand, if you're not actually writing a game, and just want to learn about data compression for networking, that would change your priorities.)
