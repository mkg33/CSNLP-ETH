Now I have a message that says: Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key.
There's six of them and the mouse and keyboard seem to work fine on them.
When I go into Bios, I can see an icon labeled USB, so I made that the first Boot devise priority.
For some reason, the flash drive doesn't light up when I plug it into the the USB port that is built into the case; maybe I plugged that into the wrong place on the motherboard.
Can I use the USB ports that are directly on the Motherboard and which is which?
I downloaded Ubuntu, and put it on my flash drive.
Then I restart and do not press delete and received a message that says: Remove disks or other media.
Then I'll start the machine and hit delete on my keyboard once I see the Bios splash screen to access the UI for Bios.
So I remove the flash drive and hit F on my keyboard.
I plugged the flash drive back in a hit F on my keyboard.
I plugged it into one of the USB ports that is connected directly to the motherboard.
I just built my first computer, and I need help getting Ubuntu installed.
