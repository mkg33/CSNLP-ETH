Just cancel this prompt (hit Escape) and you'll remain on the console session.
I am wondering if there is a chance to directly connect to a VMs console via RDP.
Hyper-V Manager's console connect does not use a RDP session.
My solution:  Shutdown the VM, open a VM console connection to the VM, and power it back up.
When the system boots and switches to the windows graphical desktop, by default the HyperV vmconnect console pops up a window to choose the resolution and local resource settings (unless you've checked "save for future connections" box).
It seems the hyper-v manager is basicaly doing the same when connecting to a VMs console.
It seems if the Windows OS on the VM is already up and running when you open the HyperV console, it will connect to an RDP session and NOT the console session.
You are now on the actual "console" session of the VM.
Remote Desktop and connecting to a VM's console through Hyper-V Manager are two separate things.
I found this out becuase the local policy on the hardened OS image I loaded from had RDP logins (even local admins) and I couldn't gather why it was telling me I needed rights for Remote Desktop connections when I was at the "console"
