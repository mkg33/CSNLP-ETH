(as far as I know you have to toggle between onboard or external graphics usage in the BIOS)
That said, I think a EyeInfinity video card will be much more cost effective than Matrox stuff, please correct me if I am wrong on this.
You should consider Eye Infinity from AMD/ATI with screens that support DisplayPort :
Of course, I could've gotten a converter but I figured the 22" widescreen had enough screen area to make up for the 17" :D
2 from the card and the third from the onboard video.
Also see my answer for a similar question, particularly the USB video adapter comments:
We have a bunch of older Dells (like Dimension 3100) at the office that can run 3 displays with the addition of a video card.
I forgot when I was buying my third monitor (which only outputs DVI as my other 2 does) and so I had to forgo my oldest monitor, 17", to get my new 22" on.
My 5770 here has a Display Port, HDMI and 2xDL-DVI.
And about using the onboard VGA, I don't think it's possible since the onbard VGA is automaticaly disable when something is plugged on the PCI-E port.

But if you're getting a card, check whether the ports on the card will fit your monitors.
And, I don't know if Matrox still make hardware but if so, they have solution that allow you to do this.
