This will typically be the IP address assigned to the interface the post-NAT packet is sent out on.
if you wish to filter based on the actual source of the packet, you should use -s x.x.x.x/xx before the -j MASQUERADE
In practice, that will usually mean that the source will be the normal source address for the route to the destination's next hop.
If I have two NICs on my server, what is the difference of
the purpose of using MASQUERADE is so that it will modify the source address to that of the interface it is going out of; if the outgoing interface has a static IP, use SNAT, don't use MASQUERADE; it causes all connections to be forgotten whenever the interface goes down and is essentially intended for any interface that has a changing IP.
When --source isn't specified, what does iptables then use as default?
If you run iptables -t nat -L -v -n, you will see something like this:
The system will follow the normal rules to define the source address as the machine's local address that is "closest" to the destination.
