For $m$ polynomials $f_1(a), \ldots, f_m(a)$, $\sigma = (\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_m) \in \{-, +\}^m$ is a sign pattern if there exists some $a$ such that for all $i$ the sign of $f_i(a)$ is $\sigma_i$.
where the max is taken over sets $X$ of $m$ points.
For each $a \in \mathbb{R}^p$, the set $S(a)$ is defined as $S(a) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^d: f(x, a) \leq 0\}$.
The following is based on Jiri Matousek's Geometric Discrepancy book.
Let $f$ be a degree $D$ polynomial in $d + p$ variables.
This is the primal shatter function of the range space $\{S(a)\}$.
We can get a bound on a quantity which is more delicate than VC dimension in this model.
A result from algebraic geometry is that the maximum number of distinct sign patterns of $m$ degree $D$ polynomials in $p$ variables is bounded by $2^{O(p)}(Dm/p)^p$.
For example, circles are defined as $(x_1 - a_1)^2 + (x_2 - a_2)^2 - 1 \leq 0$.
Define $\pi(m)$ as the maximum number of distinct sets induced by $\{S(a)\}$ on any set of $m$ points, i.e.
\pi(m) = \max_{X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d}{|\{S(a) \cap X\}|},
Also, if the VC-dimension of a range space is $k$, then its shatter function is bounded by $O(m^k)$.
We get that $|\{S(a) \cap X\}|$ is exactly the number of distinct sign patterns of $f_1, \ldots, f_m$.
Define a range space in $\mathbb{R}^d$ parametrized by $a_1, \ldots, a_p$ as follows.
Notice that the VC-dimension of of the range space is that maximum $m$ such that $\pi(m) = 2^m$.
So, in particular, if a range space is given by a family of constant degree polynomials in $p$ parameters, its shatter function is bounded by $O(m^p)$.
