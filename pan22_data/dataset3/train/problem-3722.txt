This is the code-behind for MainWindow, it seems, which should be an effector class (handling what the user sees).
");, whereas in other places you update updateLabel.
[ln 30-31] Style choice: I recommend using {} around conditionals, even if they're only one line - because if you update them and make them more than one line and forget to add the brackets... exceptions.
Watch out for inconsistent naming: FindWoWDirectory vs WoWFolder, for instance.
Even though this isn't that long (250 lines), I still feel that there's a lot of code in this class that belongs in a dedicated class, e.g.
Make this method return null if there is no news to be had because of the WebException, and do the check in the UI code [ln 55]:
[multiple] As mentioned in other answers: rename Realmlist to RealmList or Realms.
Realmlist is a compound word, so it should be RealmList.
Be consistent throughout: if this is a setting that a user needs to understand (hence why you used Folder instead of Directory), convert it to Directory code-side.
You have a using System.Windows.Forms; at the top, yet you still specify the full namespace in the code: System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK.
the update check, retrieval of the WoW directory,...
Web Forms MVP is probably overkill for this kind of project (since I doubt there will be much functionality to be added in the future), but I'd still try to limit the code in this MainWindow class to UI-related code, and move all other code to smaller dedicated classes.
I have just somewhat completed a program, and was wondering what I could do to improve readability, and design as some functions seems to be rather large and an eye-sore.
Rename it; again, consider the point above that it should be realms.
For instance: progressText doesn't really convey what it is.
[ln 81] You've already included System.Windows.Forms - no need to have the entire name here.
Actually, scrap that, it should be Realms because you should avoid using the name of the type in the name of the property or field.
[ln 60] Single responsibility: if GetNews's purpose is to get news, it shouldn't also be dealing with notifying the user if there is none.
It seems a bit odd to me that you suddenly use MessageBox.Show("Cannot find WoW Directory.
Make another class containing the helper methods like GetNews, GetWoWDirectory, etc., for the business layer, and refer to it from MainWindow.
Indent the first line of the snippet above by one more space.
(Also please be consistent: in one place you name this updateText.)
