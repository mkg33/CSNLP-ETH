I had a similar issue, and Jacobm001's answer didn't work for me, so I thought I'd add my solution in case it helps anyone else.
Hopefully you can now work with this repo on your pi!
I am logging in to git with the same account pi that I used to set up the respository directory on the raspberry pi.
Create a new repository on GitHub, and then clone this in your pi.
Its a partial solution as I am still unable to remotely create a git repo, but I can clone an existing repo from github and then use git to push/pull changes to this repo.
I have followed the instructions to set up a private git respository on my raspeberry pi.
How do I give access to my git login to access the directory?
On the raspberry pi I needed to use sudo to set up the directory.
The solution, as suggested here, was to insure that my Pi's SSH key was set up properly:
However, I encountered an error when trying to remotely add my repo.
Paste your entire SSH key into GitHub > Account > Settings > SSH and GPG Keys.
I followed these instructions to set up Git on my Pi.
