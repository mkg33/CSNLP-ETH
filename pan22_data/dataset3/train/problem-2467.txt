Glue records have extremely big value, then NSes of domain located on hosts inside served domain.
We are experiencing intermittent access problems with the site (some people can view it/some can not).
We have had our domain registrar change the 'A' record to point to a web host's server (dedicated IP) where our site is set up.
In order to avoid such loops, glue records for domains, which have own NSes inside itself, carry additional data - IP of hostname
Glue records in parent zone provide exactly this ability: if we'll continue to use example above, in c.d.e.f.com zone definition we must have b IN NS somename, where somename is|are hostname(s) of NSes for domain b.c.d.e.f.com (and this records must be identical to righthand of IN NS RR in domain b.c.d.e.f.com - parents and auth.
The registrars say they are unable to change the nameservers (their nameservers) for the domain - the only way would be to transfer the domain away from them.
I am wondering if this issue has anything to do with the nameservers not pointing to the hosts nameservers?
Just imagine - we have to find NSes of domain b.c.d.e.f.com, placed (for simplicity - 1 NS) on names.b.c.d.e.f.com, but in order to know IP of names, we have to get zone b.c.d.e.f.com, for which task we have to know IP of names... etc.
