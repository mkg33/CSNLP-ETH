I have a headless linux mint machine that I use for a file server and other things.
Personally, I only use it to turn on my machine, and never use it once the machine is on.
run xinput --list power buttons have their own entry... pick the device number then run
Edit the file : /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/inet (edit POWR key)
Take three pieces of corrugated cardboard, and cut a hole in each large enough for your finger to reach through to the button.
Is there an easy way to change the behavior of the power button so it requires an extremely long duration press (10 seconds or so) or multiple presses in order to do anything?
xinput disable devnumber something like xinput disable 8
Then you will need to disable the power button efficiently a good method is with xinput
First you could edit your keymap file to change the behavior of the power button to assign it to an other key
Well, one thing you could do is simply disable the power button altogether.
To make the power button do nothing, change it to:
If this is an OK solution for you, edit /etc/acpi/events/powerbtn-acpi-support:
Glue them together, with the hole aligned, then duct tape the assembly around the button.
It's been working great for me for a few years, but there's one issue - my cat likes to hang out on top of it, and when she climbs off and on she occasionally steps on the power button and shuts off the machine.
