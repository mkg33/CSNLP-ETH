I've never had an issue running a Linux guest on Hyper-V.  Plus Hyper-V Server is free.
If you go with windows as a host, the OS will eat most of your resources and is not optimized for virtualization.
ESXi is "built" for virtualization by a company that is into virtualization and is light weight (~400MB I think) and low maintenance
However, maximum RAM on hypervisor is 32GB and so is for the VM running on it.
Go with ESXi 5 if you are not blocked on the restrictions of ESXi 5 for free usage -- http://www.vladan.fr/esxi-5-free-whats-the-limitations/
To summarize, ESXi 5 no restrictions on number of CPU or CPU cores.
However, the system needs and specifications matter.
If the systems are of relatively equal priority, I'd just go the VMWare ESXi route and allocate resources that way.
If this is a case where you have a critical Linux system that needs the bulk of the system's resources, you could use Linux as a host and run Linux KVM virtualization to host a Windows guest.
Be sure to use an HP-specific build of ESXi or install the HP CIM agents to obtain full hardware health monitoring if you go that route.
