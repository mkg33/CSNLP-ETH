I'm trying to set up a reverse proxy with Apache, and for the most part it is working well with ProxyPass.
indicator, documented here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypassreverse
Depending on your Apache setup a default error document has been defined outside of the /examples location excluded from your ProxyPass.
Which will result in any 404 message being redirect to /error/HTTP_NOT_FOUND.html.
IN your case that means a request for /examples/no-such-file will still be redirected to http://localhost:3000/.
Second to you may want to investigate in the meaning of the ProxyPassReverse  directive you omitted from your sample config.
[en | es | de | fr ] depending and the accept language settings of the browser generating the 404 error.
That works okay if I go to a file in /examples which exists, but if I hit an address which results in a 404 error, the request gets proxied rather than just the 404 being returned.
I couldn't see anything about this in the documentation - does anyone know how it can be done?
I would like to exclude one of the directories which I understand I can do with the !
