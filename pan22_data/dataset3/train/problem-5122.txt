These are all self-explanatory when examining their titles.
If "Date and Time" is selected from the "Categories" field in the "Field" window, you see the following options:
Knowing this, let's examine features within Word 2010 that will help with your concern:
Is there any way of Word 2010 automatically updating the data so that versions don't get mixed up?
2) In the "Insert" section of the "Header and Footer Tools", click on "Quick Parts."
This field will be "greyed out," and your name (entered when you set-up Word 2010) will be displayed.
However, the description field is available at the bottom by the button "Field Codes."
Do this by double-clicking near the top of the page.
Follow these steps to open the "Field" window in Word 2010:
3) Under the "Categories" section, isolate commands by selecting "Document Information."
@Chris mentions the use of a third-party software.
Document version naming (V1, V2, V3, etc...) may be difficult, as many programs only see "versions" as "deltas" in information (if info is added or deleted, that's the "newer" version).
As previously stipulated, the closest thing a computer understands for version is date of creation/date of update.
I would like to insert a table footer in my policy manual which shows the for example the "Version" (draft 1, draft 2, final etc) "Date of Update", "Updated by".
However, please be aware that the name of the user may not match the person's actual name (if an individual is using a computer at an institution, "Corp XYZ" may be the user).
This opens the "Header and Footer Tools" in the Word 2010 Ribbon at the top of the screen (the tab colour should be green by default).
Even though there is always an option to install third-party software that will benefit the end-user, this question seems to be directed towards increasing end-user knowledge of the software, and NOT learning about more software.
4) If "LastSavedBy" is selected, Word 2010 should display the name of the user that last saved the document.
