You can do a restore using T/SQL and specifying the network share location.
If you need to change where the physical files are stored then use the MOVE parameter.
This does require that the SQL Account that runs the SQL Server has rights to the network location.
Would the backup data fill up all the available space on C:?
It will be great if somebody explain how the data is laid out after the restore database is initiated on a target database server?
I have two Sql Server database instances on two different machines across the network.
Due to some infrastructural issues, I had to make a complete backup of the database on server A and robocopy the A.bak over to a shared drive accessible by both A and B.
Simply specify the network location of the backup file.
My first issue is to restore the backup on server B but the backup location does not display my shared drive.
My next issue is that server B's C: drive has barely any space left and there are some additional partitions that have more space and can house my backup file but I am not sure what happens to the data after I restore the database on B.
