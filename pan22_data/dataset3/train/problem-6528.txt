(exceptions: Matrox dual head and similar, non-cheap, hardware).
With the software installed, you should be able to configure everything without problems.
Note that splitting DVI or HDMI into two cables usually does not work.
I'm not sure about your graphics card, but you could always check the documentation to see if the DVI port is intended for use with a splitter (some are).
EDIT: I personally don't like splitters for anything, unless the original device is configure to handle it.
I would personally recommend plugging one monitor into each of the two digital outputs.
You're going to have to (if you haven't done so already) download the install AMD/ATI's desktop software from AMD's support page.
Your main monitor into the DVI and the secondary into the HDMI.
Unless you used some active (and probably not-cheap) hardware that will have work.
The plugs much match, buit without some kind of active convertor this will never work.
But still, if you have the option to plug the screens into different ports, why not make good use of it.
