Are you able to put a Windows or some other machine with a GUI on the same network temporarily?
Now just download that 1GB.bin file to test its upload speed (a server is uploading when it serves web traffic).
It can measure the transfer rate between to tcp sockets.
No need for installation of additional tools, can be done from the CLI and should provide stats for you too
You can create a 1GB file by doing the following (linux):
A quick search didn't turn up any free FTP sites/servers but I did see some that are inexpensive for low monthly transfer rates.
Command line interface for testing internet bandwidth using speedtest.net
Be sure the line you are downloading from has sufficient bandwith (ie: another 1Gbps server).
I've found that I usually get about 10-20% of advertised speeds due to network conditions.
To install nginx do sudo apt-get install nginx and place your 1GB.bin file in /var/www/html.
ie: a 250Mbps line usually will give me 10-12Mbps consistently.
That would allow you to use some of the other tools suggested and other than hardware differences should give you a comparable analysis.
I also can test upload by serving a 1GB.bin file and downloading it from another server that claims 10Gbps or whatever speed you have.
Could you maybe use `fetch' or wget to grab a large tarball from a mirror site that's hosted in Europe?
You can also use wget <ip-of-server>/1GB.bin -O /tmp/1GB.bin
Then you can download from another server (to test your target servers upload speed) with curl <ip-of-server>/1GB.bin -o /tmp/1GB.bin -- you should see the speed used in the transfer.
If you're willing to test the bandwith between to sites (providing you can setup forwarding), there's a tool called NetSpeed wich you can find here.
