When I attach to the AP (HOSTAPD) on WLAN0 from my laptop I get a 172.24.1.x address and can ssh into the machine (172.24.1.1) and I can ssh to machines on the 192.168.1.x network.
The information below show's the current contents of my /etc/network/interfaces, /etc/dnsmasq.conf, iptables-save output and /proc/net/ipv4/ip_foward files.
Any ideas on what I need to do to get the eth0 network to get DHCP addresses from the 172.24.1.1 host and if possible get the other machines that are on the same network (wired to a switch) to request DHCP addresses as well.
I'm willing to statically address everything if needed, however, I'd like to use DHCP if possible.
I would like the ETH0 adapter on the 172.24.1.1 host to get and address from the DNSMASQ pool and I would like the other four machines to get an address from 172.24.1.1 host as well.
The ETH0 adapter is connected to a switch with 4 other machines on that network.
From the ifconfig -a information (shown last) you can see that the ETH0 adapter is getting a 169.254.62.167 address instead of an address on the 172.24.1.x network.
