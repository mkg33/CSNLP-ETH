It's evident in Safe Mode, as well as on another machine running Ubuntu.
if that is the case then other devices (especially USB) would also show issues.
other than that, it is possible you have a virus on the machine or a program which is trying to interact with the screen... like its trying to take focus.
To save money I had to change the Omron switches myself and now it's ok. You can also just try to fix the switches (you have to rebend a small piece of metal inside, it's not easy and won't last long).
I've had this problem on many Logitech mouses (expensives ones).
I say this because this is the 3rd mouse I've had develop this problem.
But now as it progressed, it's obvious that the mouse is bad.
When I initially checked there probably wasn't enough time for the problems to surface, or it had good days and bad days.
It's most likely a problem with the switch (most likely Omron brand).
one thought i have is a hardware interrupt issue where the 'signal' from the USB connection is fighting with some other hardware?
I'm reluctant to plug in any fresh meat until I get this question sorted:
The mice have been damaged permanently, perhaps due to faulty USB ports on the motherboard.
I checked again and it turns out that it is indeed a hardware issue.
does the mouse pointer move smoothly or does it judder, or occasionally stutter?
Your USB port most likely doesn't have anything to do with your problem.
