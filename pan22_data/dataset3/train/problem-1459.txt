The only way I can see doing that is to manually go through each shortcut in Gnome and Compiz and change it.

It's incredibly useful, especially because it allows emacs shortcuts everywhere.
I've searched almost everywhere for some kind of utility that can allow this and can't find anything.
Note: I want to do more than just remap my keyboard.

It's a project I recently created, after a few years of tackling this problem a few different ways and I just now feel like it's solid enough to share.
I absolutely love that Mac separates the command key from the control key, allowing OS shortcuts and text shortcuts to co-exist.
The Kinto installer simply uses python to do the initial install, after that it's just a systemd service, bash, xprop, setxkbmap and xkbcomp.
As far as I am concerned it is the fastest and most native solution to this problem that you are going to find.
Here's a Gist as well, if you just want to see what is at the heart of it all, it will not alternate your keymap when needed though.
The Gist also does not include custom xkb keymap files that setup macOS style cursors/word-wise manipulations that use Cmd and the arrow keys.
I want to actually split OS shortcuts and text shortcuts.
