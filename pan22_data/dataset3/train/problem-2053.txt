Please note: Windows is untested so if someone could confirm the steps I would be grateful.
As mentioned above, a sure solution is to update to version 3.4 (Alpha).
What I get, using uTorrent 3.4 (build 30635), is a few ~30GB files keep having to be re-checked (for one reason, or another; looks like program crash, due 2 memory crash most probably) and this is taking AGES on an ok-system:
a work around that seems to work for me is to stop all torrents, start them again then exit UTorrent - go to your AppData/Roaming folder under your user folder and delete all the .old files then restart UTorrent - all of my 6 downloads running now.
:-/ Torrent(s) can NOT be stopped, during the check, and deleting .old files doesn't bypass the check.
But you'll have to search for that yourself (plus i'm not sure if there will be any problems with your current torrents when you downgrade)
Here is the direct link to uTorrent's website for that : http://www.utorrent.com/downloads/
cd "~/Library/Application Support/uTorrent" && sudo rm -f *.old
(gonna look for a 64-bit Torrent client, perhaps, tnx)
I have added steps for both Mac OS X and Windows, works for all versions of uTorrent (including the latest versions).
Another solution is to downgrade to a previous version.
3) Open Terminal and execute the following command (enter your password):
Z68A-G43 (G3) - i7-3770 - Vengeance 2x4GB 2133MHz - GTX 650 Gainward - WD 1TB 64MB SATA - Win7 Pro/64 SP1 / Saucy Xfce AMD64
I have it not to auto-start downloads, so they can be launched one-at-a-time; but, it's ridiculous having to wait a few minutes every-so-often (and only one HDD, so the system is pretty much locked during that time)
I know for certain that 3.3 (build 29333) works fine.
3) Open Windows Explorer and go to the following location:
