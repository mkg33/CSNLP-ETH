You could use the directory listing option in IIS but that's ugly and wouldn't meet your selective enumeration needs.
Clients receive an email with instructions for logging into the Basecamp project that we've invited them to, and then they can download files at will.
I think you're on the right track ... upload with FTP, and make available via HTTPS for download, that way browser and plugins don't affect the client end.
You might take a look at OpenVPN ALS (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openvpn-als/).
For $49/mo, you get 35 projects and 15GB of storage.
We chose this solution because we needed to track milestones and actions in addition to being able to share files with clients.
While this is a very different approach from hosting your own ftp server, which is what we did previously, we have found this to be a cost-effective and client-friendly solution.
Today, our company is using an FTP Server to transfer files to clients, vendors and more.
IIS 7.5 (Server 2008) supports an FTPS server; however, IE and FF don't without plugins, you'd have to get client software.
We send files to clients using Basecamp—a web-based project collaboration tool.
The technology has been gobbled up by Barracuda Networks who now offer it both as a software package and appliance.
