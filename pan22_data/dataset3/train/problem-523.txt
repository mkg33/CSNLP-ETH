I created a "new" custom search engine using the below url.
This was happening to me and for some reason disabling "User-Agent Switcher for Chrome" resolved the issue.
Running Chrome 16.0.912.75 m on Windows 7 Pro SP1.
This happens with one-word and multi-word search terms, and with any of the operators I use regularly.
It allowed me to maintain the predictive search, but made the omnibox search work again (this issue is back as of yesterday, 06/16/14, for me).
It doesn't work for me and, according to some web searches about it, others.
https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=%s
Whenever I ctrl+T for a new tab, enter some search terms and hit Enter, I'm taken to a blank Google homepage with this URL: https://www.google.com/webhp?rlz=1C1CHKZ_enUS440US440&sourceid=chrome-instant&ix=hea&ie=UTF-8&ion=1.
Given the URL you posted, it might be related to the Instant Search feature of Chrome.
In case you have a corrupted preferences file (you could test this with a pristine Chrome profile by specifying the --user-data-dir command line parameter), this should cause Chrome to overwrite it.
It also happens when I try to search in the url/search bar of an existing tab.
I hadn't installed any new extensions for several weeks before this started happening.
