The reason for wanting it to hibernate is to increase security (and battery life when on battery).
I have succeeded in reliably producing this behavior when the laptop is on battery power, but when it's on AC power it just never hibernates.
When the lid is closed, power-consumption goes down quite significantly... (the backlight takes quite a bit of power by itself)
MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013), OS X Yosemite (10.10.1)
These two settings don't appear in the battery pmset profile and do appear in the AC profile:
(For info on why this increases security see here.)
I'm doing this with the following settings in pmset:
I'm aiming to produce the following behavior on both battery and AC power:
This produces the behavior of the machine storing the sleepimage immediately but leaving the RAM powered; then after 300 seconds standby kicks in and causes the machine to turn off power to the RAM.
But I don't want it to hibernate immediately, so that when I close the lid and walk to the next room I can wake it up without having to wait for the RAM contents to be loaded from disk.
Unfortunately, once the MBP is asleep... it can't wake-up to hibernate.
Except this last part doesn't happen when the AC power is connected.
So it seems like something is causing standby to operate differently when on AC power.
I've tried to use autopoweroff and autopoweroffdelay, since that setting appears to be relevant when the machine is connected to power, but when I do that so far it seems to not cause anything other than normal sleep.
Your best bet is to simply disable sleep on lid-close and enable a hibernate when idle for XXX time.
