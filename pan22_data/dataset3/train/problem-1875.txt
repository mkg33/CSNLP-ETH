I keep a session running to an XP VM which stays open for weeks at a time.
I've been using the Terminal Server Client application (which fronts for rdesktop) daily for two years.
This can be avoided by clicking the "Connect" button rather than hitting [Enter].
Perhaps your session is being passed through a router which is aggressively killing inactive and idle sessions?
I have never had such problems, at least not in the past two or three years.
I have had an issue where when typing a remote server name if you hit [Enter] your are connected without mouse/keyboard interactivity and with a linux text input block in the center of the screen.
And if it hasn't been reported as a bug yet, then report it, because the bugs that are reported are fixed a lot faster than the ones that aren't.
Or some other unfriendly network widget which kills active connections?
It's probably also packaged for Ubuntu so maybe give it a try.
I would check the rdesktop's website as this sounds like a specific bug that will be reported as fixed in a future version(if it hasn't been already) under the CHANGES section.
I've been using the tsclient package (wraps support for rdesktop, vnc, etc) on Fedora 9-11 with no issues.
I used it without problem back in 2007 when I was setting up a lab.
