(DaloRADIUS includes some decent starter pages for use with Chilli under daloradius/contrib/chilli)
The requirements are pretty basic: It needs to keep track of logged in time and log out users when their time it up.
Edubuntu has stable implementation of LTSP, and has centralized management for diskless client in education and non-profit environment.
It should be possible to force logout from a central system.
There is a PHP front-end for Open Ldap, but I might use 389 Directory Project http://directory.fedoraproject.org/ which is easier and more feature complete.
i think Zencafe is perhaps interesting for your system.
Budget is non-existent as it will all be done for a non-profit.
check out Ubuntu implementation of LTSP, I've been runing Xubuntu LTSP for several years mainly for internet cafe.
I was planing to use Ubuntu and live-cds to minimize the amount of management required, but I can't seem to find any suitable internet cafe system that is Ubuntu based.
I have gotten a request to roll out a total of 8 internet cafe's in a large network.
I am not an expert of internet cafe but I would use a centralized syslog, so you could configure all workstations to send their logs to the central syslog server.
I would configure all the Workstations to use LDAP as central authentication.
For your setup, you would probably want to setup a central RADIUS/webserver to host hot spot logins and auth, then  just CoovaChilli on your access gateways.
What (preferably free, considering the shoe-string budget) software would you suggest to manage this?
No billing will be done, it will just be used to ensure people can share the computers fairly.
You could install Splunk as front-end to search for logs; Splunk is free for low quantity of logs and should be enough for you.
An automated deployment solution would be really useful to install quickly as many workstations you need.
I would use Ubuntu, but not on a Live CD, since you will need to do some configuration.
