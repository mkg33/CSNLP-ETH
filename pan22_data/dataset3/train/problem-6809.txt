Then there is the sky plane where only one (very large) plane is rendered.
With a sky box, you have a giant box that is surrounding your scene.
i want to put a texture as a background in opengl-es , and when we rotate the view , the background rotate too (obviously) but when there is translation , the background doesn't change.
As for keeping the sky where it is when you move etc.
With a sky dome, you have the same box, but this time the projection of the texture onto the cube is spherical.
like if i was inside a sphere and the texture are stick to it.
i don't really know the exact term for that (i thought it was hdr but no...).
This is very easy to do, simply render your sky first, then without swapping buffers, render your scene.
You will want to, however, make sure that all your objects are rendered on top of the sky.
(and i don't think the sphere idea is the best way to do it).
Problem with this technique is that the projection does not cover the bottom of the cube (which is not a problem in most cases).
The drawback here is that you will see the horizon, so you can only use this technique in closed areas.
I have certainly not explained the problem correctly , I'm sorry for that and thanks a lot if you understand me (even more if you have the answer :p)
You can also go with a literal dome, that is, a sphere (which Kromster suggested), although it comes with its own share of problems (pinch points).
