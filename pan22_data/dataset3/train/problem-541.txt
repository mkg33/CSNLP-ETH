I do not know the internal features of the database work, so i do not understand what is considered to be a connection, when a disconnection is happening etc.
The second constant (2-3 times per second) checks for new entries in the table "Chat", and the third as often checks a table online users.
It often happens that when trying to load the data from the database i`m getting an exception 'To many connection'.
Perhaps the server does not keep pace and keep the connection open a little longer.
Then you can specify open connection for the SelectCommand.Connection.

So, sometimes a conditions occur, when there are not much copies of the program running, but the bug 'To many connection' is still there.
One for the periodic updating of data about users.
If Max_used_connections is exceeded you can increase the max_connections global variable.
Also verify that the problem is not related with a cyclic methods as TableAdapter.Fill for example.
how many simultaneous connections are allowed to the server?
I would like to understand - it is the result of my careless programming or is it all the same problem on the server side?
It can opens and closes a connection too fast for the server.
Instead TableAdapter you can load data into a DataSet using DataAdapters.
