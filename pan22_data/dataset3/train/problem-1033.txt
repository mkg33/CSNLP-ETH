The actual server install isn't too bad but migrating the data takes forever now that we have 1TB+ arrays we need to worry about.
Most of my file server installs these days seem to involve far too much downtime.
actually my setups normally have 1-multiple DFS trees, most only one.
I've looked into using DFS-R to accomplish this, but I'd prefer something a little...eh...smaller.
DFS-R. Works like a charm, without taking the server down.
I never expose a server directly to users - all access is always done using DFS shares.
Rather than wait for all of the data to copy over, I'd prefer to copy the data over the night before, then sync over changes after I strip permissions to the old server.
Couldn't you continue to use Robocopy and use some of the advanced file selection options?
This should have the effect of copying all the files with the archive bit, and resetting the bit, then the next time it would copy anything that has it's archive bit set (and reset it again).
My typical method is to strip share permissions and use robocopy to copy all of the data over.
