Apart from creating snapshots and mounting them on a bigger disk is there any process to increase the disk space without effecting anything on the disk (Websites, databases etc).
The free tier was very cool so i opted for this stuff.
When i try to find the disk under /dev/sda(xvda) or /dev/sdf(xvdf)
In the free tier there was a free storage of 30Gb (EBS), so i made a EBS Volume of 15 Gb for a start and attached it to an instance i created (Ubuntu 12.04).
That should give you a m1.small instance in us-west-2b with a 100gb root volume.
Please clarify the EBS terminologies and processes.
You can specify a larger initial root volume when you create an instance via the command line ec2 tools using the following example:
I just started the journey into cloud and my choice was Amazon.
If in future the 8 Gb gets full then it would be difficult moving the sites to something other provider.
I did not actually create any 8 Gb disk but yet there is a 8 gb disk with the OS.
Before i move my sites to aws and burn my hands, i wanted to know if the disk of 8Gb can be expanded or not.
