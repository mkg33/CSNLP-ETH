Here is an image generated from google's chart API.
We had the same issue at WizVille, and think we found why this happens : the charts API returns a URL beginning by "//" which should be interpreted as "http://", but some email clients, like gmail, just don't.
I don't know a lot about email encoding but the resulting message seems correct--you can see it in this Gist but doesn't display correctly in Gmail.
When I do Inspect Element on the non-image in Gmail it appears that the <img> element has title and alt attributes but no src.
GMail will not (cannot) display this image if it's included in an HTML email.
A workaround that does appear to work, however, is shortening the URL beforehand.
I tested it with both TinyURL and Goo.gl and it worked fine, at least when viewed in Gmail (the top message is with the full URL, the bottom is with the Goo.gl-shortened URL:
I can confirm the behavior with the Labs feature you mentioned.
Sorry that's not a complete answer to your question, but I hope it helps.
While GOOG itself isn't particularly responsive there you may find other people who have more insight into this issue.
I'd suggest bringing it up on Gmails' help forums.
Is there something about encoding URLs for HTML used in emails that I'm missing?
The solution is to specify the protocol, namely "http:", before the chart's URL Google Charts returns.
Have you tried viewing it in another email client?
generate and programatically send an email through gmail smtp, or use the gmail labs image insert feature, etc)
