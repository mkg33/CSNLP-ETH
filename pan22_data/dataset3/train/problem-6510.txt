It can also find all unused custom styles, which can also be a problem.
Every time you edit ANY cell, ALL volatile cells get recalculated (unless the calculation mode is set to manual - but that can be risky).
It will show you all the volatile cells in your file as well as their dependents (which will also be volatile), and how long they take to execute.
The problem is that it becomes really slow whenever I make any change (or update the data in the other two sheets).
I am using Intel i5 Windows 7 OS with 8gb RAM (which I think should be more than enough for this kind of work).
If you have a lot of formulas updating due to links, it will bog down.
There is one sheet which has formulae linked to other two sheets in the same workbook.
Now it will only update when you press F9 so you can control when it gets slow.
You could run the profiler in the FormulaDesk add-in, and set it to profile volatile cells.
I am working on an Excel 2007 workbook (less than 1gb in size).
The less than 1 GB in size is worrisome, as if you're nearing a 1 GB excel file.
Go to Excel Options, then Formulas, and under Calculation Options set Workbook Calculation to Manual.
It's more likely that the spreadsheet contains some volatile cells, which in turn have many dependents.
Also, you can check whether your spreadsheet is bloated with orphaned blank cells, which increases the size of the file.
What you can do is go to file (button) - options and go to the formulas section and change the calculation options to manual.
