Is there a way I can get zsh to remember these environment variables for this directory, so that any time I run any command from that directory it runs with those environment variables set?
You can create a script that sets up the env and changes you to that directory.. then use it instead of cd working_dir
Not per directory, no, but if they are the same you can put them in your startup files (.bash_profile for bash, not sure what it is for zsh).
What makes direnv distinct between other similar tools:
Otherwise, I'd suggest just putting all the settings in a file in that directory and sourcing it before running commands.
Compared with other tools designed for this, direnv is the best of them.
Whenever I run commands from this directory, I need to have certain environment variables set.
However, there are a lot of these and it gets tedious, plus I forget sometimes and run a command only to have it fail because it's missing the environment variables that give it API keys or something.
Not an ideal solution, but I think it's close to the best you'll be able to find.
