4) Find the install cd, or acquire a new install CD, and clean install.
I would strongly recommend that you backup your personal data and then clean install your OS.
2) Aquire a live-cd virus scanner from some other computer, for example by using a friend's computer to download and burn the CD
After cleaning, you can install free antivirus like Avira Antivir or Microsoft Security Essentials to prevent future infections.
Once you succeed in erasing this virus, run antivirus scans by a couple of products.
Install Malwarebyte's Anti-malware, run a full scan, and clean all infected files.
I would also suggest taking this opportunity to evaluate what applications you are using and how you are organizing your data.
I recommend using at least Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware.
You can also get further help at the Malwarebyte's Anti-malware Forum
Following these steps should get you pretty close.
3) Boot your computer with the live-Cd and make sure your external drive is attached.
If that doesn't work, install and run the scan in Safe Mode.
I would never trust a system after accidentally infecting it with a trojan.
You can use Process Explorer to terminate the processes IS2010.exe, 41.exe, winlogon86.exe and winupdate86.exe .
If that doesn't work for any reason, you may use a rescue live-CD virus scanner : I like best Avira AntiVir Rescue System because it gets updated several times a day and so the download CD is up-to-date.
Using some of the products recommnded by harrymc will also help you remove this virus.
Scan the external drive, cleaning up any corrupted/infected data files found by the scanner
As a boot CD it's autonomous and doesn't work using your Windows XP system.
