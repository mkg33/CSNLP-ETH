Note that, especially for the first option, it's necessary that you know how to control your boot mode (BIOS vs. EFI).
I recommend disabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your firmware, aka "legacy boot support," and installing an EFI boot loader for Linux.
As to Ubuntu, if you had been switching between BIOS-mode and EFI-mode booting, that was sub-optimal.
If your new installation lacks the right driver, the associated disk(s) will be invisible to the OS.
It's possible that some of your problems are caused by drivers.
Some computers have multiple disk controller chips, each of which may require its own OS driver.
Neither option is entirely risk-free; if the driver is buggy or if you err in installing it, the OS may become unbootable.
Another solution is to use the firmware setup utility to switch the disk access mode from "IDE" to "AHCI"; however, this may also require Windows driver changes.
One solution is to install the appropriate driver, which you should be able to find on the motherboard manufacturer's Web site.
(I'm not an expert on Windows drivers, so I can't provide more advice on such a change.)
Given that you're using Ubuntu, two relatively easy ways to do this are:
