I generally prefer Xterm with tmux, which you can configure to split the terminal.
if you're using tabbed terminals, you can use Alt-1, Alt-2, Alt-3 etc to switch between the terminals.
If the current answers don't give you the flexibility or feeling that you want you may also want to have a look at tiling window managers.
you could use  splitvt  to split ANY terminal window in two - one above the other, not side-by-side.
However, while it is possible to split the terminal horizontally or vertically (or both) in some terminal emulators or in screen, you are limited to 2 or 3 or perhaps 4 side-by-side before they become too narrow (or short) to be of any use.
you do realise that you don't have to alt-tab between terminals in gnome-terminal, don't you?
other people have already mentioned screen as well as eterm and  mrxvt and others, so i'll point out a feature of gnome-terminal that you might have missed.
Konsole is the best, multitabs and some other cool stuff.
This ofc is a big change just for tiling terminals but if you are planning on doing the majority of things in tiled terminals a tiled WM may have benefits over the other solutions.
BTW, i mostly use mrxvt as my terminal of choice - but gnome-terminal is installed by default on most linux systems so i've got used to how it works.
i prefer mrxvt but GT is OK or good enough for light/casual use.
IMO, tabbed terms combined with a program like xttitle to set the tab title is a lot less confusing and a lot more useful.
