As fare I can recall PING uses Netbios/WINS and DNS (in that order, at least if you don't specify a FQDN).
Basically, if you have any entries in your hosts file, that are the same as the IP your ping is trying to resolve to, it will fail.
ping uses the ICMP protocol, specifically the 'Echo Request' and 'Echo Reply'.

I might be wrong on this because its based on my long-forgotten NT4 ressource-kit days.
The procedure in short is this: Open gpedit.msc and navigate to Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Network -> DNS Client > DNS Suffix Search List,  set it to "Enabled" and add the domain name to the list (the list is empty by default).
Just disable Netbios and Ping will use DNS as first priority and append the registered DNS Surffic on the interface to your hostname.
For example, if in your DNS, you have a record for www.example.com - 10.0.0.20, but then you have an entry in your client's hosts file, 10.0.0.20 somethingelse.com, you will not be able to ping www.example.com
many networks disable ICMP utilities in order to prevent attacks or basic network scanning.
I've found many routers you purchase come with a setting to disable ping and like utilities enabled by default.

I have just had this problem, and found something quite peculiar, and managed to fix it Lol
In my case what solved this problem was to add the domain of the host I was trying to ping to a group policy option named "DNS Suffix Search List".
Especially if traffic is passing a router somewhere.
WINS is gone many year ago but you might still have Netbios enabled on your interface and PING therefore might use netbios that might not give you any result.
