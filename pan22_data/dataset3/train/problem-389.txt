Sadly I have almost 0 experience with Linux networking and I need some help on how to actually do this.
The idea of what I want is simple - the raspberry should connect to my primary network via a LAN cable, get it's IP from there (DHCP) and work like normal.
My Raspberry is running the Rasbian Lite derivative called Openhabian ( https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/openhabian.html ).
So basically I'll set up a different wifi router and connect all of those devices to it.
And it needs to be able to interact with devices from both networks at the same time.
I am in the middle of setting up my home automation system with my Raspberry Pi (3B+), and I have a question regarding networking.
That way I can do anything with my primary network without breaking my home automation setup.
The raspberry is currently connected to my network using a LAN cable.
And I will not be connecting that router to my primary network.
But I also want to connect it to my home automation network via wifi at the same time.
But I want to move my home automation devices that don't need internet connection to completely separate network all together.
