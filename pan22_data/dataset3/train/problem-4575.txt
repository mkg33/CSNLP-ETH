I'd also like to point out that in a Windows Server 2008 domain, you can have multiple password policies applied to different OUs; with previous versions of AD, you could only have a single global password policy for each domain.
It's good reading to make sure you understand what you can do now, especially since you stated that you are using Windows 2008.
That helps explain the differences between the new Windows 2008 password policy options and the "old" Windows 2003/2000 domain password policies.
Open Local Security Policy by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, typing secpol.msc into the search box, and then clicking secpol.â€Œ
You're looking to change the password complexity setting you found in the "Default Domain Policy", not the local group policy.

Open Group Policy Management Console (Start / Run / GPMC.MSC), open the Domain, and right-click and Edit the "Default Domain Policy".

Then do a "gpupdate" and you'll see the change take effect.
In the left pane, double-click Account Policies, and then click Password Policy.
The better thing to do, once you get a better handle on group policy management, would be to return the default back to default settings and make a new GPO overriding the default with the settings you want.
Editing the "Default Domain Policy" is definitely a quick-and-dirty thing to do.
Double-click the item in the Policy list that you want to change, change the setting, and then click OK.
