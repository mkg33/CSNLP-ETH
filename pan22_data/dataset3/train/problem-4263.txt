I have a really strange one, and am unsure where to start looking.
My Anti Virus was Modifying the head files from the web server, FF and Chrome then are unsure about the file and prompt to downlaod it.
My Issue is both Firefox and Chrome download the PHP Files.
After testing i have seen this also happen on Kaspersky
(I was actually starting to consider a ISP issue (Its dealt with by a 3rd party and not a ISP for security)
www.mess-hall.co.uk/index.php wants to download the file in Firefox and chrome.
If i dont provide the PHP file name, then the page just appears to be blank.
Here is a screenshot, showing two browsers accessing the site without any issues.
After days of Trial and error, Different browsers, Inspections.
(I was able to replicate the issue on Facebook after a Heavy load of refreshes on the website)
(This is why the results where so unexpected between different browsers)
While Microsoft IE (Sorry Edge) WOrks fine, and so does opera....
Whats more funny, is this only happens in the morning.
I have disabled HTAccess as a Temp for the moment, encase re-write rules got abit messed up and there was browser compatibility issues.
I dont think its a issue with the Server, as no other users have complained about access.
Also ill provide you with a Link (If i can) and see for yourself if it works.
www.mess-hall.co.uk   (When accessing this URL i get a blank page on FF and Chrome)
Checked on my mobile device and the website is loading fine.
Adding an Exlusion to the Web Safeguard / scanning fixed the issue
