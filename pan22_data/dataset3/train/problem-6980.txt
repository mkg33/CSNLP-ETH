Because of this, I had to move all my other required modules to be before the YubiKey authentication.
password-auth is commented out because I use SSH key authentication rather than password authentication.
If it fails, then PAM will ignore it and move on to any further auth rules.
Originally I had the following in my auth section:
Hence, I moved auth       required     pam_sepermit.so up to be on the first line.
Failing to retrieve the user info would also manifest in the secure logs or the journal with message such as:
Troubleshooting Authentication, Password Change and Access Control
I ran into a similar issue to @DionSteel in that I am using YubiKey for 2-factor authentication for my LDAP users (but not for local users).
Finally I un-commented the password-auth line so that local users could authenticate with passwords in the case that YubiKey authentication fails (which it will for my local users).
Before debugging authentication, please make sure the user information is resolvable with getent passwd $user or id $user.
This means that if it and any previously listed auth modules are successful, the user will immediately be authenticated and no further auth modules will be checked.
I had to restructure things to allow local users to also SSH in to the machine.
In order for authentication to be successful, the user information must be accurately provided first.
First, I made my YubiKey authentication sufficient rather than required.
I'm running CentOS 7, so the file I was dealing with is /etc/pam.d/sshd.
