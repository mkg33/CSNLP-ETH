If you do not care about traffic from Network 2 reaching Network 3 and vice versa (shown below) you can try this solution.
ICS makes Windows act like a router so you are routing packets to your virtual switch.
You should not have to enter a IP address for yourself (or Subnet mask) but you can.
you can find that out by opening a command prompt (cmd) and entering ipconfig /all.
I looks to me like this has been answered before on SuperUser.
You should see another adapter appear named Network Bridge.
The most important is that you enter the correct Default Gateway, because that is the "door" your network traffic needs to reach the internet.
The IP address you need to enter there is most likely the same IP your router has.
Right click this device and select Properties to configure it.
Switch to tab Alternate Configuration and enter your data depending on your setup.
Select the three network interfaces you want to connect, click with your right mouse button and select Bridge Connections.
This makes Windows act like a switch, passing traffic between the bridged connections.
Share multiple network connections by bridging them
If you don't know your routers IP address or gateway etc.

If you're unsure about your DNS Servers it (again) is most likely your routers IP address.
Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (or six depending on your preference).
