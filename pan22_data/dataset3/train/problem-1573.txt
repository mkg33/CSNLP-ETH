Also remember that most applications are running on OSs that will always do DNS lookups in v4 because they don't have v6 DNS resolution enabled.
(Disclaimer: I ran such a system for a while as part of the IETF's v6-only experiment, but shut it off due to the debugging issues.)
Some of them will fail over to v6 as you want, but may not do it when you want: they might do it if they don't get a v4 response "fast enough", making them very hard to debug.
If you like living on the bleeding edge, party on.
How many of these clients behave is totally client dependent.
For example, some of them try to start in v6, which is fine for you and awful for other folks.
An application that is v4 and v6 capable that fails at v4 might try v6, but it also might not.
Dual-stack applications are all over the map on this.
I've had very back luck with some, and some simply will not use anything but IPv4 and fail when it is not available.
The theme here: you can possibly do what you want, but you are buying into some seriously difficult customer support and debugging, at least for the next few years.
However, the world makes this very hard to do sometimes.
In theory, your interface will not have an IPv4 interface, so any users (that is, clients on your machine) will get "destination unreachable."
You will be able to reach some places, but not all.
