In our NOC, we maintain situational awareness of all physical security zones (reactive video feeds), some basic information about the physical characteristics of the data centers, the weather and a national news feed.
We use an internal blog for change controls, and pipe the output to a Mac with the RSS reader screensaver.
It includes security news, "health" levels, emerging threats, and information on tool updates.
Its not a bad idea to have your electrical panels thermo-scanned a couple of times a year.
RSS feeds of internal or external events might be useful.
Are there other things you recommend a NOC monitor, or is this considered good enough.
If they walk though together they will just chat and not see what they should be seeing.
Every failure starts small, if you catch it when small, you can fix it on your schedule
This will find gear that is nearing failure since it will appear hotter.
If you have a seperate generator/utility room, check that too
Walk though often, if you are onsite and a 24/7 office then have 2 people walk though seperately at the start of their shift.
Yammer (https://www.yammer.com/) could be a good way to share enterprise-wide information/status (via email/IM/RSS).
The Radar available from Securitywizardry.com is always something I've wanted to put up on a big plasma in a NOC/SOC for the cool factor: http://www.securitywizardry.com/radar.htm
My thought is the walk though physical side of things.
