I've been working on a php library to overcome this exact issue.
Probabily in your python code you import libraries that access some devices that need permission.
It doesn't require sudo for basic operations provided you add the www-data user to the gpio group.
I believe the problem relies on the code in these Python files.
For example, if your Python code reads data from the USB, you need to set the right permission to the right ttyUSB file in the device folder: sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
Since you've been quite aggressive with your sudo permissions, it's probably not that.
There are two main ways (that I can think of) to resolve the second possibility.
I had a similar issue trying to run Python scripts through PHP in a browser.
So you need to set the permission to the device itself, not to Phyton or the Python script.
It's native PHP and provides an asynchronous api for GPIO manipulation.
This is a problem a lot of people face, and it's not always just due to a lack of sudo permission.
