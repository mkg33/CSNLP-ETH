Some search engines will let you begin typing immediately to do another search if you don't click anything else.
I am a heavy Ctrl+K (and Ctrl+L) user, but this is not sufficient for this use case.
To do this what I found easiest is to use Chrome (instead of Firefox) with the so-called Vimium extension, see: http://vimium.github.io/
For your intended use case (search, and then search again without using the mouse), you can use 'Esc' which will select the search box again so that you can type.
What you'll have to do is just keep hitting Tab (or Shift+Tab to go backwards) until you end up in the search box again.
These keyboard shortcuts will cycle through all the website's links and input forms.
Aside from all the good answers already posted, you can always install a keyboard macro processor like AutoHotKey in Windows or AutoKey in Linux.
If I just type something, it jumps to the Google Search Box.
Note: This is by the way not the only speed-up you get.
Since the search box in a website is not identified in a standard way across all websites, there isn't a dedicated keyboard shortcut to jump straight to it.
Often I want to adjust my search with additional refinements.

I love their way of addressing links in the browser, just type f and you will have a few letter combinations that bring you to any link on that page.
Once you do that, you can define hot keys that do anything you can do from the keyboard (and a lot more) regardless of what the applications or Window manager provide for you.
The key combination that brings you to the search box is gi.
Other than the method above, sometimes they'll code their site with some javascript that captures keyboard input.
