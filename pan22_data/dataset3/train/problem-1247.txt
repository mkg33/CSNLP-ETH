I prefer to use simpler switch names, perhaps ib-spine01, which can make parsing output easier, and allows mapping to hostnames in the case of a managed IB switch.
Although @alnet's answer is correct, we can go further and set the GUID-to-switch-name mappings in a file, so that the switch names are always looked up without having to specify a command line flag.
The syntax would look like this (as taken from the man page):
MAD that reads this string is called "NodeDescription".
I emailed Mellanox Support about adding descriptive names to unmanaged switches, they sent me a Python script named "Unmanaged_Switches_Set_NodeDescription_3.4.py" which can be used to set the description that shows up in ibswitches or ibnetdiscover output.
According to IB Spec, NodeDescription is read only.
I created a text file the script can use to map GUIDs to descriptive names, and now I can relabel every switch in the fabric with a single command.
If your switch is unmanaged, then the only access to it is by SMP MADs (Subnet Management Protocol MAnagement Datagrams).
Note that the actual map filename is managed by opensm, so it can be different if /etc/rdma/opensm.conf has node_name_map_name defined.
On EL (CentOS/RHEL) systems using distribution provided utilities, the default mapping file is /etc/rdma/ib-node-name-map.
I ran into a similar need when troubleshooting one of our IB fabrics, as it required a lot of searching to determine which switch was which when I needed people in the data center to reboot them, etc.
This description will remain until the switch gets rebooted, after which it reverts to the default description.
