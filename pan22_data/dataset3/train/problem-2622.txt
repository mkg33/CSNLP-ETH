If you are recording customer information (as in when you take orders over the phone), your PCI DSS responsibilities will increase dramatically.
Then all you have to do is set up a span port on your switch to send it a copy of your data.
You can use this device to record directly from your PRI/T1 to a file server without involving the PBX at all.
For starters, you'll have to store the recordings in an encrypted form and restrict access to those files to a small handful of trusted personnel.
If you fire up wireshark then click capture, options, if you look around half way down the box on the left hand side you can get it to split capture files by size/time.
They basically act as intermediary for the traffic.
One caveat of recording telephone calls is that you are entirely on the hook for the content of those calls.
And it costs less than the SIPfish solution mentioned above.
TOTALLY wrong problem as the SIP part does not contain any audio.
YO u need to use a SIP server that intercepts and rewrites all SIP and forces the traffic through it, then can capture it.
I would also be interested if there is a nicer way to achieve the same.
The list goes on, so weigh the value of the recordings against the costs of liability for keeping them.
If the SIP server doesn't force all traffic to go through it, if you can set up a mirror port on your switch you should still be able to do the same thing.
As other people have pointed out, you can record directly on your PBX.
It also would be advisable to set an appropriate capture filter so you don't capture everything else on your network - would make the capture files much larger than needed.
This is standard with SIP based PBX - otherwise stuffl ike call recording never would work.
You may want to go with a call recording server like SIPfish.
There are a few problems with doing that however including
