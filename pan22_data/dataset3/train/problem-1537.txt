They even have a growing library of user contributed probes to monitor things link UPSes and environmental monitoring devices.
I use it to keep tabs on my PC's and people connecting.
Use snmp to pull traffic details from your router or netflow if your router supports it.
It also keeps track of game systems and well, pretty much everything that connects to your Wi-Fi network.
I've personally used it to monitor Xserves, Minis, iMacs, MBPs, and even an Airport Express (in addition to a plethora of non-apple stuff, of course)
Is there a good, GUI based tool that can show connected machines (make sure I don't have 'guests'), traffic stats, etc.
Intermapper - a commercial product that has a five license version for free.
I'm trying to keep tabs on my home wireless network.
As well as snmp, Intermapper has lots of probes for standard services and even specific devices.
Although it's not specifically tailored for monitoring OS X, it can monitor any unixy OS pretty well.
