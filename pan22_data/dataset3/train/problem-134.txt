Well, yes, you've gotten yourself into a right mess.
The problem is with that many files in the directory, it could take literally weeks to delete them all.
You don't want a cronjob (yet) -- they're probably just piling up on each other and making the problem worse at present.
Damned if I know how, either -- in my experience, PHP's not bad about keeping that sort of thing under control.
My guess is you've got years worth of session files in there.
Once you've got the problem back under control (in a few weeks), then you can run a cronjob every hour to nuke anything older than a few days/weeks/whatever.
You also want to be careful about how exactly you do the deletion -- you can't have anything that attempts to glob or otherwise enumerate all the files, because that'll take a long time and take a lot of memory before you actually delete anything; instead, you want a script that'll readdir and delete as they come (I suspect, although I'm not sure, that find -delete might do this; when I had to delete a few million files I used a little ruby script).
