Is this something that the programmer of the application has to add support for?
"Horizontal scroll" did not work, and Zoom in/Out did not work either.
Remapping the key-strokes separately solved the problem.
That offers more sensitivity and a smoother scrolling experience, SSMS in particular.
In this example SSMS has a "results" pane for the results of a query, which has a horizontal scrollbar, but the horizontal scroll wheel doesn't move it.
I am also using the MX Master and ran into this issue.
I had a similar problem with horizontal scrolling in PDF-XChange-Viewer.
The later did exactly what it said: zooming in and out.
Try this out for other applications -- if your horizontal scrolling breaks, elsewhere, try using the Application Specific settings to only change the behavior in your desired application.
Open up your Logitech Options software and from the "Mouse" panel, click the white circle over the Thumb Wheel Scroll.
Inexplicably, changing the behavior to "Zoom In/Out" seems to fix this horizontal scrolling issue (at least, I can confirm this for SSMS.)
Or are there possibly some hacks that could let me build my own support?
Other applications (like SQL Server Management Studio, aka SSMS) don't appear to recognize the horizontal scroll.
I have a mouse with a horizontal scroll wheel (the MX Master by Logitech), but the horizontal scrolling is only recognized by some applications (e.g.
