Incidentally, does Linux/Unix allow a mode of file opening with creation wherein the created file is deleted when the creating process terminates, even if it's from a crash?
awk 'NR>1 {print $9}': print only the ninth column of lsof output, excluding the headers
Normally, this is enough but sometimes, processes create files in there and fail to cleanup after themselves.
Some people do it by checking last modification timestamp, but this approach is unsafe because there can be long-running processes that still need those files.
Is there a program/script/etc that embodies this approach or some other approach that is also safe?
Obtain a list of files older than so an so, exclude files that are open by anything from that list:
Debian/Ubuntu have tmpreaper, it's probably available in other dists as well.
You could just do rm -rf /tmp/* and hope nothing breaks...
I need to delete these orphaned tmp files or else future process will run out of space on /tmp.
A safer approach is to combine the last modification timestamp condition with the condition that no process has a file handle for the file.
I always run lsof +L1 | grep tmp and either kill or restart the processes holding on to "deleted" tmp files:
egrep -v "foo|moo|bar": print lines NOT containing foo or moo or bar
