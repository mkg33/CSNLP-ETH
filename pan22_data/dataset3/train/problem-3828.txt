It's quite slick -- But obviously you need to think about for example, USB storage, which doesn't want to be ejected uncleanly, which it will be if you switch display outputs without manually ejecting the USB key first.
Then you run the USB1 and DisplayPort cables to one computer, and the USB2 and HDMI cables to the other computer.
In the menu for the monitor, you bind the USB ports to a video input.
These are on the same plate as the power and video connections They're labeled "USB 1" and "USB 2"
Here's how it works, I would imagine other Dell monitors are similar.
There are four USB3.0 "A" ports you can use to plug USB devices into the USB hub built into the monitor.
There are two USB3.0 "B" ports to plug cables which would go to a computer.
When you change display input to HDMI, the USB hub automatically gets switched to the other computer at the same time.
For example: "USB1 goes with DisplayPort" and "USB2 goes with HDMI"
Three are on the same plate as the power/video connections (bottom backside of the monitor), and the fourth is out on the edge of the display at the back, like if you wanted to have an easier to reach place to plug a USB key.
When you use the buttons on the monitor to select DisplayPort, your USB devices are automatically connected to the matching computer.
