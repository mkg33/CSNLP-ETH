It's not just about restoring data - that's the easy part.
Had a test restore been tried, this would have been apparent.
As already mentioned, test restores are an absolute must.
Can you also restore any apps running on the server?
If you have a disaster, such as a fire, will you still be able to obtain a drive that can read your old tapes, etc.
A backup isn't a backup if you can't restore from it.
When choosing the components that will make up your system give consideration to the future.
If you have Active Directory you need to catch a "System State" backup on one of your domain controllers in a regular fashion.
Just bear in mind that one of the reasons for backups is to be able to recover from a disaster, such as the building and everything in it being destroyed.
I've seen several cases where service programs (database engines, etc) kept files locked and years of backups went by w/o ever catching the locked files.
You won't know if you can restore something unless you try it.
If your backup media is destroyed at the same time the server computer is, it's not a backup.
They're not just so your users can get away with being careless.
Never name backups as "new backup", "newer backup".
If you plan to do a bare metal recovery of a specific server computer, having a "System State" (or equivalent) backup taken in a regular fashion is nice.
