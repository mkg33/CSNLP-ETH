Assume the variation based on uses then calculate the waited avg.

(This is based on the assumption that 1 kWh costs 0.15 $ or 0.15 EUR.
Since the Microsoft Joulemeter is no longer available, you may wish to consider visiting these sites for calculation:
That way you'll be measuring actual power usage instead of trying to estimate.
So, for example, if your constantly-on PC consumes 300 Watt --> it will cost you roughly 300 $ per year
As a quick rule-off thumb: if you want to know how much the power consumption of a device that is continuously on costs you per year, then you can just replace Watt with $ or EUR.
The definitive way would be to buy a Kill A Watt and plug your computer into it.
Just get a multimeter and measure current on real time basis.
So, 1 Watt continuously is 1*24*365 = 8.7 kWh/year, which costs 8.7 * 0.15 = 1.3 $
So, yes, to be correct, 300 Watt will cost you almost 400 $, but as a rule-of-thumb this simple approximation is good enough (for me).)
