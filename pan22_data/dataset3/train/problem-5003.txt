The PERC 5/6 or H700/H710 may allow you to perform what you are wanting to do.
I am not sure if the initial creation of a stripe/RAID 0 on the drive will make the data inaccessible or corrupt it.
Create a single drive RAID 0 with your current drive.
We have a server that is being used in production, but it was not originally meant to.
If that card is not an option, is there a card that would allow that?
If you are looking to create a RAID 1 from an existing disc.
It is not a supported function, so I am not sure of the exact outcome.
IF anything goes wrong you will still have a copy of the OS you can simply put back in the system and continue as if nothing happened.
The SAS5/6, H200, and S100/S300 auto-initialize when an array is created.
Then install Openmanage Server Administrator in the operating system.
With Windows 2008 you can do a baremetal recovery of the system, so backup sytem, reconfigure the RAID and to finish, with the Windows DVD boot the system and select recover a system from a backup.
Any data on the drives would be deleted during this process.
We do not have a controller that supports what you are wanting to do.
Just be sure that you do not select the option to initialize the array during this process.
The main thing I want to add to it is a Dell PERC S300 RAID Card to have the main hard drive (Windows Server 2008 R2) mirrored on another hard drive.
Steps 1 is critical if you choose to reuse the original drive in the array.
I can not initialize the disk and wipe the the OS to create the array and then re-install.
It will then copy the contents from the original drive to the new drive.
Is there a way to create the array with a current hard drive, without affecting it, and just mirroring the drive?
It will allow you to reconfigure the RAID 0 drive to a RAID 1 array if there is another compatible drive present.
