Probably a mix of what Chris S said below and communication between the Domain controller and PC.
My machine is Win 7 domain PC, if I am connected to the network my DC is on and enter the password wrong it takes 30 seconds or so to tell me the PW is incorrect.
This blog article gives you much more information than you probably care for!
However if I turn my Wifi off or connect to a different network it instantly tells me the password is incorrect.
In addition the method of authentication (domain vs local) also has a performance hit on the authentication.
Most OSes (linux and windows are good examples) enforce a retry delay in order to prevent someone from scripting a login to the server and potentially brute forcing or locking out an account without a delay that will (potentially) allow the attempt to get noticed by someone getting failed login alerts.
If you miss it 2 or 3 time, it stole less than a minute of your life.
It is mainly to prevent quick brute forcing of passwords.
Note that in the case of domain passwords the password is verified twice if it fails on a non pdc emulator DC.
