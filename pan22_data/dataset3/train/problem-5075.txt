For internet access and intranetwork communication, does each router need to be connected to an additional router which connects to the internet?
I’ve read many posts and articles describing how to logically create subnets (Pluralsight: Subnetting a Class C Address Using the Fast Way, Network Enginering: How to divide network into subnets?
Do I need some professional grade router designed for subnetting where each port is allocated to a different network?
I’m thinking in terms of  consumer networking equipment.
How to Subnet a Network ), and I grasp the concept of calculating the subnet mask.
My intention is to segregate devices based on if they need internet access, local network resources, or both:
  2: Local Network Only: Fileserver, computer running backups and printer
My question is what hardware configuration is necessary to separate a network into multiple subnets?
I tried changing the subnet mask in my Netgear Nighthawk router and all I accomplished was reducing the number of IP address available.
However, what’s left out of these informative guides is the practical application (understandable, the logic is universal, but every network is physically different).
Do I need to buy a router for each subnet with each configured to provide a subset of the available address?
Or am I completely off the mark in my assumptions?
I wasn't able to assign devices to IPs not in the router's subnet.
