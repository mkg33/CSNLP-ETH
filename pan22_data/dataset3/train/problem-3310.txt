Typically they will also have better prices, as suggested by pjz.
To reference the process for the S[OFU] sites: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/server-hosting-rent-vs-buy/; and the followup - http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/new-stack-overflow-server-glamour-shots/
I would recommend (at least for the real start up phase) to go with renting as you need.
Once you have made some money and know the real need for hardware, you could then switch to your own hosting.
Such servers have been tested for stability and usually come with at least some basic hardware support services that will help minimize downtime.
The cloud offers some highly dynamic storage systems (like S3), which can grow during the initial phase.
Nothing worse for a start up than under-equipping and then ending up with a lot of frustrated users once the servers give out.
Also, unless you want to build something out of the ordinary, custom built servers tend to be more expensive.
Then you will have enough knowledge of your needs and systems to manage that.
As a startup your time is better spent on building features, doing performance testing, etc which are all things you can't buy.
Additionally when you need more the next month, they show up in five days.
They will be familiar with the hardware, administration and the vendor's support ogranization.
If you're buying full hosting, you might aswell go with the brand provided by the hosting company.
It's usually cheaper since your large 1u rack server companies are buying by the 1000s and you're not.
I reccomend purchasing servers from a trusted brand.
