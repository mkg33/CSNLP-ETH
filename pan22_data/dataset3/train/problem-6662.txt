If you REALLY want to ensure you only communicate via the public interfaces, then have the ssh sever(s) only listen for connections on the public interfaces.
i connected to server1 from server2 then checked to see what my ip is ( server2 ) and i noticed it is not the public ip of server2 but rather the private ip of server2.
i suppose they have configured it to use "private ip" when ssh ing to each other.
If you want to refer to the server by name (ssh server2) and you want the name to automatically be mapped to the server's public IP address, you should add entries in the hosts files of both servers, telling them their names are to be mapped to their public IPs:
This will ensure the connection happens using the public network.
Then follow Massimo's advice above for using proper IP address and/or hosts entries.
You should specify the public IP address when connecting to the other server.
Comment them out (you may have them already commented out as I believe all interfaces is the default)
server2 would recognize server1 by it's public ip.
Assuming you're using openssh or some variant open your /etc/ssh/sshd_config (that's a common path for it) and add:
i would like servers to communicate only via their public ip's..
