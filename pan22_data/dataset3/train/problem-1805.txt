Honestly, you could sit there trying to reinvent the wheel for spam reduction spoke-by-spoke, but lots of other people have done lots of other good work in this field already.
For point (1), is there any valid reason not to reject all mail from outside claiming to be from your domain?
Assuming that name of my domain is my.domain.com, I want to use following rules:
If not, this is best done by defining SPF records and using spf-milter to reject all incoming mail that violates a published SPF record.
in the m4 config file in order to get sendmail to accept email from invalid domains.
I agree with most of the other posters about some of these being better done with milters.
There's no way the amount of effort you'd have to put in (and continue to put in, as spam trends change) to maintain a halfway-useful ruleset would be worth the result.
For point (3), this should be done already, as it's standard in sendmail.
Can anyone help me with constructing sendmail rules for limiting spam?
If you want to run MIMEDefang together with sendmai you can do most of what you write by providing the appropriate routines in mimedefang-filter.
Have a look at milter.org for a catalogue of excellent, community-maintained rulesets, and consider SpamAssassin for more heavy-duty spam filtering at the Sendmail level.
For me, sendmail without the line above, plus milter-greylist and spf-milter, plus spamassassin-via-procmail on delivery, has reduced the spam in INBOXes by well over 99% (and the greylisting was the cheapest, biggest win of all).
However, your best approach would be to use SpamAssassin first and then see what more filters you can implement yourself.
Check your m4 file; if that line is there, remove it and regenerate your cf file.
SpamAssassin can be executed via MIMEDefang which means you can combine it with custom rules of your own.
