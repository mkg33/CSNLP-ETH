For example I create certificates and with each new page the certificate number is displayed as...
However, the following method is only applicable for simple uses, and should cover what you are asking here.
How can I add the page numbers of a MS WORD document as a field anywhere in the document.
The number (generated by the field) may look the same from the previous page, so your fields need to get update.
Instead, you'll make the table in the main body, with the SEQ field instead of the page number field:
In fact, Access looks like the right choice to make such things, but it sounds like you're looking for a trick using page numbers as an ID for your certificates.
But this will look awful and, in fact, inconvenient for many pages.
First of all, page number works better with headings; so you could insert all your fixed parts (the table) into a long header, and then fill its variable parts in the page's main body using, let's say text boxes.
The simplest way to do so is to go to the print preview (CTRL + P) and go back OR select everything in your document and press F9.
What you are supposed to do is to use templates and databases.
So for new pages, copy the whole table (with the field inside it) and make a new page and paste it there.
