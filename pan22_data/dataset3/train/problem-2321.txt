From what I am reading, my best guess is that the H3C switch is not letting either the requests or the DHCP's response through.
Does anyone have any thoughts why this would happen this way?
The few clients that are getting Valid IP configurations are in the same room (and therefore same TP-Link Switch) as the Server.
We are attempting to configure a DHCP server on a Windows Server 2012 R2 but most clients are ending up with APIPA addresses.
We have 7 offices with TP-Link managed switches as well as 20 APs and 24 classrooms.
First a little about the network setup: We are a smaller department of a larger school.
The switches, APs and classrooms all lead back to the larger school's switch which I am told is an H3C and from there to a router and the internet.
Am I right that DHCP relay and or UDP relay not what I need?
My understanding it that would be between VLANs or across the router.
All of our devices are one 1 VLAN and 1 subnet while other departments/programs are on different VLANs.
