), is available as a VMWare virtual machine disk (PureDarwin 9).
Also, keep in mind that new Macs come with Mac OS X.
While you may be able to find some locations that sell it for slightly less, you will not be able to obtain it for free unless, say, a friend gives it to you.
Apple used to store compressed ISO files of Darwin till version 8.01 (linked from PureDarwin's site).
However, you can (questionably legally) buy a copy of Mac OS X and install it on a PC ("hackintosh").
They also link to an old Darwin 8 ISO file stored on apple's Darwin website (actually, they link to the source browser).
It's latest version, PureDarwin Xmas (booting process fixed), still in development (?
Interesting that nobody has mentioned, that GNUStep is largely compatible with Cocoa.
Their website also offers a "nano" version (PureDarwin Nano) as both an ISO file and a VMWare virtual machine.
It was a Darwin community intended to release Darwin ISO files.
(Didn't link to Hackintosh on purpose, SE and SU are not intended to spread piracy.

There is no legally free version of OS X, but you can take a look at Darwin.
You can always click on the headers to go to homepages for updates.
Also, please keep in mind that according to the License Agreement (or whatever), you can only install Mac OS X on Apple computers.
You can get Linux distributions that run on Macs (ppc and x86)

Mac OS X costs $129 USD and is available through Apple.
PureDarwin is a project meant to continue where OpenDarwin left.
But it is more of interest to programmers, I guess.
