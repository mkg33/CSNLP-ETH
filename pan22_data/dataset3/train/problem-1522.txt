Say an internal user wants to do something "illegal"..
It's only insecure if you actually have something valuable to protect.
MAC addresses aren't intended to be kept private, so it's very easy for someone to clone it.
Since the admins can see it is a "hack" there is no responsibility of the real user.
I don't think it will hurt as part of your overall security scheme.
And as far as I know a user can scan for the MAC addresses within the LAN.
In computer security there is a statement "Users are the weakest links in the security chain " So I can imagine a one situation.
The first X digits represent the make of the router and I believe the other digits represent other things as well.
So in this case he can use the MAC of his own machine and do whatever thing he want.
And it's that wrong feeling of security that's the problem.
While they are easy to spoof, it is more work for the hacker to do so.
I think it would be fairly trivial to find your MAC address if you were on any network other than your own along with a hacker.
So in that case he can steal a MAC of a his mate as well.
If you're just trying to prevent unauthorized users from using your wireless connection MAC-based authentication is fine.
(Don't bother to filter on MAC-address, nor to hide the SSID.
It's bad because those who use it, apparently think it makes things more secure.
