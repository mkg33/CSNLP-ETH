So, after each machine boots once, you can shut them down and change those properties and it all works.
Based upon your response to my question (in the comments), my next question would be, can the machines run with local only networking to avoid SID issues?
Don't sysprep if all you're worried about are SIDs rather than hardware changes in a VM:

The way I have always done this is to activate a 'master' image, and then copy it.
Alternatively, could you create 15 base images from the sysprep image.
When VMWare first launches the copies, it asks if you (c)opied the image or (m)oved it.
I can't answer your workstation activation question, that's probably best answered on superuser.com anyway, but it does sound to me like perhaps you should look at VMWare's Lab Manager product as I think it might suit your needs more than your current situation.
However, those machines cannot live on the same LAN segment because they have the same machine name and MAC address.
If you say "Moved", it does not cause reactivation.
At my last place of work, I (as a developer) had to create and manage my own Virtual Machines for testing.
Active the 15 images once and keep those as the master images?
Personally, I think you are spoiling your devs by creating VM images for them.
