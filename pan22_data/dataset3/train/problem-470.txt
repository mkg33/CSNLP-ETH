The company I work for recently got hands on a batch of second hand PowerEdge SC1425 machines.
These are the dependencies as documented for Red Hat.
I find it incredibly difficult to locate the files on the Dell website, and install any of them on an Ubuntu system:
In the documentation, it explicitly states that SUU is a 32-bit application and what the dependencies are for running in a 64-bit environment.
Our operating system of choice is Ubuntu Server 10.04 64-bit, which installs just peachy on this type of machine.
I know this question has long since been answered, but it took me a while to figure it out so I am answering for the benefit of others that may be searching this question.
No fussing with floppy disk images, dosemu, or other wackiness.
I didn't even have to use the kernel boot option reboot=bios.
Now I'd like to install the firmware updates from Dell, which are apparently marked as recommended.
The instructions lists where to get the raw BIOS on the linux.dell.com website.
But I cannot execute it directly from the shell either.
The Fine Manual worked for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a Dell PowerEdge 2850.
You are likely missing the 32-bit compatibility libraries, preventing the 32-bit Java from executing.

I suppose that they ought to be available for Ubuntu under the same or similar names; procmail, glibc, compat-libstdc++-296, compat-libstdc++-33, libstdc++, zlib, and libxml2.
But I cannot execute it directly from the shell either.
you will need to mound the image with -o exec  to enable execution of the application from that dvd  (or iso image)
This includes the updates for the BIOS, the BMC, and possibly some other hardware.
