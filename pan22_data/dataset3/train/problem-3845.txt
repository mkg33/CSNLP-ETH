And if most VMs ran from one host, there might be a single point of failure.
# Be sure to install the necessary package, avoid the "devel" ones
Given CentOS 7, the systemd example is relevant, specifically:
A previous "service with numactl" question  How do I run a service with numactl  happens to be about mongodb.
I wonder how I could permanently fix this numactl startup as I don't want to start mongod manually every time.
Another design option would be to split up your NUMA host into VMs no larger than one node each.
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/production-notes/
Editing /etc/systemd/service/mongod.service.d/numactl.conf  to override the exec:  ExecStart=/usr/bin/numactl --interleave=all -- /usr/local/bin/mongod $OPTIONS run
Mongo has a clustering capability, although that would be more complex than scaling up.
In first instance be sure that numa is installed and loaded during the startup:
(I googled and couldn't find any service files I could edit on my server).
I installed MongoDB 3.6 on my centos 7 machine and in the startup log I see a warning because I am running NUMA hardware:
I usually run sudo service mongod start and I want that this command starts MongoDB every time with the numctl prefix.
/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mongod.service
