Because you are moving to a new machine, rman is the way to go.
  2) prepare the new environment for the upgrade (e.g.
  4) RESTORE the database to the new server to the  point in  time you want (but after the point in time where the preparation for the upgrade was finishe) but don' t open it
They want to backup the old database and restore it on the new server.
If you upgrade a database on a server you have to do the following steps:
  6) apply the upgrade procedure to the new database
Is this possible to do directly, or do they need to upgrade the old server to 11 first?
We have a client who is using Oracle 9i on their old server, and they want to switch to Oracle 11 on the new server.
If you had any Oracle apps, you would need to upgrade and not export/import.
  6) apply the upgrade procedure to the new database
If you were not moving to a new machine, upgrading the database would be the way to go.
  5) startup the database in the new environment (startup uprade)
There are some documents from Oracle Support that cover this topic
Both servers are Windows, so there won't be any OS translation to deal with.
Assuming you are only talking about database here:
  5) OPEN the database in the new environment (alter database open upgrade;)
  2) prepare the new environment for the upgrade (e.g.
If restore it a new server for upgrade you have the following steps:
You can leave your old database open but all changes that are made after the point in time you recovered to are left in the old database and therefore lost.
So RMAN helps you to transport  the database to the new server but it does not help you to avoid the upgrade steps.
