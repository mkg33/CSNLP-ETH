Actually I think it's closer to an animation movie than a software.
Software design is a very varied process and the methodologies employed will differ widely between companies and individuals.
In developing regular software you could work with mockups to show wich elements are positioned where and when on the screen, this would work for the gui part of the game, but the overall look and feel is best demonstrated using real art.
But I may be wrong, because I've never worked professionally in any domain.
Yes, software design for games is very similar to non-games -- which is not to say that game developers create UML diagrams (because not all software design involves UML diagrams).
I think game development adds one step to traditional software developent, and that is creating some game art and sounds to demonstrate the look and feel.
Most features in a game could be put in UML diagrams, entity diagrams and a database diagram (i think most games use some sort of internal database system for all the data)
But at the end of the day, games or non-games, it's all just software.
Most game development teams have been doing Agile since before Agile was a buzzword.
The requirements may differ but the fundamentals are similar.
I would say that game development is very different from software development.
Since this is much more important then in regular software.
Mostly because game are artistics, while software aren't.
