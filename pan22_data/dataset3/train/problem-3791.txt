You don't have do worry about dynamic changed files during backup, setting file systems read only, exclude specific directories or something else.
How to do that you can look at Easy backups and snapshots of a running system with LVM.
You can use LVM (Logical Volume Manager) to make consistent backups.
With LVM you simply create a snapshot, mount this snapshot and backup it with the method you prefer.
Assuming you have mounted a backup device on /mnt/usbhd/pi_backup/ you can do for example:
You can make a copy with cp -a, make a mirror with rsync, make an archive with tar or make an image with dd.
This will take a while so you might want to run it in the background.
It takes only one time a little effort to setup LVM.
This is the same exact way you backup your sd card in Linux.
Beside other improvements like easy adding, expanding and reducing storage or restore the operating system to an earlier status from a snapshot you can also make backups.
Then type 'dd if=/dev/[the NAME of your sd card] bs=1M'.
