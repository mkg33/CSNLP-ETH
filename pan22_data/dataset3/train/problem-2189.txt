Additionally, STP is not reporting any blocked paths, confirming that no loop has been detected.
Usually it's because of a misconfigured port channel, e.g.
Gi0/22 is the uplink to the central router (there are other switches upstream, non if which are logging flaps), so the questions follows - how is this switch learning the VM's mac on Gi0/22 ?
We've been having an issue for the last few weeks on a relatively small network.
We get this on multiple mac addresses and multiple vlans, the above is the most common one we see (there are thousands per day).
Obviously the first thing was to eliminate a L2 loop, we have looked into this many times, rebuilding diagrams from scratch using both cdp and physical tracing and we absolutely cannot find a loop anywhere.
The issue started when we swapped a specific Cisco 3750 for a 2960G (there were some other changes), exactly since then we now get the following notifications all day long:
Any help or tips on how to debug this would be greatly appreciated.
The mac address in question is for a VM on a server, obviously the server does not move and is physically located on another switch directly connected to Gi0/24.
