I would concentrate on making sure that all the partitions are large enough for the intended tasks.
You can then adjust your partition sizes to maximize the available space for the areas you expect to need them -- /var, /var/log, and /tmp.
Once you've done that you'll have a much more solid idea of how big your / and /usr partitions must be.
You might consider increasing the size of /tmp in case any of the software you are using wants to make a lot of large tempfiles.
I wouldn't bother splitting off a 30GB partition for /usr.
I generally agree with your approach of splitting the disk into multiple filesystems.
My main recommendation would be to use this sort of approach for filesystem sizes, but concentrate on doing proper monitoring and log file rotation to ensure you don't fill up those critical /tmp and /var/log filesystems.
It really sounds like you should do a trial installation first, to suss out exactly what your space requirements will be for the basic system and software.
16GB is a reasonable size for / and /usr combined; give your root partition 20-30GB if you really want the room.
I'm not sure if putting swap in the middle really does anything for you.
On a standard linux server that should be plenty of room for logs, but a specialized server might have create much larger logfiles based on usage.
For example, what is the risk that your 16GB /var/log will fill up?
I don't have much experience with LVM, but with your proposed usage it makes sense.
