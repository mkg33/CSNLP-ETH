Most likely you want to prefix everything with sudo and do it as root.
If you want a partition table, you almost certainly want an mbr table to have compatibility with 32-bit Windows.
There are a lot of other options, among them GPT which is accepted as The Future, but it's advances are mostly unnecessary on a small device like a usb disk.
If you chose the "superfloppy" setup, do this in stead:
In the *bsd world it is known as "dangerously dedicated".
Almost everything later in the answer requires it.
This is (afaik) the default in Windows, and is sometimes called a "Superfloppy".
We'll use fdisk to create the partition table and a single partition spanning the whole drive.
If you only want one filesystem, you don't need a partition table.
After you have zeroed you usb drive, you'll need to create one or more filesystems on it before you can use it.
Fdisk will tell you what it does and how it works, you should read and learn, but I'll just tell you the keys you need to push.
If you just need it to work for transferring files, you probably want fat32.
To create a fat32 filesystem on the partition you created, do the following:
Other popular choices supporting modern filesystem features like permissions and reasonable platform support are ntfs and ufs.
Hit n to create a new parition, p for primary, 1 for partition number, enter to accept the default start, enter to accept the default end and w to write the partition table.
