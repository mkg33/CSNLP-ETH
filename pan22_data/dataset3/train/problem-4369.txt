Remember the Edsel - giving people what they think they want is not necessarily going to make a good product.
If you simply look at things as a demographics game then you will get Hollywood-style pandering, least common denominator mixed up nonsense that doesn't really appeal to anyone in particular.
You have to be careful if your vision is very outside the usual and make sure that a market actually exists.
If you don't then your project has failed before it's even begun.
So the key here is to have a strong vision and stay true to it...and of course to have a market for this in the first place.
If you have a vision there is a basic market for, and you stick with it AND you have the ability to bring it to market then you will succeed, feedback or no feedback.
But instead of the simple turn-based system that people enjoyed he came up with a very complex phase based system that never really caught on with the fans of his old work.
So if you are a big fan of RPGs from the 80s and 90s and get lots of comments that people think the game is too hard, you are probably on the right track for making a great homage to the era.
For example Julian Gallop was the original maker of XCom, and he made a followup game in a similar vein.
That way you are qualified to be the ultimate authority in what the right direction is and sorting out varying criticism will not be much of a burden.
This is why I feel it's important that you, personally, have a real passion for whatever it is you are doing.
