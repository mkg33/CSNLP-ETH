A section should ideally have a heading (and it’s the only one needed in this case).
unor already covered pretty much everything I would say for the HTML structure, so I will focus on script.ts.
  <h2><abbr title="Sunday">Sun</abbr> <time datetime="2017-12-31">Dec.
The forecast can be given in a p. As the img seems to convey the same content, it’s correct to keep the alt attribute empty.
While you could use a list for the temperatures, I think three p elements are sufficient in this simple case.
The time element can be used to mark up the date in a machine-readable way.
  <img src="clear-sky.png" alt="" height="60" width="60">
The abbr element can be used to give the full name of the day.
A few opinionated statements that some may not agree with.
When using a label for the first temperature, too, I would go with a dl element instead:
Don’t use them for the name in simple name-value items, nor for stand-alone content (where no other content in the section exists).
<img src="clear-sky.png" alt="" height="60" width="60">
I think it makes the most sense to use the day+date as heading.
<h2><abbr title="Sunday">Sun</abbr> <time datetime="2017-12-31">Dec.
There is certainly more that could be said, but I think for now I'll leave you with this so this doesn't become too overwhelming.
  <h2><abbr title="Sunday">Sun</abbr> <time datetime="2017-12-31">Dec.
You shouldn’t use heading elements (h1-h6) like that.
These elements give the heading for the section they create.
