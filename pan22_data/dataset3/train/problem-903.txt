One of my 2 hard drives (1tb and 500gb) failed, and I don't know if there was any data on it or if I had lost any data.
First of all, I have server with OS Windows Home Server 2008.
If its the system drive the recovery is more complex but again your duplicated shares will be fine.
Any data you had on non-duplicated shares is at risk.
On Home Server any shares you had duplicated will be fine.
So if there was any data on that drive, you might wanna contact a Data-Recovery Company.
That's the read/write head hitting its outer limits and reseating repeatedly.
You're most likely screwed, this sounds pretty similar to the Click Of Death which means that your harddrive is or is close to being dead.
Correct me if I am wrong, but Windows Home Server was designed to be okay after a hard drive failure like this right?
For the hard drive failure part, what is this sound?

I was only occupying around ~300gb and the 500gb died.
