One is taking a number in a given format and converting it to decimal, and the other is actually printing that number in a nicely formatted way.
You should thus split it up into two functions: One which does the extraction, and one which does the output.
This has the potential to cause people using that function and wanting to separate outputs much grief, and is easily circumvented by having the function take a std::ostream& as parameter and writing to it instead.
Let's start off with a few general hints and tips:
Finally, this function does a little bit too much; two completely separate tasks, to be precise.
You're wasting performance and causing binary bloat, when the fix would be to simply add an enum class with three members HEX, OCT and DEC.
When invoking the function, you then simply pass std::cout as an argument.
One issue I have with this function is that type should never, ever be a string.
The other big issue is that this function limits its own usability by necessarily writing to std::cout.
