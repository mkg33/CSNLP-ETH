Is it possible to 'colorize' the output from find?
For example, the following command prints executable files in green and other regular files in the default color:
(You can also do it with standard find, but in a roundabount way through -exec sh -c 'echo ...' {}.)
The dollar sign makes it match the end of every line but has nothing to highlight so it outputs even lines without matches while highlighting other things you've listed.
With GNU find, you can use -printf instead of -print to customize the way a file name is printed.
Sidenote: If grep has colors off, you could either add the --color option to it (grep -E --color ...) as Dennis Williamson suggests, or set it for the session (export GREP_OPTIONS="--color=auto").
which will highlight every occurance of "readme" and still display the entire output of find.
As these are mixed in with my other find results, among other things, I'd like to colorize them.
I have a find that searches /home on all of my servers, and exec 'rm' certain files.
If colors in grep are on or auto, you can simply do a short grep pipe with the extended-regexp option and the dollar sign (to still display every line).
