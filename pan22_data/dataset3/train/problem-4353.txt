So, communication about availability, planning activities based on time available (in other words, the split between work and educating is still happening regularly but the ratio keeps changing dynamically) every week has worked out well for me.
I have been running an informal tech club for 5 years now.
For instance, I don't have to go to office everyday.
For instance, when they know I am on a 50 hour week, they have a lot more free time, so they take care of their time intensive tasks.
My students are used to this ( I communicate them via group email that next week I have a 50 hour week or a 10 hour week) so they also adjust their schedule.
On 50 hours weeks, I do everything (discussions, coding sessions, guidance about doubts and clarifications) online, over email and Skype.
I am surprised that I did not bump into this question already.
With that in mind, I have a simple 'fill when time is available' policy.
On 10 hour weeks, I do more face to face interactions, extended lectures, write ups and so on.
Then, when they know I have a 10 hour week, they know they will be spending more time at the club, and adjust accordingly.
Of course, I have been working from a home office from 5 years, so, I have a lot more free time than others.
Some weeks I have a ton of work ( sometimes as high as 50 hours) and other times, its less (as low as 10 hours).
