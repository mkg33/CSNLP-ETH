Of those factors, the first is the least important.
the resolvers will use both, either by random selection, round robin or other.
IPv6 will change this, as it requires the IP with the most common topmost bits to be the one contacted first.
Picking at random and using RTTs is much more common.
IPv4 resolvers will typically use the servers in the order they get them in the packet, with the first one most often succeeding.
The order is typically randomized by the DNS server to spread the load.
When some domain have primary NS, and several secondary NSes, will clients ask them randomly to reduce the load, or they will hit primary NS only, and proceed to secondary only when primary fails?
Adding more servers may definitely improve performance.
As far as DNS recursive servers are concerned, there's no difference between "primary" and "secondary" name servers - technically they're both just "authoritative" servers.
This will make randomization of the DNS replies meaningless.
Based on empirical data on our DNS servers, it seems that primary and secondary are hit with about the same number or requests, i.e.
The only things that make any difference to the effectiveness of the load balancing are:
