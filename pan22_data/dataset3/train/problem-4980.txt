You could import the LaTeX file into LyX, to edit the document without learning LaTeX.
Ask her to read what looks like text for the paper, and ignore all the funny \foo{bar} stuff.
How can she proofread and modify my paper without having to learn latex or to see all the latex code?
My preferred option would be to just let her use the original LaTeX file, and tell her to ignore the LaTeX code, though (and point out what \:u means).
In my experience, LaTeX is not usually so markup-heavy as to be unreadable for those who don't know it.
PDF-XChange Viewer is be able to enrich a pdf document with markups and comments, even in the freely available version.
If she's going to be modifying it herself, she's got to be able to working on the actual source.
The easiest way would be to create a PDF or a print-out, and just let your girlfriend make notes and comments on that, then make her mark-ups.
I'll have to write some papers for the university written in German, in which my grammar and spelling is somewhat terrible.
So, if she wants to read the document at the PC, this tool could be helpful.
But I've not tried this, and the LyX wiki warns that it may not be 100% successful.
