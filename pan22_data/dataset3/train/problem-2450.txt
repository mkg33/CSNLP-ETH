Disabling the DNS client service is going to make the server completely unable to resolve any DNS queries at all.
Also, if your web application is communicating with other services or web sites, then it would stop functioning.
But also, almost everything any computer does that involves networking of any sort requires DNS queries in order to function properly.
Adding NICs or changing their settings can cause flushing of DNS Cache and then it's CPU usage goes up.
DNS Client Service serves mainly as a DNS cache as it's service name "DNS Cache" suggests.
But there might be some processes on your web servers which rely on DNS name resolution.
My guess is that the DNS client service activity is due to IIS Logging; try turning that off temporarily and see if that resolves it.
In my experience, high CPU utilisation by DNS Client Service can be caused by big hosts file.
If that's the case then you know where your real problem lies.
For starters, that means at a minimum the server will not be able to do any Windows Updates.
Then their response times could raise only because of repeated DNS queries to your DNS authority.
