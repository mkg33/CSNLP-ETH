It simply sounds like your clients aren't running the Puppet agent service.
Which is the default configuration which came with the package.
run service puppet start or systemctl start puppet (systemd) and if you're on a Red Hat-type OS, also run systemctl enable puppet (systemd) or chkconfig puppet on.
Puppet uses a pull model, so you need to run the agent to pull configuration from the master, every 30 mins by default when the agent is running as a service.
The only one that really matters is server if the default of puppet (relying on the search domain) isn't sufficient.

Since you say running Puppet manually works, I guess you don't even have to worry about that.
While looking at the Foreman dashboard I can see that 95% of the servers appear as synced and updated (blue icon) and 20 servers which have no known common ground appear as unsynced and not updated.

Normally you'd configure the agent to start at boot during provisioning.
When looking on the /etc/puppet/puppet.conf file on any of the Puppet agents (the ones which are updated or the ones that are not updated), I see it's configured like so:
