EDIT: Nevermind on the freeware version of Ping Monitor, it's restricted to 5 nodes.
Observium also supports increasing a number of concurrent pollers to increase performance.
I've just started experimenting with Observium and fping.
fping is an older tool, but it allows for simultaneous pings and is used by Observium behind the scenes.
If you don't need a GUI you could just fork a couple of fpings, depending on it's underlying design.
Any one got a suggestion to what software i can use?
I like Ping Monitor if you're looking for a free version.
The project has moved around, so the actual package is now on SourceForge.
It's a full fledged monitoring system though, so pollers are going to do a lot more than just pings (SNMP operations, etc).
I know it looks a little sketchy, but I've used http://fping.sourceforge.net/ without a problem.
I'm looking for a similar tool to Cacti and Multiping inn the image, it can be for linux or for windows.
If you have a budget to work with the Solarwinds Engineer's Toolset has all kinds of awesome ping goodies.
It's a unix tool, but should probably work under cygwin.
