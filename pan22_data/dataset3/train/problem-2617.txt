Yes, it should be absolutely fine to install the copy of Windows that came with your laptop.
Completely legal, as you have the key and you are using the source media to restore your devices factory state.
Call the manufacturer that you acquired the laptop from and they should send you a disc if the laptop came preinstalled.
After a brief flirt with Linux, I want to install the original Windows in my laptop.
Or, do the also legal thing, download an OEM ISO for the windows version your laptop came with (in my case a dell XP Pro) and use the key on the bottom of your laptop.
I can I legally install Windows with my Laptop's license key?
In reality, when you buy big software like Windows you are buying not the disk but the license key to use said disk.
When I had to do this I contacted both Microsoft and dell, they didn't like the fact I'd already downloaded the ISO, but said there was no legal issue using it since I would be using a valid key for it.
I've used them on 6 machines now and they work perfectly.
But I discovered my linux install totally deleted the partition where the factory windows image was stored.
In short, yes you can because you have a legal key.
