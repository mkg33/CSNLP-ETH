Windows is possibly lying when it says your processor is 2GHz, when its likely operating at 800MHz unless under heavy load (when it operates at 2GHz).
Please check and disable cpufreq or cpuspeed daemons on your PC to run on a full throttle.
(It is not just the value of 800Mhz, I also feel my system very slow with linux)
Looks like you have ondemand governor enabled by default.
The weirdest thing is that Windows XP and 7 recognize the 2Ghz of my processor,
It's called dynamic frequency scaling and is not just for mobile chips (though modern mobile chips almost always do it for lower battery consumption).
I tried with Suse 11 (KDE), Xubuntu 11.10 and Lubuntu 11.10 and these systems only recognizes 800Mhz from my processor of 2Ghz!
The dynamic frequency changing lowers power consumption when its not needed, allowing for less heat, less noise (from fans), and less power consumption.
Try doing some heavy computations (on all your processors) and you likely will see in linux that your cpu frequency goes up to 2GHz.
The utilities I used are: linuxinfo, sysinfo, "system profiler and benchmark".
My desktop's i7 processor has SpeedStep and TurboBoost that dynamically change frequency depending on load, and AMD has there own similar schemes.
