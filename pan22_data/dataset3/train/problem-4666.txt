NEver tried it but its worth a shot to export the entries and then import them into your own HKEY_CURRENT_USER, restart and then use the MMC snap in to see if you can access them.
I think if I can do that, I should be able to connect via MMC and do export for the certificates.
Now mind you they will be un-readable binary blobs so they need to be decoded.
Is it possible to use some kind of recovery CD to boot and then "login" to offline image?
The editor will insert the user's Registry data into HKEY_USERS under the user's name.
Never tried it before but if you have access to NTuser.dat file from the old computer you can load the hive in to your Registry.
Is there a way to recover private keys for SSL certificates which were installed in MMC->Certificates?
long story short - something got screwed with my boot loader, then drivers gave me blue screen etc - after 2 days of googling I decided to stop and just reinstall the windows (keeping the image of old one on a separate partition of course).
