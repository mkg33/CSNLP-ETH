For example in bash you can put the following in your .bashrc:
Some commands, such as I-search, are accessible without the control key in this mode.
I know how to open a file as read only if emacs/vi/vim is already running.

I would have added this as a comment in reply to the accepted answer, but it didn't seem possible to have a multi-line "code" block in a comment, and (in bash anyway) the above code really does need to be on 3 separate lines.
sending a file to std out, may be acceptable given the size of the file
I am not going to discrad to anyone user answer here, but i would like to aadd some more info about Read-only Mode file.
(different shells will have different formats for doing this, but you get the idea)
As per oreilly documentation Read-only Mode There will be times when you want to look at a file but want to protect that file from inadvertent keystrokes and changes.
