Maybe the user who is running the application will dynamically load a dll that you have just replaced with an incompatible version.
Use the command "net file" on the server hosting the shared file to see what users have the file open.
When it starts up, it looks for a newer version; a emacs-version.exe where version is newer than the current version.
Alternatively use the Shares section in Computer Management to achieve the same thing.
New users then got the new versions and existing users have to restart to get it.
We have some fileshares to the directory for exes as we don't want to use Remote desktop all the time for access it.
Someone who knows the reason and even better how to solve it ?
For in-house stuff, if you don't have versions, simply consider looking for main-1.exe, and failing that main-2.exe and so on, and simply create a new file whenever it's installed.
When a new version arrives the exe-files must be changed.
The exe-file resides on several servers with Windows 2003 R2 that is loadbalanced by Citrix.
The make main.exe search for the highest-numbered version.
Then we have to kick out all users before the change.
Then they install emacs.exe and emacs-version.exe and only complain if the latter can't be installed.
I don't thing that it is related to the share ( the handle utility will tell you about it ) and I don't know of a solution to this:-(.
You can use handle to find who is locking the files.
But with many users Windows may somehow lock the exe-file.
Use the command "net file /close" on the same box to force any session returned by the first command to be closed.
We have an inhouse application Fattracs that is used by 10-30 users over Citrix.
Your installer could also remove older main-N.exe files, if you like.
If there is only a few users it used to work to change the exe-file on the fly.
