I'm using Vagrant to build a reproducible virtual machine for one of my projects.
The process fails at the make and make install steps, producing the following errors:
I don't see the reason why would you install NginX from source since you didn't say any reason.
I've had to install make using apt-get at the start of the script because the image I'm using doesn't already have make installed.
For Ubuntu replace codename with Ubuntu distribution codename, and append the following to the end of the /etc/apt/sources.list file:
The part I'm having trouble with is installing nginx from source.
For Debian/Ubuntu then run the following commands:
I've verified that nginx gets successfully downloaded and extracted by checking the usr/src directory after the scripts runs.
So it might solve your problem if you are on centos, too:
Googling the make errors doesn't seemm to return anything useful I can work with as they're all specific to installing software that I'm not using.
So I'm just leaving this here from the official site:
I had the same problem on my centos7 too, so it turned out that I hadn't installed the peer packages completely.
This virtual machine needs a basic LEMP stack, and I'm using a shell script to provision it after it's created.
