Even if your repository is svn, you don't need to mess with tags during the deployment process, just look in HEAD for the required artefact version which can be a part of the puppet manifest you apply to the group.
Most release processes I have come across deploy built artefacts rather than straight checkouts from svn.
If my experience holds generally, then maybe that could contribute to the lack of support for what you're trying with svn?
I would do it by failing group A, deploying an artefact 'myCode-1.1.tar.gz' to group A.
We use SVN extensively for our software and configurations and specifically tag each change/release and then let puppet do its stuff by using vcsdeploy (http://www.practicalclouds.com/content/guide/pclouds-vcsdeploy-deploy-stuff).
I think that your procedure is good and you should try and use MCollective to manage the puppet runs and taking the nodes out of the balancer if possible.
The concept of what you are doing is sound though, but as mentioned.
The management then becomes choosing which version of a file (be it a jar, tar, rpm etc) in a repository to deploy rather than playing with svn tags which is done in a release build process.
