Yes it should look pretty (or not ugly), but don't underestimate siplifying graphics.
Tailor your examples to fit with the style of these games (eg FPS vs RTS).
My suggestion is to pick your favourite company (or top 3) and look at the AI in their games currently.
While pretty graphics are not important, visualisations of the actors is crucial.
As for exactly what to show, this depends entirely on what company you want to work for.
If you're applying at a company that uses unreal, you're in a much better position if you use unreal to show off your demo.
It shows you have both knowledge of AI and implementing it in their current tech.
A 2D city with 2D blobs moving around is fine, if you're demonstrating collision avoidance.
What you want to do is show all the behaviours/decisions/data the AI is using to the viewer.
Turn on every piece of debugging you can and leave it on for your demos.
Anywhere that is letting non-technical human resource people judge technical demos sent by candidates is not somewhere that you want to work.
Without this, the viewer may have no idea how advanced you AI is.
This can be simple things like showing the current state next to each actor (eg idle), the "field of view cone", current path, etc.
