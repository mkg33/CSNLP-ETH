However, after rebooting the server I get the dreaded 'Insert boot media' and nothing happens.
This is the guide that I followed: https://help.ubuntu.com/11.04/serverguide/advanced-installation.html
After saving the configuration I said yes to boot in a degraded state.
I selected the md0 disk and it appeared to install just fine.
I've been trying to install Ubuntu with software RAID on my server and there is obviously something that I don't understand about the process.
I went through the initial install process and manually set up my partitions.
The rest of the setup went normally, no errors of any kind.
I loaded up the recovery disk and the mdadm configuration looks correct.
Running file -s /dev/md1 shows the error needs journal recovery, I'm not sure if that's related or not or how to fix that.
I've searched around the internet but can't figure out what to do next or more importantly how to troubleshoot what exactly is going wrong.
Rebooting gives me the same problem, no boot media found.
I then created new RAID 1 disks combining the two partitions, one from each disk, such that each partition is mirrored.
Running file -s /dev/md0 doesn't indicate that GRUB is there and so I attempted to reinstall GRUB using the recovery disk.
