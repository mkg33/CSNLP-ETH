Also ensure that both abuse and postmaster addresses are valid.
Notice that I removed t=y earlier from the policy entry, but that didn't do the trick:
In terms of the content you send - its a lot more tricky to say whether that's a contributory factor.

What happens you try to send mail to norepy@teltub.com from yahoo.com?
It's important to remember that most spam systems work by totalling a variety of scores.
Looks like you've got the right stuff set up at your end, and the headers you've published show that DomainKeys and SPF settings are acceptable.
Certainly its not an easy thing to test in the absence of DSN failures to identify how to recreate the problem on demand.
I redid the whole thing with a new IP and got the same results.
But noticed that the DKIM signature generation tool that I use, leaves a 't=y' in the middle of the signature.
It should work, even if it goes to the bit bucket.
The things nobody can tell from the headers you've supplied are what Yahoo's bayesian filters hold - nor the rate at which you send emails.
In the case of the latter there's several milters for sendmail (which may work with Postfix) but I'd suggest having a look at policyd
The problem was that DKIM signing was still at test mode ('t=y' in the DNS entry).
