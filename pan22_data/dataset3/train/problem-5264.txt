I copied my GPG data from another computer by just copying ~/.gnupg/* to an external drive.
Also, if you only copied the GnuPG home directory's contents (~/.gnupg/* does that), you'll have to apply proper permissions (chmod 700 ~/.gnupg) to the enclosing directory, GnuPG is rather picky on others being able to read your files.
GnuPG does not scan all your drives and folders for its home directory, but looks for it as dedicated places, by default only ~/.gnupg (in other words, in your home directory).
If you want to use it on another computer, use the --homedir option, for example gpg --homedir=/media/usb/.gnupg --list-keys.
If you copied your GnuPG home directory back on another computer, you might have to take ownership again using chown $USER:$USER ~/.gnupg, as even when using the same user name, the underlying numeric IDs might have changed.
I'd read that this works, but can't figure out how to get it set up again.
I didn't do --export and --import because I figured this saved me a couple steps (and, again, had read that it would work).
