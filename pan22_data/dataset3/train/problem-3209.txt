It took about 8 minutes to display the contents of the disk.
The user told me he last used the CD drive several months ago with no problems.
Surprised, I ejected the Knoppix disk and inserted a disk full of MP3 files.
The disks being read sound like largely burnt disks, so the issue might stem from a bad burner.
I was able to read the disk with no problem on my PC.
I went to his desk, put the CD in his Dell Latitude D610, fired up Windows (XP) Explorer, and clicked on the drive.
Our company pushed out the Windows Autorun patch recently (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715), but no other users have encountered this issue.
On my other computer, I Googled for an answer, and didn't come up with anything.
Just a thought, but is there a virus scanner intsalled that might be grabbing the disk when you put it in?
I rebooted into Windows, went to look at the Knoppix CD in Windows, and Windows Explorer froze up.
I went back to the user's laptop, and it was now showing the contents of the CD; Explorer was no longer locked up.
A user came to me with a CD containing 24 PDFs, complaining that he couldn't read the disk on his computer.
I waited a few minutes, then shut down and re-started his PC.
Any ideas what might be causing this huge delay, or better, even how to remedy it?
The error correction in the drive in question could be off, exacerbating the problem on this one system, while the others show no errors.
Windows Explorer froze up -- clicking on his C and D partitions had no effect, and screen redrawing wasn't happening.
I suspected a bad DVD/CD ROM drive, so brought his laptop back to my desk and booted a Knoppix CD with no problems.
Windows Explorer locked up like before, and after watching it for 12 minutes, the system finally displayed the contents of the disk.
