I've done that, but there are serious issues with it.
b) a colleague of mine tried to use one and had problems.
Which I'd recommend cause it's a pain otherwise :)
I saw this article today, in case you do end up doing the 3rd party scanning route.

I can't imagine it being significantly cheaper than that-- especially if you're talking about irreplaceable photos that are effectively priceless.
What about purchasing a cheap-ish scanner, say $50 or maybe less.
The only other alternative is to buy a decent scanner and do it yourself.
I had to wipe down each photo and the scanner bed everytime I scanned, then I spent a long time finding the optimal resolution and fussed endlessly with white balance.
Feed them all through (or at least batches of 50 or so), then find a utility to split the multipage images into separate image files?
The image of this one on Amazon shows the cassette.
I know there are services out there but the best one i could find so far is Scancafe.com and they charge like $0.29 per photo so that's not going to be in my budget.
So if you choose to go this route check them out first to find one your happy with.
Not the best method, but could be most cost effective in the long run
Two, there are quality/photography snags that keep it from being as good as you think it should be.
Once you're done you could sell the scanner on eBay, or keep it incase you need to use it again.
Does anyone have any good suggestions for the best way to scan in a few hundred photos
I have about 700-800 standard sized photos sitting up in my room that i want to get scanned in before something happens to them (flood fire lost).
For the negatives you have use a negative scanner.
These come with a cassette into which you load the negative strip and you can then feed these through the scanner to process many images at a time.
