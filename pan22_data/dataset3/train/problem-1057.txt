I would enable every setting like "Enable XYZ translation acceleration" and all "Boost 2D/3D graphics".
These features require specialistic hardware and do not work with standard home gaming cards.
Plainly, I would just enable any setting that would help boost performance of it.
Would such computer be capable of running advanced visual simulations with high framerate or run hardcore games on high settings with high framerate or for another example display 8K movie of 60FPS (if I had 8K monitor for that).
This means they are at a lower level and have direct access to hardware whereas a type 2 hypervisor has to piggy back off the OS which isn't ideal.
Yea, I know, it's impossible to have it in desktop, this is just helping you with visualisation of my question.
Also 3D rendering or any GPU intense work is slightly different VMware ESXi has two features called VSGA and VDGA which directly talk to the GPU either dedicated (VDGA) or shared (VSGA).
Well it is possible however you would never install Linux and then a type 2 hypervisor you would install a type 1 (native) hypervisor such as Hyper-V or ESXi.
Let's imagine that you have a super-powerful-server at home of size of desktop (just visualisation).
I mean, seriously the really outrageously hardcore computer.
Some games companies are already rolling out streaming online gaming websites where you can play the latest titles, all of these are running on virtual machines backend.
2048 physical cores each 3GHz, 64TB RAM, GTX 780 Ti Black Edition (SLIx4, (four graphics card working as one).
Hope this helps to answer your question a bit, its quite a large topic.
But yes in reality with lots of money and skills you can get a virtual machine to do whatever you like.
Assuming that I would run Linux, I would install virtual machine client like VirtualBox or VMware and install Windows on it.
