Does this match the DDRII 667 that we are supposed to have?
DDR(1) is more expensive than DDR(2) these days if its a new server you should look at the mainanace costs but wow I think I throw away worse pc's than that without looking twice..
Then there's also the issue of DDR vs. DDR2; DDR2 is better.
You don't mention what the server is doing, but typical server tasks (web, mail, database, etc) are CPU- and/or network bandwidth- and/or IO-bound.
It is also important to note the Front Side Bus speed of the processor.
One of the options only comes with DDR 400 (or DDR 400 registered).
Memory bandwidth makes little or no difference for those tasks.
Is there a big difference between DDRII 667 and DDR 400?
The bandwidth of DDR2-400 is something like 3.2GB/sec and unless your server is part of a render farm or is doing certain kinds of science work, you're simply not throwing around anywhere near that much data per second.
667 and 400 indicate the bus speed of the RAM; higher is better.
Just don't expect any performance increase from it.
As others have said, DDR2 is cheaper at this point, so it certainly has that going for it.
We currently have DDR II 667 RAM on the dedicated server.
Also, if I run CPUZ on the current server it reports the type of memory to be DDR (not DDRII) with a DRAM frequency of 200MHz, CAS Latency 3 clocks, RAS to CAS delay 4 clocks, RAS precharge 4 clocks, cycle time 8 clocks, banks cycle time 12 clocks, command rate 1T, DRAM Idle Timer 16 clocks.
When it comes to latency, the first number (CAS latency) is the more important of the four numbers; lower is better.
Unless you've got a fairly pricy SAN or SSD array, your drives can't even hope to read or write 320MB/sec per second, and that's only 10% of DDR-400's bandwidth.
If the FSB is 400 then 667 memory will do you no good.
Even in applications like games that are sensitive to memory bandwidth, there's little if any real-world difference between DDR-400 and DDR2-667, because of DDR2's increased latency.
