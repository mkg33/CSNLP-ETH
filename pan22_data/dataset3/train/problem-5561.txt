(I should notice that before that I got another error related to super-block, which was fixed by re-running the mkinitrd).
I moved my CentOS soft-RAID1 drives to another box, and now it fails to boot.
While changing box, it is highly likely that your disks no longer have the same device name as viewed by Linux.
When I launched the boot process from the grub menu, I get the following error:
Then, check that /etc/fstab and /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf don't contain any references to your raw disk names.
You should boot the new box on a rescue CD (live CD, any distro will work).
In any case, the disk that used to be /dev/hda may now be /dev/sdb, or something else.
This could be because the driver is a different one, or they are just numbered differently.
Then, check how your disks are detected, find their new names, so you can update your configuration.
Swap partitions are a frequent culprit, if you didn't put them in a RAID partition.
Update this to be correct for your new box, and rewrite grub to both your disks, using the grub command:
GRUB does it's best to use "independant" disk names, such as (hd0) and (hd1), but it does map these to real device names in the file /boot/grub/device.map.
