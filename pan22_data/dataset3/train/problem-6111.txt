Edit:  However, as I'm thinking about this, one practical effect that could be pretty well recorded is that of gunshots.
The websites and programs answered so far are definitely the way to go.
There's most likely a shooting range that rents out pistols and, as long as you call beforehand and make sure the range owner is alright with it, you could probably bring in a microphone for, at the very least, a trial run of how the recordings could sound.
Here are some sources for sources of sounds i found and use
And, of course, have one of the employees supervise if you're not experienced with firearms.
It is possible to create your own sounds with Software, a free software is for example Pure Data, but also any Software Synthesizer with enought variability will do it.
If you want old-school 8-bit-era sounds sfxr is a great little tool (Mac OS X and Windows).
For example, try Little Endian sound mangling SDKs.
If you're writing a simple game, you can pick some open source sound library, which contains sfx'es for blows, explosions, whatever you need, or to buy a licensed one and use it.
Not to mention, programming with a few less fingers would be tough.
You could try some dynamic sound effects generation where sound parameters would depend on your game action.
Most likely, any level of explosion you create will not sound much like what you're looking for anyway.
It's worth noting that, depending on the range, an indoor setup could likely make for some undesired echo if their sound dampening isn't well done.
There's a guys in a movie industry for example, even whole compamies, which work is to create sound effects for movies, series, video games.
Actually this is a self discipline, called "sound engineering".
