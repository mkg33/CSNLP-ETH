I've checked, and the windows firewall on the host is disabled.
If neither of the other two answers are helping you, you could always try grabbing some DNS traffic with Wireshark or something similar, then looking for the actual DNS conversation.
If you are trying to use DHCP and it does not work then try setting Static address and see if this helps.
Compare resolv.conf on problematic and normal machine.
The host user had installed some kind of VPN client that was blocking DNS traffic created by the guest.
I have several Vista hosts each with one Ubuntu guest each running in virtual box in bridge mode.
Usually Bridge mode problems are due to improperly configured guest network settings or a problem with DNS.
Make sure to do it somewhere you can see both sides of the conversation (i.e, is the problem that DNS requests aren't making it to the server, or replies aren't making it back to the client?)
On the problematic guest machine, if i dig @<internal dns ip> <some internal domain> it always gives timeout, but on that machine, the <internal dns ip> replies to pings and i can even telnet <internal dns ip> 53.
