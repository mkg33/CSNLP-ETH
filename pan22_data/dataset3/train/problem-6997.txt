You don't really open a partition per se, but a file in the partition.
Windows prevents you from listing, opening, or modifying them while it is running, but they are visible if you look at the volume under some tools (such as EnCase).
However, I guess that file doesn't have a path, you cannot open, delete, or modify it.
You can call ReadFile() and give it the filename $MFT.
1 on the disk) - which makes sense because Windows cannot locate files by name without the content of the metafiles, so there is probably deep in the NTFS API a way to access files by file number only (sort of like opening a file in Linux by "inode" number instead of name).
So if that is a file,  maybe partitions are files, too?
The path to the MFT is \$Mft - the mirror is \$MftMirr.
The names of them are less important to Windows than the position they occupy in the file table (i.e.

So everything on a disk, including the boot sector is a file.
The NTFS documentation refers to them as "metafiles."
Today, i discovered that the Master File Table is itself a file.
