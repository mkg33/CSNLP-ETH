Currently, in Windows 10, the Start Menu search feature presents only applications found in the two Start Menu folders:
Now, to get to all the other shortcuts in your Start Menu folders, from the Start Menu itself, you can use the All apps... list, or the Search my stuff feature.
I assume (and I would put good $ on it) that this is all by purposeful design, because historically application installers have polluted Start Menu folders with all manner of silly shortcuts (help files, readme text files, order forms, internet URLs, other spam).
those that do not link to applications but instead link to documents like help files) are excluded from the search results.
Note that this logic is specific to the above two Start Menu folder locations.
On second thought, this isn't too bad actually, that's going to speed up the computer by making it only do the refresh on-demand.
This pollution ruins the "app search" experience (think Windows 8.x) so with Windows 10 only apps are shown.
should work actually.. i am using a shortcut to a .xlsx in my start menu
Either workaround is far better, IMO, than navigating polluted app search results.
C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\
In Windows 10, clicking on Start > All Apps will start a service that "Discovers" other apps in the Start Menu folder.
then search for the entry and (if you like to) map it to the start page of your start menu
In my case it turns out my user-specific Start Menu was not being indexed.
some shortcuts are missing from particular appilication, http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/programs-missing-from-start-menu-windows-10/1de9b3fe-d994-48c0-9b9a-18f6991d44eb hope this link helps.
