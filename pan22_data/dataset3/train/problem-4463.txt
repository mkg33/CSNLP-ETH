Windows will be the host OS, and Linux will be the guest.
Your main hard drive is usually /dev/sda, but it might be something different depending on your computer.
You can then start Linux like any other native Windows application.
Don't ever touch /dev/sda1 (or whatever your Windows partition is) while in Linux.
It installs like a normal program and can be uninstalled just the same.
But if you really do want to dual-boot (which is the official name for booting two different OS's) I would do it like so:
I'm interesting in installing Linux but I dont want to break my Windows installation.
(There are obviously exceptions, but unless you really know what you're doing, you probably shouldn't.)
(Although it's probably all already in a sticky or something, so search around first ;)
In the Linux install you will create partitions in the free space behind your Windows partition.
In Linux you will have many different filesystem types to choose from.
I run Fedora 15 as a guest in a Windows 7 host with no problems.
a. Linux has a different scheme for recognizing drives and partitions than Windows.
Download the Windows version of VirtualBox, use it to create a Linux VM, and install whichever Linux distribution you wish inside the VM.
If you have a really powerful computer (or are using a fairly frugal Linux distro) you can run in VirtualBox or something like it.
c. I'm sure your install guide will go into this, but hard drives are formatted with different filesystems.
I would recommend the Windows installer for Ubuntu, it's probably the safest way to install it without breaking anything.
I recommend installing Linux in a virtual machine.
The best way to go about it depends on what you want to do with it.
Generally you will have a swap partition that has it's own "swap" filesystem, and then any data partitions (/, /home, etc.)
Windows uses C: A: D: etc, while Linux uses /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc for drives and /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda3 far partitions on the drive /dev/sda.
The default filesystem for Windows 2000-7 is NTFS.
If you just wanna try out Linux, simply use a LiveCD.
If you ask around on Linux forums they'll be more than happy to explain all that stuff to you.
That means if the hard drive is /dev/sda then the Windows partition will be /dev/sda1 and your Linux partitions will be /dev/sda2 /dev/sda3 etc.
