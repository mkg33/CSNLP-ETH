Just download the ISO, right-click and select "Mount", and open the DEEPIN_S.exe file.
If your experience any lagging go to the Display settings and set the Windows Effects setting to "Off".
Instead when you boot your computer the Windows bootloader will give you the option to choose which OS you want to use.
Deepin can be istalled without the need to create a partition for it or a medium such as a USB drive to run it from (although it can be installed that way as well).
There is a version of Linux that will run in 32 bit Windows OSs.
The only difference might be the fast startup settings.
Cygwin Shell (https://www.cygwin.com/) is a linux emulator that runs inside Windows.
Then delete the Deepin folder along with the uninstaller.
Also, Deepin is a beautiful OS and very user-friendly, but also a bit power hungry.
The installer will simply ask you to create a username, password, and select how much hard drive space you want to use for Deepin.
This will greatly improve system performance on slower machines.
It's no different than installing a program and it will not overwrite the Windows bootloader with a GRUB bootloader.
If you don't do this before reboot the installation will fail.
As it will instruct you, it is important to go to Control Panel>All Control Panel Items>Power Options>System Settings, select "Change settings that are currently unavailable" and turn OFF fast startup.
Note: These instructions should apply to most if not all versions of Windows currently being used.
I have not tried it myself, but have read articles that state it does work.
Once your computer has rebooted and the installation has completed you can turn it back on.
If at any time you want to uninstall Deepin just login to Windows, go to the root of your Windows drive (usually C:), open the Deepin folder and run the uninstall.exe file.
