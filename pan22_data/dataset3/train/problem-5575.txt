It supports hundreds of thousands of characters and symbols, some rarely used or from dead languages.
The font Arial Unicode MS (at leat from Office 2007) does not contain the character \uA786.
(And then, for other people to be able to see the character correctly, they'll need the same font or you'll need to convert to a format that embeds character glyphs (font embedding) such as PDF.)
I think, in Windows, once you've downloaded it, you can right-click and select "Install".)
I'm only aware of one font that tries to support all characters: Unifont.
Because of the sheer number of characters, trying to make a font file that covers them all is considered by most to be a wasted effort so usually only the more commonly used characters are included.
I've checked and it supports the particular character you've asked about.
(Sometimes that's just latin characters, sometimes it includes other languages, and sometimes you get fancy stuff like emoji.)
This is a bitmap font which means it looks pixelated at larger sizes.
You'll probably want the Standard Unifont TTF download, a 12MB file.
You'll need to use a font that actually supports the particular character.
