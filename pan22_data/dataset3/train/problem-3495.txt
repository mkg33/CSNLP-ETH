On the other hand, it does give you more processing power at your disposal, so it's a bit of a tradeoff.
After a bit of searching the web I found this piece of software.
Is it possible to use my laptop screen as an external monitor?
You can move your mouse over the screens like you plugged them directly onto your Computer.
ItÂ´s called MaxiVista and provides the use of other Computers as monitor.
I need to create a multi-monitor setup for my desktop computer but I have no additional monitors with me right now, aside from my laptop.
You can do something sort-of similar using synergy; you can control both computers from one mouse and keyboard using your network connection.
Check out this webpage from Alternativeto.com...it lists the (mostly) free alternatives to Maxivista...as good of a list as you're gonna get...
This isn't quite the same thing, since windows won't drag from one machine to another.
Note that I am not trying to connect a monitor to my laptop, rather, I am trying to connect my laptop screen to a desktop video card (if this is possible).
