All signals are analog, wether if it's electricity (copper), light (fiber) or radio (wifi), signals/waves can have any arbitrary value.
Here is a layman's answer to a presumably layman's question:
There are many differences between analog and digital, but one of the primary distinctions that will easily answer your question is that analog signals make use of sine waves while digital signals make use of square waves.
It is not the medium that determines the type of signal, but the devices on each end.
During communication of the two electronic circuits, the transmitter will convert the electrical signal into light/optical signal so that it can travel in the optic fibre, on arrival to the receiving end, the detector in the receiver will convert the optical signal back into the electrical signal.
In laymanâ€™s terms, in a Fibre optic system, two electronic circuits are linked with an optic fibre .
However, you can also transmit a analog signal over fiber optic, such as a video.
How this transformation done depends on the encoding.
From this analogy, l turn to believe that the optic fibre is a physical conductor that transport both digital and analogue signals in the form of light.
Since fiber optic data transmissions in networking use square waves, it is a digital signal.
Information in a fiber optic system can be transmitted analog (signal varies continuously) or digital (signal exists at discrete levels representing zeros and ones).
I mean traditional phone system is analog, but Ethernet is digital, but what about Fiber Optic?
However, in the computer world they carry digital information (either 1 or 0) and they are processed digitally, transforming the analog information into digital information.
Most fiber optic transmissions used by telecommunications/cable operators are digital.
