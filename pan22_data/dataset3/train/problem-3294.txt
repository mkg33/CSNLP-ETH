Played with Windows 8 for a month and realized what a mess.
What I discovered was that Windows 8 changes your hard drive from MBR to GPT (boot sector) and each one does not like the other.
Thus I bought Windows 8 online directly from Microsoft which automatically was setup on my USB thumb drive.
What I had to do is: (this assumes you installed Windows 8 and thus your hard drive is set as GPT)
The article is intended for Windows Vista, but you can follow the steps and see if it still applies for reverting from Windows 8 Developer Preview to Windows 7.

After spending 16 straight hours of research and work on this problem, I finally found the solution.
Just reboot using a Windows 7 recovery USB/CD drive and select restore an image (Windows 7 image).
You could try using the original Windows 7 install CDs, but my new laptop does not have a CD player.
So then, I thought, its time to put Windows 7 back on my computer.
I did a BIOS update on my computer, also saved an image of my Windows 7 system (VERY SMART STEP!)
Using this article from Microsoft support you can recover data from windows.old file.
You have no idea how many problems and errors I discovered.
There were so many I did not even keep track of all the error codes and everything that would not work.
Thus you CANNOT boot a Windows 7 recovery USB drive AND/OR do a Windows 7  image restore if your hard drive is set as a GPT volume/disk; likewise, you CANNOT do a Windows 7 MBR image recovery from a Windows 8 recovery bootable USB drive.
And I was armed with everything: I had a Windows 7 bootable USB recovery drive, a Windows 8 bootable install/recovery USB drive, a Windows 7 image file, and the latest and greatest BIOS.
