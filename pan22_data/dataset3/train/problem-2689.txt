I personally don't know of any way to verify that the products are genuine as it requires having access to the product key which, obviously, is not going to be handed out without a purchase agreement.
Windows 2003 licenses are coming down in price because of the release of Windows 2008.
If you do purchase and find a problem with the license then you can contact the Microsoft Anti-Piracy folks.
I personally have no experience in working with them, but I would imagine that they would help to address your issue in a fairly timely fashion.
What is the best way to determine if the licensing for Server software purchased online is valid for our company?
You can determine the validity of a running copy of Windows by going to http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/default.aspx?displaylang=en and clicking on Validate Windows.
For example, this copy of Server 2003 seems entirely too cheap (we are planning to migrate to Server 2003 from Linux, can't use Server 2008 due to old Win98 machines), but if it's valid we'll certainly pick up a copy.
As far as pre-sales go, your best bet is to buy your licenses from reputable vendors that you trust.
