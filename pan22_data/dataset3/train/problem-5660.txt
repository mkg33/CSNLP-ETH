There must be more at play in your workload than just INSERTs.
PAGEIOLATCH_SH means a page is read from the disk.
I have a program that insert row to a table though multiple connections.
The complex and more expensive answer is you need to fix the application so that it does not read that many pages (ie.
The insert statement is NOT a stored procedure, by simply dynamic sql every time when insert into the database.
However, once it reach about 3000 rows or so, SQL server start slowing down.
Simply and cheaply put you need a non-Express instance, more RAM and a faster disk.
What other information should I look for to fix to issue?
If I kill the application and run the process again, the insert will be fast again, for the first few minutes until it become a snail again.
CPU utilization is low when running the insert statements.
I notice the query has wait_type of PAGEIOLATCH_SH.
This is a SQL Express, so memory utilization is limited.
For each insert, the connection would open and then close.
In fact, I notice some other Select statements are having the same problem.
Eventually it become 30x slower than it should be.
