How would my macbook work when i use 4 computers on only two cores?
I typically do browser testing and vpn/ssh stuff (so not computationally heavy things)
Afaik each machine needs one dedicated cpu core and some ram to run.
Granted, if you do computationally heavy things in the VMs you might get less mileage.
As an example, Virtualbox runs just fine a single-core CPU, right alongside your other programs.
The task scheduler for the host machine should theoretically be able to run an indefinite number of Virtual Machines, albeit at slower and slower operational speeds.
I have a dual core (4 logical core) MBP and constantly run 2-3 VMS on it, some linux, one windows.
My school is trying to save money so we are supposed to run a server with at least two clients in virtualbox.
Anecdota: I'm successfully running three VMs on a single-core machine; the performance varies a lot (depending on the loads), but it is feasible (the actual shortage is with RAM in my case).
The bottleneck is not typically the processor, its the RAM.
It helps, but isn't strictly necessary: Your VMs will just get less processor time, minus the overhead; but in general, you can run as many VMs as you want, if you don't mind the decrease in performance.
"Afaik each machine needs one dedicated cpu core".
I have 8GB of ram, I give each linux VM 1GB and the windows 2GB.
Your computer multitasks, allowing it to run more than one program per core.
In order to run VirtualBox on your machine, you need:
Virtual machines do not need a dedicated CPU, only Dedicated RAM.
