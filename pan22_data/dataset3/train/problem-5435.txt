The most commonly used low level protocol would typically be TCP - as it has built in functionality to resend missing or corrupt packets, however solutions which run over UDP and do their own checks are becoming practical (Google QUIC protocol uses UDP).
Other protocols could conceivably be used as well.
The lower level protocols include TCP, UDP and a few other less commonly used ones, including protocols used for traffic management and some VPNs.
There is no simple answer to this question - it is, in effect, nonsensical and there are a huge number of ways this could be done.
Then you get secure protocols like HTTPS and SCP - all of these are common for transferring files reliably.
There are a plethora of other, less common ways of transmitting the file across a network - and indeed some of these don't even require Internet.
Sending files by encoding them and sending them through a mail / store-and-foward system expands the number of possibilities hugely - this includes encoding files in a way that mail systems will cope with and sending them - usually via SMTP.
Above this you then have the application protocols - and these will typically sit on top of UDP or TCP - and this is where the choices become hugely overwhelming.
Ms word documenta can be sent through any protocol like HTTP and FTP.
They include using SMB (local file sharing), FTP (old way to upload files to systems, very complex protocol) ad HTTP .
