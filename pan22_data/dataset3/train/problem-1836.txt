My shop is putting together a three-node cluster for use as a Hyper-V host for our customer.
Previous installations we did for this customer only had two nodes per cluster, so we did Node and Disk Majority.
But now that we're moving on to an odd number of nodes, it has put us in a quandry: do what Microsoft recommends and use Node Majority or go with No Majority: Disk Only?
The flip side, is that No Majority would result in a "single" point of failure (which is something I think we can mitigate).
To give proper context to the questions, here is our physical configuration:
My customer would really like to have this cluster up, even if only one node is available.
Everything I've seen online is saying the same thing about this configuration being dangerous, but I don't know if they're just parroting or have actually validated the information.
The reason I ask, is that using the recommended settings we could only tolerate one server failure versus two.
I guess I'm looking for reassurance from the community that I'm making the correct choice, since I'm deviating from what Microsoft recommends.
