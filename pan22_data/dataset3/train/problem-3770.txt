I had this issue since I was having different DPI.
None of the other answers worked for me, I finally found something that did, after a lot of digging.
Use the Group Policy Editor (or download the superior "Policy Plus"), and disable UDP.
I've had the same problem - switch from 32bit to 24bit colours and it will let you connect as normal.
tasklist /svc | findstr /C:TermService to identify the Process ID, and
When I have this issue I move the RDP screen to my default screen and maximize the screen.
net start TermService to restart (though it will restart on its own in my experience)
There are a lot of settings to fiddle with in there, you could also try disabling RemoteFX graphics.
You can find this in policy rds/client or rds/host/connection/select protocols, or in the registry at SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services\Client
On my laptop I had DPI set to 125% while a computer I was connecting had 100%.
Repeating a workaround documented by @johnny Keeton above, proposing as answer because it worked for me when the other solutions above did not...
