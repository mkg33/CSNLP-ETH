And there is a set of constraints over the variables, thus in the constrained state space, the actual probability distribution of each variable will skewed.
I am wondering if there are any results on estimating the probability distribution of the random variables under a set of constraints.
Consider that we have a state space of n random variables, for simplicity, the variable value can be 0 or 1.
For example, if we have two variables a,b and a constraint a=0->b=1, the actually probability that b=0 will be 1/3 compared to 0.5 when unconstrained.
The golden answer of the probability distribution could be derived by using the SAT solver to get all the solutions and then computing the statistics, which is prohibitively computationally expensive.
Each variable has its probability distribution when it is not constrained, also for simplicity, it can be a uniform distribution (50% probability for 0 and 50% for 1).
Given the Valiantâ€“Vazirani randomized reduction from SAT to unique SAT, if there was a way of efficiently estimating the probability distribution of variables then you could use it to solve SAT.
Thus I am wondering if there is any way to do a fair estimation on that.
If the SAT instance has a unique solution then you are asking for the actual solution.
