Reinstall any software from scratch and don't copy any of the registry over.
Hopefully, your friend has been performing regular backups of their system.
When a virus damages your system, there's only one way you can be certain that you've removed all traces of the virus, and that's to do a complete re-installation, including re-formatting of your drive(s).
I've used SystemRescueCD successfully in the past.
It is now too late to do a backup as others have suggested.
I don't think there's anything to be gained by trying to "clean up the mess."
Once a virus is detected, I take the approach that the whole installation is now suspect and should not be trusted.
But some spyware (and viruses, I assume) will put itself all sorts of places in the registry so that it reinstalls itself.
Better option: back up the system, do a clean install, scan the files (documents, movies, music) that are still needed and copy those over.
If you were to restore data from a virus infected backup, you could end up back in the same situation your friend is in now.
ClamAV will do fine at finding viruses in the filesystem, however.
If you perform a backup now, you're potentially creating a virus infected backup because you cannot be sure which files have been affected by the virus.
There's tools (sorry, I forget the name) you can use on Knoppix to access the registry, but it's pretty tricky to clean out the registry.
Make sure you scan the files before putting them on another system.
Both allowed be to transfer data from one HD to another.
