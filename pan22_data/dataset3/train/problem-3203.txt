You may have to manually mount it (ie mount /dev/sd[a-z][1-?]
A missing point here is what to do if it doesnt automount.
If that doesn't work you can type "sudo mount /dev/ /"  As long as the partition is labeled properly that should work.
If it is a hard disk or a cd-rom drive, you have to figure out which device it is, and then mount it.
You can type mount from the command line to find out where everything is mounted.
Typing "mount" with no options will show you what partitions are mounted where along with some other information.
To mount an drive that's not automatically mounted you can go to "Places-->Removable Media" or "Places-->Computer" at the top and when you select an unmounted partition it should mount it for you.
If you are just plugging in a drive (ie usb or firewire), then check dmesg and see which device it showed up as, and which partitions are available.
If the volume isn't mounted typing "sudo fdisk -l" in a terminal will list all the drives and partitions that are connected to the system.
It's worth noting that in addition to /mnt/, where storage volumes sometimes are manually mounted, hal (the hardware abstraction layer daemon) will mount things like usb drives, memory cards and cd/dvd-roms under /media/.
I believe that Ubuntu places volumes for extra drives under /media/ and not /mnt/ like other linux distributions.
Otherwise you may need to supply the -t option with the file system that's on the partition.
Check the mount man page for more options and examples.
Assuming they are mounted, they can be found under /mnt, if not, you would have to first mount the device.
