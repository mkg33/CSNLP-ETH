Granted this will eventually happen anyway, but it will happen much faster for a battery that is always plugged in.
If you were hoping to use the laptop for, say, more than a couple years, then maybe it would have been better if you bought a laptop with an easy-to-replace battery.
If not, they will eventually lose the ability to hold a charge.
Batteries need to be exercised (the charge/drain cycle).
Shouldn't make a difference to you if you're going have it plugged in all the time though.
I have my asus k501lb laptop and it seems that the laptop's battery is non-removable, what is the disadvantage of this laptop battery?
Fortunately my laptop has an easily removable battery separate from the A/C cord, so I remove the battery from the laptop when I know it'll be plugged in for an extended period.
The only (small) disadvantage is that the battery will stay at 100% charge which will decrease its life somewhat.
it seems that the new laptop now are none removable just like any smartphones... what is the alternative of this?
You can buy a laptop that has an easy-to-replace battery.
