Does the domain controller proved a list of approved computers to the client or the server?
Does anyone know the process of how the Logonworkstation attribute is processed during log in?
resolved properly on both srv09 and the client computer attempting the remote desktop connection.
This event shows up on the server as expected as a
It previously had 8 other server names in the field and the account can access them, but Remote desktop-ing into the new server fails with the following error
The server is on a different Vlan then the other servers, so I tried a wireshark capture on srv09, but all I see is rds traffic between the client and server.
I don't know how to troubleshoot the issue further.
I have added a server srv09 to the "logOnWorkstations" for an active directory account adAccount1.
I thought maybe DNS wasn't working properly and checked that nslookup srv09
Just to be clear my goal is to allow adAccount1 to access only the 9 identified servers and right now it can access all but one.
