D is typically your recovery partition and C is where your drive will save any and all of your what can be considered normal data (games, temporary files, cache, etc etc)
please download the program TreeSizeFree and run it (as admin to see all data).
Disk clean up is a great tool, but you may find a tool called CCleaner to be much more effective.
Have you tried to use standard "Disk Cleanup" tool?
Yes, Windows uses C: drive as default for all temporary files, browser cache and so on.
Also, as you continue to fill the drive, you may notice (or not) a decrease in your drive performance.
Is there anything not being used you can get rid of to create space?
I think Windows is filling my HDD with cache and other junk files.
Are you able to locate the folder which uses most space?
You can download it for free and it has much more in depth options than a Disk Cleanup.
Antivirus is Bitdefender the latest, installed a few days ago.
I've seen this happen with Windows 7 Professional...you might have Windows Backup set to the backup destination D:.
