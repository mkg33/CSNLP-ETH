If you can try to divide your problem into two, it might be easier to solve for you:
In my terminal, I need to press esc-shift and press z two times to close the crontab.
Make sure that your php executable is in /usr/local/bin
You will get one line output saying crontab installed.
Open up your terminal and try the code examples here.
And add at the end the following line to execute it every minute:
Let's say within the above examples the "wget http://www.domain.com/file.php" worked for you, then type in:
So you want to call a PHP script on a schedule using cron jobs.
These two parts are usually independent of each other.
-Scheduling the run of that script using a cron job.
I need to run the CRON jobs on my local host as i am fetching feeds using RSS feeder.
You'll probably get permission errors in your first tries, so chmod your php script to 0755.
-Writing a script which fetches the rss feed and does whatever you want it to do
This explains you how Cron works and how to add tasks to your crontab.
if you're working on a Windows environment, the easiest way to achieve this would be to set up a scheduled task to execute the PHP script that will fetch your RSS data (using the php executable - see here)
Once you find a working command the first part is complete.
