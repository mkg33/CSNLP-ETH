It all depends on the structure of the damaged file and the extent of the damage.
Steve Gibson with the Gibson Research Center is a pioneer in data recovery.
On the other extreme you will find the simple text file,
If you read through his website concerning his SpinRite product, he discusses in depth how his software can partially recover files where other products will not recover a file if one sector is bad.
I think the answer depends on the hard drive recovery software that you use.
really-huge-document-pt-1.pdf through really-huge-document-pt-10.pdf).
You could still lose the whole file by losing only one of
Disregarding an attempt to effectively put back the data into the original form, does situation A represent a full loss of data while situation B represents only loosing 10% of the data?
In the example you used, PDF is very vulnerable to a partial destruction, because
I would recommend that you do not try to cut files into pieces, since this is not
to use, and to concentrate rather on having backups.
Now let's assume one of these sectors failed on the drive.
I would instead recommend keeping the files in the shape that is the easiest
These 40,960 bytes represent a single file we are attempting to store.
Or is the data recovery dependent on the type of data being stored and/or the error correction methods implemented on the drive?
In situation A we just had the file stored as-is (e.g.
really-huge-document.pdf) and in situation B we had split the file into ten subsections (e.g.
where breaking it into pieces will only mean that one piece is lost and the others
For a hypothetical exercise let's say we are attempting to store 40,960 bytes (10 sectors) worth of data on the drive.
Modern hard drives utilize a 4,096 byte sector size when storing information.
Here is an example excerpt where he talks about partial file recovery:
Here's one where I think he sheds light on your question by describing a method used:
