Also, check the network card for the docking station (Under the network connection-->Properties-->Configure button), in the Advanced Tab, look for any power-related settings: the card may be being turned off to save power.
I have my xbox360 connected to my laptop-docking-station with a plain old network cable.
Now i've set up the windows network so that the laptop is sharing it's internet connection over the lan port so the xbox can connect to the internet.
Am i missing some setting or is there any tool or command that i can use to re-initialize the shared connection so i don't have to reboot my machine?
Disclaimer; this will drop any connections you may have.
The laptop itself is connected to my home network via wifi.
I would put one between your laptop and xbox and see if that helps any.
"the connection cannot be used again until i restart windows"
But when i switch off the xbox (which i sometimes do during working hours ;) ) and back on later that day - the connection cannot be used again until i restart windows.
That often works for me when I need to reset a network link.
Have you tried disabling and re-enabling the network connection between the x-box and the laptop?
I assume the network shows as connected, but you cannot get internet.
