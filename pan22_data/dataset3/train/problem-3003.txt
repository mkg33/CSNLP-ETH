The session will only then end once you've closed that bash session.
You can do something like top -n1 -b to get a snapshot of the system.
If your last command is top, then existing that will always close your session.
When run with the -c argument, the shell terminates once the command terminates, which causes your session to end.
and use putty's "remote command" option to try running that; once you leave top, the session will be overwritten with a bash shell, and when you leave that, you should be automatically logged out.
If you open PuTTY with the the remote command top, then SSH will run the following:
It's logging you out because you told putty to run one and only one command in your remote session, which is top.
I'm not aware of anyway to get top to stop clearing the screen on exit.
SSH executes the remote command by passing it to your configured shell to execute.
Try top; bash as your command and you'll run a shell after top exits.
To run top and then stay logged in, you can use the remote command top; $SHELL -l. This will run top and then start a login shell.
One the remote command exits, the shell it runs in will also close, which ends your session.
