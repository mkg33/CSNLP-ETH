Is there any way to reduce this to a single function?
You're creating two functions per image one to handle mouseenter event and other to handle mouseout event.
  <img src="http://reneinla.com/tasha/style/images/stills/FORD-SUPER-BOWL.jpg" alt="" class="myImage" />
Does onHover2 refer to the function which should be called when hovering second time?
  <img src="http://reneinla.com/tasha/style/images/stills/OPERATOR.jpg" alt="" class="myImage" />
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  var hoverImage = 'http://reneinla.com/tasha/style/images/gifs/giphy.gif';
  <img src="http://reneinla.com/tasha/style/images/stills/OPERATOR.jpg" alt="" class="myImage" />
Using numbers as the suffix to variables/functions means you're repeating same/similar code.
On mouseenter, change the image src to the desired image and when mouseleave revert it back to the original.
Also, add a common class to all the images and use this to bind event on them.
  <img src="http://reneinla.com/tasha/style/images/stills/FORD-SUPER-BOWL.jpg" alt="" class="myImage" />
    imageSrc = $(this).attr('src'); // Store the value of original image
You can use hover() to bind mouseenter and mouseleave events on images.
If you look at the mouseenter handler of all the images, you'll notice that they are all same.
It is just setting the src attribute value of the image to the same value which is provided in HTML.
This will reduce the number of functions from 2n to n + 1 where n is the number of images.
A quick improvement will be to use a single function to handle mouse enter event of all the images.
