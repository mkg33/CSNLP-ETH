The law for these sorts of things can be very muddy, so it's best to get a lawyer who's very experienced, or to just trash your hardware and start fresh.
Protected "C" - data which if in the wrong hands poses a threat to national security, organization-wide security, or "root" access to the entire database where the data stored can cause the same widespread damage.

If you want a neat tool to categorize by risk, the Canadian Military has a pretty neat method for that:
Find a lawyer who specializes in data security breech.
Depending on just how good he was and how cautious he was about getting a persistent backdoor, you might need a new hard drive and motherboard.
Consider: he could have installed his back-door into the boot sector.
It's a hefty cost in most cases, but if there's potential for a law suit, then lawyer up first and go from there.
Data Protected "A" - data that can cause significant damage to an individual without risk of damage to others using the same system.
Protected "B" - data which can cause significant damage to any more than 1 person, but is still limited to people whose data is stored in the same system, but without risk of damage to the organization which carries the data.
So, if your databases house personal information, and your server belongs to an entity who is legally responsible to people to keep that data confidential, then I would trash anything that can store data and start fresh.
And depending on exactly what he has done, you might have to leave all your data behind.
If it was me making the decision of what to do, I wouldn't look at the person for clues about what he may have done; I would act on the risk of damage that the data you have tucked away in those databases could potentially do.
