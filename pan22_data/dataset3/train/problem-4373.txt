Basically, external drives connected via e-SATA operate at the same speed they would in a internal setting.
Change the settings so that the new laptop can access files on the old one, and set the folders you want to share over the network.
If the computer is already networked to a router in your house you could just set up file sharing on the old laptop and transfer from it to the new one.
What's the most effective way of transferring these?
USB2 is much slower, but I've read USB3 was supposed to have similar performance to e-SATA (I'm not up-to-date on this).
External hard drive or network transfer via crossover cable.
I would just connect it up using a crossover cable, or via a switch to set up a quick and dirty internal network.
The transfer may be much faster using an external hard drive casing, especially if the new laptop PC has an e-SATA port (and the HD casing as well of course), than any solution involving an ethernet cable.
I'm buying a new laptop and still have lots of videos, pictures, pdfs, and code etc on my old laptop.
