I have a Windows Azure VM running VS2013 Load Test Controller and a second Azure VM running 2013 Load Test Agent.
I am able to telnet from the agent VM to port 6901 on the controller VM.
The agent can connect to the controller but the controller cannot connect to the agent because of following reason: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond 168.62.XX.XX:6910.
I have also created endpoints for each VM to port 6901/TCP.
When I apply the test agent configuration settings, it fails on "Test agent could not connect to the test controller."
I have not been able to get the two communicating successfully.
Make sure that the firewall on the test agent machine is not blocking the connection.
I have been completely unable to work around this issue so far.
I also created a local admin account with the same username and password on both machines.
Unable to connect to the controller on 'controllerVM:6901'.
Exception: Failed to connect to an IPC Port: The system cannot find the file specified.
I added the hostname and IP of each VM to the other's HOSTS file.
