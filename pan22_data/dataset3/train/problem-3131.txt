I will be replacing the Raid card with the same model of 3Ware 9650SE, however, the card ordered most likely will have newer firmware on it.
I don't know about forward compatibilty, but I would note that even though the configuration information is stored on the disk, that doesn't mean that arrays are backward compatible with a controller with older firmware on it.
Since the local stores no longer carried 9650SE's I got a 9750.
I called 3Ware and the lady who answered the phone informed me that the array configuration was stored on the drives and that plugging the old drives into a new (either identical or same line) card should just work.
I am happy to report that things indeed 'just worked'.
Then throw in the new Raid Card, check the firmware version (not letting it post).
My plan is to update the firmware/driver on the current setup (which is still booting) and verify that everything works..
I managed to backup all the data to a very large drive.
I discovered that while testing three separate 9650se controllers to ensure interoperability.
The controller with the old firmware will not recognize the metadata on disk arrays formatted with the newer firmware.
Just make sure to verify your backup and do some test restores to make sure things are good to go there.
I can't imagine that a different firmware on a new 9650SE will be different.
Having said that: Making a backup before doing anything is certainly the safest way.
And update to newest firmware if needed via Java management utility on the card?
We have a server running an old firmware version and driver (just took this position) on the 3Ware 9650SE Raid Controller... We have been having issues with the server and seemed to have narrowed it down to the Raid Card...
