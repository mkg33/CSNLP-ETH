This is very useful if your system is running on (e.g.)
First: You're running Unix (and presumably NTP): Make sure you have set your system's BIOS/Hardware clock to UTC.
You don't want cron still running in US/Eastern time when you've changed the machine's timezone to Hawaii.
Third: If you user account still has a messed-up idea of the time zone something is probably setting the TZ environment variable -- double-check your .profile and shell rc files.
Generally I suggest rebooting - this ensures every part of the OS has been kicked in the head and understands what has happened.
The absolute last thing you need is your hardware (BIOS) clock fighting with Unix over whose timezone is right and when daylight saving time begins/ends.
Second: When you change the system-wide time zone you sometimes need to log out and log back in again for the system to understand what happened.
US/Eastern time and you have users logging in from Japan - People like the time their system reports to match the clock on their wall :)
Three Simple Rules for Not Going Insane When Dealing With Time:
Unix doesn't assume that every user on the system is in the local time zone, so it lets you override on a per-user (or per-shell) level.
Setting your hardware clock to UTC makes life much easier.
