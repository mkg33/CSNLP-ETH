My errors occurred when I made it 2048 but when I changed it back, PHPStorm worked again.
Oracle JVM requires a single chunk of continuous memory (more or less equal to the sum of Xmx and XX:MaxPermSize parameters values) to initialize.
On Windows systems 32-bit java can only allocate up to 2 Gb.
Most probably the issue is that JVM can't allocate the requested heap on start.
My errors occurred just after I changed the Xmx value from 1024 to 2048.
And any libraries that inject themselves into process memory will reduce this solid block.
the folder "admin" above could be a different folder in your case, so I highly recommend you check it or you may not find the .IntelliJIdea2017.3 folder in it.
I couldn't make the program run anymore, even after restarting the PC.
What worked for me was updating the phpstorm.exe.vmoptions file in the C:\Users\.PhpStorm2016.3 directory.
What worked for me was updating the phpstorm.exe.vmoptions file, located in the C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\PhpStorm 10.0.4\bin folder.
For your case, you will have to dig in to the correct folder i.e.
I am using PhpStorm2017.3 and to make it work, I had to delete the folder .IntelliJIdea2017.3 from the following location:
You need changing PhpStorm.exe.vmoptions file accordingly
Please try reducing it to 1024m or 750m, for example - does it work?
There was some unknown issue with Java on the system so I downloaded the Dev Kit from here after uninstalling phpstorm, and then installed phpstorm and the 64-bit version works as it should.
Then I changed the Xmx value back to 1024 and restarted the PC.
So it seems that Xmx value you have set is just too much for 32-bit JVM.
