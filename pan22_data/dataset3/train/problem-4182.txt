So as a bonus it seems that Visual Studio is good at idling at least ;).
Is 4GB enough, or will I see a noticeable improvement with 6 or 8 or whatever...
Given that laptop RAM not free, how much RAM would actually make a difference to my normal dev environment - VisualStudio running in a couple of instances, Firefox with umpty tabs open, perhaps one or two other apps running as well?
In the year 2018, Visual Studio is still running in a 32bit process.
I am probably going to migrate my work laptop (WinXP, ThinkPad T61) to Windows7 soon, and want to take the opportunity to upgrade to a 64bit OS and use the infinite amounts of RAM this will allow :)
Running more instances should behave better (if memory usage is high per instance).
This means that it can use roughly 4 GB of RAM memory, maybe a little less.
More then 4GB only makes sense if you are planning to run 2 or more Virtual Machines and Visual Studio at the same time.
The other Visual Studio instance is lying around at only 176,8 MB of RAM (idling, but a very very large solution).
But as you can see - a single instance of Visual Studio won't really eat more memory.
I'm running Windows 10 64bit on a Macbook Pro with 32 GB of ram.
Will I see much difference in upgrading from 32bit XP and 2GB RAM, and if so where is the cut off point?
I've used two machines, on with 4GB and one with 8GB - Couldn't tell the difference between them and I was doing things pretty similar to you.
Just for reference, as you can see in the picture below, Visual Studio is buzzying around 3,5 GB RAM (I just rebuilt this solution to eat more memory for the picture.
If 8GB is not that much more - it could be worth investing now otherwise 4GB should be plenty.
So anything above 3GB wont help a single instance.
