I mean, I can create filters so that LittleSnitch will not send traffic to specific websites like Google Analytics etc.
I have recently switched from MAC to Windows Vista.
There are WebControl section in settings where you can tune interaction with specific websites.
I do realize that this isn't as good or universal as what LittleSnitch does, but I hate adding really low level things that affect TCP/IP.
You can also try Adblock which runs on Mozilla and Chrome as well.
I used to have LittleSnitch on Mac where I can create filters and disable browsing to other websites.
However, I cannot find a similar software on Windows.
I tried Zone Alarm firewall, but it doesn't let you add filters to stop traffic to specific websites.
There are Ghostery plugins for Mozilla and Chrome and IE as well.
If it's specific tracking websites, you may want to look at Ghostery.
Obviously this only works on users that install these plugins.
Are there any software available on windows which are similar to LittleSnitch?
You can list all elements on a page, and block any element specifically, or by simple expressions.
