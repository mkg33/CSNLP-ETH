Shove that into a scheduled task and run it every few minutes would probably cover you.
IMHO, this is a better option then scheduling a batch file to stop and restart the service on a schedule.
A nice page for troubleshouting printer drivers can be found here: How to clean up printer drivers.
To add my two cents: zsr.dll is not a Windows dll file so it has to be a printer driver dll (most likely HP).
Faulting application spoolsv.exe, version 5.2.3790.0, faulting module ZSR.DLL, version 6.20.1625.0, fault address 0x0001f979.
Personally I would be looking at which print driver installed the zsr.dll and remove / reinstall it.
Try to uninstall the printer driver and reinstall the latest one from the vendor.
My advice is to update the printer drivers on the server and set the Recovery options on the sevrice to restart the service on failure.
I have set it to "Restart the Service" on the First/Second/Subsequent Failures on the Properties/Recovery tab, but it does not restart.
You can schedule a simple vbs script like this one to restart periodically the Spooler service on the local computer if needed.
But this is just a workaround for your problem, you may check all the drivers to see if they are up to date.
I have a windows server 2003 with a few printers, and once in a while the Print Spooler service crashes with this message in the event viewer:
Obviously it would be nice to prevent this entirely, but until then, I would like it restart automatically.
