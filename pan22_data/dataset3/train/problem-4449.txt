Generally the VOIP traffic can be broken down into 2 parts... Control traffic and Audio Stream traffic.
This may not be how Avaya specifically does it, but in plain vanilla VoIP you should see SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) going back and forth at around port 5060 to exchange information such as Message Waiting Indicator, Phone Registrations, and the like.
The audio packets won't give you a whole lot to look at in Wireshark since it's just encoded audio data.
Edit: By the way, you shouldn't necessarily have to break out Wireshark to troubleshoot VoIP.
You probably also want to learn about Quality of Service (QoS), as this will become important when VoIP-ing over congested lines.
Most often the VoIP server or endpoint should give you some troubleshooting information or debug diagnostics as things are happening that are way more valuable (and make a lot more sense) than Wireshark data.
Try "Voice over IP Fundamentals" by Jonathan Davidson, James Peters, Manoj Bhatia, Satish Kalidindi, Sudipto Mukherjee.
When you place a call, you should also see SIP traffic setting up the call and exchanging the information for the Audio Streams to begin transmitting.
