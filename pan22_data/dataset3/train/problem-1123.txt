Better asked at http://www.serverfault.com if you run into problems with that one though.
I've searched for answers a couple of hours now, but it's a dead end.
I would like to run commands with a different user in PHP.
Of course, you could also use simple sudo functionality if it's just one or 2 commands instead of the whole site needing a different user.
Most people says it's impossible and others don't know.
I've been looking for an answer for this for a long time now and I finally got one.
With SuExec you could do it, even easier is suphp, which has a package in Debian, so I assume Ubuntu will have it too.
User presses a button that starts a screen running CS Source server.
I would like to be able to run PHP commands, in system-function exec or whatever, but with a different user then www-data.
And then add what user and group to run the virtual host in your virtual host file:

Also I don't know what function to use (system, exec or other) so some tips here as well could be usefull.
