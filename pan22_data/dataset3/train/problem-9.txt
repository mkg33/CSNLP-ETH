I am not aware of any tools which attempt to make a better estimate than this, but it is theoretically feasible to do a bit better with the new diagnostics available in /proc in recent kernels.
The other to look at is RES which tells you the amount of space in resident memory.
The other is RSS, or "resident set size", which is the amount of memory in pages which are currently resident.
This does NOT necessarily mean that it's allocated or in use, but simply available should the process request it.
There are two columns to pay attention to: VIRT and RES.
From what little I've searched, it looks like showing swap IN USE isn't possible.
There are two counts per process, which are (vaguely) useful.
When the kernel gets a bit short of memory, it tends to discard pages which haven't been used much recently.
However this isn't really the true picture either:
That is, pages which are not backed by any disc file (not mmap'd file-backed pages).
VIRT tells you how much memory has been reserved for the process.
However, there isn't a single process which triggers it, it's just general memory pressure.
These are VSIZE (or vm size) which is the total number of pages that a process has allocated - but this tends to be a big overestimate of how much is actually "used", as it can count pages twice, and count pages not being used at all (mapped but not used).
"swap" is really considered to be "non-resident anonymous pages".
It might choose to discard file-backed pages, or anonymous pages.
Moreover, you can't even measure page usage very accurately.
