Just as long as you keep them out of direct sunlight, you'll be fine.
Unless your fridge is freakishly deep, you won't fit them anyway.
Your server is going to create A LOT more heat than the fridge can cool.
A/C controller server rooms are for hundreds of servers, not three.
Additionally, most rack mounted servers I know are 80cm deep.
Your server will most likely do an emergency thermal shutdown within about 10 minutes of being closed in the fridge, and you risk doing serious damage to the internal server components.
If you've ever been in a server room (which in comparison to a fridge is massive) where the air conditioning is playing up, you will know just how hot it gets and how quickly it gets that hot.
I think you want to stick to airconditioning units: they are designed to deal/work with moving air.
Don't look at the manufacturer to replace all the failed components on warranty terms either.
You do not need any special cooling for just three servers.
Now, you may also want to plug-in a dehumidifier (or a blower that throws hot blows outside) that you run every time you open and then close the fridge and before starting the fridge.
I live in Australia where the amient temperature can get up to 40 celcius easilly on a summers day  - you'll be fine with just three servers.
