If you skip three phase, at least get 220v service for your rack.
What I typically do for multiple servers, especially since the servers have dual redundant power supplies is we wire the rack to have two single phase 20A or 30A power feeds, which is sufficient to run at least 4 of my servers nominally (yours may be differnet).
Assuming you are using 120V, if your outlets are all on 20 amp breakers (vs 15 amp) then you should be able to handle at least one server on each breaker at your mentioned peak load.
I have only personally seen 3phase used for loads such as blade servers, which need that much power within a single rack.
From my experience, if 3 phase is available for rack equipment and you have a 3 phase PDU, it allows you to put higher loads into each rack.
I seriously recommend you consult an electrician, not sys admins, for this kind of information.
If you have open spots on the panel for more breakers (and the panel can support it), I would hire an electrician to add more outlets on separate breakers to where you want to run your servers and plug them in accordingly.
most equipment will run on it out of the box, and again, you will see a drop in your electric bill.
Nevertheless, for what you are describing there is no reason to go with 3 phase.
Three phase power is never necessary, but you will see a 3-4% drop in your electric bill should you convert over.
I think an average office should be able to cope with your power needs as long as you have enough circuits available.
Even smallish building air conditioners can run single phase 208V, so it really depends on your office building.
