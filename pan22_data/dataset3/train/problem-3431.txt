Put it in your .emacs (or an .el file, and (load-file "/path/to/your.el")).
Is there any way I can get that to point to another directory like, say, my projects directory on the Desktop?
I'm using Emacs on Windows XP and whenever I type in "~/" it automatically replaces that with a directory, in my case its "C:/Documents and Settings//Application Data".
The ~ seems to be handled by expand-file-name, and it does not mention any way to change how it is expanded.
On the other hand, you could probably set your shortcut to start emacs to start in your chosen directory, allowing you to save and load files without specifying a path.
You could specify a new value for HOME, but that might confuse other things that use HOME as a place to store files (customize, etc.
that might want to read from or write to files under HOME).
~ is a very old and well established synonym for 'the user's home directory' and that logic is probably buried deep inside emacs and unlikely to change unless you're willing to rebuild it from source after finding the appropriate code and changing it.
Every time I need to make a new file there I have to C-x C-f + the full path, and although tab completion makes it faster than it'd normally be, it'd be nice to have that one directory bound to something like "~/" for easy access.
As an experiment, I wrote up some advice to find-file that temporarily changes the value of HOME.
The idea is to minimize the amount of time where the alternate value is active.
I can not test it on Windows, but the only thing that is platform specific is the use of HOME, but I think Emacs converts the Windows equivalent (a combination of several environment variables?)
