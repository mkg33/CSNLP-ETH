Is this a surprising discrepancy, or is it normal for /etc/group to list only members where the group is secondary?
When I look at /etc/group, filesender_1 is not there:
Typically, when a user is created without specifying a group with -g or --gid, the default behavior is to set their primary group as their username, and this gid is not placed in the /etc/group file.
There exists a program called members you can install on most linux distros that lists the actual members of a group whether it is their primary group or a supplementary group.
Hence files and directories created by the user joe will have ownership joe:joe.
on a group will show users who are members, either primary or supplementary, of groupname.
When I look at /etc/passwd, the group id for valid_senders is listed for filesender_1 ...
... so I know valid_senders is the primary group for filesender_1.
I want to verify that the user account filesender_1 is a member of the group valid_senders.
Programs aren't supposed to read /etc/group or /etc/passwd directly, they are supposed to use the system calls.
If you add the user joe to group 'students', then running
All this has been true for at least 20 years now, and probably much longer.
I read this as "production_1 is the only member of the group valid_senders, whose group id is 12345."
I've seen it so many times I stopped looking at the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files and instead started looking at group memberships the way they should be looked at: getent group <groupname> and groups <username>.
Generally speaking, system administrators should add the user to their primary group's member list in /etc/group because the getpwent() family of system calls will remove duplicates when called.
But you will not find group 'joe' in the /etc/group file.
will show joe in the list of users in group students.
