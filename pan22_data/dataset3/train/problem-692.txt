Is there anyone who know how I change that value easily without modification of kernel?
But the problem is that they cannot reach to a full link bandwidth.
In my math, the completion time of the flows is less than 1 second.
In other words, they are finished at slow start phase before getting a full link bandwidth.
Provided that your Linux kernel is not very ancient, you can increase initial congestion window using command ip, something like this:
This increases default initial congestion window to higher value of 10*MSS (~14KB).
I am looking for disable tcp slow start mechanism for high-speed network.
You might want to play with values higher than this, probably as high as 40.
For more information, read original Google proposal to increase initcwnd and also this article.
In older Linux kernel versions initial congestion window value (initcwnd) was as low as just 2 (2*MSS, or about 3KB), and since 3.0 new default is 10 (about 14KB).
Therefore, I want to increase tcp congestion window size to maximum.
Currently clients send 100MB flows to random servers with non-blocking 1Gbps link.
