For that use a small sample of data and check whether the result is correct.
First you need to verify that your implementation of the algorithm is accurate.
To do that define null hypothesis and try to reject the null hypothesis with a significant confidence level.
But using a programming language like R will be more easier to implement.
Once the implementation is verified, you need to verify that there is a significant relationship among the variables that you try to predict.
How can I test that the first happened, rather than the second?
Now, there are two possible things that could lead to that:
The only thing I could think of was to somehow generate a small, synthetic data set with the property that I want to test and run the analysis on it as a unit test.
I get some result, stating, for example, that property X is increasing over time.
At this stage the sample doesn't need to be representative of the population.
A step-wise debugger, even if one exists, won't help, since intermediate results can still consist of millions of lines.
There might be unit test frameworks for your SQL distribution.
I've came across the following problem, that I recon is rather typical.
