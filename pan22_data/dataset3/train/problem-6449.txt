Sniffing the traffic wouldn't be a bad idea either.
It doesn't appear in the standard list of Exchange ports.
That port is in the range that it could be used by RPC communication to your mailbox server from the client trying to initiate a direct connection to the mailbox server.
We also use RPC/https - but this isn't relevant as far as I know, as I assume this is just using 443.
We are using Riverbed to compress traffic between the sites - but this isn't a Riverbed port either - I'm seeing some port 7830 (Riverbed MAPI) traffic but nothing is in their documentation for this port.
Wireshark is your friend, especially if you have a switch that can port mirror.
Even though you have set up on the server Outlook anywhere (RPC/HTTPS) the client doesn't always behave right (outlook 2010 I am looking at you)
If people complain then your RPC/HTTPS configuration isn't correct on the clients.
I'm seeing a lot of traffic going to my Exchange 2003 server from client machines on TCP port 1499.
(The reason they are traversing the firewall is because the clients are at remote site connected via site-to-site VPN.)
(Have googled it, but it comes back as Federico Heinz Consultora - no idea what that is!)
