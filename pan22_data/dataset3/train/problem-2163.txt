Although the class is extremely simple, it wouldn't hurt giving them proper names like operand, operator, etc.
This task can also be done by using functions or by creating utility class.
For me code is: readable, well documented, easy to use.

First of all I have to notice that your code is not object-oriented, because it is not manipulating objects.
Variables has a proper names, comments are everywhere :) Good luck in learning!
For this task it is natural for me to use static methods, so the code will look like this:
