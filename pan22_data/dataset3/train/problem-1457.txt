Reformatting them as MacOS partitions made it possible to remove them afterwards.
Using OSX in virtualbox, on a virtualbox host, and I changed the dynamic disk size, but OSX wouldn't allow me to resize the partition (with the error in the original question)
I had this problem when trying to remove some linux partitions from the disk.
If you start the GParted live cd: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/
Not necessarily a useful answer, but I fixed this problem in Yosemite by using the Repair disk option in Disk Utility.
Previously I had been attempting to format it to use an Apple Partition Map after which I kept getting the described error message when I attempted to split the space into two partitions.
I was able to fix this issue by  resetting the NVRAM (command+option+p+r at boot).
Perhaps a simple answer: I fixed this by using Disk Utility, erasing the drive and reformatting it to Mac OS Extended (Journaled), selecting the GUID Partition Map as the scheme.
Once that had completed, I was then able to partition the drive successfully.
On your system it will automatically detect and fix this issue.
