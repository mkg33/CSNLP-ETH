The easiest thing to do, would be to turn off the webcam prior to getting up and walking away.
Skype doesn't have a way to tell whether you are in front of the webcam or not, it can only detect if the webcam is enabled or disabled.
Then you would have to manually start the screen saver each time you got up and want it to start using a screen saver.
Is there any way to make my screensaver come on when my webcam is open in Skype?
I can't think of a way to do this, because when the webcam is enabled the computer is not in an idle mode since it's receiving input from a peripheral device.
The screensaver will work when my webcam is not being used.
If you did do this, and say you set the screensaver to come on after 30 minutes, the screen saver would start every 30 minutes if you didn't have some sort of input to the PC (mouse movement, volume adjustment, etc).
You could make a shortcut on your desktop to start the screensaver.
However, I believe the webcam would still continue to run, so the other person could see everything, but from your point of view it would show your screensaver.
