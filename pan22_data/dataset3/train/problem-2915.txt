There's no need for their existence to turn you into a reboot-obsessed user, however.
To find out where most of your disk space is going (and if temporary files are even a culprit) I suggest using a program such as OmniDiskSweeper or GrandPerspective to tell you where all the large files are.
They are reclaimed (deleted) upon reboot and will eventually get re-created as you use your Mac.
These locations should be automatically cleared out regularly either through the daily, weekly and monthly "cron" scripts and/or a restart so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
If it suddenly has lots more free space, this is due to the ever-expanding swap files.
It's a good thing when your Mac swaps unused memory out to disk.
Your specific Cache and Temporary folders can be found by running the command echo $TMPDIR and/or usr/bin/getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR
The one big exception is Safari's Thumbnail cache does not delete and can be found in your DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR under com.apple.Safari.
then reveal that files in finder and delete them if they are not in use anymore
Mac OS X temporary files are stored in /tmp and /private/var/folders.
I use Disk Inventory X to find what actually eats my space.
I got a bundled copy of AppZapper with a MacHeist - recommended.
JDiskreport - Free Java Utility will show you where all your space has gone - also recommended
to run these scripts and/or clear your caches and temp files.
You can use tools such as Onyx, Cocktail, Leopard Cache Cleaner, etc.
