sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext/
I'm looking for some utility or hack to disable completely the internal keyboard and to re-enable it either using the mouse or using some key combination.
The external keyboard still works fine, and I was able to disable, then reenable my internal keyboard.
My cat has a nasty habit of jumping over my MBP and causing keystrokes that mess up things (anywhere from stopping a playing video to deleting a file).
To re-enable the internal keyboard of a portable Mac:
this app is free, locks keyboard, n doesn't shut off screen (you can continue to FaceTime / Skype, or watch a movie)!!
To disable the internal keyboard of a portable Mac:
sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext/
Try the free software CatNip, which claims to detect cat-like typing and locks the keyboard in response.
When I initially disable the internal keyboard, terminal notifies me that:
There are a couple 3rd party programs that do similar things.. or just get a stand that will put your MBP at an angle so the cat doesn't jump on it..
The internal keyboard is then disabled, external keyboards will still work.
