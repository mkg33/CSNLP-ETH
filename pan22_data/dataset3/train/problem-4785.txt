Can the old hard drive still be used after I reformat it?
Or should I just make the exact same partitions with the new disk and copy and paste everything manually?
No method is safe except restoring from a backup made before drive failure began.
However, there are tools which will try to read the data on bad sectors and move it to good sectors.
When you restore, you choose what drive letter to restore to, which can be the same, or different, than what you now have.
If I do this, what are the risks of the having the bad sectors replicated onto the new drive?
If I do this, can windows restore the exact clone of my old drive with all the partition letters?
You may be able to get good data using these methods before you clone, backup-restore, or copy drive-to-drive.
See Does cloning a hard drive also copy over errors like bad sectors?
Will this decrease the longevity of the new drive?
Because of their compressed nature, an error is not as severe as if you were trying to recover a database.
See https://hetmanrecovery.com/recovery_news/how-to-restore-broken-sectors-and-fix-hdd-errors.htm and https://www.disk-partition.com/windows-10/bad-sector-repair-windows-10.html , look for other tools, then make a decision on what that data's worth to you as to what you want to spend in money and time to try recovery.
The Windows 7 backup tool works on a drive letter basis, copying what it finds in a partition which is mapped to a drive letter; it does not copy the entire disk's partitions at once, and is not a cloning tool.
Or should I use Windows 7 backup tool to backup the entire hard disk to the new one and restore it?
Haven't dealt with this problem in a long time, but it has worked in the past.
If you clone-copy the drive, data on bad sectors will not be copied; you will end up with blank sectors on the new drive.
Should I just clone the old hard disk onto the new one?
SuperUser.com does not deal in 'should', just 'can/cannot'.
