One does not have arbitrary systems added to a work network.
Samba relies on fixed, known ports and isn't really designed for the sort of scenario you're trying to work with.
Lets start with "Work Network Admin refuses to give me a 2nd IP address".
LPchip's answer covers why it dosen't work for most part.
Also consider that your two systems are in a separate network segment and unless routing is set up explicitly, systems outside your subnet can't see them.
There's a few issues in play here, many of which are well, not technical.
The reason for this is securing the network and even having a second router is a horrible horrible thing in most work environments.
The easy solution really is to be nice to your admin, bribe him with a sixpack of whatever beverage of choice and ask him how you can have your needs met without breaking the network.
And of course, if you showed the same level of hostility towards the network admin as you did in the original version of the question, well, he might be disinclined to explain it to you.
In many workplaces doing so without authorisation will likely lead to you very quickly having to put all your personal belongings in a box and walking out of here.
Incidentally the person who could set this up is your network admin.
If adding a router without any auth to the wall socket works then simply adding a switch should work by the sounds of things, unless you did MAC spoofing as part of the process.
I'd also consider checking the company policy since its no use getting your way if you no longer have a job.
