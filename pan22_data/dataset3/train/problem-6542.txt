Users should use tools like Seagate SeaTools(http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/) to read the number of power on hours on any drive they purchase that is not factory sealed.
For anyone trying to figure out what the terms new pull and new bulk mean in terms of disk drives (and other computer components), please see this link: http://www.istoragenetworks.com/avoid-bulk.php
System pull means it has been taken out of a previously used system, but was tested and working.
Production on the Seagate Cheetah 15K.5 U320 line of drives ended in December of 2011.
“Bulk pack” and “ new pull” merchandise are either factory rejected units or plain old used units that ended up in the hands of a broker that does not have the tools to properly test the equipment.
How often do you think users buy servers / workstations / SANs ,yank out all the components without using them, and post them for sale?
Production of the Cheetah 10K.7 line of drives ended in 2007.
New pull means it was taken out of a system that was never used.
Just about all U320 and U160 SCSI drives are out of production as of 2012.
Shamefully, we have found that just about every disk drive we have purchased (advertised as a new pull or new bulk) had thousands of power on hours recorded in the log pages.
(Side note: I work for iStorage Networks, and the majority of products we sell are end of life disk drives.)
"Gnoupi" hit the nail right on when he said "new pull" is "shiesty term created by the industry."
Disk drive manufacturers (and system builders such as HP, IBM, SUN/Oracle) do not sell equipment as bulk.
