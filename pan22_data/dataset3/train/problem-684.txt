Or do I have to add the mapping in the zone editor at godaddy.com?
If you just added the NS from hostvirtual without removing the GoDaddy ones you will need to change GoDaddy as well.
You point your virtualhosting name server from godady.That means you should use virtualhosting name servers' interface to create your dns records.
In the godaddy dns manager interface I've added the nameservers ns1.hostvirtual.com and ns2.hostvirtual.com.
Can you elaborate exactly what problem you are facing in above setup so that we can respond accordingly.
Shortly what you did was right, you need to keep your dns records at your hosting company's site.
I've registered a domain at godaddy.com and created a virtual linux server at hostvirtual.com.
Alternatively, you could have left just the name servers at GoDaddy and added an A record through their interface.
If you removed the GoDaddy name servers, the entries there would be irrelevant.
I want to check if I've configured things correctly.
At hostvirtual.com they have a dns zone editor where I've added an A record that maps the hostname of the virtual machine to its ip address.
As I believe it now stands, you have two sets, so you need to update both places.
Some domain registrar are also provides name server (such as name cheap) and you don't need to point any external nameserver but just use their servers to create dns records.
