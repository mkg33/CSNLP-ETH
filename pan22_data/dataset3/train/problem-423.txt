In either case, I would like the former employee's personal email address to be removed.
We need to remove his personal email address and replace it with a new email address.
I believe that if you create multiple certs from the same letsencrypt client instance, it reuses the email address stored in regr.json, at least for expiry alert emails.
If the certificate was signed, there is no way to update it.
What steps do I need to take to accomplish this (if my understanding of the process is incorrect, kindly point me to the right direction).
/etc/letsencrypt/accounts/acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory/{someKindOfHash}/regr.json

There is also a contact email address stored by the python letsencrypt client under:
The email address used as the admin email when we started using let's encrypt needs to be modified (a former employee used his personal email address as the admin email and he is no longer with the firm).
Because Let's Encrypt is a certificate authority, I'm guessing you want to update the data (an email) within your certificate.
What steps need to be taken to get that modified (we can get the former employee to confirm this).
