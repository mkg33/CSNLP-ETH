You need /Q to stop rmdir asking you if you're sure or not.
Here's a more off the wall suggestion if you're regularly doing this and the circumstances are right.
It bypasses the Trash and is typically much faster.
You should be careful and check the command you type twice, so as not to accidentally delete something really important.
There are tools that can help you understand which process locks the file, but it's a different story from this one.
I usually delete huge directories from the command line.
However, I have used this technique when dealing with very large SDKs which get updated frequently.
If some files are currently open by some process, they and the directories they contain naturally won't be deleted.
Maybe deactivating the trash can before you start could be helpful.
Store your directory in a separate disk partition.
There are obvious limitations such as having fixed partition sizes unless you use/trust something like Partition Magic.
The benefit is that you can very quickly (almost instantly) destroy and recreate partitions.
