Make sure that all of your connections are using SSL.
What can I do to ensure that nobody can sniff my passwords or my other browsing activity?
For example use https://gmail.com instead of http://gmail.com.
I frequently need to access secure resources (gmail, banking, remote desktop, etc) while on public wifi hotspots.
In little things, you can force GMail to use secured connection :
Despite being reasonably common practise this went pretty much unused at my University.
One more thing to be aware of - certain public WiFi locations get you to pay by credit card before you can access the internet.
If you're using a public wifi at a business or educational institution you are affiliated with, it's likely they will also provide a VPN server for you to login to with your network credentials.
When you try and browse to the internet you are re-directed to a page where you can enter credit card details and then gain access to the internet.
Beware that some scammers have actually caught onto this and created dummy hotspots (pretending to be a hotel or whatever) to collect credit card information.
