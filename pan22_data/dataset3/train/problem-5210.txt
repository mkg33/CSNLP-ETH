2) If microsoft IS planning a native C# compiler, then can C# replace C++ as the industry standard in AAA vedio games?
If you're interested in mono or ahead-of-time compilation, I recommended reading: http://tirania.org/slides/AltDevConf-2012-Mono.pdf
Both Mono and Microsoft's implementation will JIT-compile C# to native code at runtime as well.
tl;dr: C# is viable to use today in AAA titles, but languages replace each other at a glacial pace which is quite difficult to predict or speculate on in a worthwhile manner.
1) Is microsoft planning to release a native C# compiler sharing the backend code generator with the C++ compiler?
you can't just optimize out, because code might depend on them.
Other than Indie game development, C# is also used for in house tool development at large studios.
2) C# is already being used in AAA titles such as The Sims 3, including on consoles.
1) Regardless of whether or not Microsoft is planning to, Mono already has an "Ahead of Time" (AOT) compilation option, converting C# to native code at compile time.
C# is unlikely to outright "replace" C++: There's no practical reason to throw out existing codebases if they work well to rewrite them in C#.
2) Even if they do release such a thing (unlikely), it still would generate far less efficient code than pure C++, because it includes many safeguards, generalizations, etc.
There's still plenty of C floating around which hasn't been replaced with C++ to this day, and a lot of C with a minor splattering of C++ as existing code has been updated and modernized as needed, rather than replaced wholesale.
Also you most likely wouldn't gain any significant performance boost, because what you describe is essentially what is done at runtime anyway (to some extend).
