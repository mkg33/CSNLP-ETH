I faintly remember there was some XML file in the past versions but it seems that have changed over time.
I use several search engines in my firefox, each with some 1-3 letter shortcut such as "w" for wikipedia or "m" for google maps.
I migrated to Brave Browser recently which provides far better customization for search engines than Firefox.
I used the method described by dong jy and it works very well!
I need to slightly adjust the URL of one of the seach engines.
An easy way for editing mozlz4 files like the search.json.mozlz4 file is using the mozlz4-edit FireFox Addon
In case anyone is looking for the configuration file in Windows, it's located at C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[xxxxxxxx].default\search.json.mozlz4.
In Ubuntu 16, firefox 58, the configuration file is compressed into .mozlz4 format and located in /home/[user]/.mozilla/firefox/[xxxxxxxx].default named as search.json.mozlz4.
So the file path is /home/[user]/.mozilla/firefox/[xxxxxxxx].default/search.json.mozlz4.
So I need to know where they are saved and how to edit them.
Your can decompress and compress this file with python lz4 library.
