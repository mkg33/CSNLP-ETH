Each one recognizes the certificate and stablishes a secure connection.
Next, I post two nginx vHosts configuration only for one site www.theenergyofchange.com , the HTTP and HTTPS.
The HTTPS conection is made by a NGINX server which after securing the connection, makes a proxy_pass to an Apache machine which serves the website content.
First, he ran into the problem of always receiving the same certificate (laenergiadelcambio.com) for both websites.
I've taken a task left by another worker who left on vacation.
I've been strugling with this issue and I seem to be running into a dead end here without knowing what to do next...
He was trying to setup SSL certificates for two diferent websites www.laenergiadelcambio.com and www.theenergyofchange.com.
The other site is identical except for the server_names
And after some reading we found that it was because of our OS (Centos 5.5) lacking TLS SNI support (Server Name Indication) due to an old version of openssl (0.9.8e).
These are thawte certificates for a single domain.
Note: we are making these changes in a test enviroment, so the changes to the NGINX URL's vHosts files are not public yet.
Firefox complains about this: (Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)
So.. what am I missing here that makes some browsers secure the connection and others not trust the certificate issuer?
We decided to assign a unique IP for listening in each server block as told in the NGINX Documentation.
