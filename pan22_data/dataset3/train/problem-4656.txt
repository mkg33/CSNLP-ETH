We rolled out a DMS a year ago where I work and we are still making tweaks to document types, workflows, and training users.
I think 95% of the users preferred the old directory structure to what we have now.
You mentioned that for the most part your existing directory structure is working.
I have used SharePoint extensively over the past 18 months in several small teams, and it has worked wonderfully.
I'm not saying that a DMS can't work if used for the right tasks, is setup correctly, and all the users understand how to use it.
That obviously doesn't work for everything, but a good file structure (maintained in a VCS mostly) is enough for what's left.
It also comes with a full text search that helps you find documents when you can't remember what you tagged it.
The trap is that technology will solve all our problems...but in reality it doesn't work out that way.
Document management systems in my experience almost always causes users more issues than they solve.
Maybe Alfresco or Maarch is the type of solution you're looking for.
DMS systems are a bit of garbage in garbage out problem and when users don't understand what a tag or can't figure out what document type a document is you get a lot more garbage than you think.
In most cases this approach will go over better with users and is more effective.
It is easy to use and integrates well with Microsof OFfice and WordPerfect.
We keep moving everything out of files and into our wiki (Atlassian Confluence), the the MS Word import module its taken everything we have thrown at it.
Can your issues be address by training or small tweaks to your existing solution?
It even includes both its own workflow system, and Windows Workflow Foundation.
