1 is probably the best if you have plenty of time.
If you have the money, invest in yourself: buy a drawing tablet.

3 is the quickest by far, but it isn't great because you have to make do with what you find.
It gives you an advantage for any future projects you do, and gives you a wider skillset.
The Wacom Bamboo tablets are "entry-level" consumer models with slightly less accuracy, but they start at $69 (Wacom store; you want one with a pen, not the $49 touch model) and would be just great.
So if you are able to somewhat draw things by hand, try getting a tablet - it won't improve your art skills unless you work at it but it can at least make it easier for you to make crappy programmer art.
If it makes enough money you will be able to hire a team of professional artists to revamp it.
Personally, I am a terrible artist, I just can't make good graphics, but it sure didn't help that I was stuck trying to do things with my mouse, sloppily drawing lines or clicking pixel-by-pixel.
If the game is good enough and web-based, you can release it without "proper" graphics and no-one will complain.
I'm interested in both 2d and 3d computer generated graphics techniques, as well as free graphics repositories.
2 is better if you need them to be higher quality, but exactly what you want.
May take a while to find someone, without paying them.
But you might find the users still prefer the original version.
Are there resources for programmers with little to no graphics design talent, but still want to make good-enough graphics for their own programs?
I can at least roughly sketch something that works, and my Wacom Intuos4 is amazing for that (but surely overkill if you ask a professional).
