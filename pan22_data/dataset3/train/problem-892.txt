Note that I do not want to use a normal hash function as these are not suitable for password.
This is why the hashing must be done on the server, so that without prior knowledge of the password it is impossible to log in.
One could steal the database, read the hash and send that along with the username and still get an access.
However, I cannot find any way to achieve this with a PAM module so that vsftpd will use it for logins.
How to perform user authentication with serverside password hash for vsftpd ?
Traditionally, when the client logs in, it sends the credentials (username+pw) without any further processing.
This means that either the client or the server hashes the password and then the credentials are checked for a match.
The server then checks if an entry exists in its user database that matches the supplied credentials.
Do I have to code my own PAM module or do I have to generate htpasswd hashes on demand ?
However, if the client does the hashing, it effectively becomes useless.
To render password recovery harder in case of database breach, the password is stored in its hashed form.
Because the hashed password is now used as the password.
