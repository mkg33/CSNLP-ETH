The big storage vendors (EMC, NetApp et al) limit their RAID group sizes to somewhat around 20 spindles (depends on disk model).
This is exactly the use case for a volume manager.
Many things need to be considered how to address a solution to your problem.
As you did not mention anything specific in terms of requirements (throughput,  IOPS/latency,  RAID rebuild time - just to name a few important parameters) I'd just answer regarding the shelf/LVM/RAID group size.
It makes however perfectly sense to use LVM to stripe/concatenate your RAID6 LUNs when you add storage as you need to expand.
As a general rule you should try to keep your RAID6 LUNs not overly big in terms of number of disks - it doesn't make any sense to have RAID LUNs with >>20 disks as you're facing horribly long rebuild times.
I can't comment on the performance side of things since you didn't explain anything about your IO patters and requirements.
But these guys know their RAID controllers, characteristics and rebuild times very well and their RAID implementations are not your run of the mill md(1) RAIDs or cheap PCI-E HBAs.
