Amazon's rented server, EC2, is $0.10/hour, which is $72/month.
Amazon S3 could also be very cheap for hosting if the file collection is small and infrequently downloaded.
It seems to me power failures and other problems causing downtime are more frequent on do-it-yourself servers than purchased hosting.
Think about it like this:  Are you asking how to get all of what you paid for, or how to get more than you paid for?
I'd recommend cheap paid hosting over S3 if you expect more than a few dozen Gb of traffic per month, because Amazon charges ~US$0.15-0.20/Gb traffic and something similar for storage.
What does it cost if your web site fails at a critical moment?
Is it worth $100 to know it will work when others come calling ?
The old adage 'you get what you pay for' applies to bandwidth / performance.
That is somewhat pricy compared to cheap hosting or even small, decent VPS like Linode.
If so then that justifies using a $100/year hosting account.
If so, thats a good reason for a local server...such as to backup all the other home computers to it or to use as a home media server.
Are you hosting your resume or a sample-of-work portfolio ?
Most hobby or personal home pages are not going to require much bandwidth, so while a big operation like updating the software after a year may slow everyone else down for an hour or a few hours, this won't happen very often.
If your hosting needs are modest, there are free solutions such as Google Sites or Blogger and for developing dynamic applications,  Google App Engine.
You should consider measuring how much bandwidth your server uses under typical or expected use.
