There may be keys where even the Administrator has no permission.
Regrettably, I must admit to learning this from experience.
On an individual basis, it is trivial to take ownership of that key and change permissions so that Administrator (or a user) can modify the key in Regedit or load a .REG file for that key.
Note also that with great power comes great responsibility.
Another application for that purpose was flagged by many AV engines at VirusTotal.
Note that the Owner of the key is TrustedInstaller.
There are applications such as PowerRun that enable you to run the CMD prompt or Regedit as TrustedInastaller, but double-check any download before using it.
It is possible to mangle the Registry sufficiently to require reinstalling Windows.
you've exported an entire hive), then you'll need to run Regedit as user TrustedInstaller.
