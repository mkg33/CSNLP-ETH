The issue comes from formulas, tables or the like.
The equations were no longer images and I successfully edited and saved the document.
I had several hundred pages of statistical equations and multiple pictures.
I have an alternate solution for this bug - not perfect, but in my case I could save the whole document:
Make a new Word-Document and copy and paste the text,formulas in parts step by step.
Turns out they let you insert an .ico as a picture, but after doing so I got the endless save loop.
I had the same problem, while I did not have any functions in my file.
I copied each graph and pasted it as an image, so there is no link to Excel any more.
I wanted to edit my document but it was failing to save all the time, so I saved an unedited version of my file as a Word 1997-2003 document.
I had this issue when I was using a auto-Bibliography with the IEEE style.
Took me a while to find the problem, but after taking out all the icons it saved just fine.
I had copied graphs from Excel to Word, after which Word got this saving loop.
I hope this works for all - I lost roughly a day till I did it right.
It saved, but I'm not sure what will happen if I try to add the bibliography back in.
Change or retype the actual part, if the save loop starts again.
Hopefully that's useful for somebody stumbling across this question in the future.
In this way I could save a big document with formulas etc.
Then, I reopened the newly saved document, selected all and copied it into a new Word 2016 document.
I had to remove the bibliography from the document to get it to save.
I hope it helped and excuse the english-grammar mistakes ;)
