Use properties of a running console window (see context menu of an icon in the left top corner) to change window dimentions.
You should know that there are simpler ways to accomplish what you want than modifying PATH environment variable or installing vim.bat.
Ingo is right about the way vim is called by default, there is just no really good way of doing it on Windows (vim works well on Unix-like systems).
Alternatively, append the Vim installation directory to your (user or system) PATH environment variable (through the Control Panel).
The Vim installer (C:\Program Files\vim\vim74\install.exe) has an option to install vim.bat wrapper scripts into C:\WINDOWS; you can re-execute the installer to add those.
Actually, vifm can, it's cmd.exe that stands in the way.
Sorry, I can't name any, this is kinda a reason why vifm supports Windows.
Alternatively, use something like ConEmu or Console2 instead of cmd.exe to run vifm, those are nice replacements of standard console.
You can quickly check that vifm supports resizing by changing size using :set columns+=1 and set lines+=1 commands.
Vifm is invoking Vim as just vim, and assumes it is accessible through your system's PATH, which does not seem to be the case.
