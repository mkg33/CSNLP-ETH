The output of w just shows the first (actual) username, not root if the user has done su.
To get a list of all people who used su, you can check /var/log/auth (depending on your distro).
You can check which pts'es are still active by checking if the pseudo-terminals are still active with ls /dev/pts (you would have to do this quickly though, because pts'es get re-used).
You can find the modify time of the pts with stat /dev/pts/.
You could also use the modify time of the pseudo-terminal and cross-reference it with the time in the auth.log file.
This should give you a list of user names who are running 'su -' to be root:
If a user does su to another program (shell) it will not display because it is not a login shell.
I want to know which of logged in users currently has root access, i.e.
The main problem here is that you are trying to correlate date which was not designed to be correlated.
You can use ps to check which user is running a su process.
Admittedly, it's not perfect, but I think with some scripting you would be able to get a list of users who su'ed.
You have to get information from several sources and then cross-reference it.
I know I can see the list of logged in users with w or similar commands.
