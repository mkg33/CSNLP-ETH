Another example is $\mathbf{ReachUL}$, the class of languages decidable by nondeterministic log-space Turing machines such that for any input and any configuration, there is at most one sequence of nondeterministic choices leading to that configuration.
A few others; related to $\mathsf{IP} = \mathsf{PSPACE}$, but there are enough of them that weren't mentioned in the OQ that I figured it's worth putting them here:
FWIW, the ostensibly semantic class APP defined in [1] was shown to be syntactic in [2].

One of my favorites is $IND[t(n)] = FO[t(n)]$, where $IND[t(n)]$ is the class of problems decidable with an inductive definition which closes in less than or equal to $t(n)$ iterations and $FO[t(n)]$ are the problems decidable using a first order logic sentence with less than or equal to $t(n)$ iterated quantifier blocks.
