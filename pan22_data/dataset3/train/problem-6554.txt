I'm not sure what this does, and it only lasts a short while, but it has allowed us to recover data from an otherwise unreadable hard drive when no other methods have worked.
Make sure you are logged on as an administrator on the machine you are accessing the drive from.
Then right click the folder you are trying to access and select properties.
Another program along the lines of Photorec is Foremost.
That should bring up the Advanced Security Setting for filename box.
The second is that the user directory has NTFS permissions denying access.
This is in the folder options - way down on the bottom of the list of options.
This sounds like a permissions issue rather than filesystem corruption or hardware failure.
Place a check mark in the Replace Owner on subcontainers and objects box.
just an addendum ... if you go to properties of the folder(s) and you do not see a "security" tab that allows you to change owner, you need to turn off Simple File Sharing.
However - If it is hardware failure - don't laugh - we have had surprising success by putting the hard drive in a bag in the freezer overnight, and re-connecting in the morning.
Windows give the option to encrypt the user directory when setting it up.
This will make your current user owner of the files and allow you to access them.
on xp if "simple file sharing" is on, you can't see the area that allows you to change owner.
Click on the advanced button in the lower right hand corner.
Try right clicking, properties, security, advanced, ownership, and take ownership of this and all sub folders.
