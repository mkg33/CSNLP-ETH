Then select the Live Paint Bucket to fill in any shape with any color
I have never used illustrator before but one simple way of doing this would perhaps save the file and open it in photoshop then fill in the colors that way?
Right click on each one and choose Release Compound Path.
Vector images are usually manipulated using binary operators.
Illustrator is using Vector format; I've never used Illustrator but I know the procedure using Inkscape.

Then you can choose the individual parts of the letter and color each one.
In this case, you're looking for "Difference" (XOR).
First, convert the text to outlines by choosing Type -> Create Outlines.
The Appearance panel (Window > Appearance) lets you add layered fills, strokes and effects, so it's possible to get that effect without converting the text to shapes/Live Paint/whatever.
That should be it - sorry I don't know illustrator to tell you the exact steps.
By changing the z-order and the color of each part, you should be able to get the effect you want.
