So instead i added a filesync task that basically syncs the files on the server withe local folder.
There's some good examples of code on their site, including listing contents of a directory:
Hopefully your C# is pretty decent, so you can loop through the LastWriteTime to identify the most recent written file to the server.
Old code, and @Martin Prikryl probably has a neater way of doing it...
Once you've identified the RemotePath you want to download, you would call the GetFiles method:
At first i did a similar solution as the ones above, but we had some issues with the load not picking up a file if the timing was off for some reason (we needed all the copies on top of the latest).
Obviously you'd then need to put in the SSIS error handling, but I'm hoping you've got this area covered.
There may be other ways to do this, but in my previous job we utilised a WinSCP library through a Script Task to download files from an SFTP.
I had a similar problem where i had to get the latest files from a SFTP.
You can set the SynchronizationCriteria to time in your case.
