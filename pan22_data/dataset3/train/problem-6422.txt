I have a Sager laptop that gets quite a bit of use.
It will recognize the battery but won't see the AC power if plugged in while the battery is in.
The capacity was great up to this point which happened in an instant.
I can power up the laptop without the battery and it works fine.
This seems more like a chip problem in the battery to me, but I'm not sure.
If I plug in the battery while powered up it will claim it's charging it, but it stays at the same percentage.
Ok, I'm sure I will need to replace either my battery or my AC adapter, but would rather not buy one if the other is the problem.
If I was in the process of using it, it would charge just fine and stay On AC power.
If I unplug the power, it will switch over to Battery fine, but I have to power down and unplug the battery to get it back on AC power.
If I left it alone, however(power settings to ONLY turn off the monitor) in either Ubuntu or Windows 7 it decides that it didn't want to use AC power anymore and would just start draining the battery until it died.
I've had dying/dead batteries before but they typically won't hold a full charge anymore but it still winds up to 100% then drops quickly when unplugged.
