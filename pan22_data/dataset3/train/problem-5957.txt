For reference, here's what TechNet has to say about "Add workstations to domain".
In a course about Windows Server administration that I took at the university they told us that a normal user could add 10 computers to a domain.
This is controlled by the "Add workstations to domain" right, which can be found in the security policy under "Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\".
By default, any authenticated user can add up to 10 new computers to the domain.
I can only guess what is happening in your situation, it's either:
In order to add a computer to a Windows domain, your ID needs a few permissions:
My account is not priviledged in any aspect, I'm just a regular user like everyone else.
Is there any way I can find out with my user-level-priviledges?
Over the years however I've added and removed way more than 10 computers (virtual machines included) to the domain without any problems, while some colleagues of mine swear that they can't add any computers.
Check your account and you'll probably find that, somewhere, these permissions (or more) are set.
Typically, this would be changed by the sysadmin when the domain is created in order to restrict this right to a specific group, usually "DOMAIN\Administrators".
