where in size partition11=partition21 and partition12=partition22.
I would also remark that RAID-0 is the most fragile of all RAID types, since a problem with one disk will mean losing both.
Getting the boot-loader to work on this kind of configuration is not that easy, but this article might help:
If you wish to keep the RAID, remember to have good backups as it is likely you will find yourself reformatting the disks a few times while trying.
One would then install OS X as software RAID on partition11+partition21 and Linux on partition12+partition22, so both RAIDs are kept totally separate from each other.
Just an opinion: It would be much easier to break the RAID and give each OS its own disk.
I would think that one will need to partition each of the two disks in exactly the same way, say disk1 partitioned into partition11 and partition12, disk2 partitioned into partition21 and partition22,
This is easier for a hardware RAID where the RAID disk appears as just one disk to both OS, but much harder for software RAID and especially across two very different operating systems.
