SSD from the laptop and plugged it into a PC, then formatted it using windows on a boot-able USB.
I have never used this tool, but I remember seeing a tool to change bios passwords, and I do not know if it will work on your specific bios/motherboard, but it would not hurt to try!
You can download the ISO, use a tool to create a bootable usb using a software like rufus usb creator.
After looking at this article,  It looks like a non conventional bios battery with leads on it.
Once in, windows was able to remove the BIOS password.
It seems I can't post a picture of the board due to only just making this account.
Unfortunately I've hit a wall trying to find the BIOS battery.
In the end I couldn't locate the battery at all - i'm not sure to this day if there even is one, and if there is...it's very well hidden.
I'm currently trying to reset a BIOS password on an old Toshiba Portege z20t to allow me to change the boot order and reformat the laptop with a fresh copy of Windows 10...
Boot into the usb and there are a lot of useful tools.
Alternatively you can try using the tools on Hirens boot cd.
