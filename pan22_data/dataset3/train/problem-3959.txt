Group policy is replicated with the rest of the information that is replicated during a normal AD replication cycle as well as the FRS replication cycle.
In Windows 2003, group policies are replicated with sysvol, which is FRS.
If I have a group policy, and add a group/user/machine etc to that group policy, how long is it until all domain controllers have that change in effect?
This is a Windows 2003 Domain set up with controllers at different geographic locations (Each with a different L3 network).
FRS replicates right away, which means whenever it feels like it.
If the change is something that needs to be replicated right away you can force a manual replication in Sites and Services.

This would give you a maximum time to replication.
I realize it probably depends, but how do I figure out how long it generally takes for my given setup?
Dfsrdiag is the tool of choice for monitoring and testing replication.
Maybe yours are configured to only sync once per day, and sync from you to a server is over 2 steps?
So to check how long it would take to replicate you would need to look at Sites and Services to see what your replication interval is between sites.
Also, is there an event I can check to see if it has a reached a particular domain controller?
I'm in between cycles how long to the next replication) it will take to replicate.
It depends TOTALLY on your setup - if you have various geographical setups, configuration path and times can be configured.
Windows 2003 R2 and later use DFS for sysvol replication.
I am not aware of any way to see how long from now (i.e.
