I don't think you can do this with S3, but you can ban IP addresses that exceed preset limits with CloudFront.
I want to implement few anti-scraping mechanisms like banning IP's which are making too many requests or making requests appearing to be robotic etc.
The AWS service that seems best suited for this job is WAF, the Web Application Firewall.
From the Security Automations section of their documentation:
I understood there's a way to blacklist IP addresses in bucket policy, but is there any dynamic way of implementing this like...
IF a specific IP is making....specific no.of requests per minute....then, ban it for specific time.
I know nothing is fool proof, but I just want to offer them some resistance & make their job difficult.
Just set up CloudFront to serve S3 content and block direct access to S3.
I have a few static web pages hosted on amazon S3 that are very frequently updated.
Your costs may reduce slightly, they may go up slightly, but it shouldn't make a huge difference to your costs.
