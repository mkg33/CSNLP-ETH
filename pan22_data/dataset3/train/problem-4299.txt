After that, click on an empty space in your task bar, and it should be fixed.
And that causes to freeze the highlighting on any icon that is selected from the taskbar.
Okay, so I was playing around with the Start button, and I figured it out: First, right-click any NOT opened program on your task bar, for example, if you don't have Windows Store open, right click on that icon.
The problem is when, for some reason, I accidentally Right-Alt Right-clicked an icon in the taskbar.
I don't know but I think Microsoft is keeping this bug as an evil-eye protection, this is the 4th OS upgrade and the bug still exists.
In case shift + right click does not work (which it did not for me although it used to on Win 7/8), Ctrl + right click worked for me.
Any help is highly appreciate it because this thing is really frustrating.
(opens the Start menu + the context menu for the previously Right-clicked icon).
This problem is not new to me as it occurs when I was using [Windows 7 + Windows 8.1], and Found a solution that worked with the both OSs: (Shift-Right Click).
Right Click on your Taskbar an find Start Task Manager
All you need to do is hover over any un-opened application, make sure it's highlighted, and hold shift and right click ONCE.
I hope that worked for you, because it worked for me.
(nothing will happen, except that icon highlight sticks).
If the Taskbar don't show after a minute, go to File -> Run new task and write Explorer.
I can't find any solution for this in the internet pages.
This might also be the problem that caused the error in the first place as well.
If you want to keep your activity, but don't restart the computer try to restart Windows Explorer.
