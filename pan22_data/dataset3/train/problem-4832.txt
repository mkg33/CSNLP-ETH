Am I missing something, or is there a better way to do this?
This isn't working, and the transparency has nothing to do with it - hyperlinks in the PDF seem only to work on "in line with text" elements.
I had the same problem with Word 2007: when saving as PDF, the hyperlinks on images were not working.
I've got a Word 2010 document that I'm trying to convert to a PDF with "Save As...", preserving hyperlinks.
I am currently experiencing the same issue and the ONLY workaround I've come up with after a couple of hours is to place a text character before and after my image, then insert my hyperlink, then make the text transparent.
You save it as a Macro Enabled Document then convert that to PDF.
I discovered that this problem appeared only for images inserted via drag&drop.
What I'm trying to do is make a "clickmap" image by putting an image on the page and overlaying parts of it with transparent shapes that hyperlink to different URLs.
I tried inserting the same images using insert -> image, then added the web link to the image, then saved to PDF.
