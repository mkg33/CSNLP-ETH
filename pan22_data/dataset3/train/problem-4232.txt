In the CITRIX Access Management Console, I sometimes get a session that shows it's in a down state - but has none of the normal info associated with it (user name, applications, client name, idle time, etc...).
I had this problem too that was occurring too often, when this problem happens i can't even kill the user's process with process explorer so what's the difference when using Daphne?
I see it's one of my published apps, but when I try to end the process - it simply does nothing and the process remains.
It does say which servers it's on, so I check out that server's terminal services manager.
On another note, the way to troubleshoot this issue is by checking the following:
Running a CITRIX presentation server farm, version 4.5.6 on Windows 2003 sp2.
Any way to get rid of these sessions without a server reboot?
The csrss.exe process might show high CPU consumption because of vtdw30.dll being unable to free enough memory.
So I go to the task manager and look up the processes running under that session id.
