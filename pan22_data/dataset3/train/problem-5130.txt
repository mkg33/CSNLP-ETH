Currently, it is FAT32 formatted, because at first thought I might want to connect it to my Windows 7 laptop sometimes.
From the use you describe, this could be a big win.
I only want to change if there will be a noticeable speed gain.
For lots of small files within a directory, ext3 or ext4 with the dir_index capability gives excellent performance.
I thought that maybe using another file system will speed things up, and possibly eliminate the need for defrags.
Default options for XFS might be bad, but I think it can be tuned to your benefit based on what you are describing.
It depends on how much man page reading and testing you're interested in doing.
If other filesystems only have the advantage of less corruption chance, I'll stick with FAT32 because of the compatibility.
ReiserFS seems to be the best choice to manage an huge amount of small files.
Exporting the books to another format means the creation of lots of new files.
I think you'll get a significant benefit from using a non-FAT32 filesystem on Ubuntu.
As I noticed that I usually don't use the HDDs on the laptop (except for the defragmentation itself!)
Calibre makes its own copies of the books on import, using author names, series names and titles in the file and directory names, which results in the creation of lots of directories and the copying of lots of small files.
Besides the filesystem, you should consider putting this data on a separate filesystem (with whatever format) and using mount features like 'noatime' and 'nodiratime' to improve performance.
After several dozens of books all this started getting really slow.
Then I correct the details Calibre got wrong, and this results in the directory and file names being changed too.
