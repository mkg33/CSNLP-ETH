c. raise the function level of the domain to the server 2016?
b. install one domain controller with server 2016?
which are the correct ways to update the Group policy definition library?
The central store can be created on the SYSVOL partition on any domain controller (SYSVOL replicates through DFS to all domain controllers) and then go to the domain folder and find the Policies folder.
My recommendation would be to create a central store.
This will copy all of the ADMX files over to the central store where all DCs can access them, including Server 2012 DCs.
If you do, the Server 2012 DCs will no longer be able to service the domain.
I recently found the Group policy of our domain (windows server 2012) is not updated enough to support our Win10 end-user machine.
From there, presuming that a PolicyDefinitions folder has not yet been configured, none will exist.
Go to a Server 2016 DC and copy the C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions folder to the aforementioned directory.
An easy way to access this would be to use the following UNC path: "\FQDN of domain\SYSVOL\FQDN of domain\Policies".
