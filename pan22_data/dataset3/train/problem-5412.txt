I plan on making a (servlet) application that stores its data in a MySQL server, but only reads them at startup time and write them every 4h.
You can configure mysql to use a low amount of ram- however you obviously take a performance hit by doing this- however if your not dealing with much data, this might be worth it.
Would open, write the data in the DB, then close the MySQL server every 4h be a good idea to reduce its RAM usage?
It does sound like using a database here might be overkill (from what you have described)
If you give it too little memory performance will suffer.
These buffers are kept until memory is needed for another purpose.
I wish to let this application have as much RAM & CPU power as possible (hard drive access doesn't matter).
You don't state your O/S platform but Linux and other Unix anything read from disk gets stored in memory buffers.
It you are concerned with limiting the RAM used by MySQL tune its memory parameters.
Depending on memory available you may gain no benefit from closing the database and reopening it.
