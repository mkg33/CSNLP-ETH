The only time traffic will hit the router is if it needs to be routed, i.e.
Occasionally, all PCs on my LAN get disconnected; they can't reach each other or any servers.
There is a slim chance that cables or computers are to blame, but even if that is the case, you probably need to get a decent switch.
I've got a small business which consists of several PCs and a router which are all connected to the same 24-port swtich.
If you have everything on the same layer 2 Ethernet switch, then there's no routing necessary, which means that the traffic will never reach the router.
The server with that IP then responds - with its source MAC address in the response - and the client then sends the packet to that MAC address.
You can detect this by running "arp" at the command line, which will show you these cached entries.
Can I assume in this case that the fault lies either within cabling, switch or the computers?
If you can't reach a server and you see an ARP entry for its IP on the client, check that machine's settings and make sure the MAC address you see is correct for that host.
I have a simple question which involves understanding of the purpose of a router.
If PC-A pings or connects to Server-A, does router have anything to do with this connection?
I assumed since PC-A and Server-A are on the same physical network and same switch, the packets get routed by the switch, but not the router.
What I was wondering is whether this problem could be caused by the router which is also our DHCP server.
This is done via a broadcast - the requesting node sends a broadcast asking "who owns this IP?"
There's one (admittedly rare) way in which the router could be the fault...when a network node needs to reach another local node, there's a process called ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) where the Ethernet (or MAC) address is determined from the IP address.
It's possible that the router, or another node on your network, is responding to ARP requests for IPs that it doesn't own.
