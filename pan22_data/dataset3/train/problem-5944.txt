This assumes you don't wipe the drive during the re-install.
It is usually better to do a completely clean re-install (ie, format before installing) but if you are trying to repair a windows install in order to retrieve documents then yes, you can install windows and all your documents will still be there (usually in a Windows.Old or Username.Old folder).
If I reinstall Windows XP on my machine, will I have to reinstall everything?
You will have the option of wiping the drive or simply installing another instance.
Yes, to all the stuff that requires installation (Office, photoshop etc).
I'd recommend backing up as soon as you retrieve your documents so you don't have to worry with this in future :-)
You can re-install Windows without formatting the drive which will leave all your files in tact although you will have to reinstall any software that requires registering itself with windows (in the registry).
You will simply need to find them once you reinstall.
(A quick and easy backup for smaller size backups (ie, documents and photos rather than huge video files) would be something simple like DropBox).
