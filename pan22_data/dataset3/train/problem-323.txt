I know old modems used to covert digital data to analogue before sending it over the phone line, and today DSL uses a complete other frequency thanks to micro-filters.
Since you don't care what he signal is, only whether any arbitrary signal (or multiplexed set thereof) could be audible, the idea of digitally encoded data or photon pulses don't really enter into it (and photons exhibit the properties of a wave, which is an innately analog phenomenon).
If it can be heard, I would love a clip of it to listen to.
It is also the case that computers can encode and decode data via audio signals, which has applications in industrial systems malware and espionage.
It is my conclusion that just as we can visualize X-rays and other non-visible light spectrum, or topographically map earthquake vibrations, that we can also convert internet data transmissions to sound.
That said, as you rightly pointed out, humans have only so much bandwidth, and large portions of the signal would be undetectable to us, unless compressed and shifted into a range that meets our physical layer specifications.
Fiber uses light, and all the examples of what you want to hear are above 1 MHz, well above the level of human hearing.
All signal is inherently analog when traversing its media.
This implies that any given signal could be placed in a media like air where vibrations propagate the signal.
Analog modems use sound to encode data, but digital communications do not.
We've all heard the classic dial-up screeching sound, but what does it sound like for Cable/DSL/or fiber to be making a connection?
I thought maybe it would just be silence since the human ear cannot hear above 20k herts?
