I wrote a tool to do this called PageKite (https://pagekite.net/) and there are a few others as well, for example localtunnel and showoff.
This would of course only work for development, but it is a really quick and easy method.
Another alternative is to simply make your localhost webserver visible to the public web (temporarily or permanently, depending on what you are doing).
I know that the website is aimed at testing it on an iPhone, but it works with any phone.
It involves using fiddler 2 and couldnt be much easier.
This is probably the easiest solution, assuming you use one of the localhost tunneling services out there (there are a few), and it has the advantage that you can test performance over the mobile network and get friends/family/coworkers/... to take a look as well.
You could simply follow the advice on this website, but instead of connecting to a visual studio development server, simply select localhost in the address.
