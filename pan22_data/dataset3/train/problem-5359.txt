smartctl is a great tool for that, as user2986553 already mentioned.
The easiest way to ensure this happens on your next reboot is to create a file named "forcefsck" on the root of the filesystem.
Once you've ensured your disk is healthy, run an offline check on your root filesystem.
You're able to mount this filesystem, so it's not that damaged.
EXT4 can be automatically repaired very easily, and can be fixed after some pretty impressive failures.
When it completes and mounts the filesystem, it should delete that "forcefsck" file.
You will have to reboot for this, as EXT4 cannot be repaired while online, and read-only checks on an active mount will provide unreliable results.
This will very likely go well and fix any problems.
If your underlying block device has problems, running a filesystem repair has the potential of causing more problems than it would normally fix.
You may want to make sure it's gone and delete it if it's not.
However, before you check and repair the filesystem on /, make sure the underlying disk is healthy.
The following could possibly be classified as "major changes".
Make sure your backups are intact and workable before making major changes to the host filesystem.
Create a file named "forcefsck" to force a check at the next mount attempt:
EXT4 is a filesystem that requires offline maintenance like this every so often.
You should definitely enable "pass" on the fstab to make sure your filesystems get checked regularly.
