Just keep this mantra going in your head as you write software for Vista and beyond.
Writing settings to a config file stored in the application's installation folder is highly discouraged these days.
"Users can only write to their profile...Users can only write to their profile"
So when it tries to open the file in the Program Files folder, that request is getting redirected to your user accounts Virtual Store location transparently.
If you really have settings that should be applying to all users on the machine, you should write them to the All Users Application Data folder instead.
Your copy of TextPad is probably running in an elevated context and so it is seeing the file that lives in the real Program Files folder.
And even then, you'll still have to run the app in an Elevated context by default unless you explicitly grant the Users group write access to your folder.
You're probably running into a part of Vista's UAC features called Virtual Store.
If this is your code that you can change the functionality of and you want users to be able to use it without running as admin, you should change the location of where you store your config files to somewhere in the user's ApplicationData folder where it belongs.
Your application is running in a non-elevated (non-admin) context.
