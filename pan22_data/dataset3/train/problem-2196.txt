Arial, so that only the font family is changed but everything else is untouched (bold, italic, colour etc).
So what I'm looking for is a way to define a font for incoming HTML email, e.g.
I looked through all options and searched the web for a solution but couldn't find anything yet.
I know how I could change the format of incoming email from HTML to plain text but I would loose all the formatting in this case.
If the received mail has the font hardcoded,  then I don´t think there´s alot you can do.
"... you cannot easily control the font used to read HTML messages, since most people who send HTML mail specify the font they want their messages to appear in.
After our company switched to Microsoft Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 2007 I noticed that most incoming email is hard to read since the default Microsoft Office font was used when the message was composed and this font looks pretty fuzzy.

If you’re bothered by that, you can follow these steps to set a default font and make an HTML message use that font.
