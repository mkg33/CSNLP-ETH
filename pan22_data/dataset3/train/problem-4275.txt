PS: you have to pay for the better voices, but they will work on free text-to-speech software afterwards... at least the one I have.
Cepstral seems to provide reasonable prices for text to speech voices.
(This is NOT a SW solution, but we used it in a paging systems... 5 minutes to install)
When it comes to having a good sound, what you really want to look for is not the text to speech software, but the good voices: they are a separate subject.

The small footprint, plug-in solution accepts wide range of input data to generate real-time speech for Security Transit Medical and Industry.
There is no license or development...just buy the box if you only need one voice output.
"TextSpeak Embedded Text-To-Speech modules series convert ASCII text to a natural, clear voice with unlimited vocabulary.
Here is a website which has sample voices on it: including Audrey.
I also have to place a pausing symbol (.,: or such) at the end of titles so she doesn't keep talking right through them.
They have 20 languages and simple are the best sounding TTS you can find.
I have others, but I have only used her for a long time now.
Although I have to change most ' that are on the text with copy-past to one from the keyboard, it is worth it for an almost realistic sounding voice.
