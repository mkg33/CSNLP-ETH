We already know that the requested hostname does not end in examples.co (by the first condition).
If you are then you will need to redirect HTTP to HTTPS first on the same host.
Any optional subdomain is captured (in the %1 backreference) and everything after this is ignored.
The %1 backreference contains the hostname less the www subdomain (if any) and less any trailing dot (a FQDN) - as captured by the CondPattern ^(?:www\.)?(.+?)\.
Just to note, if you are using standard wildcard subdomains (as suggested in your other question) then a request for https://www.<subdomain>.<domain> will likely get stopped by the browser (and consequently no redirect will occur), since the SSL cert won't be valid.
Any request for anything other than the canonical domain needs to be redirected to the canonical domain.
Your additional "note" at the end regarding subdomains is really the main complication here.
The second redirect occurs when a non-canonical domain is requested.
Only change to a 301 when you have confirmed that it's working OK. You will need to clear your browser cache before testing.
The first rule primarily strips the optional www subdomain (or sub-subdomain).
Test with 302 (temporary) redirects to avoid caching issues.
