Allowing regular users to read almost anything is a great support for them when they wish to learn about Linux.
(My answer is general, not limited to accessing /boot/ only.)
Let's suppose I'm logged in as such a regular user.
These aren't the sort of data you'd want the plain user to have access to.
So why are they even readable by the regular accounts?
The thing I'd be worried about is if non-privileged users could modify files there, as that would give them more direct access to privilege escalation via booting a special backdoored kernel or whatnot.
Personally I would feel "safer" if it were 700 instead.
There's nothing sensitive in the /boot of most Linux machines.
Is it some kinda technical limitation of the security model, or is there an actual valid logical reason why it must be world readable (Ubuntu1604)?
Xiong Chiamiov's answer is good but I'd like to emphasize another aspect of the subject.
It's just the same as allowing everyone to read /usr/lib or /bin or any number of other directories on the system.
I can't imagine any shell scripts other than installers needing access to /boot post boot and installers are run as root or sudo anyway.
