While Scottie H provided a nice workaround by specifying different config files at startup, this approach might be a bit cumbersome to configure and use.
You can define multiple profiles, each having potentially different color scheme, font etc.
You can easily switch the profile of any existing terminal, usually via its right-click menu.
You need to specify the "profile" when the terminal is started (no run-time change), and tabs of a window cannot have different settings.
Unfortunately xfce4-terminal doesn't support profiles.
I recommend that you try some of these aforementioned terminal emulators to get a feeling how profiles work, and based on that decide whether it's worth it for you to switch to another emulator, or you'd prefer to stick to the one you're already familiar with.
Some terminal emulators (including, but not limited to: gnome-terminal, roxterm, tilix, terminator, konsole) support "profiles" which is exactly what you're looking for.
From each terminal, you can only modify its own configuration and not the other ones.
