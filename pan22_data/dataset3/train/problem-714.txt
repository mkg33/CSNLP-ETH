The Services tab also has a Hide All Microsoft Services option to help filter out necessary services.
Windows XP has a built-in tool called the System Configuration Utility which can help with this.
Your admins probably have some startup scripts they are pushing through group policy and could be what is causing the delay.
Type msconfig from Run to open the tool, and look at the Services and Startup tabs.
One of the new fast SSDs such as the OCZ Vertex would go a long way to solving your problem... and it won't just be your boot times that improve :-)
To see exactly what runs on startup from your computer, take a look at Autoruns from SysInternals.
While your question description indicates you are leaning towards tools, nobody has suggested what I consider to be the obvious answer to the short version of the question:
If you have a lot of stuff trying to run at once, it may be worth it to look at using Startup Delayer to force your startup apps to run in a specific order rather than all at once.
You might want do test it out in various environments ... network connected, network not connected, safe mode, standard mode, different users, some peripherals connected and not connected.
From here you can disable unneeded services and startup items.
