I need to split an excel worksheet into multi files based on a name in a column.

I think you are going to need to export your data to text and use a scripting language to read the text and automate the creation of files.

If you don't have a prohibitively large number of files to create, you could do this manually by filtering the original data by Name and then copying the matches into a new workbook.

I would say if you have 25 or fewer files to create, this might make more sense than taking the time to wrestle with the VBA.
