I have a windows 2016 server, which hosts a VM (Oracle Virtual Box).
Anybody knows which firewall rule might do the trick ?
However, if there is no specific reason for running VirtualBox instead of Hyper-V, I would recommend this instead, so traffic does not have to pass through the Windows server, but instead let the virtual network switch pass traffic to the right machine straight away.
I'm sure that the virtualbox does the same, but it makes sense using the built-in features for this unless VB is needed for other reasons.
Turning on both public profile and private profile has no problem at all.
For the current setup, I would suggest you open the firewall for the RDP protocol, rather than a port.
You should open a TCP and UDP port 5001 on winows server 2016 and let domain profile firewall be turned on.
Domain profile firewall is blocking the RDP connecting to VM hosted inside the Win2016 server.
The reaon is that your client and 2016 both are on domain.
Create a rule in your Windows Firewall to allow incoming connections on port 5001
Turning off the whole domain profile firewall just for RDP is not an ideal solution.
It is better to have a special rule as an exception.
you enabled firewall for rdp into 2016 but its not allowing connection on 5001 because firewall is on.
