Is there any way to make external shares accessible?
We have used AD with network drives for many years to manage all our department files, and it's worked well.
However, my predecessor tried MOSS 2007 and it was horrible.
What I want to prevent is getting pushed into Google Apps overnight.
It is really important to have your NTFS permissions set correctly, since you won't have the share-level permissions as an additional layer of protection.
Shinier is better, because this is more about trying to not annoy a bunch of executives than anything else.
Ideally this would be across a VPN, since you almost certainly want to protect that file server.
I'm new here, and I hope this isn't too much of a shopping question.
That seems like would be the quickest and easiest for something that you won't be using long term.
The web shares basically use webdav (http/https) to remotely access the filesystem.
While there is some risk you could certainly install IIS on your file server and create 'web shares'.
I'm the under-qualified director of technology at a small college that may be acquired by a larger school.
One possible hack is to set up a Remote Desktop User that has access to the shares, then let the outside user RDP in and they can view them.
However, the larger school uses Google Apps and Drive, and we're now constantly getting requests for internal data.
My recommendation would be to create a trust over a site to site VPN between the two AD Forests, and use selective authentication to give the specific groups that need access to the information that they need.
We have Office 365 email and Office 2010 on our Windows 7 desktops.
Today, for example, I found out with less than an hour's lead time that their marketing department wants to view all our marketing department's photos.
Also you really need SSL if this is going to be authenticated.
We're low on money, which is why we're likely being acquired, and I cannot buy a big boxed product.
