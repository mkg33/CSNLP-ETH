Based on my knowledge of Office 365 I advised him that due to the DNS configurations required for Office 365 that they can't span a single domain across multiple tenants.

My knowledge is more about Azure AD and Exchange Online.
The best way to approach it would be to create their main domain and then additional domains in the same forest to apply to the tenants.
However for the re-architecture they are changing to a new domain name.
The Office 365 tenant currently is associated to a single domain and all global users belong to this tenant.
What other considerations should be made before executing anything.
As well since I've never architected an AD domain at this level, this being my first real shot at it.

You probably need to look into the Office 365 Multi-Geo capabilities and you should reach out to Microsoft for guidance.
Currently there is one office in the United States and then one in Germany.
So my question is if they go with using sub-domains for the additional tenants would they have to use those sub-domains for the other Office 365 services (In-Tune, SharePoint, Skype for Business, etc)?
Due to the GDPR laws German data has to remain in Germany (or some other EU country) in it's own tenant.
Naturally they don't want their US user base to reside in that tenant.
I've recently been asked by a fellow colleague to assist him with an Office 365 re-architecture he is taking on.
Time is plentiful as they are in the planning phases but need suggestions soon to start prototyping some executions.
