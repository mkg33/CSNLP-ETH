On Windows XP, things are always pretty fast even when using big-ish applications for a few hours (Visual Studio, Chrome with lots of open tabs).
It gets really slow after a few hours, making a "context switch" is usually painful (takes up to 20 seconds) and shutdowns usually take 2 minutes or MORE!
Making the context switch from a memory intensive app that's been open for a good few hours to freshly opening a new one is mostly seamless.
It is a over 11 years old, and in the world of operating systems, that is several generations.
I keep my PC clean, I don't install loads of software, only essentials required for working.
I might be wrong but Windows 7 seems to page memory much more frequently than XP, so it could be that it needs to swap out much more during those times I need to make a "context switch" to another app.
Although you technically meet the minimum requirements to Windows 7, your machines sluggishness is most likely due to a lack of memory.
Shutdowns always take up to 30 seconds, but usually less.
On Windows 7 I use Windows Essentials for security because it is light and I don't use a third-party firewall.
You need to remember that Windows XP was released on August 24, 2001.
TLDR: Windows 7 is unbelievably slow for my needs, so how can I get Windows 7 to be just as fast as XP on the same machine?
Startup is just as fast as XP but that's where it ends.
You will not get the best performance out of Windows 7 without 4 GB of RAM - or more based on usage.
My computer has 2GB of RAM and a 2.00 GHz Core 2 Duo processor.
My computer's page file is always limited to 3GB (more than enough for my needs).
Doing the same thing on Windows 7 is the complete opposite.
While I understand that Windows 7 has many improvements over XP architecturally, I just don't understand why my computer gets so slow after a few hours of use on Windows 7 compared to Windows XP.
Look at the requirements for XP and you can see how things have changed.
