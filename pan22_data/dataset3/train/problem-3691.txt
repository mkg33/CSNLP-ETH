Extract of the Command iptables in relation to -s flag
So what we have told the iptables command is that we want the source to be the first 256 (192.168.0.0-255) IP addresses starting at 192.168.0.0 to be declared as a source in this command
Just wanted to add to @Zoredache comment (Which is also an answer)
To break down -s 192.168.0.0/24 we need to look at the subnet mask it represents:
Now this doesn't really give us any indication of how it's represented as the number 24 until we look at the binary representation of the subnet mask:
Another example would be I want the first 65,536 IP addresses starting at 10.1.0.0 to be the source
So what @Zoredache has suggested works by working on the subnet mask short hand
So the command would be -s 10.1.0.0/16 this is subnet mask 255.255.0.0 (Binary is 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000) and this will declare 10.1.0.0 through 10.1.255.255 as the source addresses
Now a quick count will show that the first 24 binary switches are set to 1 this is why it's represented as /24
