I know about the Folder settings for these that are buried in the "Folder and Search Options" dialog, I'd just like easy-to-click access to those settings.
It worked great, but not as convenient as a simple button on the explorer bar.

Same thing as if you went to Windows Explorer's Tools Menu and choose Folder Options->{View Tab},
Some quick googling didn't really bring up anything useful so I thought I'd ask here.
- Shell extension that toggles between displaying and hiding file extensions.*.
but I'd love to see this written as a button on the explorer toolbar.
Has anyone run across a nice small Windows Explorer Shell Extension that simply adds toolbar buttons at the top of the window to Hide/Show Hidden files and to Hide/Show System files?
Sounds like you are looking for something like these:
There's a context menu extension: HiddenFilesToggle Context-Menu Shell Extension
- Shell extension that toggles between displaying and hiding hidden files.
I'll want to use this is Windows 7 if that makes any difference.
I don't like the clutter of running with the Hidden and System Files visible, but I'm constantly having to turn the options on so I can do work in those folders.
Same thing as if you went to Windows Explorer's Tools Menu and choose Folder Options->{View Tab}, but this is quicker & easier.
Unfortunately the changes didn't seem to be applied straight away.
I tried to do this myself once by adding shortcuts to a couple of .vbs scripts to the Links folder (in IE Favourites) and displaying the Links toobar in explorer windows.
I'd love to see a toolbar button (or two) added for convenience.
I did this once by creating 2 registry files, one for unhide and one for hide.
