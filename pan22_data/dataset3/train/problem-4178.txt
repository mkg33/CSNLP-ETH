Had there been any non-microsoft add-ins I would have tried turning them off first.
Did not go to the trouble to find out which one was causing the trouble.
you could also test the email download from another machine that has/hasn't antivirus just to confirm that if it's really the AV that is mucking around with Outlook.
Was able to reproduce it anytime I sent myself a test file containing large attachments.
additional thought - any add-ins active on the outlook?
just a few thoughts, since the email "cannot be downloaded" from the server, I dont think PSTs are in play yet here.
I used a test email with four attachments totaling 7.8MB.
Looking at their names I didn't see why I needed any of them.
Turning off all Outlooks add-ins (all supplied by microsoft) solved the problem.
Then you can just delete the offending message and good to go.
Most mail services have a web mail utility in addition to the standard pop/imap services.
you can confirm the size of the offending email from the web mail portal to check if size is the problem.
Can you log into your mail server's web interface and see exactly what message is causing the problem?
OST corruption would be more likely but that could be sidestepped with a new profile creation.
