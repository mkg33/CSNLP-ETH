You'll either want to force one session per user (Group Policy setting) or the tscon command to switch into the session.
I need to create a startup script on a server that is live in production, so unfortunately I don't have the luxury of trial and error.
You can't run a program outside of a session and then "import" it into a session.
I need to start an application upon server bootup that is run as a particular service account.
You have to create a session (auto-login or similar) and then run the application inside it.
will the application be running in that profile, or just running in the background as a process I can see in task manager?
I need the same instance of that application to be accessible when I manually log into the server later using that same account.
If the latter, what options do I have to set the app to run automatically upon startup and be available when I log in?
Logging that service account in as part of the startup process is fine if needed.
Once that is done you can login to that session and see the application.
