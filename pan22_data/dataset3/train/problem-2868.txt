Valve games also often have a "colour blind" mode which may be worth looking at.
Audiosurf now includes the ability to change block colour settings.
In mono mode the objective is to collect all the coloured blocks and avoid all grey ones, but at some points they looked identical to the colour blind user.
I actually had the chance to test Audiosurf on a colourblind user for a class, and found there was only one issue.
For those who don't know it, Audiosurf involves matching coloured blocks (red, yellow, green, blue and purple) in most modes, however the "mono" mode reduces them to coloured blocks that change colour and grey blocks.
This is an interesting topic, I often refer back to this page: http://wearecolorblind.com/articles/quick-tips/ and the resources linked above seem quite good too.
So I'd say with so many colour blind people around, you may be able to find some test subjects of your own and check any gaps with the vischeck plugin linked above.
Some of the issues are not as severe as you might think: for example red and green gems in a matching game may be perfectly fine if one is brighter (usually that would be green).
