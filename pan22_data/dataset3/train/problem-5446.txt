software that can transparently back up files immediately before they are written to, so that I can be certain I have all the versions of a file that ever existed.
The drawback is that saving the file becomes a two step operation - you would need to implement a check in as well so that all versions of the file are stored.
Old snapshots will be forgotten as you add new files to clean up space.
The nilfs2 filesystem makes temporary snapshots several times a second, for free, due to the way it works (it keeps a detailed log of changes, and reading files actually reads that log, rather than somewhere else; the log can simply be truncated to revert to an older state).
You may want to run nilfs2 on a Linux VirtualBox instance and run Samba to access the files within.
To be sure of having a copy of data immediately before or during it's been written, use RAID array.
What I'm looking for is true continuous backup software, i.e.
You can also tell it to never forget some snapshot, and you instantly get a permanent backup (against human error, not hardware failure), without a lengthy copy!
Pretty sweet software for pretty cheap and sounds like exactly what you need.
Every backup software I've seen (even the ones that claim "continuous" protection) only backs up files periodically -- say, every 5 minutes.
It uses all of its free space for continuous snapshots, and only stores differences, so you get few-per-second snapshots up to days.
If you have text files which change often and are sensitive to change, you could put them in some sort of source control.
