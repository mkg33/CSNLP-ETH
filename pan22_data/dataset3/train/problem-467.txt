This may or may not be worth it, depending on how much the repairs were worth, but it's a thought at least.
Keep a copy of the invoice, and if she doesn't pay within the amount of time you specify (30 days is common), then pursue legal recourse.
It's simple: if you haven't been paid for the services you provided, then that is theft on your client's part.
(Methods relying upon local Windows authentication can be bypassed, as you seem to be aware.)
If you return the computer but retain the hard drive, you will probably make the problem worse, not better, as it will just aggravate your already unfriendly client.
It doesn't matter how unfriendly your client is, you shouldn't let her bully you into working for free.
Instead, either forcer her to pay you, or else undo whatever fixes you made, and return the computer exactly the way you got it.
If you keep part of her computer, she may have grounds for complaint against you, but if you return it exactly the way you received it, and she hasn't paid you, then you're even, and you haven't done anything wrong.
While it would be best to avoid, people are sometimes more cooperative when you bring lawyers into the picture.
Back it up, install TrueCrypt, and encrypt the entire volume.
Another solution would be to return the computer in full working order with an invoice for the services you provided.
Don't return the computer if she hasn't paid for the repairs you made.
I don't know exactly how she's "demanding" her computer back, but unless she's threatening you with violence (in which case you should report it to the authorities), you are under no obligation to return her computer if she hasn't paid you.
