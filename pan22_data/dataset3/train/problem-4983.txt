On Windows there are only a few usable replacements, mostly based on bb4win.
They are not completely functional, can't really be used for daily work.
Note that Awesome also has good support for building whatever sort of UI widgets you could want, including a taskbar.
Can choose from the windows many ways, so I have no problem.
It's very spartan, but it does the job pretty well.
It's a tiling window manager that has hotkey and mouse bindings.
use fluxbox, you can disable / hide the taskbar (called 'toolbar') completely.
I enjoy using Lua to script my window behavior, and I also don't use a taskbar.
I personally use tint2 panel 0.1sec autohide (instant), with openbox and custom hotkeys.
Awesome, Xmonad, and dwm are all good choices for lightweight, configurable, usually tiling window managers.
Sounds like LXDE with compiz without a panel or something like that.
Openbox provides a list of windows, a switcher, tint2 provides a taskbar for that, there is a tiling app which provides tiling for all of this..)
( I found them like this, maybe it works for someone, I talk only in my 'position'. )
Compiz provides that window choosing which you say, and there are many others with different managing.
It doesn't have any extra stuff by default, and it was once even known for being low-memory -- and that was when we didn't have RAM like you do today!
Getting overwhelmed by windows is quite impossible because once you get used to multi desktop setups, you won't suffer from that.
Awesome changes its configuration API with each update, so your config script breaks.
