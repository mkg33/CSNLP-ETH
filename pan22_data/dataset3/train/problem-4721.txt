If you're talking about case insensitivity ONLY within apps running under Mono, you can use the IOMAP environment variable to tell mono to ignore case just like Windows does.
Create a .dsk-file of size X-MB (with dd), then make a JSF-filesystem on that file, with option O (OS2 compatibility - = case insensitive)
One way is to mount a localhost SMB share to /var/www.
Now go to /etc/fstab, and replace the old uuid for /dev/hda5 with the new one.
What methods are there to make the Linux filesystem case-INSENSITIVE ?
When everything is up and running, you can reformat that partition with (warning - this will erase all data on that partition - make sure you selected the proper one, and don't have any data on it, yet):
I have asp.net applications developed on Windows, but there are always issues with capitalization/spelling on mono when putting it on Linux.
When you install the OS, manually partition the disk, and create another partition with format JFS, which you mount to wherever you want to have it.
