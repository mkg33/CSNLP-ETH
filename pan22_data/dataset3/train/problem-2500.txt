Now the thing is that I have my fileserver with most of my files at home and also two other servers (web and development servers) combined with all my other computers and network related stuff.
My main server at home which is always almost always running is using Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS, however poweroutages do happen (even if they are rare), the server is setup to automatically start up again so as long the VPN service is autostarting I should be fine.
I've got a bunch extra laptops laying around, some with express slots and I've probably got some extra desktop to spare as well if absolutely necessary maybe I could setup a VPN to one of these computers and then bridge that connection to the other network port where I put a switch or AP (would that work?).
I've never done anything like this before and I don't want to spend a fortune on enterprise equipment to set this up when I probably already have enough hardware to set it up using Open Source software.
My network at home is a 100/100Mbit/s Fibre Optics connection however I'm not sure what speed I'll be getting at the apartment but there's a risk that it'll only be 10/10Mbit/s or 100/10Mbit/s maybe even slower if I'm really unlucky.
If you want a constant VPN connection, the best is to get a second router at your house and have your company have a constant VPN tunnel from your router to theirs.
That's how a lot of remote workers I know have done it in.
I've gotten an appartment in a city 25 000km from home as I'll be living there during the weeks, in this appartment I'll have one Mac Pro (10.7), one MacBook Pro (10.6) and maybe one Windows 7 Laptop.
So how should I set up this, I guess that I should be using VPNs in some way but how, should I put a router there that in some way connects to the VPN (does consumer routers even handle that), should I set up separate VPN tunnels to each machine locally?
