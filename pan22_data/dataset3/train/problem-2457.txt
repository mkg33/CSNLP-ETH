The Windows intaller service is normally set to manual and  the buttons will be greyed until you change to Automatic.
Anything unusual in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\run ?
Note that removing the InProgess key even with the Rollback doesn't solve anything and the key will be recreated as it was by msiexec.
You should be able to see the msiexec.exe service running, and if something is in the middle of installing you should see other msiexec.exe children processes.
How to deal with "another msi installation already in progress" when all others hints didn't work :
It would be best to allow them to finish, and maybe try to squeak your install in between.
You can try stopping that service to see if it makes a difference.
In the registry, the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\InProgress will point to a file located under the C:\Windows\Installer directory with an IPI extension (something like f2345.ipi).

The information which is meaningful lies in this file which is the installer for the failed installation (which blocks the other installation).
I don't know if this will help, but for those using Windows 10, you may not be able to see the msiexec process under processes but under Details.

Try using one of them (repair first, as it should solve the problem, then remove) in order to properly end this aborted installation.
I have seen it before where the .NET Runtime Optimization Service is constantly firing off ngen.exe using the installer service to generate optimized .net assemblies and never allows the installer to use anything else.
Opening this file with notepad or any text editor will show a lot of binary content but at some place you'll find some readable text :
Launching this installation (double clicking on the file) will lead to some options like install, repair or remove the product.
