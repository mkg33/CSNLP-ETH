I have a number of rules that filter mail to my deleted items folder.
How can you "debug" which rule applied to a given message?
I am not sure exactly how much infomation you can pick out of outlook's logging feature, but it might help.
I just enabled this on one of my machines and going to see if it shows me my rules in action.
For Windows XP users, it will be created at C:\Documents and Settings\user name\Local Settings\Temp\Outlook Logging\OPMLog.log
I created 7 Deleted folders (deleted1 ... deleted7), modified all rules that deleted emails, assigning them randomly to one of the seven folders, with between2-4 rules per folder.
I had 20 rules all sending email to the Deleted folder.
Then I cleaned up the deleted folder, deleting email I knew I didn't need, leaving email that I might refer back to and restoring good email to Inbox.
The log file is created at C:\Users\user name\AppData\Local\Temp\Outlook Logging\OPMLog.log in Windows Vista.
Sometimes it seems a rule applies to a message which I did not intend it to apply to.
I like the coloring idea (move to deleted folder AND assign it to this category / color), I just didn't take the time to learn to implement it.
Then I selected all rules and ran them against my Inbox, checked which folder got the emails I didn't want deleted and that narrows it to 4 rules, then move other rules back to Deleted folder, spread the four rules across folders, re-run.
