As I understand it, you cannot use routing with DHCP either.
But does everything in your network have a static address or is it expecting a dynamic address from the internet server?
If it were me, I would try setting up a bridge on the Raspberry Pi and hope that my wireless card would allow it.
where dev(n) is standing in for all the devices you have off the different ports in your router.
With either static or dynamic addresses, you could use a bridge, although, at least at one point, some wireless cards couldn't be used in a bridge.
Internet_Server ------------- Raspberry_Pi --------- Router----dev(n)
This won't work if you are using DHCP - you can't use IP forwarding for something that doesn't have an IP address.
And how are you getting traffic across the Raspberry Pi?
If you are using iptables, you will need to be sure forwarding is allowed for the bridge, as in this example I found.
If everything already has an IP address, you could use IP forwarding to get across the Rasberry Pi.
