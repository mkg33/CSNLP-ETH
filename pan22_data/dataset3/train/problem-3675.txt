Specifically, Check whether crond service is restarted after you lastest config (last night) or not.
this explains why you can't find your job (pending QNAP rebooted.
You should check /var/spool/cron/ for active cron jobs.
There seems to be some questions behind QNAP's cron anyway).
Also check /var/log/cron and /var/spool/cron/ for more information about running tasks.
But i cant find the line with the script name in it ?
you'll need to use autorun.sh which will allow you to load your specific configs on startup.
May be the crontab is overwritten, but not restarted ???
I added a line in my crontab on an QNAP NAS with crontab -e i saved (:wq!)
However it runs every hour, so i tought i take a look at the crontab, with crontab -l
editing crontab directly should work until QNAP reboots.
This line would have had a script to run for every 5 minutes so i dit 5 * * * * and the script name.
It is running every hour because you specified 5 * * * * not */5 * * * *.
Last night i quit trying, went to bed and kept de NAS running.
And wen ik woke up this morning i looked at the database and the script is running.
