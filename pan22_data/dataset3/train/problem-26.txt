It can make a huge difference, Bluetooth was intended to be a PAN.
Today I have realised that leaving my smartphone close to the laptop makes the Internet not work, but puting it on plane mode is letting me use the laptop with Internet without any problems.
The thing is that the Internet works fine randomly.
(Depending on the make and model of the router, it would be in the web-ui).
Some routers and wifi chipsets have a Bluetooth coexistence mode.
I have been trying to solve the interferences problems I have when I use my laptop from a room that is not near to the Wifi repeater.
Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wifi use the same frequencies, because of this they will interfere.
Restarting the WiFi repeater and/or router used to work, but not always.
Another option would be to use a router with the 5.8Ghz band.
It has much lower transmit power levels, this really shouldn't be an issue unless the Bluetooth device was within a couple feet of the router.
If you have a coexistence mode in the router use it.
Can my mobile phone be really be making my laptop unable to connect properly to the WiFi?
If you do not, try choosing another wifi channel in the router configuration and see if it helps.
This can also happen with the usb wireless keyboard & mice combos that run on 2.4Ghz  You can try adjusting the wifi channel in the router to either 1, 6, or 11.
