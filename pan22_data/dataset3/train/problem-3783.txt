The upgrade failed to set the boot environment to FreeNAS 11, so I did that manually after seeing a reboot simply took me back to FreeNAS 9.10.2.
Is there any way to force (from the command line) for the system to go through the FreeNAS 11 install process again so that it fill in whatever clearly didn't install properly in the previous version?
I am able to SSH into the server, at which point I tried to trigger another upgrade by typing sudo freenas-update -v update.
(I tried editing /boot/grub/grub.cfg to set default to the previous, FreeNAS 9.x entry so that the system would boot to the previous version, but that didn't seem to have an effect when I rebooted.
To switch trains while doing a command line upgrade, I used the following command sudo freenas-update -v -T FreeNAS-11-STABLE update.
Yesterday, I tried to upgrade my FreeNAS 9.10.2 system to FreeNAS 11.
Of course, that still wouldn't solve the improper FreeNAS 11 install anyway.)
While the system was booting into FreeNAS 11, the failed upgrade had left the upgrade system thinking I was still on the FreeNAS 9.10.x "train."
If I can do it by SSH that would be idea -- the system is headless, so if I can take advantage of that SSH connection to repair the damage without starting from scratch, that'd be very helpful.
That was a mistake: now it boots into what appears to be FreeNAS 11, but when I try to go to the web GUI, I simply get "Internal Server Error."
After a few stories like that we stopped using FreeNAS and switched to plain vanilla FreeBSD + ZFS.
