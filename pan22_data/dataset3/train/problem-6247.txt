You also need multi-auth so the switch knows to look for more than one MAC address.
Modern 802.1x systems are much smarter ("more complicated") and can independently police multiple hosts on a single port.
This is where multi-auth and multi-domain come in.
You would need to configure MAB (Mac Auth Bypass) authentication for the ip phone in the multi-vlan interface.
If the switch sees a phone as a CDP neighbor, it will do CDP bypass and will not attempt to authenticate.
There is a little-known feature called "CDP bypass" which allows a Cisco switch to detect a specific TLV in the CDP message which allows immediate authentication.
Because the 7941 won't do 802.1x itself, but will pass EAPOL through, and "fake" a logoff when the PC port is disconnected.
(Ignoring that it's in terms of NX-OS, this is how MAB works.)
Be aware however, that newer version of Cisco IOS no longer include this CDP bypass feature.
That will allow multiple machines in the data vlan, which is disabled by default and will show "Security Violation" in the logs.

As Jaxxs points out, the only compromise is to allow the phone access without authentication (i.e.
CDP should actually take care of the port authentication for an Cisco IP phone.
You should configure authentication order dot1x mab to do attempt dot1x first.
So, in simplest form, the port is either authorized or not; once authorized -- MAC limits aside -- traffic from anything will be allowed.
