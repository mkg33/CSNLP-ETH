I still have no idea what WMM mode does or doesn't do but disabling it was the only thing that worked.
Try connecting to some site via their IP address: If you can do that, then it's definitely DNS.
After doing all the other recommendations and manually entering a DNS address (8.8.8.8) did this work- such a simple button!
Try connecting to 69.59.196.219 (Superuser's IP address).
Have you tried pinging the sites from the command line to see if it's name resolution or the actual connection?
What it sounds like to me is that there is no DNS server set up on your wireless DHCP, so you can't access any sites, but Google (for some reason) is either cached or in your local hosts or something, so it's getting out to that site.
For Susan and anyone else who's having the same problem and stumbled onto this page.
Do you have any special settings in the router for the WLAN?
In my case, I was able to solve it by disabling "WMM mode".
Connecting to it via cable worked fine but the wireless connection only let me access Google affiliated sites.
Switching wireless channels, changing wireless modes, none of these worked.
Do you have the Google Toolbar or something like that installed?
My fix was to open the network properties, select ipv4 properties and have obtain an IP address automatically selected.
If it's not DNS, try a traceroute to that IP address.
I agree with Anakun that you may not be connecting to your own router.
