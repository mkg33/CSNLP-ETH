Have you deleted Adobe files/directories in/Library/Application Support/Adobe  which is different than Users/Yourshortlogin/Library/Application Support/Adobe?
If you, for example, search on an installation date and time for your entire machine you may find files installed within a few seconds or minutes of known Adobe files.
This is another recommendation that when installing an app, don't be doing other tasks while the installer is running.
So I use the paid HoudaSpot which, though it is just a Spotlight front end, does visit all of the system.
These are not standard "removal tools" but they are meant to help when you want to reinstall a product from scratch when there are errors such as you said and they have helped me in similar situations.
This way you have no way to tell they are from Adobe.
Also, the log files give you the times of installations.
In Library/Logs/Adobe/Installers/ there are a bunch of log files.
In Library/Frameworks/ there is Adobe Air stuff and sometimes more.
Also, there may be another set of ~Library... and other ~/... folders and files as there was with your own user folder.
They often have to do with DRM or anti piracy efforts.
Using the Log files you can find some of these (if any).
Check the root/Library... equivalents of the User folders as there is a lot of stuff in there.
Some of this may be repetitive but follow these steps and you should have absolutely positively NO trace of Adobe left on your computer.
It is possible to use a free app called EasyFind to find all of the files listed by dcc and myself in this post.
Obviously keep AbodeRGB1998.icc and others that are used universally and not used by Adobe.
Finally, there are some files labeled with only the name of the Adobe app.
These are great tips, all organized in one place and are probably sufficient.
If you have other User accounts then you may find a file .Adobe at /Users/[useraccountname]/ The dot in front means this file is hidden.
In /System/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/ you may find ColorSync profiles from Adobe apps.
I have a suspicion there is a way to do this in the Terminal or another freeware app that can do this but have never bothered to look.
To search on date and time you will want to search on (usually) Creation Date or sometimes Date Added.
Of course you will want to backup your system as well as clone it prior to doing this surgery.
First remove the standard way through Add/Remove programs then run one of the following:
However, frankly, it misses or ignores areas of the system that seem  obvious.
dcc's list neglects a few files and folders, for example /Library/Application Support in favor of ~/Library/Application Support, (i.e., suggesting only the user (~)/LibraryApplication folder) and there a few others along these lines.
In /Library/Internet Plug-Ins and Library/Internet Plugins (disabled) there may be Adobe files.
Remove these but reserve them for further spelunking.
In /private/var/db/bootcaches/ there are some incomprehensibly named folders several of which contain adobe ".playlist" files that can go.
Digging deeper into/private/var/db/receipts/ there are a bunch of adobe bom and plist files that can go..
in /Library/LaunchDaemons/ and /Library/LaunchAgents/ there are Adobe files to be chucked.
In /private/tmp/ there may be AdobeApplicationManager.
Adobe files and folders often appear in the Users/Shared/ folder.
As for the log files, adobe may install files that do not have the name adobe in the filename.
