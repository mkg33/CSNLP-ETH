@Caridorc has already addressed looping: use a for-loop, and extract the termination case out of the loop.
There are two learning objectives to this programmers' etude: looping and pluralization.
If you find it acceptable to have an extra newline at the end of the output, you could get rid of the System.out.print() special case.
            System.out.println(MessageFormat.format(VERSE_FMT, b, b - 1));
In the template, 0#99 bottles is admittedly an abusive hack.
        System.out.print(MessageFormat.format(VERSE_FMT, 1, 0));
Therefore, I recommend going with the standard solution rather than reinventing the wheel.
          "1<{1} bottles} of beer on the wall.\n";
One approach to addressing the pluralization issue would be to define a function.
You tried to do pluralization, but you have a bug:
          "1<{0} bottles} of beer on the wall, " +
          "0<Take one down and pass it around}, " +
However, I would like to point out that pluralization is a common i18n problem that has a standard solution.
