Sometime over the Thanksgiving holiday, my Netbackup installation decided that it no longer liked the tapes in my library.
I've tried moving both tapes and a policy to a different pool.
I have verified that my policies are referencing the NetBackup pool.
If someone can suggest logs that I can look at or enable, I'd appreciate it.
Now when I try to perform a backup, it immediately errors out with error code 96: "EMM status: No media is available unable to allocate new media for backup, storage unit has none available".
I have tried setting policies to a different pool and then setting them back.
If I try to label a tape, I immediately get error 98: "error requesting media (tpreq)".
It had worked fine a week ago with no changes that I can think of, besides moving the new week's set of tapes into the NetBackup pool.
Resetting the volume expiration to nil solved the problem.
I have tried moving tapes into the Scratch pool and seeing if it would pull them into the NetBackup pool.
Turns out that an earlier attempt to set the expiration date of the data on the tapes accidentally set the volume expiration date, so all of those tapes were expired.
(I had previously moved them to an unused pool so that they wouldn't be written to until Friday.)
The tapes show up in the output of nbemmcmd -listmedia ... with the correct pool and other information.
I've rebooted the Netbackup server and the tape library.
