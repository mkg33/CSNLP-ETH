Using NAT still seems to be working fine for my purposes.
The reason for the slow networking is a bad autodetection of the network settings.
You DO NOT want Windows to automatically detect settings when Virtualbox is installed.
Much simpler fix was, via Network and Sharing Center, to change Wifi Adapter settings.
Meanwhile, bridged networking still works on your wired NIC.
Go to Control Panel => Internet Properties => Connections tab => LAN settings, and make sure all of the checkboxes are UNchecked.
Yeah that works, but that is not the proper fix (at least on Windows 7).
If I ever find the need to use the Bridged or Host-Only networks, I will revisit this question.
Simply uncheck "Virtual Box bridged newrok adapter" in Networking tab, and your wifi will establish connection within seconds, not minutes.
Yup, just for people who find this question in the future: I did end up solving this myself by installing VirtualBox with all of the networking options disabled.
Whenever you need bridged networking via wifi card for your Virtual Box, you can check it back.
The host only is needed for shared folders, and it is not the primary reason for the slow networking.
After I did this and rebooted, the difference was night and day!
