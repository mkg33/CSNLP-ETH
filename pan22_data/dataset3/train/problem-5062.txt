Type the word you want to replace, press tab, type the new word and then ctrl+cmd+f will perform a “Replace All”.
You can also use some of the other selection items in Edit > Find.
I've googled (just a bit) and couldn't find an answer.
Well, I was typing exactly that but mipadi did it faster, however I’d like to add that the correct way to find and replace would be:
For example, if you have a word highlighted, you can use ⌘+E to use that word as search text, and then ⌘+G to walk through occurrences of that word.
The buttons in the box map to the same options under Edit > Find, so you can use those key shortcuts.
I love keyboard and I use quite a few in TextMate but just realise I still use the mouse for 2 of the most common actions:
Of course, minipadi’s solution works without bringing the Find dialog at all, which is, often preferred.
As for the second question, cmd+d is for any save dialog (at least in Cocoa applications).
All these shortcuts are listed in Edit > Find for easy references.
You can also selected another word to use as replace text with ⌘+Shift+E, then step through the occurrences (using ⌘+G) and use Replace All in Selection (⌘+Shift+Control+F) to replace.
Incidentally, this works in almost every document-based application on Mac OS X -- not just TextMate.
