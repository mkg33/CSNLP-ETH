http://loggly.com/ and https://logentries.com/ both look promising, though I haven't used either of them personally yet.
even after a complete physical disaster or comprehensive hacking of all my systems.
The closest that my searches have come is LogLogic (http://loglogic.com/).
I also have accounts at free website monitoring services to alert me when a website goes down.
I'm looking for a service to securely store syslog-ish information.
I understand that I can pay a consultant to build and host such a system, but I am wanting something that is subsidized by "enterprises" paying $$$$$ for stuff and power users getting to piggy-back on the infrastructure for only $.
My Question: Does such a service currently exist, and if so, where on the web?
They all generate various warnings, alerts, info messages, etc.
http://www.spiceworks.com/ sounds like it might be right for you.
I can't trust my own skills to "guarantee" that my own sites are secure, so I want to use somebody else's professionally secured web service to keep my messages.
I want to store warning messages, alerts, audit trails, etc.
I have a few home computers, a few hosted virtual servers, misc websites, etc.
Basically I don't trust my own skills and want to pay somebody else to "insure" that I can have logs and audit trails, etc.
Maybe you should talk to a representative there to see what services they offer.
You're describing a valuable service that, as far as I can tell, isn't saturated with companies jumping on the bandwagon.
