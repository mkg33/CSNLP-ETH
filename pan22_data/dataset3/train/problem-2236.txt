These probably have some expense, but are integrated platforms with support.
For example, App Metrics .NET instrumentation, indexed in Elasticsearch, with Grafana dashboards and Bosun alerts.
Insight into where exactly requests are spending time in the application is necessary, which implies instrumentation of the app.
Or specialist products in this space include Dynatrace, AppDynamics, or New Relic.
Either way, likely get a platform you can also send traditional host and network monitoring data to.
As this can be a significant project, there is a decision to be made of build vs buy.
I'd love to find a tool for Microsoft IIS that shows me broad metrics (# of hits over a period of time), details (# of hits for a particular path over a period of time), and tools to show me changes in application performance for particular paths over time.
Check out OpenAPM landscape for a functionality matrix of what some of these can do.
The market is mature enough that this is a category of software, see APM listings in G2 or Capterra.
On the SQL side of life, there are lots of great tools to monitor performance, bottlenecks, and changes in performance over time.
Build would be integrating various open source components.
You need application performance monitoring (APM).
Does anyone have a tool for this that they prefer?
Just don't expect host CPU and interface dropped packets to solve all your performance problems.
All in on Microsoft there is Application Insights.
My team is responsible for monitoring the performance of our custom application infrastructure.
