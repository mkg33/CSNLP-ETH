The copper is also the heat pipe which takes the heat to the radiator which then has the fan and fins to help dissipate the heat and expel it from the laptop chassis.
I’d suggest heat sink only for the square copper part because the function of the strap is to conduct heat to the fan rather than merely to absorb heat.
The grill I would term “fins” (any of a number of standing ridges on an ordinarily hot object, as a radiator, a cylinder of an internal-combustion engine, etc., intended to maximize heat transfer)  to the surrounding air by exposing a large surface area" ref or “heat exchange fins”.
My laptop's cooling fan is pretty much identical to this:
The whole thing, including the fan, is the heat sink.
The copper square sits on the CPU, above thermal paste which fills the gaps between the CPU and the Heatsink.
Is it called ventilator or something (on the whole)?
As detailed in the question, I would like to know what the grills on the side of the fan, which enable hot air flow out of the laptop, are called.
