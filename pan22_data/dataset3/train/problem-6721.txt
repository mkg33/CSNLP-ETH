Modifying your windows registry and not knowing how to "undo" it is very dangerous.
I have assumed several things in writing this and the most important is that you have a basic knowledge of modifying your windows registry.
No matter what when I add these to the "Startup" directory two instances are going to be started.
When I went into that folder and deleted all of the shortcuts, the duplicate entries disappeared.
Don't add that if you don't want to start it minimized.
The are very small and really can be considered a stand alone or portable program.
I also have checked this "Pinned" solution and the "recently opened" was not the problem.
I decided that research it more and I found out that if you look at this on the internet you find a alternative to using the "Startup" folder in Windows you can do it through the Windows Registry using "Regedit"
I have two two special programs that I want to start up automatically.
I had done a fresh install of Windows 7, but copied my user folder from the old install.
If you have never done a "regedit" or do not know what I am talking about here, don't do this.
Once I actually fixed this problem by mistake doing something else, so I have no idea what I did, but as luck would have it, before I had a change to follow up, I needed to do a restore from a backup so I went back to them starting twice and just did a manual kill after a restart.
At the very end I have put " /t" Which tell Windows to start it minimized in the system tray.
This included copying the C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\StartMenu folder.
    - One is just a very simple desktop clock program.
1 is Pinned, 2 is "recently opened" and #2 list can vary depending on which program you use and how often.
When I add a shortcut link or an actual .exe - I only put it in one "startup" folder for only my "user account" and not in any other  account.
Although windows showed the "pinned" icons in my start menu, it didn't actually show them as pinned.
That path is just when Windows can find the exe file I want to start.
    - Process Explorer is a "task manager replacement".
