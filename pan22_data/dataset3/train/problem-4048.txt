Create a seperate document titled "Cover Page...(your document title)".
I then choose the preset cover page sample called 'Perspective' which has a gradient background.
You will not be able insert any pages that you have been working on as separate document.
Remember to do this on the document you are actually working on.
Drag it by its handles to fit the extremities of the page.
Bonus: You can even make it look either like a normal page by page paper or a magazine-like paper!
Alternatively, if you are not forced to use Word, you could try using Publisher instead, which would definitely make life so much easier on this aspect.
I use Microsoft Word 2010 and I simply insert a cover page at the top of the document from the Insert tab.
I remove/change the mountain picture as required and change the colour of the gradient or change it into a solid fill, use a pattern, texture or even picture backgrounds as usual.
So dumb that in 2010 they still can't create different cover page color as has been requested for years, but this work around is so much easier than other options I have heard.
If you want to insert different coloured pages in between, then you can try setting the page margins to 'narrow' from the page layout tab and then simply draw a rectangle or insert a coloured text box that is as big as the borders and then choose 'send backward'--> 'send behind text' from the format tab.
This a bit of an advanced method but super effective and requires the use of "InDesign" if you want to go the extra mile and you're allowed to Submit in a .PDF format.
You get to view side-by-side with your document when creating your table of contents (if you have one).
We can use a rectangular shape and fill it with the color, or we can create a black picture in paint, and then can place it in word... remember to use 'send to background' after right clicking it :)
This way they save together in the document folder.
