Here's my ideal setup (if possible) -- there is a wifi network (lets call it bob's) with which I want access to, but I have a few other wifi-connected computers on my network which I want to keep behind a firewall.
I cannot use a PCI card because the server is a micro ATX Atom PC.
Also, to do routing I'd need to connect two ethernet cables between the server and the AP (because you can't do routing/QoS on virtual devices) -- which isn't a problem really; but I'm not sure whether the AP will allow me to separate the public and private LANs.
Second part is that I want to have my own private wifi network off the back of this; can I then tell the AP to serve a new network called foobar.
Or, as well as the AP, am I better getting a wifi-to-ethernet adapter for the server?
However, if the private clients connect to the server via wifi, then aren't they exposed to the "public" network?
I could use a wifi usb, but this can be tricky to set up on headless linux; plus the signal strength is a bit lousy.
That is, if someone is savvy enough to scan for my IP range.
So I was thinking of buying a wireless access point so that I could set it up to connect to bob's network from the AP, and then from my server, connect to the AP via ethernet.
When I say private network, I mean that my server is actually a Debian linux install with routing configured (and I also do some QoS stuff on, etc).
If this question is a bit vague/spurious in places, please comment and I will explain in more detail.
So ideally, I'd like all the clients on the private network to be behind the server in terms of routing.
