So far worked fine and I haven't had any problems.
The 500gb is split in C:-System, G:-Games, H:-Games, F:-Misc
Sure, you can solve them by resizing the partitions but I can imagine more fun things to do.
And I still get a reinstall done in two days (including all software).
The only case where I ended up with multiple volumes was when I had multiple hard drives.
When partioning there almost always comes the point where one partition has plenty of space and another one doesn't.
A few years back almost all of them partitioned heavily between various components (temporary area, a few system ones, user data).
I realize that this is a Windows question and that there are advantages and disadvantages in partitioning but it is worth looking at how Linux distributions evolved.
In my experience it's just horribly inconvenient to partition which may or may not be a proper reason.
Since I have multiple computers retaining data on reinstall is not an issue, it's just a case of temporarily moving the non-replicated stuff over the network.
I see that this is getting rare now, the main ones just have one large root partition with everything in.
The other 230gb is split in E:-Backups, I:-Important Data, J:-Misc2
