PC has this problem occasionally also, but rarest of all.
The device has a WiFi AP capability - I have set up the WiFi and I am accessing the network from 2 different iPads, 2 PCs and an Android phone.
I got a dedicated WiFi router (TP-Link WR740N), connected it to the DLink and turned off WiFi on the D-Link.
I am trying to set up ADSL and WiFi in a country home.
I have bought a DLink DSL-2640 modem-router for this.
I am assuming that this is a problem of the device - ADSL and WiFi might be too much for it.
This goes on for 5-10 minutes or so, then it passes away.
The device is connected to the ADSL, everything works fine.
After a while the Internet stops responding - I can't load the router's web interface.
EM interference is very unlikely since it's a country home and there are no wifi networks around.
After a few hours of work I begin to notice that one of the iPads is taking to long to load pages - it even can't load the router's web interface.
I tried switching WiFi channels, switched the router to g-only mode.
WiFi is functional, I can disconnect and connect a device, device obtains an address through DHCP.
I updated both devices to the latest official firmware.
I am at a loss and don't know how to debug this further.
