These hyperlinks are broken, and the improperly coded HTML files will not work.
Right now my plan is to use an .htaccess to make all requests case insensitive, but I wanted to make sure I am thinking of any adverse effects this might have.
Are there some other serious consequences of this that I may not be thinking of?
They have also been sending out hyperlinks to those files in all lowercase.
Since the server was windows, and case-insensitive, it was simply forgiving this and everything would function fine regardless.
I just wanted to get a few other opinions and options together.
Now that the files have migrated to a case-sensitive file system.
The people who were previously uploading files (usually simple html files and images) were following the very poor practice of capitalizing some characters in the folder and file names, then entering the filenames with incorrect case in their html code.
I am migrating all the data from an old Windows FTP server to a Linux environment, and have run into some issues.
I know it could have a serious effect on dynamically generated pages or links, but since this is just a simple staging server, and we only use it to show sample files, we aren't going to be doing any of that anyway.
