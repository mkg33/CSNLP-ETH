Seconding 3dinfluence, are you sure this is a VPS?
I got subversion running after using rpm to install loads of stuff, but now I want to install Trac I can't find the packages I need.
Why would yum be disabled on a VPS especially when rpm isn't?
A workaround may be to find an RPM for Yum and its dependencies.
Is there a (easy) way to find and install rpm-packages and all their dependencies?
Are you sure it's a VPS b/c that should be your virtual machine to do what you wish with it.
My problem is I want to install more software on there (like Trac) but I'm having a hard time.
Most VPS providers allow full root access to allow you to install almost any kind of software.
The only reason I can think is that they do not want you install software.
Maybe the proper course of action is to work with them to get trac installed on your VPS?
Sounds like a recipe to screw up a machine and end up in rpm dependency hell real quick.
If this doesn't work try to install CentOS in a local machine and put keepcache=1 in /etc/yum.conf.
Upload the rpms to your server and install them with the rpm command.
They have also disabled compilers, so downloading source and installing that with make is no option either.
But right now it sounds like you're on the fast track to RPM Hell :)
It needs python, which needs other libraries, which all seem to require each other...
I've got a VPS with CentOS 5 where my company hosts a subversion repo.
After "yum install trac", trac and all the dependencies are saved in /var/cache/yum .
Yes, it's called Yum :)  So why did the hosting company disable yum?
If you can get that installed you may be able to use Yum.
Yum is known to puke itself trying to use under 200MB RAM.
Most tutorials tell me to use yum to install packages, but it has been disabled by the hosting company.
