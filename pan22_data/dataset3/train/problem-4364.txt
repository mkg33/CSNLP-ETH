Much easier than trying to adapt a picture to a shape, especially if you want to add text in it somewhere.
And sometimes the way you do things comes down to what best fits your workflow.
Why not just create a word document called 'shapes library' and save them in that.
I suggest making your own custom template with all the shapes you often use.
Then all you need to do is open it when you want to access the shape and copy it on to the clip board.
However, this saves some time compared to doing it externally..
Being in position that required writing of significant number of "how-to" documents, I have had the same need; the solution I found that worked best for me was to use:
Using the MS Clips Organizer is not necessarily better than the cut & paste from a shapes template suggested by COT either (a technique I have used as well), this is just another option.
It is in the All Programs\Microsoft Office...Office Tools folder in the Start Menu.
In the end, it is not as quick and easy as having them in the Insert Shapes menu, but it's faster than customizing on the fly.
