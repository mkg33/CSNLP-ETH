Some will actually do nothing (not even keep a note they were ordered to zero out some area) when you unplug them "soon enough" after requesting a/some trim(s) - and "soon enough" here means "[even tens of] seconds after the request".
When you require a safe wipe, look whether the drive manufacturer provides some utility to do this, that would take care to really zero out all of the areas of the drive ...
So just overwrite (regardless of the drive type), no zeroing necessary or (from now on it's about flash drives) even easily possible.
Even when they are sent a "trim" request (mark the block as free and zero it out), a lot of flash drives take the approach "yeah, I'll do it some time in the future, when I'll feel like it".
Most of them will, on write, choose one of the free, least used blocks (they actually have more capacity then advertised, just as HDDs have space reserved for remapping of bad blocks), write the content to the new block, remember that this block now stores content of "offset xyz" and release the old block to the "free pool".
Zeroing before write just adds a slight check that two writes succeeded (and it steals some of your precious time).
What you are trying to do is absolutely pointless, regardless of medium (why zero out whatever, when I'm gonna overwrite it in a second ?).
And it is (if possible) even more pointless in context of solid-state / flash drives.
