On some level, you're going to have to manage gamestates, your video hardware, audio hardware, etc.
I've been using SFML for a while, it's an object-oriented API which has a lot of examples on the site for you to learn from, as well as tutorials.
I highly recommend OpenGL for starting your game programming exercises.
Even better, SFML is not C++ exclusive, it works with the following languages:
And the nice thing is, you can use OpenGL with it and the Qt framework as well.
A very nice starting point for 2D development in C++ is SFML.
SDL is cross-platform, open-source, works with C++ natively, and has great documentation and tutorials to get you started.
If you are confused whether to use 1.6 or 2.0 I'd suggest going with 2.0 because eventually you'll still have to upgrade.
I think it's a nice starting point for 2D development, but if you want alternatives you can try out Allegro or SDL
While it can be a good learning experience to dabble with DirectX, DirectSound, and the like, if you immediately want to make a game, it's best to use some layer of abstraction.
For links and tutorials, I think you should be able to actually learn to display some primitive shapes such as a triangle first.
Such tutorials on basic display is all over the web and youtube.
2D game is basically flatted display in terms of 3D.
