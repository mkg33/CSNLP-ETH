This is not so important, since I can re-enter database credentials, but I'm looking to the future.
A 'mastermind' could crack it but they would need a lot of access anyway.
Maybe the "projects" can share connection credentials / pointers within the same "solution"?
Pentaho's isn't great but you can at least store some of the database credentials is encrypted format, and they are blocked out in GUIs.
I want to avoid re-entering/ losing credentials in the future.
Are they encrypted to his username, and now that he's long gone, unrecoverable?
At the same time, my predecessor left --- and I have no idea where the credentials are.
There, I learned to have scripts load data to a [VariableDB].
I take it config files and/ or connection managers --- they can be shared between packages within the same "project?".
I'd prefer not to store any database passwords in plain text.
SSIS --- well, it might be the opposite, maybe not.
That way, I can either initiate that VariableDB at runtime to "ProdDB" or even set the variable to different DBs within the script, temporarily, whatever.
If SSIS scripts and jobs are running on the same SQL DB server, are they stored somewhere?
I know there are probably a few ways of doing this, but what's a simple way so that if I have 5 packages pointing to "TheFinanceDatabase" I can easily swap out the database host server, name, user, password, etc?
Point is, I don't have to go through tons of files changing database names too often unless some major architecture changes.
