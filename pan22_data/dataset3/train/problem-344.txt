I've a feeling that my configuration is not valid - as it stands, but I'm not sure.
I want to use ICS to allow one machine (with the MBB modem) to act as the Internet interface and allow other machines connected to the ADSL router (including a new Android tablet by WiFi) to use the single mobile broadband connection.
In the end, I decided to go with a PocketWiFi modem/router.
I bought it outright (no plan) and popped the SIM I was already using into it.
Due to circumstances, I have only got mobile broadband where I am living.
I have a small network with a ADSL Router (but which isn't connected to the Internet.
Might be easier to cut out the middle man (the router) and just share the internet connection directly through the machine with the stick, using an Ad-Hoc network.
Use this software on your PC that has mobile broadband, it will turn it into a wireless Hotspot for other PC's.
At less than AU$80 it provided a much more versatile solution.
Can some kind soul lead me "by the nose" to getting this working?
