But this being my first MP game, i need some advice about how to keep players in sync with the server game, my questions could be.
I thought of sending data to each client 4 times every seconds, containing information for all entities on the board.
However i can imagine this would be a lot of work, and i wanted to ask if there was a smarter solution, i've looked at some post around the net, but could't find any which would apply for my game, feel free to throw links my way.
This is how the game works as of today, when a new game is created, the server initialise a master game, basicly all logic happens here, it tell clients what to visualize.
I am currently working on a Multiplayer TD, players can join games, and place towers on a map, so far so good.
"What to do, if a player plays with a poor internet connection, and having a latency jumping from 400ms to 3000ms"
"What to do, if a player looses contact to the server for several seconds, therefore getting out of sync"
This data i would then compare to the client data, and overrule entities that is out of sync, there would then be a tolerate value, so the users would't experience changes on the board, because of small game delays.
