Maybe you could use incron which uses inotify to launch commands based on file system activity.
You should be able to use Linux auditing to add a watch on the drive's mountpoint, then monitor the logs with ausearch after the event to find out what file was read from or written to (if any), and what process did it, audit can watch for reads, writes, executes and attribute changes on any filesystem (as long as it's supported on your system – it should be).
In Linux, the recent-ish fanotify syscall enabled a nice utility called fatrace that informs on which process is hitting which file either for the whole system or a particular partition.
I have enable "spindown" on one of my Linux server's drives, which is only accessed by a BitTorrent client - meaning, when I don't have torrents running, nothing else should be accessing the disk and waking it up from spindown (right?
You could then possibly watch the mount point and use incron to trigger lsof to look for which process is accessing it.
But something is making the disk spin up every 15 minutes or so.
Definitely my favourite tool for this sort of thing:
