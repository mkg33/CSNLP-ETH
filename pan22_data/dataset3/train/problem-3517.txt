I have three HDDs for programs and data and a SSD for my C: drive.
After the hardware switch, Windows started right up and loaded the basic drivers.
I did do a full backup and image creation on a bootable disc before I started also.
If you have any Acronis product with this feature maybe you can use it to create a drive/partition image.
Use O&O Diskmage with the Machine Independent Restoration (MIR) technology.
No issues with them and no network/sharing/homegroup/printer issues.
I've come across a couple of single-user-license programs that simply needed to have the license key re-entered but that's it.
I was facing the same issue with a mobo & cpu upgrade last month.
If not, you can give Universal Restore a shot or perform a repair install of the OS.
First simply try booting up and see whether Windows can handle the change by itself.
I do have Acronis TruImage that has Universal Restore built in to it but didn't need to use it.
I had to reactivate Windows but that wasn't a problem as their automated call process worked fine.
At the very least you will need to reactivate it and install your new chipset drivers.
I had to call Adobe to get my Photoshop and Photoshop Elements programs re-activated.
Another option might be to use Acronis' so called "Universal Restore" feature, which supposedly (I've never tried it) allows you to restore your Windows system image to a different hardware environment.
Tip: Before you start the hardware switch, deactivate all Adobe products and deauthorize your computer in iTunes if iTunes is installed.
