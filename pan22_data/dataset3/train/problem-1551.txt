I can do this easily if I open only a single occurrence of the meeting.
I only want to move the start/end time on my calendar.
But when you need to edit the time for a RECURRING meeting, you need to click on the "Reccurence" icon, then choose "Custom" to go to the pane that you originally used to set up the recurrance.
I didn't create the meeting in the first place, and I don't want to change the time for other users that are invited to the meeting.
I have a situation where I have a few reoccurring meetings in my Outlook calendar for which I want to change the start and end time for.
When I logged out and logged in as that user, I was then able to adjust the appointment.
At the bottom right, it said who had created this recurring appointment.
The confusion with this is that when you edit the time of a meeting, you do it in the first screen.
What you are looking for is the Recurrence button on the Appointment Series tab.
In my situation, I was able to view but not edit the recurring appointment.
When you click on the button it will bring up the recurrence details and you can change them.
