All well and good - keeping these objects in sync is a task to be done.
For example, if a Login (identified by SID) does not exist on a Secondary replica (regardless of username and password) and the system fails over to that replica, then the corresponding principal will fail to authenticate.
I see the Primary's SIDs for logins such as ##MS_SQLAuthenticatorCertificate## do not exist on either of the other nodes.
However on those other nodes, there exists a login with the same name and a different SID, but that SID is the same between those two nodes, viz:
I have a case with three nodes; the third being read-only.
Will a failover work despite these Logins having mismatching SIDs between some replicas?
As I understand it, server-level objects must be kept in sync (aside: then why isn't it part of AG by default?).
I read these are for internal system use only, so I would expect the DB engine to maintain SIDs across replicas if that's required.
I am reading mixed messages about server level object syncing between replicas in an Availability Group.
