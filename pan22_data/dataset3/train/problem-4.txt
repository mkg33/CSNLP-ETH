But v1,v2,v4 and v5 would have non-zero normals since v1 is guaranteed to have a non-zero density and at least 1 of x,y or z would be non-zero.
So if v1 is the only vertex whose density value is 1 and the density value for all 7 other vertices is zero then v3,v6,v7 and v8 would have normals of zero (assuming the adjacent cubes were empty).
To create those normals the algorithm would need density values from the surrounding cubes but not the normals of the surrounding cubes.
When reading a paper like this one (ie one that has been used around the world to visualize life saving data, and help countless people) if I think I have found an error I stop and take a long hard look for my mistake instead of looking for the mistake of the authors.
The paper doesn't say to compute the normals for the 8 "cubes" around the cube in question.
Interpolating those normals to the triangle with vertices at e1,e4 and e9 should give a normal pointing roughly at v7.
It is saying to compute the normals for all the vertices of the cube you are testing.
