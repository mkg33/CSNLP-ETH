There is not a simple tool or existing script for this that I am aware of.
If 2016sp1 is the earliest version you need to support then almost everything is available in all editions so you can use Express and not even have any licensing costs for that one instance.
In terms of scanning for the use of functions added in a specific version (or enabled by a specific compatibility level) something could be written using the documentation from MS though that might not catch calls via ad-hoc SQL if your stored procedure and other use that pattern for anything, and you'll need to do further research to cover changes to undocumented functions.
That would only be one extra instance you need to add to your CI/Test/other processes.
Would it not be acceptable to test against the minimum version you need to support, rather than testing against every version from that onwards?
You might get away with that with prior versions too, if you don't use any features that were standard-/enterprise- only prior to 2016sp1.
