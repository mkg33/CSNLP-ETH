My problems went away entirely after this was performed.
I have the same issue despite I have a fresh install since I just bought a new computer with Windows 8 pre-installed and it can't be that I have to refresh the installation again.
It has to be the whole Windows root folder (which was not set with me initially).
I checked all standard hints I found but everything was fine.
I learned that the Metro apps have special access restrictions on Deskop PCs (x86) only.
Actually only the advanced apps like games or calculator didn't work but the simple apps like weather or maps worked.
Fortunately one of the first subfolders I checked was "C:\Windows" and Bingo!
I hope this helps all who were also almost there with Metro apps :-)
However, it can't be that Metro apps have full control on system root "C:\" because this would open up a large security hole and thus I reverted this change and started checking on subfolders.
This is why tablet PCs or Smartphones don't experience this issue.
I know this is a bit old, but I recently ran in to this same problem.
For me the answer was adding full access for ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES to the folder
My ultimate resolution was to delete the SRUDB.DAT file and let windows recreate it.
This security change is completely uncritical as actually everbody has such rights on the Windows root folder.
I added "ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES" to the C:\ security options, and gave it full control.
Btw somewhere on the MS web it says that these rights have to be set on "C:\Windows\system32" only (which is true as it was set with me) but it is not sufficient.
