No not at all, you only need to get a version of XAMPP that has the extension available.
I'd also like to know exactly why one has to recompile all of PHP instead of, say, tweaking a php.ini setting or adding a new module.
Unless you can find it has a plug in but something called System V Shared memory im going to assume wouldn't come as a plugin :(
if its not installed get a version of XAMPP with this feature installed or you have to recompile
if u cant enable an option look at your cofiguration file (in this case php.conf or php.ini on windows).
this will help u see the option if if its installed.
You then compile everything into the PHP binary and not into a shared library file.
Does this mean it's impossible for me to use semaphore functions?
For tweaking your php.ini as you coin it, you would need an external library file, see the PHP ext directory.
Because the modules sources are part of PHP sources.
In fact, a quick google came up with this http://www.php.net/manual/en/sem.installation.php , so no sorry :(
