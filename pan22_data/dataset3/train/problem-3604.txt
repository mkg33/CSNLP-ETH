In addition to what I need, who matches those needs?
If the site starts getting busy, you can start thinking about a VPS, but shared hosting is much cheaper and easier and sufficient in many cases.
AWS and Linode are two great options(AWS is free for a micro).
A VPS gives you root access to a server of your choosing.
If you're in the UK, I'd recommend Heart Internet (the Home Pro package offers what you need, they have auto-installers too).
I assume the store will be a Drupal module, in which case you'll probably only need one database.
It is mostly informational but in the future it could grow and I would possibly implement drupal and store login credentials in a DB.
I would shy away from a hosting provider that offers anything 'unlimited' though.
What do I "need" in a hosting service from what I have described?
I would actually recommend a VPS if you're willing to take on the technical requirements.
I am looking to create a site that people can visit to be informed and updated about this game.
They offer all sorts of security and stuff for $239437.33.
A few friends and myself are working on a game for Android.
If you can find one with a Drupal auto-installer, even better.
If you're not technically inclined enough to take on a server; look for a host that offers php/mysql(most do) and that should do you.
I'd probably start with shared hosting that offers PHP (version 5.2+) and MySQL.
