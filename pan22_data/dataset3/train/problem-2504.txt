Although quantum mechanics and general relativity were unknown when Planck proposed his natural units, it later became clear that at a distance equal to the Planck length, gravity begins to display quantum effects, whose understanding would require a theory of quantum gravity.
Max Planck was the first to propose the Planck length, a base unit in a system of measurement he called "natural units".
I'd recommend storing everything in Planck Lengths.
Of course, you going to need a fairly large data type to store your measurements.
The Planck length, is the unit of length approximately 1.6 * 10^-35 metres.
All kidding aside, why not store the unit-of-measurement with the actual measurement (in a separate column of course, probably as a foreign key).
Meter lengths are an easy conversion of "x" meters divided by 1.6e+35.
The Planck length is deemed "natural" because it can be defined from three fundamental physical constants: the speed of light, Planck's constant, and the gravitational constant.
It is in the system of units known as Planck units.
The only time you'll need to convert the measurement is if you want to compare it to other measurements in a different unit.
This way when you are displaying the measurement you do not need to convert it at all.
I would go with m unit and int datatype, as meters are SI unit and int should be the fastest and the most memory effective.
Simply display the measurement, along with the unit of measure.
