It's a feature you can't live without once you've got to know it, and the implementation is great!
In Windows XP, you can run Windows Explorer as any other user, including "Administrator", by following the "Option 2" instructions on Aaron Margosis's blog post entitled RunAs with Explorer: http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/2004/07/07/175488.aspx.
This script turns on the "Launch folder windows in a separate process" setting for all new profiles that are created based on the machine's default user profile.
If your question relates to your own computer, I cannot recommend SudoWin enough: it allows you to perform the "sudo" trick (supposedly a well-known Linux/Unix command) under Windows.
This means that programs retain the preferences and settings they would have if they would run under your account (registry, user profile), but then with admin privileges, protected by the password of your own account.
[EDIT] And did I mention it's completely free (open source)?
I use this all the time, and so I have included the following *.cmd script in my new machine build process:
In other words: it lets you run programs under your own account, but with admin privileges.
