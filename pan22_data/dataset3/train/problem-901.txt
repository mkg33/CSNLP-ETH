I fix these computer free of charge for elder people.
I've tried with a couple of my OEM install disk, they install but won't activate with the # on the sticker, only my disk original #.
I can install linux on these computer to get them up and running but most of these people are windows familiar and have never heard of Ubuntu, Mint, etc.
My question is, if I use a Retail XPPro Install Disk or ISO to install, (if I find one, NOT BUYING) then insert prod key, will it be activated.
The County Library every two to three years has an auction and sells the computers that there customers have been using.
If you are going to tell me to get xppro iso, tell me where, I can't seem to find one
The OS was preinstalled by there suppliers, with administrative priviliges.
I have Win 7 iso that lets you do what I'm asking, but none of these computers have Win 7 installed.
I'm not sure how Microsoft is handling reinstall of legal copy of XP without original disk other than force you to BUY WIN 7.
I know XP is no longer supported and I heard all the Servers are shut down that do the activation.
Any suggestions on how to accomplish this task would be appreciated.
Library employees have no idea what the passwords are, no install disks, but they do have Prod Key sticker with legal numbers on the case, mostly Dell models.
