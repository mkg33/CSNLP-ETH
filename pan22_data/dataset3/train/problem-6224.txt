DFS Replication uses a compression algorithm known as remote differential compression (RDC).
Data goes in folder/s on ServerA, it gets synced to ServerB.
I have searched for similair solution and the easiest thing I have found was the http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp - free rsync-based solution.
It transfers only differences and can compress, so backup is rather fast, especially for low-speed connections.
   If trust is not already in place, adding it just for backup would not be a best idea from security point of view.
Then setup client on backup machine and bind it to server's folders created before.
Just execute server and set aliases for folders you're going to backup.
It works in a similar fashion to Dropbox, except for one major and very important difference: there is no "cloud" middleman.
The built in DFS replication sounds like it would work well for you.
RDC detects changes to the data in a file and enables DFS Replication to replicate only the changed file blocks instead of the entire file.
Once set up, no need to script anything - just drop files in the replicated folder, and they will copy to remote (1 or many locations) per the setup.
What you describe is very generic and can be done using array of solutions depending on your needs, from simple script using Robocopy to high end third party software.
Ive used this successfully over various wan links to remote locations very successfully.
I would use Resilio BTsync to simply backup/copy folders to another server, as you described.
