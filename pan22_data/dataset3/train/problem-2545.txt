The point of a PK is that it uniquely identifies that row.
Changing a primary key may have grave implications to the integrity of your data.. changing sex from “M” to “F” after other parts of your systems have established relationships to the “M” row may go unnoticed.
Now in a table that has a Foreign Key to another table, it's ok to update the FK if/when necessary.
However, I don't think there's much difference between "adding a new line and removing the old line", and just modifying the row itself.
I suppose you could write your own code to keep it straight but now your users are dependent on you instead of rock-solid database principles.
I’m not a philosopher so maybe I’m missing your point.
So really, when the data needs to change, create the PK on an auto-increment field and let people modify the rest of the data, or delete the entire record when necessary.
Hiding the key(s) somewhere in the row may sound good but all you have done is created a way to circumvent data integrity provided by the DBMS.
All of the concerns that others have brought up are still valid.
That's why you should be careful when creating a PK with a composite key (multiple fields that comprise the PK), because if those fields need to change, then you're changing your PK and any depending records need to change as well.
Once a record is created with a primary key, you really shouldn't be updating the primary key.
