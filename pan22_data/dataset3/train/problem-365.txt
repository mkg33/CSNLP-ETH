Just make sure that both lan's are on the same subnet and your ready to go.
If you can get away with only using one router, then you'll be golden.
One interface is internal, one is external DSL, and the other is external to the Cisco that has the T1 WIC.
I also configured mine for failover, so if one dies, the other handles the traffic (albeit poorly)
I don't know the best answer, but here's how I've got it setup:
In that case, your VPN endpoint would need to be that central router.
I'd only advise this for smaller networks and it's not optimum either, but it's very simple!
I'm routing all VPN traffic over the T1, and all internet traffic over the DSL.
If you don't have another layer 3 device closer to the hosts, then you'll likely need to setup host routes on the machines themselves pointing your PPTP traffic to the VPN router and a default route to the internet router.
The easiest solution would likely be to set all your clients to default route to the "internet" router - now assuming that is something more than just a $10 ASDL modem you should be able to enter the static routes on that device so that it forwards the PPTP stuff off to the right router for that.
If you can't, you may need to get a third routing device that decides which path to send the packets down.
The key device in this setup is my Juniper Netscreen SSG5.
if your having trouble understanding layer 3 routing and ip tunnels then you can use openvpn in layer 2 mode.
Sounds like you've got a decent handle on the solution:
