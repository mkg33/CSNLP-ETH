That'll leave some room for other stuff and the filesystem cache (mysql on here?
More than enough to cause your c1.small instance to swap.
Once you tune that watch the graphs over time and see if you have room to go up or down.
First off you can lower your maxclients to around 150.
I'd say the next few things I'd be looking to check are
 - does the apache error log mention hitting maxclients
have apache do less (mix of cdn, alternative http servers, and http proxy options) 3.)
Setup apache's mod_status (probably already there just uncomment it) and point munin/collectd/cacti at it.
RSS is a rough metric to extrapolate like this its just all we got.
If you confirm the cause is memory exhaustion and swapping there's tons you can do from there.
 - is the memory usage growth slow and steady or spiky/rapid-onset
450 children with an RSS of around 10mb each is over 4GB of potential memory usage.
 - does dmesg or /var/log/messages mention OOM killer at all
The third you can do cli but graphs will help, and the fourth you need graphs.
Swapping is almost always a downward spiral for apache servers.
skinnier apache children (fewer modules, tighten up the php config) 2.)
