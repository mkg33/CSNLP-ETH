Valve reports that for the gel-splatting in Portal 2, applying individual decals for each splat would have become too performance-intensive.
Instead, they re-used the second set of UV coordinates generated for all the level geometry as part of their lightmapping process.
For Portal 2 with its larger levels, this map's resolution per world meter is relatively low.
To paint a particular spot on a wall, you look up that spot's corresponding texels in the gel map texture and set them to your paint colour.
When you expect to be painting a large percentage of your level, applying it as one consistent layer tends to scale better than applying large numbers of overlapping decals.
apply your texture to the projected texture coordinates
By creating a "gel map" texture, they could use these UVs to overlay gel onto any of this geometry.
I wouldn't be surprised if Splattoon uses a similar technique.
By mixing this alpha with the falloff from the gel map, they turn the gel map's low-res bilinear interpolation falloff into a more detailed-looking splatter edge.
This was based on Tag: the Power of Paint, where the levels were small enough that this map could be displayed directly with reasonable resolution, so they could stamp detailed splatter patterns into it directly.
To mask the artifacts, they combine this with a tiling normal map for the surface of the gel, which has a blotchy pattern in the alpha channel.
This second UV channel unwraps every triangle of the level to a unique portion of the lightmap texture.
Without some images or mock-ups of what you want the desired result to be, my first guess would take use a splatter image as a texture & then project it as a decal.
