ImageMagick has a command line utility that can join images into what it calls a "montage."
All files need to be in the same folder, and have a filename ending in a 4 digit number.
It is written in Java, the github repo is here: https://github.com/darkFunction/darkFunction-Editor
I use it very frequently for building spritesheets.
Website for the project is: http://darkfunction.com/editor
My graphics designer has made graphics in separate PNG files.
The Compass framework has a sprite generation tool.
It can be tiring getting the right command line parameters to do what you want, but it's a very powerful and flexible tool.
You can download Processing for free at Processing.org.
I could probably code something myself, but why re-invent the wheel :)
It supports automatic sprite selection, combining images, sprite grouping, and multi-sprite animation with rotation.
Is there a clever tool/script that mashes them into a spritesheet?
I don't know if I understood question correcttly but I know the software that operates with textures and makes animation, sprite sheets anf .gif animations.
I have decided to open source my 2D spritesheet and animation tool.
