Personally I always create at least three partitions (boot, often changing data and static data).
To answer the question in your title:  No, you do not need a separate data partition.
The others 16 (usually 7%-ish) are not visible to the end user.
Any modern SSD comes with spare sectors which are not visible to the OS.
With regular end user usage there is no need to worry.
No, you not need 10% free space on any modern SSD.
Now if you are going to do consistent heavy writes to the disk, 24/7, for 20 or 30 years then it can help to consider these things.
And with a relative small disk fewer partitions might be preferred.
And SSD will often last over 10 years, and by that time they are obsolute and will be replaced by newer hardware.
Storing data in a folder or on a separate partition works just as well, but it is often quite useful when things break and you want to recover information.
But with a modern SSD and <10years of usage there is no need anymore.
Anyone telling you otherwise is using outdated information.
