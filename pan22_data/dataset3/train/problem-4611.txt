Even if this user closes the database, they remain the 'file owner' of this file until the last user closes the db and the locking file is deleted.
After this, if anyone tries to reopen the db, they get a 'file in use' error.
I am troubleshooting a difficult to solve MS Access file access problem which has so far defeated every Microsoft Access MVP.
The way Access works is that when a user opens an Access db, Access creates a special locking file and makes the first user to open the database the 'file owner'.
The key to this seems to be that the 'file owner' is not set.
We have the front end in a shared folder, and the permissions are such that only certain people have write access.
We keep the data in a separate database that has appropriate permissions set, as it's a SQL server, but this would also work if the data is placed in a Read/Write share, and the front end in a Read only share
This means that Access cannot create the lock file, and everyone can use it.
Well for a certain group of users (and only them), when they are the file owner and another person closes the db, the file owner disappears from the file properties.
