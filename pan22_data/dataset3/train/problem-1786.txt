Simply cut the shortcut from the desktop and paste it into the previously opened folder and it should be perfectly fine.
What the most awesome is you can use VBoxHeadlessTray to configure each one of your VMs.
Just create a shortcut to <VirtualBoxDirectory\VBoxManage.exe> startvm "vmname" --type headless and put that in your startup folder.
It's really easy to use, which automatically restore VM's state when Windows boot up and save state when Windows shutdown or restart.
You can actually start a VM headlessly without resorting to a third-party VBoxVmService now.
The start up directory does still exist, albeit in a well hidden place...
Access it via opening the "Run" box (Win+R) and entering
As previously stated by chad and gonesoft, you can use VboxManage.exe to start the VM on launch, however, if you do not specify "--type headless" it will actually show up in the VirtualBox Manager as running etc.
Open VirtualBox and right click on the VM you want to autostart, click the option to create a shortcut on the desktop and close VirtualBox.
just like as if you had started it normally, headless is what makes it hidden - not something you'd likely want to do in all cases...
