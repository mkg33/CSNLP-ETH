You may wish to consider a server with a redundant PSU, however you would be looking at significantly more expensive hardware, such as a HP ML330
I'm a bit of a HP geek and would warn you off that model and suggest you go for the ML150 if you have the budget for the following reasons;
Now obviously the ML150 is more expensive than the ML110 but I genuinely believe the upgrade is worthwhile to give you the ability to expand your CPU, memory and disk seamlessly in the future if needed.
I would recommend picking up the add-on that gives the RAID card some cache, that can provide a significant performance improvement.
Bare in mind however that HP don't officially support Ubuntu so you might want to check for drivers and also that HP don't officially support non-HP disks on any of their controllers, again you should be fine but perhaps do some research first.
We run a FreeNAS file server for network-based backups with 5.25 TB on one box (removed the CD-ROM for bay and SATA port) and another as a low-end NAS using only the software RAID in the OS -- this performs adequately, but using the onboard RAID with some added cache for more high performance storage as @sysadmin1138 mentions makes quite a difference.
We have both ML110 G5 and G6es, and have had great luck with them considering the price.
Furthermore the benefit of the redundant PSU is reduced, unless you can put them on separate feeds.
I would recommend putting whatever you buy on UPS backed power however.
