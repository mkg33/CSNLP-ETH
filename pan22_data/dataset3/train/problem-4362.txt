In order to place a file in RAM that does not exist on a local disk but can be accessed by other programs, you need to have a filesystem inside the RAM.
That said, were you to use a RAM drive and open the file, it would still make a copy of the program from RAM to RAM anyway.
So long answer short, it is not possible, but it is likely not going to be the solution you are after anyway.
The reason is that everytime you setup the RAM drive and copy the files there, you have to undergo quite a procedure which can be analysed and traced more easily than if the file is stored with security in place on the harddisk itself.
If it is speed, then you have to understand that a file of a few KB or MB will will not be that much slower than RAM.
If it is security, you should note that a filesystem is more secure than RAM anyway.
When you open the file from disk, it will be copied to RAM and then executed, its just that another program that wants to access this file will also do the same, giving you more copies of the program.
This way, they can still see the C drive, but they can't do much unless a user with sufficient rights is logged in.
If this is indeed the goal, you will want to give the user limited rights and set security permissions on the C drive accordingly.
One last reason I can think of that you want to accomplish, is that you need to stop the user from accessing files on the C drive and so your goal is to hide the C drive and have the program they use accessible by other means.
Given that Windows 7 can't natively create one without external tools, you need third-party software.
