5- Plain labels with strong adhesive (or covered with a layer of clear packing tape) do just fine in virtually every application in the server room.
It prints out so that the label is applied "normally" and you can even have multiple lines.
They are a strip of tough, clear tape with a small, white printable area at one end.
3- They are difficult to remove without risking damage to the cable.
My first hit on google is this company (there are other sizes and types).
I have never seen one fall off or become unreadable whre almost all others have.
You may be dead set on the heat shrink labels, but I personally prefer the IDPal.
Everyone else seems to do it this way, too -- nearly every data center I've been in does it this way.
Same here -- the heat shrink labels seem like a nice idea, and in some situations it might be ideal, but I found it cumbersome.
2- They are doubly difficult to apply in a tight space.
I just use a Brother label maker with 1/2" laminated white tape looped over the cable as a flag.
I like the idea of heat shrink labels, but after some use I have found them to be over-rated for the server room.
There are varieties for laser printers (on a sheet) and for label makers (on a spool).
We bought our first one because the electricians that run most of our cabling suggested it (it's the one they use as well) and have not been disappointed.
