The prolem is that changes made on the previous laptop are not showing up, instead within dropbox, a new folder is automatically created which contains “conflicts”.
So there seems to be a problem with the syncing of the database.
I have a ton of pictures on my computer (Mac 10.9.2) and I am using Picasa.
- it would be great if this can also be realized including a Windows 8 and another Windows 7 PC
would be great to hear if somebody has a solution for this.
It seems that the database file is located on each mac individually whereas the the actual pictures are located on dropbox.
- pictures are not simultaneously worked on on different macs, ...only me moving from one Mac to another.
Problem: I open picasa on my mac laptop and add pictures, modify existing pictures and delete some other pictures.
It happens that picasa is opened simultaneously on two or three different macs.
I think this is just an issue with proper linking of the database files.
I already tried storing all my pictures on Dropbox and directing Picasa to those Dropbox folders....this has given me problems / conflicts as changes on one Mac do not properly show up on the other.
changes will be made simultanously so it would be good to have some sort of pop up upon hitting the save button, advising the user that changes are currently being made on another computer.
I have another 3 Macs on which I would like to have all pictures synchronized.
on each mac, picasa is directed to the dropbox folder, which contains the pictures.
