As such, your next swipe for a "forward" rotation just causes the camera to spin in place.
You describe your problem rotating a cube, but it seems to me that you are having the camera orbit around the cube.
If you want the camera to move around the cube as well as the background and everything else, then you should use axes of rotation that are relative to the camera.
I've been working on a project where I have a cube.
However, the vectors you are using for the axes of rotation are in world space, and do not rotate with the camera.
If the rotation of the object is (0, 0, 0), it works fine.
If you want a fixed background, where the cube is the only thing that moves, you will have to rework the code to rotate the cube with respect to a fixed camera.
Both the camera and the cube start with rotations of 0, 0, 0.
But if I, for example, rotate once to the left and then tried rotate fowards, the cube will correctly rotate left, but then the forward rotation will rotate on the Z axis and just spin the cube (So the face looks like its moving in right in a clockwise direction).
Instead of Vector3.forward, Vector3.left, and Vector3.up, you should use transform.forward, transform.right, and transform.up (with appropriate signs for the two directions of rotation).
The script is placed on the camera, with the rotateAround transform object been set as a cube.
However, when i go to swipe up and down (To rotate the cube 90 forwards) it becomes slightly unstuck.
After you have rotated left by 90 degrees, Vector3.left is now facing directly into the camera.
When swiped left, the cube will rotate 90 degrees the left, and then when swiped right, the cube will rotate 90 degrees to the right.
