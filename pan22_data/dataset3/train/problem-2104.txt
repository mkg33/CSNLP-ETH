Just type stats at the blank prompt; if it's working you'll get a load of output.
You can find the benchmarks and write-up here - although it is for WordPress it should work for Drupal as it is very likely a permissions issue.
Took a while to figure out the right settings, and how to connect to a unix local domain socket via busybox.
as mysql does), but only root can write there, so create /var/run/memcached and chown it to nobody, then set /var/run/memcached/memcached.sock as the socket path.
Memcached drops privileges before it creates its socket, though after it's written its PID.
I benchmarked the performance boost of using memcached unix sockets, it is 33% faster to use unix sockets in my tests using the php cli.
You can check it's working by using netcat to connect to it:
You may find that just setting the socket path doesn't work.
Writing it to /tmp would work too, but by its very nature that could get trashed; sticking it in /var/run is a bit more permanent.
I found that it is important to add the memcache user to the www-data group and give the unix socket 775 permissions, this way both the php handler and memcache user can execute it.
Note if you are using an alpine container in Kubernetes the pod spec with health probes would look something like this:
