When I do this, the only network I see available to connect to is Auto eth0, which I can see is provided by my router.
I would like to change that to something else, like zacs-sandbox, however I have one hang-up that is preventing me from taking the next step.
I am not a "systems guy" and am setting up a home network for the very first time.
But if I change the name of my router's SSID to, say, zacs-sandbox, I don't think my wired Ubuntu desktop will show the reflected change from Auto eth0 to zacs-sandbox.
When I go into the router config page (192.168.1.1) I see the section where I can name my SSID.
I know this because I can only access the router config page from that machine when it's connected to the router.
I am connecting that machine to my router via Cat(5?)
I have a desktop running Ubuntu that does not have a wireless card and I am intentionally keeping it that way.
Changing the SSID only affects what's broadcast over wireless; it'll have no effect on wired connections.
My question: I understand the term SSID to be the name of the WLAN, which would be the wireless network I am broadcasting from that router.
What do I need to do to change Auto eth0 to the same name as my SSID?
