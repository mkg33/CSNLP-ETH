This sets up the AD and Exchange with the correct IP addresses, and should help you figure out some of the routing and remote-access issues when the system is across the hall instead of around the world.
If you can, simulate the networking topology by creating a subnet that matches where the exchange server will live once it arrives overseas.
I would try to do the installation as much as possible over Remote Desktop, or if necessary the remote-KVM.
Once the thing is connected and ready to communicate over a VPN of some sort, start the exchange install.
I would insist on servers with remote-KVM capability -- like the HP iLO or Sun's eLOM or Dell's DRAC.
That way you can toggle the power remotely and interact with the system console during boot, eliminating the need to physically touch the computer unless there's something wrong with the hardware.
I would say get it setup as much as you can with the easy stuff like updates and light config.
That way you are getting used to managing the server without being physically present.
