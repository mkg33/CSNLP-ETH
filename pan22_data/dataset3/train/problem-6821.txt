If you're doing it locally, you're doing clustering, and people have been doing it for the stuff you're talking about for a good while now.
This is the easier way to run a Beowulf HPC (AFAIK).
Both of those projects are currently running BOINC which is pretty nice.
Popular clustering frameworks include Beowulf/Scyld, openMosix (no longer in development, but still used), OSCAR, or MPI
Does something like this exists - and if so what is it called and where do I find it?
I have 7 PC's around the house that total more than 10Ghz in CPU power.
Grid Computing, a term which is often used synonymously with "Cloud Computing") like those used for SETI@home, or Folding@Home.
The "Cloud" is basically shorthand for "my processes are the problem of some provider out on the internets."
If your choice will be some flavour of GNU/Linux, I'll suggest you to take a look at OSCAR (Open Source Cluster Application Resources).
There are also distributed processing algorithms (i.e.
If you're selling that computing power to someone one on the internet, you're their cloud.
I was wondering if I could put them to use building my own "cloud computing" network to help with rendering videos, blender animations, Photoshop effects, or anything else.
Ubuntu have wrapped a nice Enterprise Cloud thats great for running 'basic' services instead of high end computing stuff.
Eg if you are looking for a fail proof apache setup etc etc UEC is very good, especially considering its ability to expand to Amazons EC2 if the cluster reached capacity.
