It should be safe to check the Release notes for Debian 7 and just follow the upgrade procedure to ensure you properly complete the process.
In apt cache configuration you can also set different path maps to map a URL to a different upstream server.

I have multiple machines running Debian 6 (Squeeze) and 7 (Wheezy).
Yes differing Debian versions can use the same apt-cache.
I set up an Apt-Cacher server on a Debian 7 box, for the Debian 7 instances to use.
Then I did an apt-get update and an apt-get upgrade on the Debian 6 box, and of course it got all of the Debian 7 packages and upgraded.
path_map = debian ftp.uk.debian.org/debian ; security security.debian.org/debian-security ; archive archive.debian.org/debian ; volatile volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile ; backports backports.debian.org/debian-backports ; archive-backports archive.debian.org/debian-backports ; archive-security archive.debian.org/debian-security
I would be very grateful of some clarification on how the package repositories work with different versions - are they entirely separate?
I copied the sources.list from the Debian 7 box to the Debian 6 box, and forgot to change the wheezy references back to squeeze.
Can this also be used (with the same wheezy sources.list) by the Debian 6 instances?
For instance if you wanted to use archive.debian.org for Debian Lenny for instance which has been removed from the main Debian repo's.
As for if you have broken your Debian 6 server then it depends on the applications running there and if they are compatible with Debian 7.
The repositories upstream are shared, it's only the addition of the  name that affects the package set that will be used.

If you specifically need Debian 6, I would advise a re-install.
