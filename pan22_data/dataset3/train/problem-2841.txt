I can't tell if it will run monitors nicely on your setup, but I'd expect it to run a two monitors at 1920x1200 with no problems.
If my sources are correct, i5 should have better integrated GPU.
I wouldn't count on it running Crysis too well, though, but you don't seem concerned about that.
It will be more than adequate for displaying general use things like text documents, emails, spreadsheets, and webpages.
You might possibly run into trouble with, say, real-time graphs of the stock market, because that's some heavy 2D drawing, but even then my hunch is you'd be fine, with at worst some barely-noticeable hiccups.
U used a netbook with Atom N550 to drive a monitor running at 1920x1200 and the netbook's screen running at 800x600 and didn't have any problems at all for text work and development.
Resolution isn't actually that important when you're just doing static rendering.
(By comparison, I think these are an order of magnitude faster than USB->DVI external video adapters and THOSE display full HD monitors just fine.)
