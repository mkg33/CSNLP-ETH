The hcf function is unexpected, because it's just a wrapper for BigInteger.
I'm assuming you've worked out the math to do this without loops, which is good and probably more efficient.
I have the following questions with regards to the above code:
I think just using the built in GCD function would be better than making your own method that calls a standard function.
But, I don't really know how this would work, and would be worried someone else looking at the code would have the same problem.
A code comment indicating what mathematical principles, or even the name of a theorem, would help immensely.
Using BigInteger would increase the complexity of the program you can do it simpily.
1e9 is only 1 billion, which will fit into a standard integer range of 2 billion some.
If it's critical to the algorithm understanding that we think of a highest common factor instead of a greatest common denominator, then keep the function.
If you do keep it, though, use the full name instead of an abbreviation i.e.
