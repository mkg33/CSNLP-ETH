Just to put the above in perspective, there's not much the linux community can do to improve this without Apple's help and co-operation.
After connecting the USB, I get a window showing "Apple, Inc. iPod", with no contents but I cant browse using nautilus :(

At present, there's no non-fussy way of transferring data to iPod Touch from linux machines, Ubuntu included.
I just want to browse around the contents, add and delete as if a mass storage device.
What is the least fuss way of transferring data to iPod touch from ubuntu.
There is limited support in various add-ons and media players, but these are tenous at best, and quite often work with one specific version of the iPhone OS.
I have jailbroken my iPod Touch 2.0 and then you can actually mount it over the network with sshfs, and with libgpod4 convince rhythmbox to transfer songs.
iFuse claims to be able to communicate with iPod Touches that are not even jailbroken
However I needed the very unlikely combination of fresh libgpod4 with rhythmbox < 0.12 (0.11.x)
Even the /media/ doesn't contain an externally mounted drive.
