I think you should try xubuntu, its a light weight version of the normal ubuntu and ubuntu is known for being among the most user friendly linux flavor for beginners and powerful enough for experts as well.
It's lightweight, and has a great user community for questions/configuration/suggestions.
It's a distro built with Netbooks in mind, is based on Ubuntu, and uses Openbox for the window manager.
The interface for Openbox might take a little while to get used to, but it's definitely nice to have something different.
You might try Lubuntu - an LXDE based ubuntu variant.
I ran it for 6 months on my older laptop and am now running it in a VM on my Mac.
Ubuntu is probably the most user friendly, and in my experience, the best for learning linux if you're not used to it.
Since it's so old, your best bet is probably grab a few live CD's and try them out to see which ones run best on your hardware.
It's not my first choice for editing on a really anemic machine.
Ubuntu also has most of the commonly used parts of Open Office pre-installed in the latest release, but of course you can get the whole package if you like it later.
