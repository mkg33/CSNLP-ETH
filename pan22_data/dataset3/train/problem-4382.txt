When I've seen this it was because a process was holding the folder open but the folder was in the process of being deleted.
I was in an identical situation - the backup/restore program we use (FDR/Upstream) had a lock on the folders - restarted it's service and it let go.
It sounds more like there is a file lock on the folder - probably some application has got it open.
Then on the menu bar at the top of the application, I clicked Find.
It told me that AVG, my anti-virus, had a grasp on my entire E:\ Drive.
I downloaded Process Explorer from Run now from Sysinternals Live.
Use a tool like Process Explorer to see if anything has an open handle on the folder.
Once the file or directory comes up, I found the process that holds the lock.
I had this same problem and the only way I realized why I couldn't take ownership or even grant permissions was by using Process Explorer.
I would guess that once you release it or reboot, that folder will disappear.
Try using a program like Unlocker - it should show you what app has got it locked and it can release the lock and then delete the file or folder for you.
There I typed the file or directory I couldn't change permissions.
