I'm imagining something similar to the Protect Worksheet feature in Excel.
From a purely theoretical standpoint, if you are distributing an Access database file to a user, any user that can view the database could reconstruct the database and modify the new version of the database.
I'm familiar with how to encrypt an Access database with a password (requiring a password to view data).
If you mean to allow users to access data remotely, and grant some users the ability to modify that data, you may be looking for a more fully-featured RDBMS such as an SQL server, and you might look into Microsoft SQL server, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
Is there a way to allow data viewing w/o a password, but requiring one for editing the database?

If you are using one of the new file formats in Access 2010 (.accdb, .accde, .accdc, .accdr), user-level security (the Access way to prevent users from being able to edit the database) is not available.
