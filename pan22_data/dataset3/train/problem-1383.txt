There is only a VPN and open ports that link the two networks.
The issue thus far is that when the user attempts the RDP connection they authenticate just fine but then they are stopped with a message about running cmd being denied.
I've been asked to set up a user on our network with RDP access to a RDS server on a remote domain.
His thought was that when our local user logs into the remote server our local logon script policy applies and the remote server attempts to execute the bat files, that don't exist on the remote network.
We have set up the VPN just fine and the remote RDS server is reachable.
Would a domain policy for the local domain apply to a remote user logon on a remote domain when no trust exists at all.
While troubleshooting the issue with the SysAdmin of the remote RDS server I was told that the issue might be because we have bat filea that execute as logon scripts setup on the local domain group policy.
This also runs into the remote server's policy to deny the execution of cmd.
