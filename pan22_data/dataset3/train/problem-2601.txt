The image gets drawn where you are telling it to be drawn.
I'm guessing that the problem is a misunderstanding of order of operation.
Use the debugger to examine Position when you enter the Draw() method.
Position is (0, 0), the texture dimensions are 20 x 20 and the origin which you specified in the Draw method is new Vector2(texture.Width / 2, texture.Height / 2).
If this is the case, look through your code, and find where Position is being set, or where it is being changed, and make sure those bits of code are doing what they are suppose to do.
My guess is that Position will not have the value that you are expecting.
Adding parenthesis to show what happens first, we would have:
What I see in the screenshot appears to be correct, with the top left corner of the texture being at (0, 0) after specifying its origin to be (10, 10) and moving it by (10, 10).
It's unclear what you're asking, but based on everything you stated I don't see any issues.
The problem is you are not telling it to draw in the correct place.
