I have a Mac OS X server (referred to as the internal server behind a firewall that is reverse port forwarding via ssh -gnN -R *:remoteport:localhost:localport root@remote.server where remote.server is the domain/IP of a public server, which I will call the remote server.
Then, I can connect to the internal server by connecting toremote.server:remoteport.
Periodically, the tunnel will fail, and to that end I have a script on the internal server that tries to reconnect to the remote server until it succeeds.
But recently, I experienced an error in which the internal server loses its connection to the remote server, and nothing I do on the internal server can restore the connection.
What kinds of things could cause this behavior, and where should I start looking for problems?
The remote server is a VPS running a base install of CentOS 6.
The remote server ran the tunnel without errors for over 4 months, then failed twice in the last 12 hours in this manner, requiring two reboots only hours apart.
The remote server must be rebooted, after which the tunnel is immediately reestablished by the script.
No configuration has changed in the last few months.
