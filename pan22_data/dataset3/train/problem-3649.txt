Doing either one of these should result in you being able to use only the Danish keyboard instead of having to change it per-app as it makes it the default system-wide.
In the Region and Language window (first pictured by Thiago), click the Administrative tab, then click "Change system locale" and choose the appropriate selection from the list.
I don't know if this is a desirable fix for you, but there you go.
From here you can either change the Default input language to Danish.
I manged to solve this by adding a UK keyboard, then removing it.
Open the Region and Languages in the Control Panel and do this:
Click the Keyboards and Languages tab and click Change keyboards...
Go into Control Panel>Region and Languages>Keyboards and Languages tab>Change Keyboards, and remove the ones you don't want.
I really wish this wasn't so complicated; I don't have this problem on my Mac... ;-)
In your case, changing the system locale to Danish may remedy your issue.
I had the same problem: My KB kept switching between US and UK keyboards even though I didn't have a UK KB installed.
Once I added US to Installed Services and set Dvorak as the "Default input language", it started behaving.
The language bar disappeared and my input KB now stays as US.
The problem was that I only had Dvorak installed under Installed Services, and since the computer's locale was set to US, it kept defaulting to that.
