Try moving shapeRenderer.end() to after stage.draw().
Alternatively also try doing stage.act() before stage.draw() in addition to the above.
This will make the ShapeRenderer swap to a workable ShapeType for you (automatically) if it can't draw with the current ShapeType.
I personally prefer 'for : in' loops, but anything but a while loop will work (while loops will crash your game).
You should use your ShapeRenderer as an input into your draw function.
Not sure what that would fix but it's a possibility.
Stages have their own batches, which means if you want to render your rectangles (or anything) using them, they need to have sprites (or some image/texture), as batches can't draw the basic shapes.
You must not draw anything using the shape renderer after it has been ended.
Edit: Reread your question, and I didn't answer it perfectly.
Taking the ShapeRenderer as input also allows you to iterate over a list of rectangles to draw your rectangles.
Lastly, I recommend that you put this before you begin your ShapeRenderer.
