In addition to checking any read-write flag on the file, make sure that the security ACLs on the file and the folder that you put it in will allow the login that the SQL Server service is using to  access the file.
After you've attached the database in the new version, can then change the filegroup back to read-only and disable auto-grow.
It would be better to create the database by attaching both the mdf and ldf files and NOT rely on SQL Server to create a missing LDF.
The moral of my story is "Try running management studio as administrator while you do it".
Ran management studio as administrator, problem solved.
If you are unsure what the acl should look like, find the master.mdf file for your instance, look at the ACL/permissions for that file and then make the permissions for your particular mdf file match.
I had this issue when attempting to attach a sql server 2000 database to a sql server 2008 r2 server.
=> Running SSMS as an Administrator & giving db owner permission to the user by which you are trying to attach the database resolved my problem.

Microsoft also recommends that you turn on auto-grow if its disabled.
If you are expecting the server to automatically create the ldf file, figure out where it will be creating and make sure that sql server can write files at that location.
There may be updates in the LDF that did not make it to your MDF file.
It has to be upgraded and it cannot be upgraded because the file is read only.
before you detach the database in the previous version.
