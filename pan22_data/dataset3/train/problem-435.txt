However, this approach just results in a hung instance of setup.exe in Windows 10, whether run as administrator or not.
I couldn't discover a workaround in the QW.exe Compatibility settings (XP SP3) or in the NVidia settings (361.91 driver) so the easiest workaround I have figured out so far is to minimize (WinKey+DownArrow) then restore (WinKey+UpArrow) after Quicken 98 starts.
I can run it in a Windows 7 VM on VirtualBox, if I have to, but I'd rather not incur the overhead.
With Windows 7, it worked provided you picked the win95 folder and ran the setup in there, rather than the root install.exe.
Presumably because it was a 32 bit, rather than a 16 bit installer.
The net effect is you are gradually shown bits and pieces as you click on various areas.
The windows installer hasn't worked since W7 but it installs perfectly from the CD in safe mode."
Quicken 98, which was installed on Windows 7, runs on Windows 10 except portions of the display are blank at startup until you click on that area.
Quicken 98 installs fine on Windows 7; not Windows 10 however.
If that approach does not work for you, you might try the more complicated approach which worked for me on installing on Windows 7: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/please-can-you-help-me-i-have-an-old-programmes/439fc67f-ee36-4cd5-ab34-e301299890bf?page=2
Personally, I just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7.
This produces the display as it should have been at startup.
There was an Amazon review for a newer Quicken version where reviewer "Amazon Customer" stated "I still run Quicken 98 (although a year 2000 compliant version) on Windows 10 and it still does everything I need it to do.
I love this program and would feel lost without it.
