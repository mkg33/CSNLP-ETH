If several IPs start appearing more often and spider your site too quickly, this might be bad for your site, or it might be wanted: If you have interesting (and changing) content, you'll be spidered more aggressively by the big search engines.
It completely depends on the nature of a DDOS attack: If it just accesses one page, it might be a rogue DDOS-attack or just the slashdot crowd (in case of slashdot you might be able to get a hint through the referrers)
This might not be too distributed, but nevertheless might at least result in a DOS if too aggressive.
It's manual, but very distributed and might lead to DOS.
Last question: When you determine what they are: What would you do with them?
After all: isn't being slashdotted also a kind of DDOS?
Your network might be already saturated so DDOS protection needs to be added outside of your network - or are you looking for an algorithm to place there?
As everybody is typing the URL manually into their browser, there is no hint where they came from.
You won't get hints in the referrer if you're named in a popular streaming podcast, where everybody learns about your site at the same time (twit.tv comes to mind - they frequently take sites down by mentioning them).
