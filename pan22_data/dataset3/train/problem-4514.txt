Edit: I don't yet have enough rep to post images, so here's a link.
The network domain controller is a Windows Server 2003 box.
I have a fresh install of CentOS 4.8 running on an internal development server.
I can SSH into the server and from there resolve domains to IPs and ping internal servers, but for some reason I don't get any response from pinging external servers.
I'm pretty green when it comes to setting up *nix dev servers and network configuration in general, so please let me know if I've left out critical information, or posted information I shouldn't have posted.
The software firewall is disabled, and the problem is present with both static and DHCP-assigned network configurations.
And, for good measure, a snapshot of the current ethernet config via the system-config-network GUI.
Nothing requires that ping be possible between two hosts.
If everything else is working I'd not worry much about this.
Please post the output of a traceroute -n google.com, so we can see where your packets are actually being blocked.
This looks like a routing and/or firewall problem.
It might be that somebody between you and google is dropping ICMP packets.
Also check to see if you can ping anybody else in the outside world other than google?
I haven't done anything to it besides setting up sudoers and SSH.
Is 10.254.2.5 (your default gateway) also your Internet gateway, or do you have other routing in the middle before you can actually reach your perimeter firewall?
If you are particularly worried check with whoever runs your networking equipment or firewall and see if they are letting ICMP traffic through.
10.254.2.124 is the backup DC server, which is currently off and tombstoned by this point.
