Now, our client needs a new Server 2012 R2 vm, so I went ahead and built out a new one with the same iso as the previous Server 2012 R2 vm.
I already have 2 vms running on it, one is Windows Server 2012 (not R2) evaluation with 132 days left, and the other is a Windows Server 2012 R2 VM with 125 days left.
For the record, the build is 9600, and I downloaded them from here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/dn205286.aspx
copy settings from known VM which has internet access
all my new VMs reports licensed expired and i followed step 2 and worked.
So I downloaded a brand new iso, and the exact same thing happened, evaluation is expired notification on the desktop.
you are required to connect internet for all cloned VMs to activate evaluation product, otherwise follow
The client's getting new VLKs for the new servers soon, but they need the new servers now.
For every clone/every instance, Windows needs to be re-activated.
So I thought maybe the iso files (downloaded directly from Microsoft) have a 1 use only setting or something on it because I wasn't asked to input a license key on any of the Evaluation iso's.
I am not an expert but found a solution to my problem.
Once I booted to the desktop for the first time, the Evaluation period was expired?
Just finished building out a VM on an ESXi host 5.1.
