It's possible the user in question does not have all the rights or permissions needed to run SQL Server.
NETWORK SERVICE is, I believe, the default that SQLEXPRESS will run under.
I have two SQL Server services in Sql Server Configuration Manager: SQLEXPRESS and MSSQLSERVER.
I stopped this, and tried to run the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER), but it keeps timing out on me.
But here's where it gets weird: I installed SQL Server Enterprise, and during installation I specified a local user (SQLServices) to be used for all SQL Server services.
But SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) does NOT run and gives an error that it can't connect/time out etc., and SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS) runs, but under NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE.
Not sure why it wouldn't show up in the list of programs to remove.
You are correct that SQLEXPRESS is the free version.
I think that SQLEXPRESS is the free version, but I don't know how I got it and I can't remove it either because it doesn't show up in remove programs.
More than likely, SQLEXPRESS being present or running has nothing to do with trouble you are having with SQL Ent; they can run side-by-side as separate instances (barring any misconfiguration which would explicitly prevent it - which would likely have to be done purposefully)
As for why SQL Ent is not running; exactly what error(s) are you getting?
Okay, so this worked for SQL Server Analysis Services (MSSQLSERVER) and SQL Server Integration Services10.0 (MSSQLSERVER), they are running under this user.
