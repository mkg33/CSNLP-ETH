I take your point about passive monitoring, but I think you're slightly off-base.
For McAfee DAT files, you might be able to find out where the directory the DATs are kept, and have a script that looks for the created or last-modified date of the newest DAT file in that directory.
That's exactly as accurate as you asking the client machine yourself in some other way.
When I had to do this for SAV CE, you could query the registry of the client machine to find the current AV definition version, and I think the date as well.
The answers above are pointing you towards a centralized management console.
The central solutions I've worked with don't assume that the client got the update; they update the information in the console with what the client says its definition date/version is.
In fact, the worst that can happen is a breakdown in the console, still sending updated DATs but losing return communication from a client, and showing an older definition date in the console than the client actually has.
However, if you can't do that (machines aren't going to stay under your control after deployment, etc) then you can try to find out where the AV software you use keeps that information.
