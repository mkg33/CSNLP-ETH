A 4 node network, however, would leave two ports unmonitored.
A unicast exchange between two hosts on two separate switch ports will not be seen by a listening host on a third switch port under normal operating conditions.
Depending on the switch make and model, there may be caveats to this function that may make the designated port less functional, ie: only able to receive traffic, not send, while the mirroring is active.
Ethernet switches do not broadcast all traffic to all ports.
In an Internet Gateway situation, port mirroring would be turned on between the router and the switch, and so would catch all Internet-sourced traffic, but not all LAN traffic.
More expensive managed switches, with enterprise functions such as VLAN support often have port mirroring features, that serve as a wiretap utility that duplicates all traffic sent or received on any one port to a second designated port.
For a 3 node switched network, that's not a problem, as if one or the other port is mirrored, either destination the host on the unmonitored port can talk to, is monitored.
There may exist switches that can mirror all VLAN or all backplane traffic to a designated port, but I'm not familiar with such functionality.
Another caveat that is likely on all but the most powerful, expensive switches, is that only one port can be mirrored at one time.
