If it's not working check Keyboard Shortcuts Move focus to active or next windows and set to Option + Tab.
You may want to try Optimal Layout as well: it combines powerful application and window switching with instant preview of window content + grid based window resizing and layout if needed.
Just check their site, app is amazing and beat all other solutions (and believe my, I try almost all of them).
Another option is to 'hide' the application using ⌘(command) + H rather than minimizing it.
I just found that there's another alternative, that I'm using on my Ubuntu machine: there I switch between applications using Alt-Tab and between their windows using Alt-^ (which is the button on the top left corner on a German keyboard layout; on US keyboards it's actually ~ as Krishna pointed out).
Option + Tab switches between windows like Windows.
To set that shortcut change Settings > Keyboard > Move focus to next window to ⌘-~ (DE: ⌘-^)
This way you only have to lift your finger a little higher when you want to switch windows of the current application.
This way you can use ⌘(command)+tab to select the application and bring it to focus like Windows.
It's not yet perfect, but for me, competition is miles behind.
