I thought that was where the Local System acct was located.
Then you can use the filter in procmon to only list those activities generated by that application.
Their settings would be copied from the Default User profile initially.
The Default User folder is typically used as the base folder that new user accounts are created from.
I have used a service running as the 'Local System' account and user data is stored in:
The Network Service and Local Service accounts both have hidden profiles in the Documents and Settings folder.
This is a hidden folder and took me a while to find it.
The entire Sysinternal suite can be downloaded as a single zip file and you may find other utils in the kit that can be helpfull.
On XP there is a "System Profile" located at C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile
You should now be able to run through the list and determine which file this application is using (NOTE: After several minutes of logging, you can use the file menu to stop monitoring)
So if a new user were to log on to a system for the first time.
You will need to know the name of the exe that the service runs as.
