I already installed TeamViewer on both ends to test and the same phenomenon is witnessed.
I solved the latency issue: What really made the difference (for me) was to disable on both, the server and client side:
That made me think that maybe it is not the RDP settings but something related to the Intel NIC settings?
I am experiencing extreme latencies when using Remote Desktop from My Windows 10 machine into Windows Server 2016 Standard (Intel i210 internal NIC).
I pinged my Server machine from within Windows 10 and it does not show any latency, so I am suspecting it has something to do with my settings in Windows Server 2016 or in the Intel i210 NIC settings, or possibly it has something to do with the compression algorithms?
However, when I connect from Windows Server 2016 into my Windows 10 machine via RDP there is virtually no latency, everything is very smooth and fast.
I am confused because RDP works flawlessly when connecting from the server into Win10, but latencies the other way around make using RDP almost useless.
The latency is many milliseconds when typing or moving windows or doing just about any task from within the RDP window.
Connecting an RDP session is fast both ways around, it is the latencies when being logged into remotely and when typing or opening windows or panning windows.
