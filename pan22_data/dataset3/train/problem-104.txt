It didn't really made huge difference in bcdedit /v listing -- basically it just updated the copied boot record with a new guid instead of previous {new-guid} -- but something got fixed in the boot records behind the curtain and it started working.
In my case I was moving existing vhdx file to a new path (actually new drive).
Fairly easy, but it didn't work; I was getting the same error as you.
I'm trying the install Win8 in a VHD using the Hanselman Guide
There is official guide for this scenario, but it is missing one critical command - which may help you.
All went well until the PC rebooted and Windows shows me this error:
I had this exact same problem, and I fixed it by moving the VHD to my C drive.
The official guide Add a Native-Boot Virtual Hard Disk to the Boot Menu can be summarized as:
To fix it I had to mount the vhdx from its new path N:\windows.vhdx to disk letter O:\ and run this command:
I had this very same error, but under different circumstances than you.
Note: you could argue that bcdboot actually fixed the vhdx file, namely the boot files in O:\, but that could not play role in my scenario, because I discarded the vhdx I ran the bcdboot on and instead used another copy that was never treated this way.
To continue native booting into it I had to edit boot records in BCD to point to the new path.
I'd suggest you first compare the hash on your ISO.
