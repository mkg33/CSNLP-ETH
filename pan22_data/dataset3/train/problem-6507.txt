Is there any log of what files were skipped, or a relatively easy way to compare the two top-level folders and see exactly what's missing?
How can I know exactly which directories did not transfer?
I did this simply by CTRL+C the top-level directories I wanted from one drive, then CTRL+P in the drive for backing that up, all within Windows Explorer.
Make sure to keep the /L, otherwise, it starts copying things.
The problem is, I don't know which folders exactly were not transferred.
hat I copied consists of 1.5TB of data with many branching directories, so I doubt I can do this manually.
I let this process run overnight and upon return, I had the error that a folder could not be transferred due to file path length.
If I knew which directories couldn't be copied over the first time around, I could go address their path length or use (what I've only now learned about) robocopy to copy them.
ROBOCOPY /E /Z /DCOPY:T /PURGE /FP "X:\...\SourceDir" "Y:\...\TargetDir" /L
You can use Robocopy with /L to get a list of all files that are not equal.
I pressed skip each time to see how extensive the problem was and there were only 3 folders that were not moved for this reason.
Here is a line that I use (forgot what most qualifiers mean, but ROBOCOPY /?
I was trying to copy a large amount of data from one drive to another drive in order to back it up.
