I'm using Visual Basic and C# with different classes.
A screenshot of what the activity looked like is below:
The student has to select which of the three event blocks on the right causes the behavior specified in the question.
So far I have just played with loops and decision structures.
As I look ahead to next year, I want to do more of these problems, especially when teaching loops and sorting algorithms.
Focusing on those skills outside of/separate from the syntax helped because students only had to worry about one thing at a time.
I wanted students to have experience with the ordering of function calls in C. There are technically two correct ways to approach this, but because I specify the requirement to use each block, there's only solution here:
They are quick and simple to make and differentiate instruction effectively.
In the context of AP CSP, they provide great practice for the AP Exam which includes a number of code samples to read and understand.
Seeing how information gets passed from function to function and how to lay out the structure was helpful for students.
I used Google Slides to put different colored text boxes on one slide and gave the students instructions to arrange the text boxes in the proper order.
What I have been doing is writing some code and testing it and then moving things around before giving the projects to my students to rearrange.
This example is for the Thymio robot with the VPL programming environment but similar puzzles could be developed in any block environments.
