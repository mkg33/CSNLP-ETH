I would loop through a battle system that would pick units, have them attack, etc, and then see which team won and do this many many times for an average.
I need to know what the unit type was, that was I couldn't write one function that understood all the unit classes.
It would also allow me to make a method where I can say get a unit from an arraylist and call its get speed method and it wouldn't demand I know the unit class.
I am looking to make a program that will allow me to test units for balance when in combat.
I am looking to make a system for the units that allows me to have each unit have the same basic stats, health, speed, etc.
The issue was when I called a unit from a team, tried to add one etc.
Any help or ideas for how I can do this, please ask for more information if needed.
The thing I am having issues with is how to design or make the classes for the units.
I tried making a class for a generic unit and then classes that pulled from it for each different unit.
The idea is that there will be two teams of so many units of different types.
For instance, grunt g = new grunt() instead something where I can get the unit and just call, unit.getspeed();
But that each unit will also have their own functions for abilities that would be different then other units.
