However, even if you elect to compile the code locally, it's almost always a better idea to create a package from it and install it using the normal packaging tools for above reasons (rather than running make install directly into your filesystem).
Test the updates in your development environment to make sure they work as expected before deploying them on your production system.
What is the version that you're looking to install?
Do you have any test environment in which to run a trial of this new PHP package?
By building from source, you lose most of the advtantages of your packaging system, specifically:
The binary package has been built by your vendor and has generally had a fair amount of testing.
There are certainly some advantages to building from source -- for example, you may require a different configuration than provided in the vendor package.
This is true regardless of how you choose to install the updated software.
You're probably best off using the binary package, assuming the current version was installed as a binary.
Ensure that your development environment accurately reflects your production environment.
