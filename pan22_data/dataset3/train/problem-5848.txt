Mark Russinovich has some details on the ways this might happen in this article on changes made in Windows Vista's file copy mechanisms.
That said 38Meg/sec isn't abnormal either if there's any other traffic flowing in or out of either the client or server or (as is more likely) that rate is mostly limited by the speed of your local laptop hard drive.
However even though your target OS is a bit old the hardware isn't all that weak and a RAID 10 setup with 4x7.2K SATA drives should be good for somewhere between 60 and 120Meg/sec write speed which is significantly higher than the 39Meg/sec Vista is reporting for your copy.
The odd thing here is that if it is a solid, well-configured GigE link then you could hit network transfer rates reaching 70Meg/sec (and maybe a bit higher) for a sustained copy of a large file like this.
In any case I would check that your RAID 10 was actually healthy - the symptoms here would make me suspect it wasn't able to write as fast as it should be.
The performance graph you posted looks like this issue and I have seen exactly this sort of behavior in the past where I had a target system with very slow disks and a fast network.
There are known issues with the Network File Copy processes on W2K - if the remote system can't empty the write cache faster than the rate the file data is arriving in over the network then it will steadily consume all physical memory on the server if the file is big enough.
