Because of that for 0.0.0.0 mask the only valid network address is also 0.0.0.0
By the same token, it will be shortest possible match so it will be used only if there are no more specific matches.
Any IP will match - because it needs to match on 0 bits.
Netmask dictates how many leftmost bits must match (at least as many as 1s in Netmask).
But I know this guy, default gateway, who may be more knowledgeable than I am, so I kick the can along (and forward to him).
Is this just a default route which routes all traffic (regardless of the IP/Subnet being requested) to the default gateway?
I've been reading up on static routes and such while studying for my next MS exam, and am wondering - in CMD, if you do a route print -4 you get a Active Route Output such like this:
It is a default route, but it does not route (match) all traffic.
In other words it says - I (router) tried to match this packet to all networks I know of and failed.
 In order to check if an IP address matches given route entry, your (router) device will compare it to Destination.
Packet will be routed via default if no better route exists.
To get network address, you zero host bits (by bitwise ANDing IP with netmask).
If multiple route entries match, longest match is selected as best.
That's why a default route is also known as Route of last resort.
