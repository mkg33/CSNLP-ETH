If it blocks it there it will prevent execution as well unless you manually configured your anti virus to do something different.
The purpose of the EICAR file is to identify whether your anti virus is able to detect the file entering your system, which is the exact place where your anti virus should stop the file and not at a later point.
So, it sounds like it is catching you download the com file in which case it is scanning your files properly.
For the EICAR test using a local file, you generally need to disable your antivirus software, then download the test tool, then reenable the software.
Even if you did get the com file on a 32 bit pc it would actually execute as it isn't a valid com file anyways.
Otherwise, your AV catching it on download or thumb drive insertion means it's working properly.
The reason for the various file types is that some scanners are set to only scan certain file types, thou non of the executable version of EICAR are valid applications, they are just for detection.
Even though you cannot get your 64bit OS to launch the com file the AV scanner should still catch it.
If you do get the com on your computer and then manually scan it you should also find it is detected.
If you are looking for the scanning on execution just rename the .com to .exe as it isn't valid either way.
So, EICAR works on 64 bit and you are unlikely to need an alternative test file.
Another thing with 64 bit is that a lot of viruses fail to execute because they don't apply to 64 bit code.
