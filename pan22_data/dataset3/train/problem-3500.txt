In the column with the hyperlink, the cell above had the hyperlink while the cell below just had plain text.
Finally just merged the cells below that line for all but the column before and after the cell with the hyperlink.
I have used this method in power points and it appears to work in Excel also.
What this does is make some text (For blablabla, click), and then adds a hyperlink to the end of the sentence (here).
I have not seen a single method with code or in the UI that allows HTML or RTF to fully render in a cell, and have not seen any examples with multiple links.
There is a way to hyperlink only certain text in one single cell.
However, right click and go to Format Object and Properties, and you can "nail" the object to it's location above a specific cell so that it moves along with the cell, giving the appearance of being "in" that cell.
OK, this a solution to this old question but it's not one that I would personally use.
The object is not actually in a cell, it's just an overlay above the sheet.
I've had this problem too, and what I did was just add columns before and after the hyperlink and made them appear to be one cell.
You cannot sort or filter on this field, nor can you do calculations based on the text.
You need to triple-click the object in order to render it as a Word "document" within the cell, and thus be able to click any of the contained links.
I add a shape (rectangle) that just covers the text I want the hyperlink on and then set:
This might not work for everyone but the workaround worked for me.
Select that text, copy, and in Excel use Paste Special to paste it where you want to see it as a Word Object.
As suggested earlier, use Word to create your text, but use Word hyperlinks, not bookmarks.
