So, change only the model type, and don't change anything else.
This is the vmware paravirtualized NIC model, which QEMU also supports.
Is there a way to make Virtual Interfaces work with ESXi on KVM?
It's a cinch with other hosts as two bridged Virtual Interfaces with vNIC model set to Virtio device would do the trick.
I tried to go along with E1000 as NIC but couldn't connect ESXi to external network.
Of course, you can (and probably should) also just use the vmxnet3 NIC type, which has been supported in libvirt and qemu just fine for many years now.
All of the other settings you have tried have the correct NIC model, but other broken or inappropriate settings.
The following blog post suggests trying the 'vmxnet3' NIC model with QEMU

I need to run two ESXi hosts on KVM and assign them distinct, external IPs visible to the external network.
The e1000 is a standard NIC type though, so I would fully expect that to work.
But, for whatever reason, you don't appear to have ever simply changed the NIC model type to e1000 and made no other changes.
You started out with this configuration, which is otherwise correct but ESXi can't use a virtio NIC:
But Virtio as NIC model is not supported by ESXi and it won't boot complaining about no network adapter detected.
There's always the possibility that some bug in QEMU's emulation makes it incompatible with ESXi.
It is understandable that virtio-net doesn't work with ESXi as they're unlikely to care about providing drivers for a NIC that's only relevant in nested-virt.
