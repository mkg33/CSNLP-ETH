I know the easiest way I do ATM is just grep for one part e.g.
just ice with -A2 -B2 flag and then in that output againg for e.g.
So I am interessted on how do you would solve this.
This works in a manner vaguely similar to that of grep but supports vim REs and paths.
I would probably do a search using vim's :vimgrep command.
Their basic functionality is more like that of basic REs, but they have some nifty additions that PCREs don't offer.
Basically you run something like :vimgrep 'pattern1\npattern2' path/** for a recursive search, then type :copen to bring up a smaller window containing a list of matches.
vim REs can do mostly everything that PCREs can, but they evolved separately from the perl regular expression lineage so most of the advanced stuff works differently.
Lets have the phrase "my ice tea" then it may be wrapped in text files:
grep will not match since there is a newline in between.
Another multiline pattern would be pattern1_\n_pattern2
:help vimgrep from within vim for more info; :help pattern.txt for info on vim REs; for more info on paths see :help wildcards.
I'm not sure if it's possible to get :vimgrep to spit out data as grep does; I've only ever tried to use it for navigation within vim.
