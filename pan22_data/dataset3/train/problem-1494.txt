The problem started when I tried to install drivers for my printer earlier today and suddenly started getting messages saying that "Windows Modules Installer has stopped working."
Then I rebooted into my external drive and did a chkdsk on the Windows 8 install that started acting funny.
When I booted back into Windows 8, I wasn't able to install any drivers.
When Windows Update tries to install a driver, it just gives error code 800703F9 and says that "Windows Update ran into a problem."
I've already done a scan of system files with sfc, tried another user account, done a chkdsk, and a few more things, but nothing works.
I decided to restart and was being greeted with the recovery boot options.
It doesn't matter what kind of driver it is, nothing will install.
Here's an install log from a failed driver install:
I shut the computer down, but when I booted it back up the same thing happened, so I did a repair your pc, and was able to boot into the OS properly.
Everything ends with error 0x000003F9: The system has attempted to load or restore a file into the registry, but the specified file is not in a registry file format.
And I can't seem to find anything at all on this issue.
I suddenly can't install any drivers at all on my Windows 8 Pro x64 install.
