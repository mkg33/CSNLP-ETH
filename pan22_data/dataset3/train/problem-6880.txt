I know this will work as we did this across multiple PCs when I was working for a company that did realtime 3D graphics back in 2000.
The simplest way to do this would be to build a box that has 2 (or 3) inputs and 2 (or 3) outputs.
I'm looking for a way to use a multi-screen setup with two or three screens that will each show a different 3d image using the same method.
I've just tested it on a 3d Sony Bravia screen and it works (using side-by-side 3d display) and looks amazing.
You could however attempt to get them started at the same time, or try to reboot the out of sync monitor till it is in sync...
You only need one emitter to control the shutter glasses and that feeds back into your graphics card, not the TV.
The problem as I see it is that the TVs send a sync signal to the user's active glasses, and are not necessarily synced between them.
The VSYNC from the master would be wired to all outputs, the VSYNC from the others simply not used.
I'm developing some kind of software that displays a 3d view-port.
No; unless you were to wire them and get them to sync to the first monitor ; although this requires you to do some electronics.
You can do this but it will require you creating custom cables for your TVs.
Then plug the outputs from your graphics cards into the inputs of the box and the outputs of the box into your monitors.
As long as both outputs are synchronised at the computer then the displays should be synchronised.
The vertical sync signal from one of the the graphics card outputs will need to be split and then that fed into each monitor instead of the vertical sync signal from its own output.
