In the main .html are the images downloaded, AND the content text is taken from the main .html also, and so on.
I want to check my URL is correct redirected (parameter etc.)
You will see original frameset HTML code and selected page code nested.
Frame: http://www.celine-cellier.com/fr/produits/boites-a-bijoux#
Right-clicking on the frame should show you the option "View frame source".
Sometimes a "frame" is more a "popup" and has NO URL, because it is compiled together from different code parts from the main .html page.
Just have to ignore to remove the "view-source:" prefix, though.
The "frame" has no URL, because all the code (Joomla) is hidden in the main .html
If you click on one of the displayed cases, then there is a "frame" coming up, which explains the case in detail (French).
The frame itself does NOT have an own URL, so it can NOT be found!
The only difference is the # sign at the end of the original main URL
iframe tag doesn't solve the problem, because the page in frame makes redirects, postbacks etc without changing the source in the iframe.
By clicking on it, it will open the source code in a new tab.
go to the system menu (wrench/spanner) Tools -> Developer tools.
