(Although Nintendo's only big hardware release failure was their last attempt at 3D, the Virtual Boy...).
On current platforms, stereoscopic 3D often offers a significantly worse experience than 'flat 3D', as rendering the scene for each eye usually results in a halving of the framerate.
But I wouldn't be surprised if most gamers turn off the 3D effect after the novelty factor quickly wears off.
But even if  you don't mind the glasses, there's another perhaps more serious problem.
But it's likely to be more as a 'tick the box' extra feature, rather than a fundamental part of the game, and at the price of a severe drop in framerate and/or image quality.
Nobody wants to wear 3D glasses for their daily living room TV viewing, and it's not a whole lot more appealing for regular gaming.
3D with shutter glasses first appeared on the PC almost a decade ago.
3D cinemas (using polarised glasses) have been around for even longer, although primiarly at theme parks.
The framerate was all over the place, ruining the 3D effect.
I'm sure there'll be a lot more games released with 3D support in the near future, simply becaust the hardware support is now there.
I recently looked at Gran Turismo 5 on a 3D TV, it was not impressive.
It didn't take off then, and little has changed since then, really.
Switch off 3D mode and you've got a much nicer game, running at a lovely smooth 60fps.
The 3DS, on the other hand, is likely to be a big success.
