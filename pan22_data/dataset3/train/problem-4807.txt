I would be very wary of doing anything CPU intensive on a micro instance.
because if it doesn't, SSL Handshake/Negotiation block reads on /dev/random instead.. which is bad for a micro instance really.
Oddly enough, Chrome also says that the site's certificate is invalid, but far as I am aware the certificate is (and was before this all happened) valid.
Recently, I had about 5k hits in about 40 hours, and after a little while,the SSL site hung on request, with chrome returning a timeout.
On an EC2 small instance (or better), the CPU resources are guaranteed.
Since CPU resources are on-demand, if/when you you do something demanding for a substantial amount of time (doesn't have to be that long), your processing power will be throttled.
I'm running Nginx on an Amazon EC2 micro instance, with some some backend node processes and mongodb.
I restarted the VM, and that did let the site load, but now it still hangs upon requesting the SSL site.
(I did not edit configuration before or after the restart).
You will be able to see this as stolen CPU cycles when running vmstat or top (%st is the column to look for).
We avoided this issue before by using Ubuntu 11.10 on EC2 micro instance.
So next time when nginx is being unresponsive, check to see if you are getting stolen cycles.
