It is intended to act only as an authoritative server for the domains it serves.
It may have appropriate security to prevent it from being used for DNS amplification attacks.
This implies it will be serving domain data to other hosts.
You should check that you can access your PowerDNS server on its published Nameserver address (which may not be your hosts address).
I add manually google.com and it's works, but if I delete entry I have "server failed", root dns (or isp dns) don't answer me.
This doesn't answer your literal question, but maybe all you really need is to throw a bunch of entries in your /etc/hosts file?
The recursor will bind to 127.0.0.1 and only listen there by default so you will be fine regarding protection against the aforementioned DNS amplification attacks.
You can use your servers from your ISPs, Google's, OpenDNS, or others.
Otherwise you will have to rely on your backup nameservers for local access.
PowerDNS is not designed to provide recursive results.
You could add the Recursor module but I would recommend only using it on intranets.
as to why those two functions are provided by separate programs.
The easiest method to resolve your issue is to configure your /etc/resolv.conf file to use external servers to resolve DNS.
I would like to set up the powerdns server to resolve all externally unresolved DNS queries to a given, internal host.
I think it's necessary to use pdns-recursor, but my configuration file doesn't works !
