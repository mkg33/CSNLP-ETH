I SSH'd in and did a ps axfw | grep r1soft and identified the subprocesses responsible and killed them.
If running Apparmor, run "service apparmor teardown", simply running 'aa-complain' for mysqld and "service apparmor stop" will not resolve the issue.
When initiating a DB restoration, the CDP Server will transfer MySQL data to the Agent, that will write the data into the cdp-agent's tmp directory (/var/lib/r1soft/tmp).
Once a tmp MySQL instance is created, the Connector/J will connect to both instances and migrate the InnoDB database from the tmp instance to the primary instance.
Common causes for this failure are security mechanisms such as SELinux and Apparmor.
I had this problem, and found that when it failed, it left the process running on my server.
The agent is unable to start the temporary instance.
The CDP Agent will also create a temporary instance of MySQL to conduct the restore too.
If caused by SELinux, put SELinux in permissive mode while doing the restore.
You can have this fixed with the resolution below:
