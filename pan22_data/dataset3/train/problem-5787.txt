Unfortunately you need to set a registry key first.
The numbers 0-9 are then MJKLUIO789, respectively.
Note: I tested this with the Arial Unicode MS font, and it worked like a champ.
To type this on a laptop with no separate number pad, you'll need to turn numlock on, which will differ depending on your computer's manufacturer.
You can go to this website: Symbols - it provides easy access to many special symbols and characters.
At the bottom of the page, you see a button for "Zero Width Space" character, just click on that button to have the "Zero Width Space" character copied in the clipboard.
It will insert the proper character, but you may see garbage depending on the font you are using (does it contain a glyph for that character) as well as the editor you are using may not be unicode aware and treat it as two characters or something else completely.
Second, making sure numlock is turned on, press the following keystrokes while holding down the Alt key, then striking the four digits on the numeric keypad, and finally releasing the Alt key.
After that formality is taken care of, just hold Alt and press + 2 0 0 B, typing the + and numbers on the numpad, and the letters normally.
