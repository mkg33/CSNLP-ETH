The "user" instance of postfix wouldn't have any local domains at all, only the "delivery" instance of postfix would have domains configured in it.
From now on he is able to send e-mails from google.com domain (but only in local delivery not to internet).
TO check MX record, if it is proper, before local delivery?
If a client adds google.com as a domain in Postfix how would Postfix know that the client doesn't actually own google.com?
Where yourmx.com is a SMTP server configured to relay mail for you.
For example - there is hosting platform, client added google.com domain.
I don't know anything about Postfix but I'm assuming it operates like any other MTA in that no MX lookup is performed for domains that Postfix is authoratative for.
Is there any way to configure Postfix in the way that it would check mx record before local delivery.
One possible way is to run a second instance of postfix on that server (or ideally use a second server as it's much simpler).
That's something only human intelligence can determine.
One way to do this that relies on an additional mailserver would be to configure postfix transport
