If I am copying a large number of files from one drive to another using Explorer, and at the same time use Explorer to view another folder, it runs extremely slow as if all the power is going into my original task.
In this scenario, if I wanted to now load an application (Word, Excel, Firefox, media player etc) - these programs files would need to be read from the disk for use - meaning that either the file copies slow down or the application loads need to wait their turn in the disk queue.
This is likely to not be your CPU or your RAM - but disk latency.
As I have an i7 with 16Gb of RAM I'd expect Win 10 to breeze through this!
This means that if you have a really fast CPU, tonnes of RAM and a slow disk - for the most part, your computer will only be able to move data as fast as it can read from /write to the disk.
Evidence of what is happening can be found in Task Manager (Performance Tab):
Explorer also seems to make a meal of tasks generally whereas a utility like Carpenter's Everything instantly displays every file in all four drives.
While my disk is running at 100% usage - my machine cannot work much faster.
Fortunately, Windows is good at multi-tasking - so the 2 jobs will run (slower) side by side - but will result in a performance drop on my PC and this is exactly what you are seeing.
Your computer is only as fast as its slowest component.
I personally have 20GB RAM and and an i5-4590 which under most circumstances runs like a rocket with windows 10 - however, when I start to thrash the disk, the whole machine slows down.
You can see that I'm only using ~3% CPU, ~30% RAM, but 100% Disk (to do this, I did a copy/paste of a 20GB file).
