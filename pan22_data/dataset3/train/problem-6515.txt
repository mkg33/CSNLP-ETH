At least this appears to be the case with Firefox.
And ideally an addon so you can quickly toggle that option?
I already have the "Copy link name" extension to Firefox which allows me to strip out all the hyperlink guff and just copy the visible text.
There doesn't appear to be any such equivalent in Firefox.
This is something that's been annoying me for a while.
When copy & pasting something from another HTML page (or another application) into one of these special textareas, any formatting is preserved.
Now in MS Office and LibreOffice (on Windows at least) this is traditionally solved by having a "Paste Special" menu where you can choose what you want to paste, with/without formatting and many other options.
Actually most of the time when pasting between websites, I don't want to carry over the formatting from the other one.
Just wondering if there's a config option to paste plain text in Firefox?
With the current trend towards "rich web applications" it seems that some application developers are doing something funky with textarea elements to allow the pasting of styled text... GMail, Yahoo Mail etc.
