Unless you need them to be in different subnets for some reason.
Just using mask as 255.255.0.0 in both routers and everything else the same should work.
I cannot ping the Netopia (192.168.1.254) from inside the Linksys network, and if I attempt to ping 192.168.0.1 from a wifi connection I get a "Destination host not available" error.
To be absolutely honest, it seems to be that you have over-engineered the situation, It would be a lot simpler and straight forward If you put the Netopia box on the same subnet/network and just allow all devices to acquire DHCP addresses from the Linksys box.
Both routers are configured to serve addresses via DHCP (Netopia 192.168.1.1 -> 192.168.1.99), Linksys (192.168.0.1 -> 192.168.0.100).
Everything currently works - I can connect via the wireless network and get to the internet.
I decided I really need to allow wireless connections to also communicate with machines behind the Linksys router.
If it has a IP of 192.168.0.0 on subnet 255.255.255.0, it will not be able to resolve a gateway of 192.168.1.100 as it is on a different network.
Although I'm not sure I understand why you are using the Linksys router in the first place.
Getting a tiny bit confused reading your question, but the one thing that stands out to me is the Netopia's address.
Machines connected to the Linksys can connect with each other and connect to the internet.
I configured the Linksys to have a static IP address:
Obviously I'm missing something, but I'm not sure where.
If you have now reset one or more and having trouble connecting, unplug everything from one machine and the troubled router then plug it in to a machine via ethernet and if it was reset, you should have no problem getting a DHCP address then applying any settings you want.
Turn off DHCP on it, assign it an a static IP on the 192.168.1.x network and plug the Netopia router into one of the switch ports, not the WAN port.
I have a home network - the main router connected to the internet (and has wifi) is a Netopia box.
Don't use the Linksys router as a router, just use the switch portion.
The gateway has to be an address of 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.1.255
Currently the Linksys is configured to obtain an IP address via DHCP.
