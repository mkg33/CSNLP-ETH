For logging everything that somebody types into your console pam_tty_audit is what your after.
NB, this logs everything, keystrokes (up, down, ctrl, etc) and also will log passwords when they type into password fields.
If you can't trust your system administrators you are screwed.
The admin logs in as a normal user, then is allowed to run various commands by doing sudo /path/to/command That's probably the best you're going to get without playing a lot of games.
However, to some degree  you can get the behaviour you want with sudo.
I'm pretty sure that it logs it output via syslog, so you could just pump that log to another syslog server.
A local logging daemon breaks the basic principle of not giving a user administrative access to the systems expected to restrict him.
Combined with this and remote logging, it would be slightly more difficult to stop than simply sudo.
In theory you can use a ssh proxy (on a system the person doesn't control) to log all traffic between the host and the system.
If you can't trust them, they shouldn't have root.
In practice it's more or less impossible to read a command log and figure out if the guy did something bad or not.
He ssh to the system, you log all data there and forward the connection to the target server.
