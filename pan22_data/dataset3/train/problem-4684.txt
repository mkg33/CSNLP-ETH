I also have a preview domain: preview.myurl.com, used for testing.
I'm unsure of the network settings and before messing up all my DNS configurations I'd like to understand if I'm about to crash my configuration.
Since everything is hosted on the same VS, I currently have also four different folders (landing, api, webapp, preview), that act as "virtual hosts" for each subdomain.
Currently I'm using a LAMP configuration for both my landing page page, for the web app, and for the APIs.
The landing page is hosted at the second level domain (e.g.
Initially all lower level domains (except for www.)
Now I'd like to split these things across multiple Virtual Servers (VS).
Then the idea is to point each subdomain to the proper VS.
will still be pointing to the current VS, while the second level domain for the landing page (A record for myurl.com.)
myurl.com), the web app is hosted at the lower level domain app.myurl.com, and the api at api.myurl.com.
To start I'd like to change the data of each CNAME entry to the actual IP of the current VS.
