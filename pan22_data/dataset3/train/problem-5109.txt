But is it possible to keep Cell B's decreased value even when Cell A is left blank after.
If you want to automate this process, you'll have to use macro's.
In column A, you place the values that modify the value.
Your new formula in Column C becomes =IF(ISNUMBER(A1);B1-A1;B1)
You can place an IF function in Column C to prevent this from becoming a problem, using the =ISNUMBER function.
When all cells in Column A have been entered and column C contains all new values, Select entire Column C and press Copy.
This basically will execute the calculation if Column A has a number, and if not, only give whatever is in Column B.
I have successfully made Cell B value decrease by value of Cell A.
Then select entire Column B, and rightclick and select paste special.
You can do this by creating a stored value and a calculation value, but it will require a manual action every time.
Now, the problem you'll get that if Column A does contain anything other than a value, Column C will display an error there (#VALUE!).
However it is pointless if the database doesn't save after value is decreased.
If you copy that to column B, it will lose the value it had stored.
In Column C you put your formula with the outcome: example =B1-A1.
Cell A is a field to enter how much to decrease from current value.
