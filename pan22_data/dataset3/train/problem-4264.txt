You can change that to 1 (or more), which means that if at least that number of secondaries don't also commit the transaction, then the transaction fails.
However, a 2-node synchronous Availability Group isn't the answer either, because as Microsoft's own documentation points out:
If the storage where the data files live fails, then both nodes will be affected.
You can't guarantee zero data loss with 2 independent SQL Server 2012s without third party tools (like SAN replication, and even then, there's a ton of work involved.)
Yes, SQL Server 2017 introduced a new REQUIRED_SYNCHRONIZED_SECONDARIES_TO_COMMIT setting at the Availability Group level.
I'm guessing the question came from a test or certification written by somebody without real-world experience.
The disk failure part means a failover cluster alone won't work because the storage is shared with both nodes.
That wouldn't be the first time, and it won't be the last.
The default is 0, which means as long as the primary receives the transaction, it's committed.
Read further in that link in the "Factors That Disrupt Data Synchronization" section, and Microsoft elaborates on the reasons why you can't guarantee that a 2-node AG will not lose data on failover.
