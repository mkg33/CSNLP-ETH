in my case this was set, yet the problematic host was still present in class w of sendmail
Solution: reconfigure Sendmail so that it is not authoritative for your public DNS namespace.
Option 1: remove the entry from /etc/mail/local-host-names
The code that's sending the mail, are you using a full email address, or are you just having the server mail it out via a local account?
with the host named www.domain.com, sendmails class w still contained BOTH www.domain.com AND domain.com (even after a reboot)
To summarize, there are a number of options (most of which have been mentioned in other answers, but for whatever reasons didn't work in my particular scenario).
You can add local emails "manually" in /etc/mail/local-host-names file.
the external link provided above even specifically says, "If I want to remove whipple.org from class w, I could rename the server to frodo.whipple.org, www.whipple.org, elvis.whipple.org, for example."
And this is telling sendmail to rewrite the domains in local addresses to domain.com, but does not alter the local delivery.
2) Sendmail may add (autoconfigured) "this host email name" ($j) to list of local email domains.
Option 5: THIS IS WHAT WORKED FOR ME add a LOCAL_RULE_0 to the sendmail mc file
this needs to go at the end of the file and <tab> needs to be an actual tab character
You cant turn it off using the following line in your sendmail.mc:
This is telling sendmail to deliver all mail to users@localhost.localdomain locally
(It requires HUPing  or restarting sendmail daemon after)
There's no valid reason for a hostname to ever be equal to a naked domain name.
3) mailertable is NOT consultede for deliveries to domains listed in $=w.
1) Sendmail automatically fills list of local email domains ($=w).
I finally found a rather comprehensive solution here.
Option 2: remove any LOCAL_DOMAIN entry in the mc file
