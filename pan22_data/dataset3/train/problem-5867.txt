Microsoft made quite a few changes related to screen resolution and multi-monitor handling in RDP in Windows 8.1.
It probably works with the older RDP clients because it forces a protocol version downgrade where whatever issue causes this does not occur.
I don't know how to apply this update because it is not available on the Microsoft site.
And since this update is applyed on SOME computers, every others work too.
Although your symptoms do not appear to be related to resolutions, maybe the negotiation fails between the Windows 7 RDP client and Windows 8.1?
My guess is that it might be related to screen resolution.
That would also explain why it works for some users and not for others - they might have different resolution settings on either the client, or on the target 8.1 system.

After searching this post and other I've come across something that so far is working around the problem.
Credential prompt has been driving me mad for the past couple of days, and following the chain of recent events leads me to believe it's related to KB3035017 that our 2012 RDP servers installed recently.
I only get it with the automatic Windows update but not on every computers.
See if changing the screen resolution in the RDP client has any effect (in particular, changing between full screen mode and a specific resolution, and also changing the multi-monitor settings).

Testing RDP icons side my side on the same machine yields credentials prompt error one one, and successful login on the other.
Hope this helps others, I'll continue to monitor and search for a correct fix.
