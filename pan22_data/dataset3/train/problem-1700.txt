The first step is to check with your Internet Service Provider, as they are the one passing the connection to you.
The device is at 24.230.166.1 from your description, so it should be relatively easy to track down and disable the dhcp server.
There is another device on your network that is running a DHCP server, and from time to time, when you request an IP address, this device is answering first, and giving you an IP in the 24.230.166.0 range.
I have a linksys router connecting to a macbook pro; just wondering if I should update the firmware or what the problem is.
If it's plugged into any other port, you will experience problems like the ones you've described.
For now, were you able to get to the internet when it had the 24.230.166.1 address?
my router was originally 192.168.1.1, but recently the DHCP is assigning it to 24.230.166.1.
Make sure that your cable modem's Ethernet cable is plugged into the port marked "WAN" or "Internet" on the Linksys router.
When I enter in a manual IP and router number, I can type in 192.168.1.1 into safari and access my router settings, but can't get on actual sites.
My internet isn't very reliable and is hard connecting with different computers.
They can change the WAN IP--it happens more than you think.
If so, change it back to that, or leave the WAN on DHCP Client Mode.
