If that shows the same problem, it can hopfully be resolved with a driver/firmware update.
If these are all intel NICs, then make sure you are using the latest driver from the intel website instead of whatever the computer manufacturer or windows update says is the latest.
If the other board does not show the same symptom, you might have a faulty motherboard.
On this very same machine, if I boot into Fedora, it can use the card at its full capacity 1000Mbps transfering 80+ MB/s
I'v etried update the windows, I've tried reinstalling the drivers...
I've tried swapping in different cards, both PCI-E and PCI.
And all the cards work just fine when plugging into other machines on the same network.
If I set it to 1000Mbps, the connection is lost completely.
If I set it to 100Mbps, the transfer drops to 100-200K/s.
I had this issue with two different machines with windows7 64bit and the driver direct from intel was the solution, even though I seemed to be using the latest driver according to the pc/mobo manuf website and windows update (which I do not use for driver updates anyway).
The only different software that this machine has is virtual box with a VPN emulator, but disabling that VPN doesn't seem to do anything.
No matter what network card I put in, Windows would default its mode to 10Mbps full duplex.
This only happens to 1 of my machine, and only when booting into Windows 7.
I would like to get this fixed, hopefully, without reinstalling windows >_< Will that be possible?
