Windows refused to allow me to rename or delete either.
You will see the long and the short name of the directory.
You can always rename the short version as it does not contain spaces most of the time.
Open a command, change to the directory and do a "dir /x".
The answer from @Ocelot did not work on Windows Server 2008 R2.
Open it up, navigate to the file location, and you should be able to rename it.
EDIT: Sorry, reread the question and realized you are talking about a folder, not a file, so my answer really doesn't help you, but I'm going to leave it here for anyone else who has similar issues.
The solution was to explore a dir with 7zip file manager and rename the folder by removing a white space from the end.
Of course, this means moving everything you want to keep out of the folder first.
I just had a similar problem with folder "Monuments - Discography " created in linux.
The solution that finally worked for me was to open a command prompt (cmd.exe), cd to the folder, and then run the command:
Windows Vista and Windows 7 couldn't recognize this folder as a valid data and when I tried to rename or remove it I got Info message saying that folder does not exist etc.
It should correct illegal filenames (beware: it will move the files to a FOUND.000 folder on the root)
I had two files, one with a space at the end, and the other with a period at the end.
I tried doing it through Python's os module, as well, to no avail.
(I was having the same problem and this worked for me).
