Oracle Base provides some basic info as to how to get started on Auditing:
AUDIT_TRAIL = { none | os | db | db,extended | xml | xml,extended }
AUDIT SELECT TABLE, UPDATE TABLE, INSERT TABLE, DELETE TABLE BY cube BY ACCESS;
While auditing is the most comprehensive solution, it may be overkill in some situations.
xml,extended - As xml, but the SQL_BIND and SQL_TEXT columns are also populated.
In SQLPlus for example you could change your login script to turn spooling on like this.
The following list provides a description of each setting:
db,extended - As db, but the SQL_BIND and SQL_TEXT columns are also populated.
Oracle provides in-built auditing tools - consider using them instead of hand-rolling out these things.
For those times you might consider just logging your session.
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail=db,extended SCOPE=SPFILE;
Then you would simply select the data before you delete it so that it would all be in the spool file.
db or true - Auditing is enabled, with all audit records stored in the database audit trial (SYS.AUD$).
To enable auditing to database audit trail enable auditing to db
xml- Auditing is enabled, with all audit records stored as XML format OS files.
os- Auditing is enabled, with all audit records directed to the operating system's audit trail.
The audited logs can be brought up by querying DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL
Now to audit SELECTS, INSERTS, UPDATES, DELETES by user cube do this:
