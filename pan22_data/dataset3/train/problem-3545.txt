However other settings should first be tried AFTER you backup the container.
Remember, all PM provides is a simplified web UI to the existing tools that are part of OpenVZ and KVM anyway.
I'm using Proxmox Virtual Enviroment (v 2.1) to manage my openvz virtual machines.
Maybe I missing something or it's better to switch to another openvz control panel?
If there is a problem restarting the container, you'll more likely know exactly what it is by reading response back from CLI than trying to do this in the PM web interface.
I think your only option is going to be to remove and then re-create the container.
I'm not sure off the top of my head if you can do this with command line tools, so that might be worth checking out.
Sometimes I want to rebuild a virtual machine with other openvz container template, but I couldn't find any tools in proxmox's gui to do so.
If it won't start, go to CLI and do it at the command line (Google for OpenVZ commands to do this, or on the Proxmox site).
In contaner options when I choosing a template item the edit button becomes disabled:
We've been able to change disk storage settings without affecting a container without issue.
Then shutdown the container, and change the settings.
Its often better to be able to manage them at the CLI level in case you get into trouble.
The easiest way I've done this before is to backup the OpenVZ container using vzdump or migrate the container to a 2nd PVE server.
Some things you might want to be sure to do in the process.
