I have 5 VMs that I use regularly at specific unscheduled time, so I don't want do the steps of logging into azure portal, starting VMs one by one then do the same to shut them down, at every time I need to use them!
Note that it temporarily saves your login token to disk and loads it in each background job, otherwise you'll get an error about not being logged in in the background job (see https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/issues/1288).
Using Azure Automation to run VMs during office hours only
Here are 3 links that explains step by step how to do this
Have a look at Shutdown Roles This API can Shutdown (and optionally deallocate) one or more VMs at a time.
You can also use the Azure Virtual Machine scheduler from SmiKar Software.
For some reason, this wasn't implemented in the PowerShell cmdlets (perhaps you can contribute :) )
There is a Service Management API call that will do it for you using REST (assuming you are using classic VMs).
For those using the Resource Manager API here's a script I wrote to restart multiple VMs in parallel.
Similarly, Start Roles can start multiple VMs at a time.

Before calling the above function you'll need to log in by calling
It is already well documented on Microsoft Web site.
AVMS as it is known will connect to your Azure Subscriptions and allow you to select the VMs and a power on or down schedule to suit.

Is it possible to write and save some kind of script that launches azure powershell, then authenticate azure subscription then start/shutdown multiple VMs in one step?
Restart-AzureRmVM doesn't return until a VM finishes restarting, so this script starts multiple such commands as background jobs.

Definitively, you should use Azure Automation to run on schedule a PowerShell Script to shutdown or start your VM in Azure.
