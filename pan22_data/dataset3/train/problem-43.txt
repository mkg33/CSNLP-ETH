Is it possible to somehow block ARP on a home wireless network router?
Is it possible to install some thrid-party firmware that will give me this functionality?
The easy way to force clients to talk only to the router and nobody else, is to disable ARP on the client, and then add the static ARP entry for the router MAC.
Nevertheless blocking ARP isn't a very good way to prevent communication anyway.
This way you can get to the router, and cannot resolve anything else if you try.
Basically I don't want the access point to forward ARP packets between clients.
If your wireless clients are all on the same broadcast domain and the router has a single interface on this network then it won't have any central involvement in the ARP process.
I guess some wireless routers have this feature, but many don't.
A router, by definition, routes between different broadcast domains.
It could easily by bypassed by observing MAC addresses on the wire and adding a static ARP entry.
For this reason the router can't stop the clients from communicating by just not participating in ARP.
The clients will issue requests to the broadcast address and the relevant client will respond directly.
It would also be fine if the access point completely blocks communications between clients.
