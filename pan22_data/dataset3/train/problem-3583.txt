the servers connecting to it both have two 1Gb ports on cat5e to...
Typically you're running iSCSI over Ethernet in LAN environments (though it doesn't have to be), so you're going to want to use the types of cable suitable for an Ethernet LAN.
For copper cable-based Ethernet with speeds up to gigabit, unshielded category 5 UTP cable is fine.
It's SCSI commands encapsulated in IP datagrams (basically).
You typically can't find much category 5 cable today, though, so category 5e or category 6 is fine, too.
(Let's not have the "Cat 5e / cat 5 gigabit Ethernet argument" here again... Gigabit Ethernet works fine on properly terminated and certified category 5 cable plants.)
I will use it in a HP server, which has two HP NC382i Integrated Dual Port PCI Express Gigabit Server Adapters.
Does it use CAT 5 or some special cabling and port (UTP)?
I searched the internet, but I couldn't find which sort of cables iSCSI adapters require.
I currently have acces to a HDS box that shares iSCSI via two 1Gb cards on cat5e
