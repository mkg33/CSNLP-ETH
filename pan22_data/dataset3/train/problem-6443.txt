I would like to make it work with my Raspberry pi 2, however I don't want to just click it on because I am using pins 1, 7 (GPIO 4), 11 (GPIO 17), 17, and 40 (GPIO 21).
On the bottom of the screen there should be some 2x16 gpio pins which you can use.
I need a way to wire it from the raspberry pi with some sort of wired connector that would enable me to continue using those GPIO ports.
Try plugin the screen to a breadboard, it'll be easier to tap onto those other pins!
This display seems to use a few ports on the gpio as stated on the adafruit's website:
After sequentially removing pins until something failed I discovered that the pins used by are (I will be including the physical pin numbers in parenthesis for simplicity as per this diagram http://www.raspberry-pi-geek.com/howto/GPIO-Pinout-Rasp-Pi-1-Model-B-Rasp-Pi-2-Model-B):

I haven't been able to find a satisfactory answer to this, so I wend ahead and mapped all the pins myself.

There's also pins you can just use beside the gpio connector for you to use:
