It's a bootable CD which lets you securely erase your hard drives.
Another suggestion, for Macs, is to use Apple's Disk Utility program.
It's included on the OS X install disc, so if you boot from that, you can open Disk Utility, select your drive, and erase it (there are some options for how many times to write over data and such).
Also, if you happen to have lots of important data, the easiest and fastest way can be to physically destroy the medium.
As a side note on scenarios when you cannot always format and wipe the disk and have to relinquish ownership of a computer with OS intact (like resigning a job and returning the laptop), Scott Hanselman has noted down a checklist on activities to carry out before giving it up forever.

A sledgehammer blow is much simpler than overwriting 1TB disk 15 times with random binary patterns.
