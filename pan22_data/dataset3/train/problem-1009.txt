The passphrase is here precisely to make it impossible.
When I reattached the monitor to the server, I saw the message
Like wazoox and sybreon said, this goes against the goal of encrypting the partition.
I have an old desktop computer that I want to start using as a headless server.
You can do so by installing an SSH server into your initramfs.
Alternatively, if you want to whole server to be on encrypted partion, you could virtualize it with openvz or kvm, and then mount manually the partition, and finally starting the virtual server.
But if that is what you want, look at the 2nd post here.
With that server running you can log into your server before the root fs mount and enter the LUKS password.
You could modify initramfs so it enter the password itself.
Then I disconnected the monitor and keyboard and  rebooted the desktop remotely over ssh from the laptop.
With a monitor and a screen attached, I installed Ubuntu Server edition with encrypted LVM on the machine.
To easily mount your partition but only after boot, add "noauto" to its fstab line in the options column, eg.
So apparently it was waiting for me to enter my passphrase before it would boot up.
You shouldn't have your OS to boot on an encrypted partion.
After installation I rebooted and, still with the monitor and keyboard attached, filled out the passphrase and was able to login.
It installs a Dropbear SSH server right into your initramfs.
When I tried to login again via ssh I got the message:
Make sure you can login as root if you've encrypted /home.
