So at your registrar's web portal, you specify for both domain names that you'll be using two name servers (ns1 and ns2).
If you have no experience hosting your own name servers than you shouldn't.
the company where you bought (rented) the domain names.
if your web site runs on the server with IP address 203.0.113.80, you can enter this information in the respective files:
Better to just host all your DNS stuff at your registrar, NameCheap in this case.
Now, for each DNS zone (mycompany.com and myblog.com) we need to specify which  name servers are responsible for the zones.
In addition you can enter extra A records for your web server, e.g.
Let's give them the IP addresses 203.0.113.53 and 192.0.2.53.
These files will then contain at least a SOA, two NS and two A records.
Also, buying a second VPS just to host your secondary DNS server might be a bit overkill.
This gives you less headaches and better reliability.
And it's quite easy to get things wrong if you don't know what you're doing.
If you want to host your own DNS zones, you need at least two DNS servers.
Apart from the generic BIND configuration you also need to specify a zone for each domain name you own:
Remember that we need to enter this information at your registrar for the two domains, i.e.
PS: That is not the correct guide to use for what you're trying to achieve.
There's no technical reason that you need to host your own name servers.
They can have any DNS names, so let's use ns1.mycompany.com and ns2.mycompany.com as you stated.
They have specific and extensive experience doing this, so let them do it.
All in all, there is quite a lot to configure and to maintain in order to set this up.
The last two (A) records are glue records required for the mycompany.com domain.
Next you need to set up those two name servers using BIND or PowerDNS (or any other name server).
