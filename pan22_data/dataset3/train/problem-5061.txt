When I started the computer, a flashing folder icon with a question mark appeared.
Disk Utility didn't even show the drive, just the install DVD.
I bought a replacement drive, the Western Digital Scorpio Black and installed it by following these instructions.
It didn't show up in Disk Utility, and when I went to install the OS, the drive was not available for selection as an installation drive.
I booted from the Snow Leopard install disk and ran Disk Utility to see if I could repair the drive.
After a few hours of the laptop being off, I was able to start it normally and copy most of my important files to an external hard drive before the OS froze, and subsequent reboots showed a flashing folder icon.
Is this something more sinister than hard drive failure?
Installation was pretty straightforward, but all was not well.
When I booted the laptop using the install disk as a startup disk, it could not recognize my new hard drive as a viable installation disk.
Recently I had the misfortune of having (what I think was) hard drive failure on my September 2009 MacBook Pro.
