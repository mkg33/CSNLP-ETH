It's really nice not to have the server disconnect as a result.
On the rare occasion I've also needed traffic isolation I add a second pair for that.
Microsoft clusters require an additional NIC port for heartbeat purposes between nodes.
As far as I'm concerned, if at all possible a server should have redundant everything.
Some refer to this as LaCP, linux knows this as mode=4 as described below.
Broadcast policy: transmits everything on all slave interfaces.
This might come under "# You need to connect to 2 different physical networks", but if the server was also a router, it would need two NICs.
XOR policy: Transmit based on [(source MAC address XOR'd with destination MAC address) modulo slave count].
More than once over the years I've unplugged the wrong cable (usually caused by rushing too much).
Adaptive transmit load balancing: channel bonding that does not require any special switch support.
Creates aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings.
Is there any reason to have 2 NICs on a server BESIDES the following cases?
Adaptive load balancing: includes balance-tlb plus receive load balancing (rlb) for IPV4 traffic, and does not require any special switch support.
There's only one other major reason that I can think of, which is similar to redundancy, and that's Trunking, so you could configure traffic to flow over 2x1Gbit ports, giving you 2Gbit of total throughput.
Linux interface bonding modes give a few other options:
