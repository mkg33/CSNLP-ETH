I haven't found a lot out there googling this topic.
Like with a GPP's GPO and create it directly with the %desktop% location.
If I log into the machine without the policy being applied to my account the domain users experience will not change.
The only thing that I've found will "jump start" the GPO is if I log into the problem machine and I have the policy applied to the OU my user account is a member of.
I have that remaining 10% that just don't want to behave.
So something must be happening to the system when I log in as a domain admin and have the policy applied to my account that then allows all other domain user accounts to accept the policy when they log in after me.
No need for a central's file and it's place it on the user's own desktop directly.
If the GPO place the shortcut in the Public / All User's folder, then it's a local security problem.
I can run gpresult /r and see that the result of the GPO should be displaying but it isn't.
A restricted user by default can only write in it own's profile.
I have created a GPO that will put a shortcut on our receptionists desktops that is linked to a file share that is full of Internet shortcuts for Insurance verification.
The way you push the shortcut can be made other some other way.
