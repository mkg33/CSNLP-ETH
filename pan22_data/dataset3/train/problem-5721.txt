The following link is to a guide that will show you how to do so.
Does this mean I should not expect to make this server work with Mac and just give up?
I have a print server that I had been using to connect my Windows machines with my Canon printer via my LAN connection.
It appears that there is a work-around for enabling Lion to talk with the older (less-secure) devices.
After looking at the manual for your print server - it does support OS X, but you're not seeing drivers on the website because they are readily available in the OS.
Once you're done with the guide, try to install again and see what happens.
It appears that Apple disabled older versions of AFP / AppleTalk in Lion due to security concerns.
Instead of step 2, attempt to add the printer in System Preferences- it may fail and then go to step 3.
The manual refers to AppleTalk in the protocols available on the device.
As you can see, the maker does not offer a driver for Mac.
Recently I switched to Mac, and I disovered that this server is not working on the Mac.
