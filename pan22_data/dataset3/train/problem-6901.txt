Have you tried to create a new db and looked at its values?
If there are several my.cnf files, all looking likely (e.g.
You can now check for files using the above output at /etc/my.cnf, then /etc/mysql/my.cnf and so on.
Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
Running this command from the command line / terminal will show where MySQL will look for the my.cnf file on Linux/BSD/OS X systems:
If there isn't one at one of those locations, you can create one and know MySQL will use it.
It seems like the file your cnf created is being superseded by another one.
I've tried creating a /etc/my.cnf(as shown below) and it had no affect
How are you sure that your cnf file is not being read?
I've managed to locate my install directory for MySQL: /usr/local/mysql/
strace -fe open /etc/init.d/mysql start 2>&1|grep my.cnf should show you the system call used to open the file.
), then you can run strace to see where MySQL binary tries to find its configuration file, but I do think that's an overkill.
Where can I find the path to my.cnf to know where I should configure the server?
On a Linux system 'locate my.cnf" will be the fastest solution.
