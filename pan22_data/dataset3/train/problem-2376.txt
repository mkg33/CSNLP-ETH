You can also use something like ExpanDrive that has a graphical interface and helps you set up and maintain the webDAV mount.
Here is a solution: https://github.com/childrss/webdav
see Apple's MOUNT_WEBDAV man page for more information.
To mount a webdav for a certain user you would use like this:
I was looking for a solution to make automatic downloads through a command-line script connecting to a WebDav filesystem and found an open source software (for Mac and Windows) which really helped!
It provides both graphical user-interface and command-line options.
If you don't want to be prompted for the username and password then you can store the user credentials in your keychain.
In (at least) 10.9 and 10.10, mounting via WebDAV via the command line isn't easy -- the mount_webdav command does not work the way it is documented and fails silently leaving an empty mount point while the interactive version (-i) of the command works as expected.
The non-interactive version files (specifically storing and retrieving of the login/password).
The correct way to mount a WebDAV-enabled server directory in OS X is like the example you mentioned works.
The reason it's asking for a username and password is because you've specified the -i argument, which denotes Interactive mode (you are prompted for the username and password).
