So, what happens when the printer trys to fall back to TT fonts?
Back in the day, when the first Macs came out, Apple needed a way of storing the characters, the mappings, and the style, or look of what we know more thoroughly as fonts.
If your printer is requesting the TT font of that specific font and your PC can't supply it, then the printer will request a font from within the PCs range, Windows defaults to Calibri, and we have a slight problem.
I'll try to break this down so that it's as easy to understand as possible.
OpenType fonts are a new standard, a more widely available, easy to use font storage format.
However, the underlying TT compatibility is still there, which the printer will try to fall back to.
An important thing to note, however is that TT fonts were Apples way of saying to Adobe We can do that too!.
So, without going into too much detail, here is the breakdown between OpenType (OT) fonts and TrueType (TT) fonts.
Since most fonts are still widely available in TTF format (TrueTypeFont) then, all you have to do when searching for a font is add ttf to the end of the search term, for example:
Unfortunately... even todays most advanced printers still can't seem to get OT fonts right.
This was the beginning of TT fonts and as such, to print in these newfound fonts, printers had to adapt, and support TT fonts, or what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG).
I've noticed that people that don't do much web font stuff don't quite understand the difference between OpenType fonts and TrueType fonts.
