and they often allow you to set different credit limits for each accounts.
That way you have security and accountability, the password keeper knows that if something untoward occurs who had access to the accounts at the time.
Remember though, the way to go for responsibility, is to have each of the user hold the password of their own account so that others does not know, and this allow the best accountability.
That person can keep track of all the passwords, loan them out to staff that have a need, then when the staff member has finished the password keeper can change the password.
Since lastpass supports manually adding password entries, you can create entries for non-web applications.
You can create one account, and share the master password.
If that's not possible it seems to me that you should nominate someone as a sort of "password keeper", someone in a position of management maybe.
I can change a password or create a login anywhere (laptop, home PC, Linux, IE, Firefox, wherever), and all of my "systems" see the change.
Whenever anyone changes your password for an online account, it automagically updates the lastpass system so that the next person to use that site automagically uses the new password.
Obviously the ideal situation would be to have separate accounts for everyone and everything.
I have used their service for years, and I love it.
There is an online service that does what you need: LastPass.
The way to go is, of course, split accounts; usually the accountability part is only money, and part of the method is to allow for different accounts using 'additional' credit cards, and all the card belong to one account.
