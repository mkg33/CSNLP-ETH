you are lacking of basic system notions my friend.
Perhaps a security vulnerability that can exploit that port without a service listening on it for connections?
But best practice in firewall setting is to allow only specified list of ports and disable all others.
But it means that there must be HUGE error in kernel to accept and use packets on every port and there is no way how this can be populated in kernel upstream.
This question popped in my head when I noticed that I could not telnet to any port unless a service was actually listening on it, even if I had a FW rule in place for it.
If I have a linux server with a FW rule (iptables) to allow inbound to a particular port does a service have to be running and listening to accept that connection or is there another way to access the system using that port?
So answer to your question is no, port with no service is closed and safe.
Without telling the system what to do I wonder how the system will provide connection to any inbound service.
When you run a service on your system, whatever port that service is using, the service notifies system to open a socket on that port for that service and then you'll see that system is listening on that port because its been told to do that.
You cannot access a port that has no service associated with it.
If the service, say sshd, is not running, how would you expect the system to open a socket on port 22?
Of course, if someone compromise your server thru running service, he/she can start new service which will listen on new port.
