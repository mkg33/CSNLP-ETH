If it's the first, you must trust the root it was signed with instead.
However, you certificate is issued against the full domain name.
To enable trust, install this certificate in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.
For your local network, you might using the host name instead of full domain name.
The error that I get with an untrusted, self-signed root is this: This CA root certificate is not trusted.
If any part of the chain is broken, untrusted, or missing, you will receive such an error.
If it's the latter, it's a matter of setting a few properties in openssl.conf.
This may be that during the self-signing process, you may have told openssl to sign the certificate with a different root (not self-sign), or it may not have been set as a root CA.
But for you, it says it cannot verify up to a trusted root certificate.
The error you are receiving is not that it is not a trusted root certificate, but that it is not able to verify up the chain to a trusted certificate.
I think the problem is that how did you access the resources.
