I was looking around for a hardware RAID expansion card but noticed that the MB also only comes with PCI 5V slot.
I'm giving a new life to an old box and I plan on running a Linux server that will handle general file duties with redundancy.
As for capping the speeds - 1Gbps over the PCI bus is more than you can squeeze down your ethernet connection - even with gigabit ethernet you still won't get anywhere near those speeds, so you should be fine.
If you only need 2 disks, use the on-board SATA ports and Software RAID1.
The MB doesn't come with more than 2 SATA 1 ports and they don't support RAID at all.
A decent hardware RAID system will perform all mirroring operations within itself without reference to the PCI bus at all.
Considering (according to Wiki) that the max transfer of the PCI bus is 133 MB/s (~1.06 Gb/s):
That is if thouse SATA ports are connected to the chipset and not on the PCI bus.
Would I be able to effectively run the OS on the main port, and the FS on the RAID array, without capping the speeds, or should I go ahead and upgrade the MB?
Its waaay faster than PCI card - cheap PCI cards can't do RAID in hardware either - an the CPU overhead is neglible with modern CPUs.
And Matt Jerkins is wrong: You can get up to 100MByte/s with Gigabit Ethernet these days with a fast protocol (NFS, FTP).
