I suppose I should have fully read the man page (man sssd.conf).
I can then login to the box with "uswuser@usw.example.com" assuming "uswuser" is in the "USW\Linux Admins" AD group.
Is it possible to configure Linux authentication to work in a similar way that a traditional Windows server does?
Please let me know if you see any other issues with this architecture.
I've configured our RHEL7 instance to support Active Directory login integration by using the documentation HERE.
That is, the server has a single computer account in one sub-domain, but can authenticate against any of the other domains.
This describes using the "realm" command to configure the "sssd" service allowing for AD Integration.
I've used the following commands to configure sssd via realmd:
I've also tried other variations such as "use.example.com\\useuser".
I assume this command fails because the RHEL7 server is not joined to the USE.EXAMPLE.COM  domain in addition to the USW.EXAMPLE.COM domain.
For example, join this RHEL7 server to "usw.example.com" but also grant access to "use.example.com\useuser"?
I would also like to grant users in our "use.example.com" (note USE instead of USW) domain access to this box:
There may be something fundamental that I've missed.
I can do a "realm join' for use.wlgore.com but that creates two different computer accounts, which is undesirable.
The RHEL7 box also (of course) shows up as a computer account in AD.
This was resolved by adding the following line to /etc/sssd/sssd.conf:
