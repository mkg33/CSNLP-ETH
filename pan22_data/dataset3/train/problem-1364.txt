Third-party utilities like TextWrangler and MacVim, as well as built-in utilities, all get a crack at it.
Any utility which tries to attach to text context menus could be causing the hang, so check all such third-party software.
When you highlight text in most OS X applications, the system passes that text to a variety of utilities which analyze it to see what that text might be.
Try removing the third-party utilities to see if that solves the problem.
Most likely, one of these is hanging for some reason.
From a process dump of the not responding terminal I could see many DataDetectors entries in the stack, and after some search I saw here how to disable DataDetectors for Mail, and thus for terminal this would be:
The utility causing the problem might not be one of those listed in the context menu: those are just the ones which decided they can do something with the text.
For example, a url, a phone number, or a street address.
I have been bugged by this problem for a long time, needing to force quit the terminal and start over again.
