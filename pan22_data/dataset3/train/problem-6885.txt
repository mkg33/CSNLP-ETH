I don't have anything to recommend from personal experience, but I can speak out against two earlier suggestions: Bugzilla is a nightmare for non-technical users, and Mantis is a steaming pile of usability fails.
I know that Bugzilla and Jira (very good but not open source) are currently supported.
I don't know if that counts as "simpler", but it works well for us.
An alternative to Bugzilla/Redmine is Mantis Bug Tracker.
One of the issues with most trackers is that they drive clients away on first sight.
I'm currently using a product from a company that rhymes with "Bog Peak" at work for issue tracking.
(Although Lighthouse doesn't really qualify as open source, it does provide free options.)
I highly recommend Snowy Evening, because it's just as powerful as these others but is also extremely easy to use for my clients:
But not open source, so it doesn't answer your question.
If yours developers are using Eclipse, you should take care of a good integration with Mylin, a wonderful eclipse plugin to access to yours bugs directly from Eclipse and also link source code to them.
