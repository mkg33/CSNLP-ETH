I've found that when you're really overheating your computer won't start up immediately after shutting off, or if you do, will shut off again before making it to the desktop.
When I had bad ram, windows itself was pretty good about mentioning that it thought I must have bad ram after it was started from a crash, and that I should scan for ram problems.
This was the only thing that cooled down the computer enough to keep running.
Personally I suspect you have an issue where you PCIe BIOS isn't quite up to date with the geforce's use pattern.
Eventually I opened the side panel of the case and left it open, aiming a 16" fan directly at the motherboard.
In your screen, it shows that the nforce3-pro CPU is 85 degrees.
I had a computer case without fans once, and my Pentium III processor would overheat easily (it's not that hard in the Israeli summer...).
OTOH when I found that my MSI AtiXpress200 motherboard's bios wouldn't support the GeForce card I had, during a game it would shut off at a random point.
