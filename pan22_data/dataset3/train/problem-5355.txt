You do however have two choices to resolve this problem.
Through no fault of your own as noted in the comments of the above answers your IP block is listed on several black lists.
Your IP of 67.18.44.5 is blacklisted on SORBS-SPAM as well as FIVETEN and LASHBACK.
- Please dont attempt/waste your time trying to have your IP removed as A - The blacklist will problerly denie your request  B - Your IP will likely change weekly/after a powercut/after your lease runs out.
If you need any more information please let me know.
This is normally because you're listed on a DNS RBL of some kind.
It will tell you possible reasons your emails are going to SPAM folder and what you can do about the same.
Use one of the online RBL checkers like the ones run by anti-abuse or mxtoolbox to see if your MX IP address is listed.
You generally have to approach each RBL to get removed from their lists, but you should understand why you are being listed and fix whatever is going wrong before you ask them to remove your listing.
The problem you are experiecning is 100% caused by your enternal IP Address being in a dynamic range.
And it turns out you are listed in SORBS as well as some others.
