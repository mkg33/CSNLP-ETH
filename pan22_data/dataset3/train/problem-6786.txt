according to this description from the Watchguard docs.
While googling, the only instance of this exact error message was a case where there was a difference between the client and the server version, but I've already checked that (both are version 11.9).
It looks much like there went something wrong during the installation or something corrupted it later.
The authentication itself works (no error about wrong login info with proper credentials, and I can see the user in the Firebox System manager), but I can't establish a connection after that.
If some VPN related settings have changed on your firewall, by you or someone else, then reinstall your VPN Client on your local computer.
I've set up the device for SSLVPN (added policies, users, a group etc.)
I don't really know what to do, because I'm pretty sure I've done everything according to the manual.
I'm using the Watchguard Mobile VPN with SSL Client, and when I try to login, the log outputs the following:
To be REALLY sure, that you have the same client version as on the Firebox, you can download the client directly from the firebox itself by opening https://Firebox_IP/sslvpn.html
Now I have to admit that configuring and managing a this thing is not usually one of my tasks and I haven't done it before, so if any info is still missing, please ask and I will supply whatever is needed.
Takes just 5 minutes, so it's worth giving it a try.
