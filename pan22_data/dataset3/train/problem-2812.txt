The rule of thumb is always set the resolution what your LCD monitor preffers in order to get the sharpness so for example you picked up and lcd 19" it says resolution supports up to 1400x900 that's the highest it gets but it can also go lower the only problem going lower it basically means you no longer get that proper sharpeness that the lcd monitor can provide.
So another words don't worry about what kinda video/monitors each computer is using set to what the lcd monitor can provide simply changing the windows view, fonts size, icon size on the application that will fix your problem.
If you're concern about the fonts and icons being too small at a higher resolution you're better off changing that feature in windows to make your fonts bigger and icon bigger.
To help you out with your question if all the monitors are the same it wouldn't matter which resolution you set for.
The video card you're using they're all going to support that resolution "1024x768" with no problem regardless how much memory your video card has or one is higher then the other.
