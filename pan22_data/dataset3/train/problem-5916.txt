My question being would using PVC suffice to feed the cabling through or should I stick with aluminum?
Either steel or PVC will work, and your concerns seem to be of the poorly founded sort.
The conduit will not "act as a lightning rod" any more than the cable will, unless you plan to stick it out through the roof.
Twisted pair cabling is highly resistant to noise by design, and metal conduit won't add any, regardless - but due to the cable design most noise concerns with Cat5e or Cat6 are entirely inapplicable to a normal single-family house.
But I have never done this before so I wanted to ask.
I am in the process of running Cat6 from my 1st floor, to my attic.
In my mind aluminum would create 2 potential issues one of which being data loss due to "added noise" and secondly possibly become a lightning rod.
I am removing the sheet rock on the 1st floor and going to place conduit in the wall.
Aluminum would be an odd conduit material - most metallic conduit is galvanized (zinc-coated) steel.
