I see some articles from Windows-type IT mags, so I doubt you will be the first guy.
Is there any batch script or command line command that can do Windows Update automatically on multiple remote servers (maybe via psexec)?
Not prefer using a VB script, but if there's one available, that's fine too.
There is a freeware and pro version, but I cannot say what the licensing restrictions are.
So, you either need to bake your own binary or someone else's non-MSFT code (a la Wuinstall), or do the same amount of scripting in VBScript.
To be honest, I have never tested it myself, wuinstall.
If you pay attention to this script, you will see you are opening up COM objects and such.
If you can get over the scripting, I know this Winboxen sysadmin lucifist wrote a PowerShell script to do what you are looking for.
If not, there is TechNet documentation to cure your ills.
You say Win23k Server, so I am not sure whether or not you have PS installed.
If you want a more batch-style, psexec method, you need to look into a shareware CLI utility I have seen before.
