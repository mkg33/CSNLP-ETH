As you can imagine, this is scrolling at rather high speed.
I think it will be a waste of bandwidth/cpu if you keep this IP and try to block some way.
After waiting a couple minutes, this is what I see in my Apache logs:
There is documentation online regarding the use of mod_rewrite to drop some of this crap.
All the requests are having a 404 (file not found) response, so it looks like you are under some kind of botnet attack, quite frequent in this VPS.
Is there a security flaw inside the Debian distribution installed by my hosting provider?
If I ran into this situation, I would shut down the web server, and then contact the provider to let them know of the issue and ask for a different IP address.
That should, at a very least, give you some protection.
If you just got the thing, it was probably whoever last had the IP address running an open proxy.
If you look at the urls, it all seems advertisements/banner.
(As long as I am not sure it is indeed a security issue that stems from the hosting provider distribution I'd rather not give out its name)
Someone has been using your VPS's IP address as a proxy to abuse the various ad networks shown here.
I just booted a new, mint Debian Squeeze x64 server from my cloud hosting provider.
