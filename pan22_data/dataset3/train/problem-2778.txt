This database was created by a contractor who is no longer around.
As far as I can tell, I think you will have to update those references.
Rather than hunting around for all of the linked server references and updating them to point at the new linked server, or changing them to use a synonym name, would it be possible (or acceptable) to create the new linked server, then add a synonym that uses the same name as the current fully qualified linked server reference, but points to the new linked server?
The content on that linked server is being moved, and the server being retired.
That said, if you remove the square brackets you will at the very least get this issue
Buried all throughout the database are references to a single table on a linked server.
If the old server is being retired (take offline)  have your IT folks set the DNS entry of the retired server's name to point to the new server that will be taking over.
I have a database that is used for reporting services.
The first problem here is that your synonym DOESN"T look identical to a linked server reference.
For the least amount of work, you could set up the synonym as you have here which should work, and then find the references and just add the square brackets to make it match the synonym.
All queries using the linked server point to OPub.dbo.ADE.
It's not the cleanest solution but you don't have to update anything in the database and the linked server connection stays in place.
Will SQL Server get confused by a synonym name that looks identical to a linked server reference?
I don't know of a way to use a synonym for a linked server which would be the ideal answer here.
By using square brackets [] you are telling it to treat the periods just like any other character and not separate out the SRAPP to treat it like a server, database, schema etc...
This would allow me to leave all database code intact and minimize disruption to business users.
