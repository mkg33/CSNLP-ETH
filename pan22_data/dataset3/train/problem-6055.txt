Sorry on my phone, can't really get all fancy with my reply ;)
Right now in my test environment, after the telco router, we are using a Linux router/firewall which is then connected to a Layer 2 switch.
It is hard to ascertain just from the web sites if they do exactly this or not.
Anything running on the gateway should not drag it down doing traffic accounting.
I would like to have an out of the box solution, preferably open source.
Each VM will have a private class ip address which is Natted by the gateway, or we may eventually run more than firewall/reverse proxy off a layer 3 switch.
I have looked at the web sites for Nagios, Zenoss, Zabbix, ntops on the firewall, etc.
It needs to be able to scale out to a few hundred servers and each server will have several VMs on it.
So my thinking is that I can do it off of a promiscuous port on the switches, or at the gateway firewall.
I need to track total bandwidth per VM for each machine, and I need to do it in a way that it is not part of the VM.
If you're using VMWare's ESX/ESXi and vCenter then consider using their own Chargeback product - it'll let you charge on a per-VM/customer/vApp basis based on a range of measurements.
Does anyone have suggestions on the easiest way to set this up, and the easiest tool to use.
I am setting up a new network which customers will host their applications on.
Split your network into a vlan per customer and graph with Cacti?
