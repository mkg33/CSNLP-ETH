First, http://www.kashum.com/blog/1217783696 describes using the plist method, but it appears to specify more options in the xml than you're using.
If I use launchctl to execute this file, svnserve starts as expected, but it doesn't automatically start when the system starts up or I log in.
As I understand it (I'm still fairly green with OSX), the best way to do that is to utilize launchd.
You have to use NetworkState when running in daemon mode as launchd doesn't do dependancies at all, so the daemon almost always gets started before the network is up.
To that end, I have created the following .plist file in the /Library/LaunchDaemons folder.
I have installed Subversion onto my iMac running Snow Leopard, but am having trouble getting svnserve to start up automatically.
So, I'd probably try a /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.tigris.subversion.svnserve.plist that looked like this:
If anyone here could provide any suggestions as to how to get this to work, I'd really appreciate it.
I've not created any launchd plists in inetdCompatibility mode, but I've found running programs in daemon mode w/KeepAlive's NetworkState set to true to work pretty well.
Second, http://www.scottboms.com/2007/03/launchsvnserveatstartup/ describes using an prebuilt working plist file to drop into the LaunchDaemons folder, modify the path specified, and then run
