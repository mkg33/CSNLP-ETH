Is there another wireless card that's currently available that would work?
This particular server only has a single PCI slot available, so that may be a limitation.
I have recently been trying to setup a wireless access point on a small ubuntu server, but the wifi card doesn't seem to be compatible.
The particular model that I had (that is to say, there are multiple models of the F5D7050) used either a Ralink or Realtek chipset (exactly which I can't recall), but I understand that some variations use different chipsets, which may or may not be supported, so you'd be taking a risk on that one.
If it works, I'd be happy with 802.11 N-draft or even 802.11 G.
I'd also prefer a card that supports 802.11 N (non-draft), but the important thing is that it works.
Better yet, I recall there being somewhere on the Ubuntu wiki is a table of compatible wireless cards and adapters that you should take a look at; try starting around here and you might find it (if it even still exists): https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs.
I've gotten the Belkin F5D7050 to work under Ubuntu, though I seem to recall some amount of manual configuration (which may even have included manually downloading and compiling drivers).
Its a Dlink DWA-552, which I was hoping would work, but the chipset doesn't seem to support what I'm trying to do.
