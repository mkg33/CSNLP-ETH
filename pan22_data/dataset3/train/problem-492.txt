However, this list is growing and changing fairly regularly for users at a specific domain, and it would be much easier if we could set up a method to simply allow all email from that domain to send to our distribution list rather than needing to specify each individual user there.
You could use a combination of example 1 on that page and a transport rule to do what you want, I think.
We use delivery management settings to restrict who can send to this list, and have set up mail contacts for external users that we want to add to this list and that is working fine.
This seems like a natural application for moderated transport in Exchange Online (see https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd298007(v=exchg.150).aspx).
I haven't found any obvious way to essentially authorize the domain to send to our distribution list, or to somehow allow the external domain to be considered inbound email; I have tried different workarounds with MailUsers, SharedMailboxes, and External Contacts, but haven't found a way for this to work.
However when users over there send mail to MAILTO-EXAMPLE@otherdomain.com the mail is redirected and not forwarded, as such the from address is from the originating user and is subsequently blocked.
We have a distribution list in our organization called MAIL-EVERYONE@example.com.
One idea that we thought might work is setting up an email address on their end called MAILTO-EXAMPLE@otherdomain.com which forwards all mail received to MAIL-EVERYONE@example.com, then set that user as a mail contact on our end.
