The switch is making sure that the new link doesn't form a loop in your network before it risks forwarding traffic on it.
Unless you specifically configure a layer 3 switch to do some customized actions it should behave by default as close as possible to a layer 2 switch, and it also has some added perks on top of that so it's always an interesting addition.
On the ports that you will only connect to stations:
Second hand switches can often have the previous configuration left on them, in which case it could be doing just about anything.
As womble stated in his answer, a second-hand switch may have a configuration from the previous owner.
As lynxman stated in his answer, an unconfigured L3 switch should behave as a L2 switch.
The kind of problem you're having looks to me more like one of these problems:
The fix assuming you know this link will never, ever form a loop in your network is to enable "fast link" or "spanning tree portfast" on the port.
This takes about 30 seconds, and likely the station is giving up on PXE faster than that.
Dig out the manual, and work out how to reset the switch to factory defaults.
If it's another switch, or another port on this same switch, a decision has to be made whether to forward traffic on that port or to block it.
When a port is first enabled, the switch needs to interrogate what is connected to that port.
