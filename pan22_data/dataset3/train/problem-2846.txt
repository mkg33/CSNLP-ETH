I'm a dev and not a DBA so I'm hoping the experts can hook me up with a solution or at least an explanation as to why.
We created a SQL Server view (for using with SSRS) of some of the OpenEdge tables using code similar to the following:
We also worked with progress and there was some optimizations they recommended on their side as well.
We have a SQL Server database setup with a Linked Server setup connecting to a Progress OpenEdge database.
What we did was dump the views all together and added sprocs that perform the openquery with the limited set of return values and a restricted where clause.
Performance still isn't great but it's much better than it was.
after that create a job that runs the stored procedure once a day or depending on the schedule you need.
We are migrating from a Progress backend to a SQL and this was a step to enable Report Designer which it accomplished.
why don't you run a job that transfers the data from your progress server to your sql server and create a view pointing to a table in your server locally.
in your query above, every time some one views your view, an OPENQUERY is executed to your server
For some reason the queries seem to bring back the whole table and then filter on the SQL side instead of executing the query on the Progress side.
We aren't going to start delving into performance much more until after the data is migrated to the SQL Server environment completely.
