(The history-editing function is still not that great in Chrome, so it may be easier if you use a history-enhancing extension like History 2, History2, or Recent History.)
The Chromium devs don't want to implement it, see:
Only downside to this, it does disable suggestions, which are helpful sometimes.
Using 'https://www.google.com/search?q=%s' will still autocomplete.
The reason that’s happening is because you visited that page enough times to convince Chrome that you frequent it (at least more than other reddit pages), and so when you type the beginning of the URL, it automatically fills in the rest, assuming that you want to go there again.
You can use an SQLITE3 tool/editor/browser/manager to edit the history files Archived History and History to remove the URL.
According to this bug report, google will never allow this to be turned off.
This method is not pleasant, but technically, you don’t have to do it correctly, you can simply edit the URL to be something else, and that will still have the desired effect.
You must clear search history before using this, otherwise it will still autocomplete to old searches.
The problem resides in using google as a search engine, changing this fixes the problem OR using an alternate google search url:
You can always just ignore what it fills and continue typing the rest of the URL or press Delete.
In practice, however, you might have to clear your history to make it go away.
Theoretically, if you just type reddit.com and press Enter (erasing any additional autocompletion), it should start autocompleting to that.
This way, it is removed from your history and so Chrome won’t make assumptions.
This has long since been an annoyance for me, and just recently figured out a slight workaround.
Another option is to open your History, click **Edit items…*, select the URL in question (perhaps more than one instance), then click Remove selected items.
https://www.google.com/#q=%s - This disables autocompletion while still using google as a search engine.
Unfortunately, there's no way to turn off autocompletion in Chrome's omnibar.
