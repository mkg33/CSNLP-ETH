I recommend either referring to the manual or trial and error.
Even if you've tried each stick by itself, if it was in the wrong slot, it still may not boot.
Silly question...did you test the monitor and the cable as well?
Also, with some ASUS boards when you are using 1 stick of ram instead of two, you have to put the 1 stick in a very specific slot, or else it assumes it's looking for a dual-channel setup and will not post if it doesn't find it (I've had similar experiences on a few asus boards).
I would try a different power supply, or at least unplug everything but the motherboard from the power supply to see if you can get it to post.
You'll have to remove the button battery for about 10 minutes or if there is a bios reset pin... that might be useful.
I've seen weird stuff like this happen when a power supply suddenly stops delivering what was promised.
It's possible that one of your two sticks went bunk, and when the board tried to boot into dual channel, the broken stick threw it for a loop.
Try hooking up a monitor to the onboard video (if it has one).
Also unplug all non-essential hardware (usb devices).
