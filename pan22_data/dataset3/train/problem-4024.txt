However, if you were using one of these services, your ISP would only see traffic going to and from the service, and they would have no idea you are currently accessing Youtube.
Through a private VPN I subscribe to, I usually get at least 2 megabytes/second during prime time.
In general, if you live in America, you will NEVER hit the actual physical limit of data you can receive.
If your ISP sees traffic going to or from Youtube, you can bet your connection is going to be suboptimal.
I am not trying to imply that ALL speed enhancing software works, because we all know how many scams there are on the internet.
Youtube and Netflix are the prime example of throttled services.
(I will not name my VPN for the sake of objectivity; I don't want this to look like an advertisement)
Usually, (American) ISPs will slow down or "throttle" your access to certain websites or webservices.
Measuring my own traffic, I get, on average, 250 kilobytes/second of data from Youtube normally.
IMHO, there are a couple of ways, the perceived Internet speed is enhanced.
