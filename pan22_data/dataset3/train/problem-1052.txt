Also, when you seed to 1% (aka hit-and-run), the time the IP address is exposed is greatly reduced.
When ISPs were trying to slow down (or even drop packets via Sandvine), forcing encryption was able to trick the routers to allow traffic through.
The two settings changes on the ÂµTorrent client will minimize exposure of the IP address.
The problem is that your roommate is seeding on a public tracker.
You are receiving the letter because anti-piracy services are recording IP address and sending the notice to the ISP that owns the IP address.
The chances of a monitoring service intersecting with your IP address is greatly reduced.
Solution 2 recognizes that your roommate will not change and it is better to work with the situation.
Solution 1: Remove your name and have him take over the account.
The first setting will limit how many peers he can connect to.
The ISP then figures out which account was using the IP address at the time the movie was being received or sent.
There's no easy way to detect Bittorrent traffic because you can force encryption.
