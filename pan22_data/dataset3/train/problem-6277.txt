After much experimenting in trying to fix this, I think it's linked to two things: Creating a numbered list using Word's built-in header styles/titles and then modifying that list (in my case, changing the indent spacing).
You need to get rid of multilevel numbering that you've done so far.
To do so highlight the entire text and change its style to Normal.
The person I sent it to said the numbering was messed up, when I re-opened it, sure enough, all the numbers have been replaced by black boxes.
Using a clean document (not a template) with functional heading styles, modify them to suit, then rename them something new.
For me, those two actions inevitably result in the black boxes.
I'm working in Office 2013, they are working in 2010 and 2007.
After spending hours trying to get headers where I want them, only to get the black boxes of death, this preventive action is the best I can offer.
I was working in a word document this morning and all was well, it has custom styles I've used many times.
I found that wizard in the 'Multilevel List' dropdown (within the Paragraph ribbon tab), having selected the List style added in the block-quoted text first.
I made a bunch of changes to the document, saved it and sent it off.
In other words, do not overwrite the built-in header names with your new formatting, but create new header names for your modified headers.
Once doing that, I was able to use the 'Define new Multilevel List...' wizard to modify the styles to my liking (note: I did not link any headers to the list levels, as that seemed to raise the ire of this nasty bug).
Then go to Define New Multilevel List and start level modification from the scratch.
I've found a solution but it may take a while to fix your doc.
A solution that helped me repair the document permanently was provided by a user on a social.technet thread.
Though I cannot cure a diseased document, I've learned how to avoid having it happen again.
