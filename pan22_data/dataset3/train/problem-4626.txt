If you have Microsoft Virtual PC installed, or its replacement Hyper-V, you need to uninstall it.
Then I realised that I ran the installer non-elevated.
I have no other virtulisation software installed as far as I know.
Set virtualbox.exe to run elevated (aka as administrator), no change.
As far as I know I don't have any programs running in compatibility mode.
I receive the error below when I try to run a virtual machine with Enable VT-x/AMD-V on.
You may also need to uninstall any other virtualization programs you may have downloaded, such as VMware Player/Workstation.
It's happened to me when I was using a Android Virtual Device.
With this setting off the virtual machine runs successfully.
Or is there any way to find out what else is using VT-x?
Check if you are using other virtual machine at the same time.
I fixed the problem by uninstalling and installing 4.3.12 instead.
I've updated to a newer version of virtualbox, and a previously working VM spew this error on new version.
Looks like it's a bug in 4.3.14 & 4.3.15 and I've reported it now.
I tried updating VirtualBox from 4.3.14 to 4.3.15 as apparently it fixes some problems with anti-virus programs intefering with VirtualBox, so I updated to rule that out, still the same problem.
I checked for solutions online and asserted that no other process using VT-x.
Either of these will cause the problem you are seeing.
When my BIOS was updated virtulization was off by default, and going into VirtualBox the Enable VT-x/AMD-V option wasn't there, I turned virtulization back on and the option was back - so VirtualBox appears to correctly know when my virtulization is on.
I have the virtulization settings set to on in BIOS.
