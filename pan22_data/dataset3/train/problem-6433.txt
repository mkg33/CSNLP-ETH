Now when you add a new slide of the specific type you just set up, the default font will be the one you just choose in the master view.
I hate that I had to hunt for a template/theme I used before or change the default one.
This will set the default for the current presentation.
Then basically whatever slides I insert later, will have that font type by default.
It won't affect what happens in other presentations, already created or new.
Here's how I changed the default so I always get the template/theme I always use as my default when opening PowerPoint...
Ctrl+Click (or rightclick) the edge of the text box
Choose "Set as Default Text Box" from the popup menu.
Then in the master view, choose the type of slide and you want to change default fonts, Then choose the texts you need to change font formats, and choose the font type you want either from Format menu, or the toolbox.
I usually choose the top one in the master view, and change fonts format there.
Under the "View" menu, choose View -> Master -> Slide Master.
