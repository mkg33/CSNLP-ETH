Ram in Sheet 1 as well as in Sheet 2 in same workbook as file name 001 and 002 i.e.
Since you are deleting rows, start the loop on the last row and move up with Step -1.
Save a copy of the file before you start deleting.
Just like in Picture 1 you can see Sheet 1 has B_Code.
To delete rows on every worksheet, put the loop inside another loop that is For Each worksheet.
Hari in Sheet 1 as well as in Sheet 2 in another workbook as file name 002 and so on.
Can anyone help me out to solve this problem using VBA.
Put that code inside a For loop to check all the cells in column A.
Then, you can use VBA code that deletes a row when a cell (rngCell) has a different value than 001 or B_Code or blank.
Suppose I have Workbook(Report.xlsx) and in that workbook I have different worksheet.
The code that finds the last row (lngLastRowNumber) is explained at Finding The Last Used Cell In A Range.
Post about any problems you have as you write and test the code.
Using filter in B_Code I want a separate workbook with every sheet in it.
