I want to do some changes to the BIND source code.
To make it use only local zone files you want to make sure that /etc/bind/named.conf.options has no forwarders stanzas and that none of your zone files reference an external DNS server.
I want those queries to go to the local BIND server and to look for answers in the zone files i provided.
You can also use the nslookup command to query a specific nameserver, as in nslookup example.invalid 127.0.0.1
Also make sure your test BIND is set to listen on 127.0.0.1 (and only 127.0.0.1) by changing the appropriate option in /etc/bind/named.conf.options (if you are using Debian Linux, as an example).
I know how to make the zone files and somewhat the named.conf file but what should i put in /etc/resolv.conf?
In order to test those changes I want to be able to post queries to my local BIND server and for it to use only the local zone files.
witch i guess is my router IP address and the queries go through the router to my ISP.
Is there a way for this using resolf.conf file or should i do something else?
