(By the way - it's not DOS if you're using cmd.exe)
I believe you can use attrib to get the file count:
dir returns the number of files and dirs at the bottom
and as previously mentioned if powershell is on the machine you can simply
So for example if you want to find out how many files are in your C:\ drive and not any subfolder you would use the command:
that command will give you all the files (system and hidden included)

Remove the "/D" option if you don't want to count folders.
This will create a file called filecount.txt in the current directory with the number of files and folders in the current directory (including the newly created file).
You will not include hidden and system files you need to add -force to count them all
So remove it if you only want files in the specified path and don't want to include files in sub folders.
you will get a count of all files and all directories.
If I only needed this once I'd just use dir, otherwise I'd consider rolling my own, probably as a C# app because that's what I would be most familiar with (although VBScript or PowerShell would also be viable).
Without installing something on the server but having powershell on your workstation you
in order to get the file count of a particular directory.
The "/s" option processes files in all directories in the specified path.
