Moving messages has nothing to do with Spamassassin and is entirely dependent on your LDA or MUA (Local Delivery Agent or Mail user Agent).
Procmail rule to filter spam to SPAM folder (~/.procmailrc)
In my opinion, it's a bad idea, you can miss false positive.
It's up to yourself to set the threshold for when it's to be classified as spam, and what to do with it (delete, move to folder, forward?, etc).
In SpamAssassin you can create rules that appends N score to the spam classification header after it's triggered.

is your server using Dovecot or Cyrus or something else?
Is your mail being delivered to a POP3 account, an IMAP account?
Too many questions and variables, and this is not the place for those questions.
Postfix or cpanel use SpamAssassin for detect  spams not for handle it.
If you want to move suspected spam mails to a specific folder I suspect you to hook it into your POP3/IMAP server (ex: dovecot), or POP3/IMAP client usage (ex: fetchmail + procmail).
But you can create a rules in cpanel (for example) for delete email with a title rewrite by SpamAssassin.

With SpamAssassin you just can rewrite a mail detected as a spam but you can't delete it.
Just put it on a specific folder with a basic rule.
