Is there any solution to get the right permissions back and make everything work again?
Today I wanted to change the permissions of an entire folder but instead I changed my entire installation (chown -R root) so now a lot of things isn't working anymore.
Restore from backup (possible preceedided by a quick backup of recently added data) would be my solution.
But if you really want to be safe, just restore from the backup and accept the loss of a days * work.
The basic answers stay the same though: For most installs you will
Having said that: you may get lucky be de- and reinstalling package, or upgrading them.
I can't reinstall it because I'm getting the same error with apt install mariadb-server so at this time all my websites are down!
I saw a solution to fix this on that website but it requires to boot on a live cd but I can't, I'm running on a VPS!
For example my LEMP server isn't working, I fixed a few issues but I'm still having a mariadb "Failed to start LSB: Start and stop the mysql database server..." because of the socket mysqld which is already installed at the right place...
