Now your file will be embedded in the Excel file as a clickable icon, and it will move with the cell you put it in if you reorganize the worksheet.
I usually just cut out all the path information and leave the original file name so I can actually read it.
Unfortunately, Excel doesn't support what you described.
The syntax is; HYPERLINK(link_location,friendly_name)
As a work around, you could use the HYPERLINK function to link to files.
You can find more information about how to use it here.
And then drag and drop the file from word to Excel.
While still in the dialog box noted above, click the "Change Icon" button, and you will have the opportunity to edit the label.
This works with practically any type of file, including JPEGs and PDFs.
I realize this is an old post, but in case someone else gets here with the same question...
You cannot drag and drop, but you CAN do exactly what the OP is asking by inserting the files as objects within the spreadsheet.
However, embedding a large number of files can make your spreadsheet file size huge.
By default, the icon will show the entire path to the file in the icon label, which can make it unreadable.
In the resulting dialog box, click the "Create from File" tab
