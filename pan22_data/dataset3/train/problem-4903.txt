MS's design goals are for windows 8 to run on the same hardware windows vista and 7 does - and forcing a signed bootloader sort of goes against it.
Two things, really - almost all new systems have UEFI, and windows 8 64 bit dev preview works fine on a system with a 'classic' bios - it runs really well on a 4 year old core 2 based system, and a good many test systems they use are bios based.
I do see UEFI implimentations supporting additional features with respect to windows (lenovo already uses it for faster boot on their windows 7 systems).
Microsoft's stated hardware requirements are that Windows Developer Preview, subject to various processor/RAM/disc space/graphics card minima, can be used on "the same hardware that powers Windows Vista and Windows 7".
UEFI/signed bootloaders might make sense on the arm versions, especially if MS has input on the hardware - especially if they are metro only.
All that people can tell you about is Windows Developer Preview, which isn't Windows 8.
Actually it will support, windows 8 is being planned to work over UEFI BIOS.
And what they, or at least the subset of people without EFI firmware who have installed it on their machines, can tell you about that is that it does not require EFI firmware.
Even AMI(American Megatrend Inc) which produces BIOS already annouced the UEFI support to Windows 8:
