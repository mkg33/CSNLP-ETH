But definitely puppet based on some very generic kickstart (or equivalent) with your puppet configs stored in SCM and a copy of the installation repositories as they were when you initially configured the box.
Foreman takes all the awesomeness of puppet and adds in provisioning for new systems.
I so rarly build a new physical server that I install them from the CD/DVD.
On Debian system, you can use the Fully Automatic Installers.
If you're running a RedHat based machine, then you definitely want to use kickstart.
Puppet + Cobbler for Redhattish systems and some debian-based stuff that's more or less experimental.
If you're in the "automagically configure my machines", then part of your install image should be puppet, because once the machine is installed, you'll need something to control it.
For virtual machines I have a set of templates based on the needed OS, when then gets cloned and configured automatically via VMware.
I've only used it to deploy & configure centos but it comes with templates for debian, ubuntu, solaris and fedora.
