If nothing works, try removing your battery and putting it back in after 3 seconds.
I didn't think it was a stuck key because I could add "p"s to the typing by hitting the p key.
I shut down the computer and opened it in safe mode.
Maybe try spraying some canned air inside the keyboard.
Also took off the "P" button from the keyboard and cleaned it thoroughly.
Push hard on the P key until it clicks or snaps (but don't break it).
I also uninstalled and re installed the keyboards from device manager, finally the removing and the cleaning of the battery is what worked.
You've already tried cleaning under it - try hitting it fairly firmly (not to the point of breaking the keyboard) to see if you can jar it loose.
I had the exact same issue, tried everything from defaulting factory setting, reformatting to install Window 7, but still had this issue.
I'm running a full virus scan, malwarebytes scan and backup just to e safe.
The simple solution -> remove battery from laptop for a while and reattach it.
Did a system restore to the last restore point (two days previously) and now it works fine.
