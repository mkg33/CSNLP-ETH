This was back with 9.04 (Jaunty) but that page has been updated and works with 9.10 Karmic also.
Next step: make ATI work with karmic which as a big PITA as the wifi card was.
Googling "RT3090 linux driver", and finding this page.
After installing the driver, to make turn it on (and autostart)
Atheros chips are VERY good, and here's an excellent Atheros-inside unit TP-LINK TL-WN821N: rather cheap, powerful (20dBm transmitter!
Check these links: WirelessCardsSupported and Linux wireless LAN support and find out whether it's compatible.
The most painless solution is to buy an adapter which works like a charm.
The driver and the patch for 64 bit available at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/401126?comments=all did the work for me ... it works like a charm now.
There are lots of complaints concerning Wi-Fi compatibility.
Probably, you have RaLink chipset or even worse: manufacturers often ignore Linux support, or provide BUGGY-LAGGY drivers (Hey, ASUS!).
I had the same issue when installing ubuntu onto my no-name netbook (no brand name made it very hard to source drivers).
There are more wireless devices that work nice, but I swear this one really works!
