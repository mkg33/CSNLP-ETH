A PCI Express Mini Card can not be put directly into a non-mini PCIe slot.
I've been repeatedly insisting on him simply getting a USB Bluetooth dongle, but he doesn't want one taking up his external USB slots.

The only way you are going to get a mini-PCI card working in a PCI slot is by using an (expensive) bridge card.
I just took a PCI Express Mini Card and a motherboard with an PCIe slot.
I've been searching around for a PCI-E/PCI based Bluetooth adapter but I've had no luck finding one - I've found some discontinued ones but they have giant antennas coming out the back - the person I'm building the computer for doesn't want that.
It is quite obvious that the two are not physically compatible, the physical dimensions in the connectors are simply different.
suggest getting a pci/pcie multi USB adapter for extra USB ports.
I don't think so  because according to this article a PCI Express Mini Card will only fit into a PCIe Ã—1 slot and the ASRock motherboard doesn't have any of those, only PCIe x16 ones which have a different form factor.
I'm helping someone build a computer and they absolutely insist on having an internal Bluetooth adapter.
My question is if it's possible to use one of those laptop PCI-E cards in a motherboard like this that has PCI-E and PCI slots, or if the form factor is completely different and won't fit?
I have done that in the past, and it set me back Eur 130.
