Once installed and before using it, you'll need to change the way that it generates the theme.
However, failing that I found out that I could change their theme generation code to suit my own purposes.
Here is the full path to the file I ended up modifying (Windows 7):
Change that 0.6 to 1 (or somewhere in-between to your liking) and I think you will be well on your way to having a satisfactory link-hover-preview.
This opacity ended up making the font extremely hard to read and led me to your question.
c:\Users[YOURUSERNAME]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\oehpjpccmlcalbenfhnacjeocbjdonic\2.0_0\javascript\main.js
(Note the final string tacked onto the end because you'll find that folder in your extensions folder -- at least I did.
As far as I know, there is no way to re-import a theme once it has been installed.

I believe I have found a fix for getting the link preview to become legible -- even if it doesn't enable full control.
In the manifest.json file for my theme I created 'out of the box', I noticed that there was an opacity applied to the "toolbar" colors which was not specified in themes I downloaded elsewhere.
You may not have been using this theme generator, but I think you may be happy with the results after changing main.js.
That would be lovely and was what I tried to find first.
If you make this change to the My Chrome Theme app, you may no longer hope for a way to control the font since it will again be legible.
In main.js, I searched for 0.6 and immediately found only one reference in all of the minified code.
I started out using the Google Chrome Theme Creator found here:
It was set to 0.6 and I couldn't find a way to tell Chrome to re-interpret this file with my change.
