Plug the drive into another machine using different data cables to verify that you get the same behaviour.
The drive should go back to Seagate (or your intermediate supplier depending on the arrangement you are under with the drive) for warranty replacement.
Before trying to return the drive, make sure you have ruled out controller and cable failure.
I have downloaded SeaTools from http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/downloads/seatools/seatooldreg (v2.13b (Graphical), ISO CD-ROM Image)
After booting the downloaded iso image, I have selected "set drive capacity to MAX" from the Advanced menu, and voil√°, it works... the drive reports the expected size of 1.5TB again!
try to format the external drive then see the results.
This means that both in the BIOS it shows only 500GB, and both in my linux every tool (fdisk, blockdev etc) show the smaller size.
These things, rare as they are, sometimes "just happen".
I'm still not happy though that something like this happens, and it would be still interesting to know why, and how could I avoid it.
As the drive did work at first and has changed behaviour, I would suspect that it has developed a fault, perhaps a short due to a manufacturing fault or power surge has burnt out a data line or corrupt its firmware.
I have 14 Seagate ST31500541AS drives, and one them started reporting only 500GB size instead of 1.5TB.
