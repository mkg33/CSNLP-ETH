If the database being checked has a heavy update workload, more and more pages are pushed into the database snapshot, causing it to grow.

Your go to guy should be Paul Randal's Blog for all things CheckDB.
Sometimes an issue arises when the hidden database snapshot runs out of space.
An example of this is shown here (the errors can vary depending on the exact point at which the database snapshot runs out of space):
Because it’s implemented using alternate streams of the existing data files, the database snapshot consumes space from the same location as the existing data files.
I am not sure the root cause that is stopping the snapshots being taken; but have you tried running DBCC CheckDB with Tablock option to see if it works?
Most likely the SQL service account doesn't have permissions to create the snapshot files necessary.
(Books online explicitly states tablock option "includes a short-term exclusive (X) lock on the database.")
But atleast it doesn't take snapshots and DBCC CheckDB may succeed this time with this option.
In a situation where the volumes hosting the database don’t have much space, this can mean the hidden database snapshot runs out of space and DBCC CHECKDB stops with an error.
On an active database its very unlikely CHECKDB will be able to get the X database lock necessary for the allocation checks to run, which is why I changed the lock timeout for it to be only 20 seconds (IIRC).
The other option is this isn't a critical system and you can afford down time; try changing it to single user mode and run the DBCC again OR restore it somewhere else and do the DBCC if you have test environment.
