No solution, but for some advice on debugging see: Troubleshooting the Windows logon process.
Don't worry, you should still be able to use your keyboard and mouse but you probably won't have any extra functions like certain hot keys or even certain buttons on your mouse might no longer work - but you should at least still be able to use them.
The list of input or even output devices is pretty long but reducing your computer to it's most basic elements with just a basic keyboard and basic mouse is where I'd at least begin the troubleshooting process.
Aside from that, you might also look into any other input devices you may have hooked up to your computer like scanners, joysticks, and/or possibly even old dial-up modems.
This uses information from this Microsoft Support article :
Of course, reinstalling drivers for a mouse and/or keyboard theoretically will enable those extra abilities but you might also have that weird problem again too.
Sounds to me like you have a keyboard and/or mouse driver issue going on.
If you have any "drivers" for your keyboard and/or mouse then I would suggest uninstalling them.
And if your keyboard/mouse are USB devices you might also look into your BIOS settings too (again, that's a bit too borad a topic to go into here).
You can also try to check your system using sfc /scannow.
If this gets you any useful information, please post it.
