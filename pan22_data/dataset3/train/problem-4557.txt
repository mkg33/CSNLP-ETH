And because rman changes the database incarnation after duplicate process, this file is never deleted during the backup process, as it belogns to the previous incarnation.
I cannot recall if I had to clean up archivelogs after a clone processes.
The duplicate database ... from active database is designed to work without any existing backup.
I could add rm command from asmcmd for the old files, but maybe there is a way to convince rman to do it for me during the duplicate database?
Try increasing the value of control_file_record_keep_time.
I would expect Oracle to clean up the archivelogs which were used during the clone process.
You can also try deleting the archive logs and backups with force before dropping the database.
Then rman recovers database (via set until scn 666666; recover clone database delete archivelog;), so the archivelog above is applied to the database:
Well, I can say that I never did delete archivelogs after a db clone because I did not check for any.
Before running the script I am doing an archivelog rman backup of the CLONEDB (it deletes backed up archivelogs) and DROP DATABASE CLONEDB.
Of course I would like to do it automatically, with the duplication script.
Everything is OK, database starts up, users are happy.
As workaround I would delete them with a script afterwards.
So from time to time I must do the housekeeping and delete old, orphaned archivelogs directly from the disk.
But the archivelog file (in this example thread_1_seq_666) stays on the disk.
I normally clone from backup location without a connection to the primary database.
While running duplicate database, rman copies datafiles and archivelogs from the source database.
I am cloning the production database to another one, lets say CLONEDB, in a regular basis.
For example, I can see that such file has been copied:
