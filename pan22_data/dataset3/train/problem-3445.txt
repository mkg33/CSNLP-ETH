And if you make a sequel, another license @ $20 for that.
So for $20 you will be allowed to include the font in your game and distribute as many copies of that game as you want to.
To distribute it requires that you have a licence for creating and distributing derivative works of the original font.
A TrueType font (such as one you might download from cheapprofonts.com) contains instructions for how to render that font and is therefore a copyright piece of software.
If you make a demo of the game (=another binary/program so to speak) you should also purchase a $20 license for that.
I hope you find our licensing scheme easy and affordable.
Obtaining a license for one of our fonts for inclusion in a software is easy and inexpensive: Just let us know that the font you purchase IS for that purpose, and then purchase two licenses for the font.
A bitmap font that you create based on such a font is also font software (instructions for how to render that font) - and it is a derivative work of the original font software.
This way you are not distributing software instructions for rendering that font, you have merely used those software instructions to create an image.
In the United States a font face is not copyrightable (Eltra Corp. v. Ringer, 579 F.2d 294 (4th Cir.
If you plan to sell the game with their font in it (whether you transfer it to a bitmap or not doesn't matter), then you are distributing it outside of the scope of the license so you will need to contact CheapProFonts (whom I presume are the owners of the font) for a commercial license.
If it is just an image of the font they hav no legal grounds.
