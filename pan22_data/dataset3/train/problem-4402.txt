This is as important as making sure you can restore your backups.
It allows for a remote host to be your "trusted" machine and have it scan your target machines for any file change.
I think the standards are chkrootkit and rkhunter.
Running both helps to 1) not need to "trust" either, and 2) protects against attacks that try to specifically hide from one or the other.
Of course, you need to have some change control so regular updates on your system does not get flagged as an intrusion.
You also want to cut the connction between the target and the trusted machine running tripwire to make sure that it will be detected.
I do not know either chrootkit or rkjunter but if they required to be installed on the end machine they do not protect you much.
To be on the safe side, at regular intervals, you want to go and make changes on your target machine to make sure that tripwire will report it.
If a change is detected then you know something went wrong.
Rootkit checker should not be installed on your target machine.
There are other, more specific rootkit detectors out there, but I've always thought that it was a matter of playing catchup with the bad guys; you'll never be sure that your rootkit detector is up-to-date enough to catch all of 'em.
I have been using OSSEC and have been really impressed by the results
On Unix-based systems, Tripwire is a good general "what changed on this machine today?"
What Tripwire does is take a hash (fingerprint) of all the file on your system and it lets you know when a file change.
It does still involve keeping up to date with detection programs though.
I know chkrootkit has an option to only notify you if anything changes (avoiding daily false-alerts).
I generally run external virus/rootkit scans from a Linux live disk.
A rootkitcheck software that runs on the target machine runs the risk that the rootkit (or the person who installed it) would compromise it and thus it would not provide you with the protection you seek.
