Look for it on the LCD screen menu - the hardware, NOT on the software!
It should be noted that this is not a perfect solution.
It may not be ideal, but at least it works and does not need to be repeated constantly.
On Windows 10 machines the following registry setting works:
The problem with disabling the function in the Intel Media Control Panel as Bob has shown is that it just doesn’t stick.
Therefore it is necessary to edit this in power management:
It is supposed to reduce power consumption, but all it does is to fade the screen in both brightness, and more importantly, contrast, but only when the display is primarily dark.
It gets reset to being on and in the middle when you reboot, and even under other circumstances (like changing the screen resolution, going into and out of standby, etc.)
It is analogous to moving the slider in the Intel MCP to Maximum Quality; there does not seem to be a way to outright disable it like un-checking the Disaply Power Saving Technology box (Figure 3).
The new Intel Graphics Control Panel does not have the option, even under battery mode:
As far as my understanding goes, if you have the NVIDIA drivers also installed, you should only have the 3D graphics options under the NVIDIA control panel.
For Dell LCD, you need to turn off the "Smart Energy" and/or "Dynamic Contrast" features!
The screen brightness and contrast should no longer “adapt” to the overall brightness of what is being displayed.
After tons of searching I found the correct option in advanced power options
I’ve searched high and low for a way to permanently disable this “feature”, and have eventually found a more-or-less satisfactory solution that works for most systems that use an Intel video-adapter (regardless of make or model).
Intel’s “power-saving feature” is indeed extremely aggravating.
You may as well change it for all of your power plans (Figure 2), even Power Saver because it does little to reduce battery power and only makes the display ugly.
