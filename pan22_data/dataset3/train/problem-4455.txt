When connected to the Internet, I can go to 192.168.102.1 and I see a landing page for "mikrotik routeros", but I cannot go to 192.168.1.1.
Sounds like there's competing DHCP servers on your network.
When connected to the router but not the Internet, 192.168.1.1 yields the router web portal, and 192.168.102.1 is inaccessible.
Router needs to have WAN Connection Type as DHCP and also needed static DNS set up (I used 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).
You have two options to get internet connectivity AND be able to connect to the 192.168.1.0 network at the same time.
route add -net 192.168.1.0/24 wlan0 should work for this.
This would be specific to your router/firmware, but since you're running DD-WRT you can easily find the information on adding a static route.
As a note, your gateway should be 0.0.0.0 for directly connected nets.
2) Add a static routing entry to the router that tells it 192.168.1.0 is directly attached.
The fact that your are getting assigned IPs on two different subnets implies you have two DHCP servers on the directly attached network.
Network is apparently connected like this:  There is a central router, with a cable to my unit's local router.
With internet access (wired in this case, but it varies):
I don't know anything about networking, but here's some info that seems helpful taken from my Ubuntu laptop.
Usually, I'd recommend using something like dhcp_probe -f eth0 or roguechecker to find out which IPs on your network are serving DHCP but you already know which they are.
On both wired and wireless connections, I can only access one of 192.168.1.1 (the router web portal) and the general Internet.
Which "mode" my devices are in is seemingly random.
1) Add a static routing entry to the linux box that tells it that 192.168.1.0 is directly attached.
This has persisted so far for 5 days (since I began using this network).
With "router access" (wireless in this case, but it varies):
Both will require disabling or removing the DHCP server on 192.168.1.1 and letting 192.168.102.1 assign you an IP for internet access.
