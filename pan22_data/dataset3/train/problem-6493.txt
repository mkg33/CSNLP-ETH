If I am, say, using Gmail over https, can someone read my IM conversations and emails if I use an unsecured wireless network?
As long as your DNS and your browser's SSL rootkey servers are valid, then an attacker on the same unsecure wireless network as you cannot get into your SSL pipe with a server.
You likely won't notice, even if you take the time to check and the browser will show everything as being secure.
I assume that the data would be secure, since it is using an encrypted connection.
To avoid this sort of thing, bookmark or type the https:// url directly, never rely on that redirect.
You also need to consider that the initial non-SSL pages are not protected.
Consider that you could visit http://firstoverflowbank.com, which would usually redirect you to https://login.firstoverflowbank.com but on the unsecured network is set instead to send you to https://login.flrstoverflowbank.com instead.
Most secured sites you visit will redirect you from an http to an https url when you go to the login page, but on an untrustworthy network, you might be sent somewhere else by a man in the middle instead.
There would just be one less level of encryption for them to break, in order to access the encrypted data.
I think your reasoning is correct; to read your information they would need to decrypt the SSL.
DNS is the big vulnerability in this area - if your DNS chain of servers gets infected by an attacker than can make all manner of things appear to be secure but in fact be insecure.
But if your question is whether a random hacker at an airport or coffee shop is going to be able to hack into your SSL pipe to your bank, the answer is almost certainly not.
Anyway have in mind that only the data inside the http stream is encrypted but the URLs are not, so maybe someone can impersonate you.
