In our case, we're required to show that our system captures everything sent to our users.
We chose to have another company (Microsoft Forefront) filter and archive our email.
From a regulatory standpoint it was just easier to show that we were complying with the full legal requirements.
For example, the financial industry has a ton of providers that have email hosting, archiving, filtering, and compliance testing all rolled into one.
However, without a clear understanding of your legal requirements, your client could be at risk which is bad for business.
This is especially true if he's in a highly regulated industry.
Something like a BCC would definitely fail since this is a manual method which could leave out email intentionally or accidentally.
I'd first start by getting a good understanding of the legal obligations then look at how you would go about proving you're complying with the law during an audit.
I work for a company which has legal obligations to archive all of our email for multiple years.
If your client has these same types of legal obligations and is attempting to do this on the cheap, I think he'll find that the hassles associated with internal archiving far exceed the costs of outsourcing it.
If you're outsourcing the entire mail system already, it might make sense to just move the email to a company specific to that industry.
