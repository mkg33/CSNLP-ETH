I currently have a setup with a HP core switch with few VLANs configured on it e.g.
I have tried configured those vlans on the Dell switch and configured the switchport as general or trunk mode, both configuration not working as expected.
When you connect the Dell switch to a VLAN trunk on the HP you need to configure the VLANs in the exact same way.
For specific help you'll need to add the (sanitized) switch configurations and the used ports to your question.
If you don't you can only use the HP's native/untagged VLAN on the Dell which may be none.
If the physical link comes up you can check the switch's MAC table for each VLAN to see if it gets populated across the trunk.
I am trying my best to learn and configured so that it works, however after few days of trying, I am out of clue.
Also, you need to check whether the Dell's downlink port already has any interfering configuration, e.g.
However when I uplink my DELL N1548 to the HP core switch, I cannot connect anything behind the DELL switch, do I need to configure vlan on the DELL switch?
The one who configured the core switch has left, and there was no documentation left behind.
