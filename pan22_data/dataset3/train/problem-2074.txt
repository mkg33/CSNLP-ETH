Googling this error didn't return anything useful.
It is also searching for the PDB for some reason for the DLL.
I'm using Win2k8 x86 with IIS 7 and my application pool is ASP.NET v4.0 Integrated.
Message: Unable to find assembly 'FluentNHibernate, Version=1.0.0.633, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=8aa435e3cb308880'.
The DLL also exists in the temp directory that IIS creates:
I've been fighting with IIS the last few days and the error that IIS generates is:
Somehow (still not sure how) this was caught by one thing, and then caught by IIS which tried to serialize an error message, but it couldn't find a DLL it needed since where it ended up catching it was in another AppDomain.
Exception: System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException
What's strange is that if I check in procmon, I can watch the IIS process find the dll in the directory where I would expect it to find it, and then it continues to search other directories for the exact same dll.
I checked all of my web.config files and compilation debug is set to false in all cases so I'm surprised to see it looking for pdbs.
Posting my answer in case someone else comes along in the future with a similar problem.
So it was clearly able to copy the dll to it's running location, but it reports it can't find it.
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET Files\ws-sm\bc2df7a7\729516d\assembly\dl3\42ab9d3b\00d491a3_3e6bcd01\FluentNHibernate.DLL
So if you get this error try attaching windbg to your process and see what errors are being thrown.
I ended up finding this problem by attaching windbg to the w3wp process and watching it start up.
What ended up being my issue was that I was unable to connect to one of my databases, and this caused an exception to be thrown.
I finally figured it out and it wasn't related to IIS.
