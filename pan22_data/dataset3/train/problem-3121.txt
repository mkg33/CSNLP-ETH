Does each type of account have different functions that need to be run?
Why don't you create separate views for each account type and then use a computed column.
I suggest that you step back and look at it from a business-rules perspective.
"I want to perform calculations on each row of accounts based on the accountType": Can you not use a cursor to do this?
Complex CASE statements will usually be faster for SQL to process, even though there are painful to read.
Do certain functions need to behave differently when presented with differing account types?
Since you want both Account Types and Function Names to be dynamic, you'll have to store them in the database.
A second idea would be to use extended stored procedures / CLR assemblies to call the function externally (or to use those functions to get the function names).
Any time you use a scaler function you have to run the function once for each row.
Cursors give your nice control when you want to do a row by row manipulation.
What you proposed would definitely solve the problem.
