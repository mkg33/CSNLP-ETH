I hope this provides enough information to stand on its own.
It does this by using otherwise-unused-stick-memory as a cache, reducing disk I/O.
LPM is a more sophisticated version of USB SUSPEND function.
Consequently, Windows 10 runs considerably hotter at idle than Ubuntu, and I have noticed that flash drives seem to get hot on Windows as well.
Windows does have this thing where you "can use USB sticks to speed up your computer".
The difference is likely due to different handling of LPM - link power management.
According to OP, the difference in temperature happens on the same laptop, same hardware, so any proximity to heat exhaust is inconsequential.
Apparently the Windows OS somehow has difficulty in configuring the xHCI controller to run LPM (or has it disabled), while Linux has no problem with that.
As a result, any USB device plugged in on that side feels approximately the same temperature as the outside of the fan (!
On my laptop, the USB 3.0 port is physically very close (~ 2 in) to the fan assembly:
To check Windows configuration for LPM, this link might be of some help.
USB 3.0 mass storage devices got hot when USB host controller disables LPM (or LPM is not enabled in USB device, this is a mutual thing).
It's possible this extra activity is generating the excess heat.
You can test if this is the case for you as well by running a very CPU-intensive program in Ubuntu (say, a 4-core build) and observing whether a plugged-in flash drive gets hot during that time.
It's possible to test this by turning off this option, and see if the stick still gets hot
