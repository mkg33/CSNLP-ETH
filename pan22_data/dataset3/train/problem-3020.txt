However, this practice is hoping for security by obscurity.
But this is still more effort than just setting the IP address directly.
If you want to secure your network, use secure protocols and proper authentication.
An attacker could listen for broadcasts, get a valid MAC address from some 'good' computer, and after it's been turned of, use the 'good' mac to get a valid IP address from DHCP.
If you have managed 802.1x capable switches, I would recommend looking into that, or setting up port security, thus allowing port traffic only from specific MACs.
You should start looking at 802.1x, this is "Network authentication" on Switch level.
I manage a reasonably small network (150 machines or so).
Depending on your DHCP server you should be able to restrict allocations by mac address - but it's trivial to sniff the mac addresses already on the network and change the address on a particular machine.
What you wish, could be implemented by some custom software which would check with the DHCP and alter firewall rules accordingly, or by having a mac filter on each machine, and update the 'good' mac list every time a new box is added (big PITA for the admins).
We have a DHCP server set up with reservations for all of the machines on the network and an exclusion zone set up over the entire range so that only known machines will get an IP address and hence network access.
It is possible that by plugging a foreign device with its own configured IP address, other machines can get on the network.
Basically every machine which gets plugged in has to authenticate itself first before it is allowed to the network.
Is there any way to get machines on the network to ignore traffic from a computer that has not been assigned an address by DHCP?
