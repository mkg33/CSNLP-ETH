It works by parsing the text and reformatting the start and end times in a time format that Excel recognizes.
LEFT(B2,FIND("-",B2)-1) is the start time in your format.
Otherwise, format the time so Excel recognizes it as a time value.
The following formula will give the hours in one day's time span.
To do this, first, check how many digits precede the letter (a or p) in the time.
Replacing these values with End and Start will help clarify what the formula is doing.
If there are more than 2 digits, the time includes minutes, so it needs to be formatted with a colon between hour and minutes.
In the case that the end time is AM and the start time is PM, this results in a negative number.
Then, put a space between the numbers and the letter and stick an m after the letter (to make it am or pm).
Once this is done for each, subtract the start time from the end time.
RIGHT(B2,LEN(B2)-FIND("-",B2)) is the end time in your format.
This returns the fraction of a day in the time span, so convert it to hours by multiplying by 24.
To correct for that, the formula checks for this condition and adds 24 to the result if it is met.
Once that is done, it's a matter of subtraction and conversion of the result to hours.
