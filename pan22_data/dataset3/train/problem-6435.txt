Although the KB lists windows 2000, the key works just as well for 2008.
I have a german Windows 2008 R2  with English Multilanguage Pack installed.
As for Windows Server 2008 R2, I also had to take below steps to make the on-screen keyboard disappear after a RDP connection:
When I login to Windows 2008 R2 it automatically switches keyboard on server to PL (and I can choose between 3 keyboard, however there's no way to remove that PL keyboard).
Control Panel -> All Control Panel Items -> Ease of Access Center->
Once applied, the local keyboard layout on a client machine connecting to a server with that registry key will be ignored, and the default keyboard layout for the remote machine as set up in control panel will be used instead.
To completly ignore the remote keyboard layout, use the registry key as listed in http://support.microsoft.com/?id=322042.
Is there a way to make sure only keyboards defined on server works and not those pushed thru RDP?
This wouldn't be a big problem but my customer using german windows also see this PL keyboard and it sets itself as default for him too...
And my customer who logs in to that Windows 2008 R2 uses german Windows 7, Windows XP.
You can work around this using the quick-switch keys to change the input language.
Make sure "Use On-Screen Keyboard" checkbox is disabled.
I use Windows 7 with PL version and PL keyboard settings.
