dbcc checkdb had thrown errors which were resolved after doing this.
I have had this problem recently too and after mountains of research it appears to be common when a database is set to AUTO CLOSE.
Yes, I too got this same issue, it was regarding the tempDb error 9001 i.e log not available.
I was able to solve this by taking the database offline in Management Studio then immediately bringing it back online.
The issue behind this was SAN or storage issue, while I/O write operation, it was unable to write for more than 15 secs.
When you take the affected database offline/online MS SQL will enable the affected database logs until the error reoccur.
Yesterday, I had received the same error "the log for database '%' is not available.
I checked the 'TempDB' but it was not accessible similarly rest of the system databases.
I simply restarted the SQL Server Instance Service instead of restoring databases.
MS SQL will take the logs of an affected database offline to avoid database corruption.

Then before going for repair option I simply restarted the SQL services for that instance and issue got resolved :) :)
I can't say why this worked only that it did work.
Another way to solve this is to change the Auto_Close option to OFF
Another way to fix the symptom is to take the problematic database offline and bring it back online again.
This started with one database then went over to two and the next it was on all of them.
