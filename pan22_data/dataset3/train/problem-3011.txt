I am currently using OS X El Capitan, not  macOS Sierra.
I can't speak for any particular implementation of NTFS for Mac, personally I use Paragon & that's always been OK for me.
Although I can read my files, I cannot save changes.

I have been advised to install  NTFS Driver for Mac OS but am reluctant to do it until I hear from someone who has done this successfully.
Now my hard drive shows up fine and no data lost or anything - Hope this can help someone.
Install Seagate https://www.seagate.com/sg/en/support/downloads/item/ntfs-driver-for-mac-os-master-dl/ for seagate external drives.
As websites can go down, I'll outline the steps mentioned in the post:
The NTFS writing has worked with no issues, on Yosemite and El Capitan.
I have been saving all my PC files onto a Seagate GoFlex external hard-drive.
Adding write support should not affect your existing NTFS partitions at all.
Mine was showing in utilities but it was greyed out.
Just thought i would advise that i did already have NTFS for Mac installed but it must have been old or something - Honestly not sure.
Anyway i was having the same issue - had tried everything else to try and fix the issue and get my hard drive to show up.
Anyways i unplugged by hard drive and installed the new NTFS for mac -http://www.seagate.com/au/en/support/downloads/item/ntfs-driver-for-mac-os-master-dl/
I also recommended the below to a friend using El Capitan and it worked for them as well.
I used the method outlined by the below blog post back when my Mac Book Pro had OS X Mavericks.
Note: I have not updated my Mac to macOS Sierra just yet, so I cannot confirm if this continues to work for Sierra and the author has not updated their post, like they did for El Capitan.
Mac can already read NTFS perfectly well [& can be persuaded to write with some tweaking, without adding a 3rd party solution, but is unsupported]
