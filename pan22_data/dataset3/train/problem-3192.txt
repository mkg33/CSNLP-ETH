We also allow partnered third-party vendors to run software that, also, accesses the same client's database as our own software allows for the same user.
However, I am wondering if there is a way to limit the resources a specific program name has access to, or, set it at a lower priority?
We have a limited time frame for when these third-part applications can run, so I cannot stretch the timing of the application any further.
Each customer is given a unique user to a specific SQL instance, and we are running multiple instances, however one instance may have between 50 and 100 users.
I have not found any way so far to limit resources or priority of a specific program as it accesses SQL, I was wondering if there were any resources for this sort of information that has not come up in my searches?
I know, using resource governer, you can limit the amount of resources a specific user has access to.
Recently, I have come into a scenario where I have been brought in to help manage a hosted system where we host our own product for our customer.
What I have run into, however, is that the third-party programs are often poorly implemented and will consume huge amounts of cpu bogging the customer down.
