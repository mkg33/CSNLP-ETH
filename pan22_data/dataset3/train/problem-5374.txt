With the storage pool defined, libvirt is able to create and manage volumes in that pool.
Note that a block device does not have to be part of a storage pool in order for a virtual machine managed by libvirt to use it.
I started learning how to create a good virtualization stack with libvirt.
The effect of both of these is the same, but in one case you are doing everything manually, and in the other case, libvirt is able to do everything for you.
I have read libvirt storage documentation but I did not understand the difference
As the above has said its very similar, a storage pool is basically a Volume group and libvirt manages the logical volumes created.
But if it is not, then you must manage it yourself.
Just add a storage pool and create the disk on VM creation.
Without the storage pool defined, you must manually create and manage the volumes outside of libvirt.
I have created a LVM Volume Group that exposes a device block made of a Linux RAID.
Whereas you would be manually creating a Volume group and manually creating the disks and then adding them to the VM.
My idea is to give a Logical Volume to each virtual machine, but a person suggested me to use storage pools instead, like
