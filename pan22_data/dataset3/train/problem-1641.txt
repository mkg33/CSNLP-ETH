I am not quite sure which version I have but if you paste and the little ctrl box comes up you can press the downward arrow, then select paste plain text, again go to the ctrl box and you can then press default paste.
Note that the filter will select all Metro/Modern/Universal/Windows Store apps.
If you have a context menu key on your keyboard this can be accomplished with 2 presses.
It is located between the Windows Key and Ctrl on the right side next to the arrow keys.
Found the answer here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-onenote/can-i-set-the-default-paste-in-onenote-as-keep/92f552ec-7042-4296-ac69-e74ad8791e2a
The context menu will open and then you can press "T" this will perform the operation using only the keyboard at the location of the cursor.
Alternatively use AutoHotkey (https://autohotkey.com) with the following script block.
This filters to only apply the shortcut if OneNote is active and in this case detects CTRL + SHIFT + V and translates it into ALT + H V T for paste keep text only.
Here's the best AutoHotkey code I could come up with for the OneNote app that comes with Office 365.
