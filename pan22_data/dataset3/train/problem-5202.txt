"Microsoft recommends as few domains as possible in Active Directory and a reliance on OUs to produce structure and improve the implementation of policies and administration."
did he give you any details on his train of thought?
If your colleague said "It will be good for security" without justifying, qualifying, or quantifying his statement, he probably doesn't know what he's talking about.
I usually only do new domains for geographically separated business units, for the first reason echobeach2 mentioned: you want local admins to be able to admin their local domains, but you don't want them to have admin rights to ALL domains in the forest.
"He said it would be good for security," Is generally code for, "I don't trust the people in the Domain Admins group."
I believe him but I have no idea why it is any better than with just one domain.
I had some problems with this at my old job during our AD deployment.
A colleague of mine wants to add a domain to our forest.
We ended up with three peer domains because of that, and everyone in the Enterprise Admins group had to go through a background check and get approval from each sub-domain before they were added.
It's also a pain to have AD replication constantly running across a VPN tunnel, or whatever.
