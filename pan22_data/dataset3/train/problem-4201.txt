If a determinate piece of news, shows or programming is needed later, re-inject it to the faster storage for use and remove it after all is done.
If you've got the time to set something up yourself, the guys at Backblaze have a good writeup on how they build their storage pods: http://blog.backblaze.com/2009/09/01/petabytes-on-a-budget-how-to-build-cheap-cloud-storage/
We have a (expansible) 1000 LTO 4 tape library for archiving.
You really just need fast access/space to a determinate time of your programming.
After the stuff is aired, you can (and you should) move it to a collection/archive (don't know the correct term in english), probably on tape.
That will be raw footage coming from news teams, recorded studio programmes, live show recordings, plus external productions (syndicated stuff, ads, etc).
That is the content that will be going to the playouts and editing and for that must be fast to access (SAN connected to MACs where the editing is done, for example).
We have a management system in the works that will deal with all content life-cicle and moving it from faster storage (online) to slower storage (near line) and finally to be archived on tape (there's a lot of metadata involved to quickly and easily find the content on the archive later).
Check GlusterFS: many-petabyte expandability, low cost per gigabyte, management console, appliance-like storage bricks, configurable replication level, as fast as your network allows, open source, etc.
Our solution was 2 Hitachi SAN, one faster (FC) and one slower (SATA) with lots of cache (256GB cache).
I work for a broadcast company and we will generate LOTS of video/audio data per month.
