If I understand your question correctly, iptables won't help you.
The first line sets packet forwarding in the kernel; the second line ensures that it survives a reboot.
You enable packet forwarding on a Linux (2.6.x kernel) router by executing the following command as root ...
I'm assuming this is an DSL router presented as an ethernet device.
Are you able to ping the internal interface of the router?
It sounds like you can ping your ethernet router, but nothing beyond it.
To figure this out, you need to tell us what router model you have and whether you have static or dynamic IP addresses.
If you can, then the problem lies in the forwarding between the two interfaces.
If you can't ping in, then there's a problem with the LAN interface.
You will need to execute this command every time you start/reboot your machine.
If you can't ping out, then there is a problem with the DSL connection.
Add the command to your equivalent of /etc/rc.local so that it is automatically executed for you.
If not, there's a configuration problem on the lan side of the device.
