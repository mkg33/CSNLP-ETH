On the other hand...Embedded Event Manager for programming custom responses is on the shrinking list of features you don't get...yet.
Nowadays (even Cisco's) firewalls are far more than a packet filter:
I added an additional layer 3 card in the back to give me a total of 8 layer 3 ports to my ASA.
I have 3 ports that are dedicated to VLANS (port 0 vlan 5-50) (port 1 vlan 60-100).
But if it comes to connecting your network to another, you may want to control more than layer 4.
I have been using an ASA5520 for my security and Layer 3.
I was skeptical at first, but 3 years after implementing, it has been a total rock star.
Port 2 and 3 are dedicated to my primary internet and SIP internet trunk for my crapy PBX.
This setup saved my $$ on spending on a dedicated router.
Routers ACLs are (for the most part) stateless, which is a pita.
This environment handles perfect for 150-180 users.
If you need raw packet filtering for high-bandwidth traffic between your VLANs, use ACLs in your backbone.
Now that Cisco is adding routing protocols to the ASA firewall, and fewer scenarios require fancier interfaces than Ethernet, the economics are pretty compelling for using a firewall instead of a router wherever it will do what you need, at least in Cisco's world.
I think if my environment hits the 200 user mark, I'll up grade to a kick butt layer 3 router and core switches.
