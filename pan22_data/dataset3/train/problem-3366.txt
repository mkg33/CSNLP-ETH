There's a device on my network with an IP address of 192.168.1.100.
If you need to allow all the traffic to spectacular host you'll need to use something like that instead:
I don't want it to send data to the Internet except for a very specific case.
It should continue to allow LAN traffic, so packets with an origin and destination of 192.168.1.0/24 are fine.
Specifically, I don't want it to send outgoing data to the Internet at all except for secure SMTP (TCP port 587 or 465) and even then, just to one SMTP server.
All you need is to drop outbound traffic from your host with rules like that:
I have a router that runs Tomato, so I have access to iptables.
I've set up rules before that drop packets, but I've never set one up that blocks everything but packets that meet specific requirements.
Your device will be able to connect to the IP 8.8.8.8 with any protocol, but will be denied for all others.
Incoming traffic is a concern too, but blocking outbound is more important.
I don't know much about iptables so I'm not sure how to go about doing this, or if iptables is even the best approach.
The first rule will allow your device to use HTTP protocol for any host, and the second one will ban any other traffic outside of your home network.
