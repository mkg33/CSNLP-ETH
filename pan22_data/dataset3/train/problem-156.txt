I just cannot agree with some of the answers here.
It has a very easy fix, just use the -N switch with your (Open)SSH client.
Which works great 99% of the time, however, when the command fails, it just closes the session.
I found this solution at https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/regular-user-is-unable-to-login-via-ssh/4119
Works great when there's actually a session to resume.
Plesk, make sure the user has the ability to access the server.
So don't try to "fix" it on the server, just use the -N switch with your SSH client.
Make sure that /etc/passwd has the correct shell for the user.
In my case, it was caused by a user without a shell on an SSH server.
For example, the user ahmad couldn't login to the server due to missing shell:
The authconfig to configure LDAP, Kerberos, and SMB settings was run without,
A user with the shell /bin/false, /bin/nologin is a proper configuration, it's usually used for users used only for SSH tunnels, without the possibility to login and execute any commands on an SSH server.
Comment out the session required pam_loginuid.so line in the /etc/pam.d/sshd file, and then restart the container.
I had put a remote command to send to the server under "SSH" configuration.
After a lot of searching, I finally found an answer in the case of CentOS 7 running in an unprivileged container.
Since the shell set to /bin/false it means the user ahmad does not have a shell, and to fix this you have to change /bin/false to /bin/bash for bash or whatever other shells.
In my case, it was a PuTTY setting that causing my pain:
