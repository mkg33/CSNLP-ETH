Setting the spec.hostNetwork option pushed the pod into the node address space, 10.240.0.0/16 for which the VPN worked fine.
If IP address 10.248.0.26 belongs to a GKE node, then for doing ping between the GKE node and your remote node you will need to add a firewall rule on 10.248.0.26/24 network to allow incoming traffic to GKE node or all targets in that network from your remote source.
As far as I can tell, when you create a GKE cluster, there is some "magic" networking set up for the pod address space, which appears not to have correct routing as regards VPNs.
It is possible that Karman is correct, but I can find no way to declare an explicit virtual network for the pods to stick the firewall rules on.
Creating a new non-legacy network does not help as GKE refuses to create a cluster with pod address in an existing virtual network and GCE SDN refuses to create virtual subnetworks for an address space that GKE has already claimed.
Simply sticking them on the default network does not seem to help.
