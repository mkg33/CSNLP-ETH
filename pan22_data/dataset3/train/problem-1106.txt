This was the start of what has been a far more rewarding (for all parties) period of my career that has made me genuinely happy, liked and fulfilled.
Unfortunately my foot connected with the power button on the front which switched it off and cut power to the connected equipment.

I was trying to find the time of the last reboot, and instead of entering just that or last | grep reboot.
So that would be my biggest mistake - wasting the 90's by thinking the world revolved around me.
Fortunately (for me) I wasn't the first person to have done exactly the same thing.
This change in attitude stopped me from being that typical know-it-all IT dick that we've all come across and really start to help those around me.
One day, when I was changing backup tapes in the server room, I accidentally kicked the UPS under the desk.
