We use Schemas as "namespaces" to group logically related tables in our database but I take it there is more to them than that?
Do I need to keep these Users in my new generated database and what do they do?
I am not a DBA and so dont really know anything about SQL 2005 security settings, etc.
We have some developers in the team who are in this list and some who are not, yet everyone can do anything on the database, at least when they are hosting it on their own machines.
Other Users are guest, INFORMATION_SCHEMA and sys, but I think these are all defaults?
There is an option to generate script for Schemas, Tables, Views and Users.
I am attempting to set up an empty copy of our database by generating the full database from SQL Management Studio generated scripts.
Unfortunately I don't know what many of the options do and the MSFT documentation of this processes isn't great.
It is the users I am confused about, because I don't understand how they affect the usage of the database.
Sorry but I am a SQL admin ignoramus and usually left these things to the DBA in my previous job!
What is the significance of a user Owning Schemas?
We also have a dbo User who is a db_owner and owns many of our schemas.
There is also a username tied to this dbo User, its the windows NT login of one of our developers, but he doesn't have his own User object in the list...is there any significance to this?
