I'll have to uncomment them once I decide to use a different, non-dovecot pem.
They had nothing to do with the default pem's from dovecot.
It's not a firewall issue as I've taken that down too.
From there I made what seemed logical, small changes.
I would appreciate any thoughts on why this isn't letting me log-in.
I've done it successfully in the past, the only wrinkle this time is that dovecot has moved up to version 2 with some different config files.
But if I netstat -tap, I do see ports listening correctly:
I'm setting up a mailserver along the lines of http://workaround.org/ispmail/squeeze/setting-up-dovecot.
In my case, earlier I had created my own ssl certificate and attempted to have dovecot use the cert.
I do not see pop3-login and imap-login processes, which I would expect to see.
Dovecot starts up, but does not allow me to do a simple manual login via telnet localhost 110 from the command line.
When I look to see what dovecot processes are running, I see:
when dovecot would not work properly for me, I returned to the ssl pem's that are installed by default with dovecot.
Per dovecot's docs, I converted my old working dovecot.conf from version 1.2.15.
The dovecot logs have not shown me anything useful.
These are associated with the ssl certificate that I created.
Once I commented out these two lines, all started working properly.
