The default permissions on sys.databases is for each login to see only it's own database:
Speaking from the development side, I can say that the admin should be able to lock everyone down to their own database (and probably master as well, for metadata).
Other clients of our hosting company use this same server for their databases.
When I log in to the server using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Express, I can see a whole lot of information, including the names of all of the databases on the server and all of the logins.
I certainly don't want other clients to know the name of my database or my login.
I'm new to MS SQL and asking this question as a web developer with limited sysadmin experience who desires his service providers to use best practices.
When I brought up this concern with my service provider, this was his reply:
If you have logins that see databases other that their own, it implies said logins have unnecessary privileges, like CREATE DATABASE.
While I can't access other clients' databases nor see passwords, it seems strange to me that I would even be able to see this information.
Management Studio gets the list of databases from sys.databases.
Please confirm or deny my suspicion that the answer is no and I need to find someone else to host our database.
This hides other DB's and users but only for a single user (probably what you're after anyway).
From the MSDN, the list of SQL Server securables includes databases and the permissions include being able to even see the database.
We have one database on a remote MS SQL server provided by our hosting company.
Using MS SQL this way as a shared host doesn't strike me as desirable at all - but you get what you pay for.
If your terms and conditions of your contract don't say that you get your own SQL instance, and only get a database in a shared instance, then you are indeed getting what you pay for.
Here is a link to the MSDN Security considerations for databases.
