I've been building desktops casually, for myself, for a little over 10 years now, but I would by no means consider myself an expert in computer hardware or electronics, and something like this has never happened before.
can I simply buy a new power supply, and expect things to work?
Before you try anything else, I would suggest removing the hard drive from the computer and then trying a new power supply.
(or damage other components that somehow survived the first assault?)
That way, at the very least, you don't lose any data if the hard drive happened to still be okay.
but I have to wonder: what are the chances that OTHER components were damaged as well?
could another component - like the motherboard, graphics card, or hard drives - have been damaged in such a way that plugging in another power supply would simply kill THAT power supply?
my power supply died last night rather spectacularly: blue sparks, popping sounds, a smell of burning plastic.
the computer shut down, then tried to start itself up again, and sparked and popped some more before I was able to turn off the power switch on the back (in retrospect: was that dangerous of me?
