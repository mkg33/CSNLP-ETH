Of course that if you aren't giving them enough attention or food, they want food and attention, so you should be right it's not the problem, first of all.
Now all I have to do is have one sitting near whatever it is I want them to stay away from.
It doesn't hurt them and it is a very inexpensive solution!
Give your cats their own keyboards in a comfortable and attractive location.
The water bottle is the best way I have found to keep my cat away from anything.
But animals doesn't understand portuguese english (I'm Brazilian XD), so that tatic of sprinkling some water on it is good.
With a child you would say "You can't do this" and he would understand.
They don't want food or toys, they want to sleep on that confortable thing that your keyboard is.
I think the best way to do this is to teach him it's not good to stay on your keyboard.
The words will get linked too, and after sometime you can try only to say "No you can't", and they will obbey.
Unplug your wired keyboard and use a wireless keyboard.
Everytime he manages to do this, sprinkle water and take him out.
If they come near the keyboard when I am working, all I need to do is pick up the bottle and they get down off the desk immediately.
Your cat will get upset and after some tries he will link the bad idea of "water in my face" with "keyboard", and that going on it is a bad idea; they won't try to do this anymore.
Keep that on the bookshelf like a book when you aren't using it.
Once they get misted a few times they learn what it is for.
You can do this also with direct flashing light (2 flashes at most, please) and some simple words, like "No you can't".
Build a shelf (U-shaped piece of wood) over the real keyboard and put a fake keyboard on top.
