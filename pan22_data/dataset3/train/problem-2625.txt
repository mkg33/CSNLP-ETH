So I wrote a tutorial and appended it to the Raspberry Pi assembly programming tutorial I wrote for the Mazidi ARM Assembly book website:
As for help The best resource I've found is "Raspberry Pi Assembly Language: Raspbian Beginners" by Bruce Smith.
Though to get syntax highlighting for assembly I had to go to github, specifically shinyquagsire23's page.

He explains assembly in one of the clearest and simplest ways I have found.
If you're this new to Raspberry Pi I recommend you look at an easier programming language than ARM assembly.
A while ago, I discovered that I could use CodeBlocks IDE to develop ARM assembly language programs in a Raspberry Pi.
There aren't any IDEs for assembly so you'll have to use a text editor and assemble it through terminal.
Although I am quite comfortable with command line interface, I could not resist the convenience of GUI.
I started my adventure with ARM assembly code not too long ago myself and here are my resources:
