I have two different kernel header packages installed:

The problem is that, when installing the latter, it requires you to compile a kernel module, and when doing so, it asks for the path to the kernel headers, and no matter what you add, it says that the path is not valid.
I've tried giving VMWare's installer all the following paths:
Now the version should match and you should be able to install vmware tools.

What it comes down to is that your kernel version and kernel devel need to match.
I have installed CentOS 7 as a guest under VMWare Workstation 7 on a Windows 7 host, and the problem is that I can't drag and drop files, nor copy and paste.
I agree that you need the kernel development headers to recompile the extensions in, but then you also need the compiler as well.
If you google it, you'll find that there's a lot of people with the same problem.
The solution usually suggested is to install the kernel-devel package, but I've done so, and it doesn't work either.
As I said, if you google this, you'll find a lot of people with the same problem, while for others it seems to simply "work", without doing anything.
And no matter what, it says that it's not a valid path.
Minimal installs of CentOS won't include a compiler, and installing the kernel headers doesn't require one.
So folks who do a standard "developer" install would have no issues, but those that do a minimal would always have an issue.
