So even if you attempt to ping something in Network 1 that is not part of Network 2 (something in the range of 192.168.10.9-192.168.10.127), the return traffic from Network 1 to Network 2 will never reach Network 2, as Network 1 believes Network 2 (192.168.10.0/29) is part of its directly attached network (192.168.10.0/25).
Endpoints get an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway (and usually DNS servers).
Router 1 will need to have a static route for the 192.168.10.0/29 network and R2 will need to have static routing for the 192.168.10.0/25 network.
From my experience the problem with people learning static routing is that they forget that routing is a two way process.
There's no sens and value  in configuring the settings via the Packet Tracer GUI.
In case of multiaccess networks like Ethernet it's not recommended to specify the outgoing interface because this will create a directly connected static route, so the router will try to ARP ALL destination devices.
But the obvious thing I see is that your two subnets overlap.
Once you've got the link between the routers working, you need to apply IP addressing to the endpoints (not the switches).
Like everybody else said, we need to see your configs.
So in your type of configuration you could go for either the next hop ip or outgoing interface.
First, validate that you can ping from one router to the other.
Typically this is automated using DHCP which can be configured in the routers.
Configuring the routers you can specify either the Next hop IP address or the outgoing interface.
It can cause performance issue and if ARP proxy is disabled on R2 all ARP requests  coming from R1 will fail.
All you need in terms of routing on the default gateways is a static route on each one, telling it the LAN facing subnet which is accessible across the router-to-router link.
Network 2 (192.168.10.0/29) is part of Network 1 (192.168.10.0/25).
