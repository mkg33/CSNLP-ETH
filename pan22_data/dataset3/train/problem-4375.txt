The existing pam_exec  PAM module allows you to call any external script or command.
I would like to run an additional command that uses the IP address and the username of the attempt.
PAM_USER  is the supplied username of the user trying log in.
Patterns can be quite complex so you could for example use
You can configure AllowUsers in sshd_config to allow only certain users and you can further restrict their access by specifying a host
PAM_RHOST  may actually contain the remote hostname instead of the ip-address, depending on the PAM implementation
Depending on how you stack your pam modules the script can only be called for users that authenticate successfully or all log in attempts.
PAM will set a number of environment variables including PAM_RHOST and PAM_USER which you can use in your script.
Is it possible to run an additional script during the login process of the sshd daemon/server?
The recommended method to add additional requirements to your SSH authentication is to change the PAM configuration.
If the script returns an exit status 0 it can pass, else the login should be rejected.
