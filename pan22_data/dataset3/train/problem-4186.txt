"more" is available in my install of Cygwin on XP, which I'm fairly sure is default.
more is available in Cygwin if it's not in the default install.
However, Cygwin was an early pioneer of the package-based install, and because it doesn't have to actually run the host OS, more things are optional in Cygwin than in other Linux distros.
All Linux commands don't even exist in all versions of Linux.
I wonder whether all linux commands exist in cygwin.
I want to use the command more to see the content of a text file; however, the command is not available.
So, you will find yourself going back to the installer more often on Cygwin, in oreder to drag in a package that just wasn't in the base system.
You need to make sure you have the "util-linux" package installed, which includes all sorts of useful utilities.
I am not sure if your specific command exists in Cygwin, but if you cannot find it, it probably isn't there (though "more" is a pretty common command to be excluded).
A full list of the packages is available at http://cygwin.com/packages/
To answer your question, "all" is awfully broad, but (very) many of the usual utilities are available in Cygwin.
