Getting regular cups of coffee helps, because you A: take a break and B: hold you cup instead of your mouse.
If you find that you're dorsiflexing your hand, raise your chair, lower the mouse, and/or use a wrist pad to straighten the joint.

The biggest problem with RSI related problems is holding your hand in a strained position for long periods of time without rest.

Ideally, you want your keyboard positioned so that you wrists aren't bent.
But before you want to buy anything: learn to mouse with your left hand!

Try a different mouse; often a large one will fix the problem, but the shape can make a difference too.
Finally, consider left-handed mousing, even if you're right-handed.
If that is the problem, also find out why it's not happening when you type.
Using a Powerball is a good exercise to train your wrist muscles, so that they can endure more.
I've heard it ends RSI for many people, but there's the danger that you'll develop the same bad habits with the other hand, too.
