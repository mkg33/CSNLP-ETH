There are lots of hackers in world, who every minute makes and spread millions of new viruses.
If you are plugged with the "Internet" then no one can say that you are not under attack.
We live in a era where only cable (electricity) unplugged computer can only be somewhat treated as secure.
The most protected computer is that disconnected from all networks, including electrical and burried six feet under.
There can be network intrusions from various sources like ISP etc (My ISP was dump enough to not employ proper security measures and there was a MSSQL worm which uses to infiltrate in my PC everytime I connect).
You told that you download the stuffs from only "Good known resources" but there are no guaranty that you are not under attack.
So better safe than sorry, Imagine if you were to loose all your information because your PC got attacked by a virus.
I honestly think that you do need an antivirus because you will never know, there are bugs, viruses & spam going around the web.
An antivirus (including firewall) product does not give 100% protection, but it does seem to provide to atleast the ones in the wild.
There are free antivirus software you can use if you do not wanna buy.
There are many type of the hacking that hacker used and one of them is known as "Phishing" which can hack your "Email" password if you are not aware about it.
The main purpose of those hackers is to hack and collect your secret information.
I'm not sure that you use the USB or not, if you then its very important that you should have an AV on your system.
Thus AV are the program which alerts you on these kind of hacking situations.
Windows firewall does protect from various forms of intrusions, but its not that good.
So i guess you still need antivirus software if you turn your computer on.
