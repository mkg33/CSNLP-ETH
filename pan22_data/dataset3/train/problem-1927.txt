The main site mymarketingcompany.com is NOT hosted with EC2.
Otherwise,  your new name would not be resolved at all.
It turns out that we have a rouge internal DNS server that caches old stuff.
But you should be able to add a record for the name you want ands preserve existing behavior.
Clearing the caches on browser and OS won't work previously.
I just created a new site within EC2, the site works fine if I go to it's public IP.
Just add an A record into the domain and set its value to the iP from Amazon ec2.
To provide more info,  we'd need to know what your domain setup looks like.
However I am setting up this site as a subdomain for another site, e.g.
Within (mymarketingcompany.com) domain DNS setting, I have a A record(subdomain) pointing to the EC2 public IP, the site won't load but goes the mymarketingcompany.com instead.
Based on the problem you're describing,  it's likely the domain has a wildcard entry to point to the existing site.
If you're not yet associating an EIP to the instance, nows the time to do it.
Otherwise your iP will change when you shut down the instance or want to replace it with another.
