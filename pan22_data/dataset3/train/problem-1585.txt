Therefore you need to create a new default route associated with wlan0.
Turned out I forgot to install the wpasupplicant package.
I have my wired ethernet configured with a static IP and I have done the same thing with the wlan.
I tried to reboot without the cable plugged into the Pi to confirm it wasn't just some sort of glitch when I unplug it while it's running but it will only work if the wired cable is attached first.
You may try look what "route -n" gives you before and after you unplug the cable.
I had exactly the same issue with Debian Jessie on my Raspberry Pi.
Discovered a bad interaction between my router (Tomato) and my rpi.
Turning off APSD on the router made the problem go away.
Here's a copy of my /etc/network/interfaces file...
Add this into your eth0 section of /etc/network/interfaces:
However when I disconnect the wired cable so I can use the Pi via the wifi it stops functioning.
Save your changes and restrict access to this file to prevent pre-shared key (PSK) disclosure:
Further instruction can be found at: https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse (section "wpa_supplicant").
Use the following command to check installed packages:
When the wired is being used the wifi comes up and works.
It seems really strange that it would stop working because the cable isn't attached.
Then, calculate the correct WPA PSK hash for your SSID (replace <myssid> and <passphrase> accordingly):
It might be useful to add wpa-debug-level 3 to the interfaces file: this writes a lot of debug messages to the log file /var/log/syslog.
