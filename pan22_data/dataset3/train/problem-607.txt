RECOVERING = Database is recovering and not yet ready for queries.
In Ola Hallengren's blog  (an SQL MVP), in his tool to verify the database integrity, I found he's using the view sys.database_recovery_status to query a db status.
This is the query that I inherited for this check:
Also, depending on what you're looking to do, has_dbaccess might throw some false positives.
EMERGENCY = Database is in an emergency, read-only state.
Remember that databases participating in mirroring or log shipping will not be online or may change state regularly.
I.e., I want the query to be able to tell what whether or not the database is in a good state.
SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX('AdventureWorks', 'Status').
I want to be able to run a query to get the crucial information about a database's status.
If you're using SQL 2005+ and only want to return the DB name where the DB isn't in the "ONLINE" state I'd use this:
the way that I found to see the db status is to use the function DATABASEPROPERTYEX ( database , property ), like this:
PS: the databaseproperty function that you use is going to be removed in future versions, so databasepropertyex is replacing it.
If that query returns any results, the assumption being made is that the database is in a suspect or potentially bad state.
Rather than query for specific conditions, I'd take a look at anything in sys.databases where state_desc <> 'ONLINE'.
If the db has a row in this view, then it's live and kicking, if not, it's offline.

I'd use the newer sys.databases not sydatabases but otherwise this is OK
