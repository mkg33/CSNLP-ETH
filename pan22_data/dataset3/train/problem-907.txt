First off, the only time this question is applicable is for Windows-based PCs.
Also I know plenty of games are written in DirectX but does anyone have any examples of popular games written in OpenGL?
And if you made a game that really needed that feature it would be much harder to port it to another platform that didn't use that API.
Maybe at some point in time API X has feature Y which is really attractive (and therefore might seem "better")... but you can't use it because nobody would have a video card to support that feature.
Popular games that use OpenGL: Quake 1, 2, 3 and 4 (maybe 4), Doom 3
As far as I'm concerned, DirectX is better for Windows since OpenGL drivers are generally terrible.
I saw the articles that were going on about OpenGL being better than DirectX and that Microsoft are really just trying to get everyone to use DirectX even though it's inferior so that gaming is almost exclusively for Windows and XBox, but since the article was written in 2006 is it still relevant today?
They both talk to the same underlying hardware, and there might be minor differences in what they expose, but most skills you get in one can be used in the other.
That said, tool support is a lot better for D3D than for GL.
Or at least that's what the Unity guys discovered with their cross-platform engine.
Console, smartphones, and mac platforms all have a singular API (or a singular API and a "closer to the hardware" API), so your question doesn't apply to them.
