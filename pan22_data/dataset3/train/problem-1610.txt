The problem is now that finding a quick and dirty solution doesn't seem to be as easy as I hoped for.
No need for extremely tight security or best practices (many files are somewhat public anyway).
Normal non-root user accounts can't do anything with system files so don't worry about that.
On a normal Linux (especially Ubuntu) install, ssh is installed by default.
I now want to give ftp or ssh access to a specific folder to a friend of mine.
Looking through the vsftpd config page I am totally lost though.
So, the quickest way to share a file/folder would be:
Your friend can now use ssh to login (or "Connect to Server" from Nautilus or similar) (or WinSCP from Windows) and will find a link to the folder you want to share when he logs in.
There are more advanced things you can do, such as chroot your friend to the home directory so he can't navigate out of it and such, but for quick and dirty use, the above will do.
If you have anything in your home folder you need to have private, make sure the files/directories have chmod __0 (e.g.
I can't find an easier/simpler solution for ssh though.
I then looked around for ftp solutions, for which vsftpd seems to be the way to go.
Does anybody have a quick and dirty way to give someone read and write access to a specific folder on a Linux server?
I first checked out ssh for which I found this blog, which seems a bit too complicated for my basic linux knowledge.
Either ftp or ssh would be fine, I'm just after a quick setup.
