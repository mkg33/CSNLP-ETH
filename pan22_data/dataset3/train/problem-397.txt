That was using the latest Rasbarian (Debian-Jessie).
If you are using wheezey checkout the instructions at coderbot.org or simplesi.net i have used them in the past and managed to create a hotspot.
Where as rtl8192ce has a support, its possible to configure at hostapd conf.
I'm guessing all the Raspberry Pies have enough power to boot Ubuntu-Mate, connect to WiFi from the desktop, and run the terminal shell -- BASH
If this didn't solve the problem then install sudo apt-get install libssl-dev it will solve it.
I had 4 usb wifi adapters, two of which were advertised to have worked with my Raspberry Pi 2.
Then I created another micro-sd bootup card, with Ubuntu-Mate.
If that doesn't work, remove or comment out the line altogether.
Firstly, you need to check the drivers supported by Linux.
And, my HDMI-sound also instantly worked, whereas before hand I couldn't get that to work either.
On the First Boot, I clicked my wifi-hotspot, plugged in the password, and BINGO -- IT WORKED!!
I don't know if any of the troubles had to do with me being in the USA, and perhaps Raspbarian not does not work well for unknown reasons.
This is the website you can find more information: https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers.
You need to set up with correct name of driver, something like this.
Although all 4 adapters found my wifi hotspot, none would even attempt to connect to any of the strong hotspots it found.
