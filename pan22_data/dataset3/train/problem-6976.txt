If main server fails, I just need to start database service in second, as database files are "shared" on storage.
Alternatively, if you're using Linux, you should look at DRBD which will allow you to replicate the data at a block level between the two nodes.
Our preferred vendor is DELL, but you can suggest me other.
Depending on your filesystem, you may be able to have it mounted on both servers at the same time, or maybe not (not really a huge issue if you cant).
Since we cannot run an real HA because an software issue, I'm planning to connect 2 server to a single storage.
I think NAS isn't an option because I need maximum IO speed.
Combine it with OpenAIS/Pacemaker and you can have automatic failover as well.
In split mode an MD1000 can be connected to two hosts, but not to the same storage array on the MD1000.
As a Dell solution, I'd probably be looking at a MD3000 which you can then attach to both nodes.
This also has the additional benefit of not having a single point of failure (your storage server).
An MD3000 can in fact do this, as phoebus has stated.
I need to setup an "cold fail over" to our database server.
