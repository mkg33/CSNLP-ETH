For it I created a simple controller which exposes a simple AXI 4 Lite slave interface (conf) the configuration outputs to core logic (hsize, vsize) and control signals (stop and idle).
So far I just moved to proper testing but at least something seems to be working in simulator.
I'd like to create a component which create an image.
I have more long term project I'm using to learn FPGA/HDL and this is first sub-sub-sub component of it used for testing ;) I'm targeting Zynq device.
For debugging purposes I included 60Hz counter input both to logic (included as watermark) and controller (included in register).
However so far I was more of a software person and I picked FPGA as a hobby - code was created by trial and error so in some places I'm not sure if it is how it is supposed to be (I can debug on my own - comments regarding style/best practice would be more valuable).
Finally ack_sign is supposed to allow sending signal to different clocking domain waiting until it will be received by it.
