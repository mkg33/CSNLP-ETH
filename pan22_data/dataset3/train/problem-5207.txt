For example semicolon usually stands for statement termination (or separation, depending on the language).
It is common in learning a new thing to base your understanding on what you already know about other things.
I think your solution is to first give them a good understanding of symbol.
This is just the sort of error I made myself as a beginning programmer, basing Fortran stuff on what I already knew about math (a lot, as a new PhD in math).
However literals, such as 5 and "foo" aren't symbols in the sense that they "stand for" something else.
Once they start to study languages in general, the concept of a word symbol will be important to them in any case, so this early introduction is good in a larger context.
From that you can progress to word symbols, such as foo.
A symbol "stands for" something, in this case addition.
Don't imagine that this problem is rare or that it is caused because the students don't "get it."
Now, you can introduce variable names as word symbols that "stand for" values.
The students who make this kind of error may, in fact, be very adept at using analogy to put the new information into a coherent framework.
Language punctuation symbols can be likewise shown as "standing for" something.
The symbol isn't itself addition, but "stands for" addition.
The former could stand for lots of different things, but the latter only for itself.
It is just a symbol, but is spelled out using some alphabet.
