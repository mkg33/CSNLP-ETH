I have a VPS with Godaddy + cPanel and I would like to create my own private nameservers.
Because if it's the case, what is the purpose of having multiple nameservers ?
There are lots of other sites around that will provide a free (primary or secondary) DNS server for you to use.
If a hoster's DNS servers are in different ASes and under different TLDs, this generally is a good sign.
You will need to update the records on your server, and with  GoDaddy to make sure they are identical.
Thus if I create 2 nameservers with the DNS of my server, I guess it's simply useless because if the DNS of my server goes down, my 2 nameservers are down too !
But you either will be trusting their expertise to get the DNS service right or have a service description for the DNS service which would include express warranties that  DNS servers in different geographical and network-logical locations are used for hosting your zones.
However, how can I be sure that my domain registrar is not doing the same (creating my nameservers on the same DNS) ?
That's why I always create my nameservers with my domain registrar.
Since I only have one server with Godaddy, I have only one DNS.
When you register your nameserver(s) with your registrar, you provide 2 IP addresses.
I used to use xname quite a lot, they have DNS servers spread around the world plus you get some amount of control of your zone.
If you only have one server,  use that address as your primary...and then use GoDaddy as your secondary.
