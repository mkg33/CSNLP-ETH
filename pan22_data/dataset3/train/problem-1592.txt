And, you need to use a RGB LED with a forward voltage on all pins something lower than 3.3v so it will actually light up.

Assuming the pin output is 3.3V, the Red is Vf of 2V with a current of 20mA, how would I calculate the correct resistance?
Furthermore, with the Green and Blue.. if they have a 3.5 Vf, and the pin output is only 3.3V, do I need a resistor at all?
The main point I'm trying to wrap my brain around is if I'm supposed to subtract the Vf of the LED from the volts provided.
This is my first time doing this, so forgive me for what seems like a very basic thing, I have read through both these articles, and I'm still not clear on the exact math to do.
As far as calculating the resistor goes, you do need to subtract the forward voltage, but the forward current is not what I expected.

So the answer to my question is actually that using a Common Anode is unnecessarily complicated for the Pi GPIO.

The better way is to use a Common Cathode, and do this:

I think I have worked out that I should be doing this:
And I'm trying to calculate what resistor I should be using.. My first question is... are the pins on the GPIO 3.3V or 5V?
The "best" way would be to use an external power source, and a transistor controled via the GPIO, but I'm lazy and won't be doing that.
