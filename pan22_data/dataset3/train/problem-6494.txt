One of the many, many forums out there explaining how to get it working in case you run into problems: http://www.overclock.net/t/1203606/ati-radeon-hd-6570-wont-duel-monitor
Or a video if easier http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvF9Ep_odxE
The DVI port already houses a monitor, and I have a spare VGA monitor that I would like to use in a multi monitor setup, but I'm not sure if it is possible - is it?
Or, try using Google with a phrase like HD 6570 vga and dvi dual monitor
Hook up the VGA monitor with a VGA cable to your VGA port on your graphics card (keep the DVI cable plugged in of course).
there you shoudl see two images each representing one of your monitors.
In the "Multiple Displays" dropdown box select "Extend these displays".
My graphics card (HD 6570) only has one DVI, HDMI, and VGA port.
Assuming you are running Windows vista/7/8, it will automatically detect both monitors and mirror them.
Many people struggle with 3 monitors but it will work fine with 2...
In order to have your desktop extended (have different stuff on each screen), right-click your desktop and select "Screen Resolution".
