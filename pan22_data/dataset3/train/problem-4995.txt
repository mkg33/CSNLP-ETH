Look for anything that looks like it may be a simple tcp proxy.
There is a MySQL proxy but my guess would be that the MySQL process is running under a different name and that is why you can't find it via ps.
You can use netstat -tulpn | grep 3306 to identify the process using the mysql port 3306.
So there is this ancient legacy server running MySQL somewhere in our office.
If there are any firewalls or routers between you and that host, check on those to see if your packets are being redirected before they get to the named destination.
and the hostname is indeed different from that of ancientserver.domain.com.
However, when I connect to the server via ssh like this:
I would be tempted to run tcpdump on your client and see if your client is contacting ancientserver.domain.com.
If so, how could I determine the ip of the actual server on which the MySQL server is installed?
Is it possible that this ancientserver.domain.com is being used a proxy--just passing the MySQL requests on to another server?
Other exploration confirms mysql server is not installed ancientserver.domain.com.
See if you have some kind of port forwarding or tunneling going on.
A tcpdump on the named destination should be empty if this is what is happening.
