I've tried using the Shift key when grabbing the corner handles, but it doesn't seem to preserve the aspect ratio when resizing.
Use the Shift key like you tried, but use the handles on one of the sides instead of a corner.
I dragged and dropped a PNG image onto the drawing surface.
Just drag a corner and it sizes the object and constrains proportions.
I'm surprised because this convention works in other office apps like PowerPoint.
In Visio you do not need to hold the shift key down.
I'm not sure why ratio is kept via side handles but not corners, but that's how it's working for me.
SHIFT and corner handles in other MS Office software.
Alternative solution which I've been using and teaching for years: CTRL and corner handles in Visio.
Check out the Office support article with instructions here:
I click on the image and the resize handles are displayed at each corner and a rotation handle is displayed at the top.
I opened up the "Size & Position" tool window so I can edit the size directly, but without my doing the math, it seems I can't require resizing to maintain the aspect ratio.
You'll need to run in Developer mode and then you'll get some extra options.
Looks like there is a protection feature set that includes an Aspect Ratio option.
There must be an easy way in Visio to resize objects and maintain their aspect ratio.
I simply want to resize the image and maintain its aspect ratio (I don't want any image distortion).
