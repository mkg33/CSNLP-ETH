I did a simple ping test to get the latency and it came back with an average of about 1.5ms every time I pinged the new IP address for that VLAN on the switch.
Currently the FortiNet is setup to do the routing for all networks but I was curious performance benefit we may get by moving routing from the FortiNet to the Dell switches.
So we have an environment with several VLANs connected to a FortiNet firewall using multiple interfaces trunked back to our L3 Dell PowerConnect 6248P switches.
I then set my computer up to use the new test gateway for that switch.
I created a test by creating IP addresses for a couple of VLANs on our network on the Dell switches and made sure routing was enabled on the switches.
Am I missing some obvious crucial piece to getting this working as I had expected?
If I change back so my gateway is going through the FortiNet so it does the routing and ping the IP address assigned for the VLAN on the FortiNet, I get an average latency of 0.5ms.
Shouldn't routing through the L3 switches have reduced latency over the FortiNet?
