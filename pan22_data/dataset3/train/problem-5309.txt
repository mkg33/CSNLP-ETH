It can do a fairly thorough system clean up, but can be told to only clear up temp files.
I'm doing silverlight development and when I run the .xap I often get the cached version of the files rather than the newly created one.
There will be a temporary folder that is hidden in here (use "show all files and folders" button).
The first tab has a "Delete Files..." button under the Temporary Internet Files section.
Easy to find in Windows XP, trickier in Vista or W7.
Easiest way is probably to run ccleaner (assuming Windows).
In IE, I've set the internet option: Check for newer versions of stored pages: to Everytime I visit the web page.

Is there an easy way of deleting temporary files from internet explorer?
While I would also recommend ccleaner, if you want to do it manually, the files are traditionally stored in (C:\Documents and Settings\username).
On XP, at least, you can also do this directly from the Internet Properties dialogue (Tools -> Internet Options, or the Internet Options control panel).
