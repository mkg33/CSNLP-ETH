The bin directory in Unix-like systems contains the programs of the system and the installed ones, but in Windows, system programs are located in C:\Windows\System32 and installed ones are likely located in C:\Program Files.
Though Windows does keep stuff all over the place, just like Unix does.
As others have said, it's not clear exactly you mean by "equivalent", but many of the commands commonly used on the command line are either built into cmd.exe (dir, copy, type, mkdir, etc) even when the Unix equivalent would be in /bin, and others (findstr, net, mountvol, shutdown, tasklist, etc) are mostly located in (typically) C:\Windows\System32 (32-bit versions on 64-bit systems in c:\Windows\SysWOW64).
The closest thing to /bin might be c:\windows\system32
Guess I always like the idea of a folder called bin on both systems to put my scripts in.
But yeah, nothing magical about it you can do something different on each system.
A list of commands can be shown with the help command, this includes some that are built-in to cmd.exe and some that are external programs.
I have been maintaining servers for almost 30 years both windows and Linux.
For some reason at the beginning I started creating a bin folder in the root of c: and I always put all my scripts and utilities that I use to maintain the server.
Windows doesn't use the FHS as shared by different Unix variants.
If you're referring to bin, like in Unix/Linux, not quite.
