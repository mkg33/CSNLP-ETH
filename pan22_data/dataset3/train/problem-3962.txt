Distribution to stores is then handled by your publisher.
In the course of building your game you will need to get at least a distribution deal with an officially licensed publisher.
Once you've got a license then you'll need to purchase development hardware.
XNA requires C# and doesn't give you complete access to the hardware, but in exchange you can develop and test on retail systems, don't need a developer license, and only have to pay a small fee to distribute digitally.
They each can accept or decline your title for their system.
You will also need to pass your game concept through each console manufacturer for approval.
If you've never shipped anything don't expect to get past this hurdle.
Once the game is finished you again have to submit to the console owner for final approval and then pay them to manufacture the product.
To short circuit this whole process, MS put together XNA and the Community/Indie part of XBLA.
Basically the retail console space is a controlled market for established teams only.
Each console manufacturer has a slightly different process for this, but it involves showing them that your team is capable to building and completing projects.
To make retail games for a console you need to become an officially licensed developer.
