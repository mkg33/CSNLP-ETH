I suggest you get into your router interface and change the DNS Servers as others have suggested.
Some malware will try to hack your router using well-known default router passwords.
Then simply type "www.facebook.com" at the prompt.
You might have transferred any data from your PC to Netbook this results carrying for your virus...
Probably Anti Virus scan and Registry scan together results no use...
So, now just manually click CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open Task Manager and check for the processes and end what all the programs you have doubt (Hope you know what program processes you should not touch) And then try if your terminate the correct process 100% your issue will be rectified.
Revert me back if it works or not or if you need any further assistance...
You might have downloaded a trojan without your notice...
Switch your DNS servers to Google Public DNS and see if the problem persists.
Just wanted to add since it does seem to be some kind of DNS corruption, you can use NSLookup to see what IP address your PC thinks "www.facebook.com" corresponds to.
(I like OpenDNS rather than Google - 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220).
There are some virus files which will never allow you to get access to some popular website like FB and other (Depends upon the trojan code) So, I guess browser re-installation do not fix it because virus file is installed in your system's hard disk.
So, manually search for the process name and use "F3" to make search in your hard disk and delete that file or block the access for that file from your anti virus firewall.
Then CHANGE your router password so it doesn't get hacked again.
I wonder if someone changed an entry in there, maybe playing a prank on you.
After this, all processes will start again with a reboot.
See if it differs from what others have listed for www.facebook.com:
