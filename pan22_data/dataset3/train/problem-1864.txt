If the plugin doesn't export .mesh files, and only exports .xml files, use the XML converter tool on the XML files to produce the .mesh files: http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/OgreXmlConverter
You may have to go into mesh editing mode, and cut out the triangles that you don't want, depending on the model.
I would recommend using the blender2ogre exporter: http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=blender2ogre

You will need to select only the geometry you wish to export, and check the "Export selected only" option.
As far as only exporting the weapon and not the floor, this is a matter of Blender editing.
Import a weapon model with hand with 2 actions, reload and shoot.
Many of these models have extra objects, such as a floor, I need to remove those extra objects and export the weapon and hand.
Exists lot of models in blendswap but, I have problem for export.
