If the PC itself is 64-Bit compatible is trickier to find out in that case.
If you are on 64-bit XP, under C:\ you will see a "Program Files" as well as "Program Files (x86)" folder.
They simply tell you whether or not you have a 64bit OS installed.
But, if your copy of windows isn't 64bit (because you can install 32 bit windows on 64bit systems) then I suggest you install CPU-Z.
Right click on My Computer and then click on Properties.
Try downloading CPU-Z and check if Instructions lists something like EM64T, AMD64, x86-64 or similar.
If in doubt, please post what CPU-Z displays for Name, Specification and Instructions.
All the other answers don't actually prove that your system is 64bit.
If you are running Windows XP then you are most likely running a 32-Bit Operating System, since the 64-Bit WinXP Version is extremely rare (for a good reason since it's largely unsupported).
Once you've install it, run CPU-Z and look for the EM64T under instructions on the CPU tab.
There is a compiled version here if you don't want to download autoit and compile it yourself.
