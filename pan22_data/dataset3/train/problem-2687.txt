You would right click on the drive and select properties.
Under each Title (Everyone, System) be sure the first box (Full control) is checked.
If your USB is failing due to age, then nothing can help you.
Also, remember to always back up data before messing with the drive's partitions.
Now you can format using diskpart or use Windows explorer to manage it.
If it is blank, this could cause an issue for writint to the drive.
to recreate the MBR and erase all partitions, then I create a new FAT32 partition on it and it usually works again.
A first check would be to ensure that the permissions are set to allow in each catagory.
This can happen by pulling the drive without using "Safely remove Hardware and eject".
Solid state drives (including USB drives) can only function after so many read/writes.
If permissions were the issue, this would resolve it.
If something is not working on one of my flash drives then I usually use GParted or something similar (GParted is Linux only, MiniTool Partition Wizard seems good for Windows.)
