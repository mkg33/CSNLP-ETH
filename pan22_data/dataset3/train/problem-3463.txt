But attempting to access the site via my publicly available site name (or its IP) yields "cannot display page."
For some years, I have run this using a Comcast Business connection.
From within my home network, entering http://[that server's IP] gives the desired IIS result.
Usually, "home-style routers" have 2 places where you should do the change.
2) Make a mapping in your hosts file that maps the intended hostname to the local server IP.
This is best attempted from another machine on the same network.
I am reconstructing (with a different machine) a network situation with a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine with IIS.
If if trial 1 and 2 both work its most likely some forwarding issue with the router.
I would suggest first narrowing down your problem set.
This will give you an idea of where your problem might lie instead of just assuming its a router issue.
You might want to check if there's something similar on your router.
Can anyone suggest what might be going wrong here?
Accessing a server via its direct ip or localhost is not always the same as acessing it via a hostname.
The router firmware (the way Comcast handles the connection to the Internet) seems to be correct (I specify the IP address of the server in the place for Port Forwarding--TCP, port 80).
if trial 1 is incorrect then you need to check with your dns provider and confirm all the settings are correct.
You can start checking if any traffic is forwarding through the router.
If trial 2 doesn't work then you have something wrong with the configuration of your binding or firewall setting on the server.
