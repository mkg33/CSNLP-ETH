For the future, run each site in its own app pool, and consider running any app that needs to be restarted separately from others in its own app pool too.
Now, i tried posting an update but it failed said it has a file in use and the error msg is as follows:
I got this error upon building the application and tried to delete the App DLLs so that upon building the DLLs will be rebuilt.
The app pool is the unit of robustness; the app (or AppDomain for ASP.Net apps) is a container that has logical but not complete separation.
Stop all the Application pool in Your IIS Server and then removed the all IIS Worker Process in Task Manager.
Seems more likely that the app itself (or the app framework) is locking the file than the app pool per se.
Please go to Task Manager --> Process and find Internet Information Services or find Worker Process and select End task.
Question is: Is there a way to "Release" the lock that is put on the file without stopping other currently running sites?
Upon Deleting I got the error as 'action can't be completed because file is open in iis worker process'.
I have a windows server 2008 R2 running a couple of sites for me, while developing i usually post updates to this server.
The site is running in the same application pool as the site that should stay online so a recycle might be breaking the running site (If this is wrong, please correct me).
I have tried stopping the site but this does not help.
