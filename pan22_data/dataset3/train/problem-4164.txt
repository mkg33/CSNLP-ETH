I'm guessing the default XNA model encourages checking for button presses in Update().
Or should I run a thread that gets a hardware interrupt when a button is pressed and store the time?
Is there another way to design my application to catch button presses as soon as possible?
(I know this sounds excessive when we are talking about button pressing and 20ms or less, but there are a number of scientific applications out there that advertise millisecond level timing precision.
If I only check button presses in Update(), this constrains me to the refresh rate of the application.
Should I run a separate thread that polls the game controller and runs faster than the regular application's 60 Hz, say 120 Hz?
I am just wondering if I might be able to get something reasonably close with XNA.)
However, I am developing a game-like application for research and need to measure reaction times as quickly as possible.
For example, if Update() runs 60 times per second, button capture times could be off by up to 16.6ms (1/60) if they happen soon after the thread goes to sleep.
