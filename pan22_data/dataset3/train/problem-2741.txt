You can get a little bit of help by making sure you are not running ANY other software while trying to edit (including anti virus, etc), but it's not going to be much of a boost.
You didn't mention what the card is, but if it's only got 512MB ram it's likely not very high end.
Get that I/O onto a different disk or RAID array and things will improve.
A Core2Quad with 4gb should be plenty of horsepower on that it if paired with a good videocard.
I do a bit of video editing myself (no HD yet, just SD), and people I've talked to that do a lot of HD editing have spent 8000 or more on a dedicated custom build with high end processors, top end quad video cards, etc and say that only it is "adequate" for HD editing.
While it won't help you, it is worth looking at what high end video editing systems use.
Your best bet is to spend about a grand on dual higher range video cards, link them together (crossfire, etc) and that'll probably give you enough to get by with.
At least add one fast (10K and big buffer)disk for editing and leave the OS and such on the existing drive.
Since your CPU is pegging, it looks like it's doing a lot of work that could be passed off to a good card, especially for editing HD video.
Then right before you render you swap the files out for the HD versions.
I have an AMD 1090T, with Formula IV mobo, 8gig 2133mhz G.Skill Ram, ATI 5970, OS on an SSD, and all my video on a 2TB Sata3 6gbps drive, and I still get lag and stuttering with my D7000 video files (about 22mbps).
Basically, you create low-quality versions of the same HD clips and do all of you work on them.
It sounds like you're biggest holdup is the video card.
Processor is important but editing reads and writes all the time.
One way that ALL computers regardless of speed can edit HD is by using proxy files.
