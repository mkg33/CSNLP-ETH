I tried using the IE-Tab extension, which acheives this seperation by embedding the other application's viewport while keeping it's runtime environment seperate.
The best I can come up with is to open 2 seperate Firefox windows, each using different profiles, but then I couldn't just change tabs to move between accounts.
Preferably to work with Firefox 4 beta 7, which is what I'm running at the moment.
I use multiple email accounts from one provider via their webmail interface, which like most uses cookies for session management.
For Google Chrome, Cookie Switcher and Swap My Cookies are similar to Firefox's CookieSwap.
The well-established CookieSwap allows you to quickly switch between personas.
(This answer contains only very partial solutions, I'm afraid.)
Out of the box, Google Chrome has two sets of cookies: one for normal windows and one for incognito (“private browsing”) windows.
What I'd like to do is be able to use both at once, by isolating the tab's cookies from each other.
But Internet Explorer doesn't use a master password, or implement any sort of password security for that matter- so it's not an option.
If the email provider is Google, a solution is to use their multiple sign-in feature.
That's not nearly as convenient as per-tab or per-window cookies, which the author of CookieSwap claims “poses some significant challenges”.
Does anyone know how to implement a solution to this?
I have no idea whether it would work or how smoothly.
There's a fairly young extension called Account Switcher.
