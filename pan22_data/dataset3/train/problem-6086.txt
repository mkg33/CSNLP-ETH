Remember to order the applets by name since it can be useful to spot in the myriad of icons in IIs manager....
I know that Microsoft announced the IIS Application Warmup module as an IIS 7.5 feature only then to do a Bait & Switch and pull it again so that they can put it in IIS 8 instead, so I wonder if something exists to run on IIS 7.5/Windows 2008 R2?
have a look ath this post: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/amol/archive/2013/01/25/application-initialization-ui-for-iis-7-5.aspx
It worked for me, I needed to activate a web application automatically since it hosted a net.Tcp WCF service that, when called , would not start the application up since this happens only when using the HTTP protocol.
While this makes sense, I would like to have certain app pools conterminously running, but I don't want to just disable the automatic app pool restart as some of the settings (e.g., maximum memory limit) are good to have.
So IIS likes to shut down app pools that aren't in use.
Yuo download the tool and after installing it you'll have an additional applet in IIS manager to handle application initialization for applications and sites.
