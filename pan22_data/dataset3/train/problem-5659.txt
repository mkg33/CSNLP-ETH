We currently have several locations where we have Point to Point T1s setup in a star fashion and since they're very low traffic and do not require the sort of high level of availability T1s provide, we want to switch some to VPN.
So, in what way could I setup the VPNs to where they function essentially the same as the T1s from a networking perspective (especially to other locations) where I do not have to renumber or do anything to locations which are fine?
All of the routers are Cisco 2801 and have VWIX T1 cards and are setup thusly:
However the actual networks are 10.[location].x.x.
Each location has a Point to Point T1 to central and a cable or DSL connection for all Internet traffic.
Here's an outlying location and the central location:
I wish to be able to setup the VPNs in such a way as from the other routers' perspectives everything is the same, so I don't have to reconfigure locations which are just fine with the T1s.
I should mention I've never setup a VPN on Cisco previously, I've only done this.
