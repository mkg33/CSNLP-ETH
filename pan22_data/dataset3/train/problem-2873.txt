Run TFTP server in directory with firmware file (or in tftpd32 you can browse this dir).
Wait... and Wait... and Wait... After router reboot (signalized by red led) flashing is done and you can set on your computer IP address to getting by DHCP server.
Next step is unconnect all devices from router and connect just computer with TFTP server into any lan port and manually set on this computer IP address to 192.168.0.66 with mask 255.255.255.0.
I have enabled telnet and have also tried telnet through PuTTy.
When I do that I cannot find OpenFlow in the /lib which comes with OpenWRT.
Then you need to rename firmware .bin file to wr841nv11_tp_recovery.bin.
Then power off your router (by button next to power cable) then power on, when red led turn on press and hold WPS/RESET button until red led turn off.
After that router will request TFTP server on your computer for wr841nv11_tp_recovery.bin and flash them.
Now you can access standard web interface on default gateway address (usually 192.168.0.1).
For example you can use http://tftpd32.jounin.net/.
This is file name valid for router with HW revision 11.X.
I wanted to convert my TP-Link WR841N into an Openflow switch for which I followed the guide at kickstartSDN.com
There are also options to recover it via TFTP described here: https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd
Please help, should I revert back to stock firmware of TP-Link?
If you want to revert, download latest firmware for your router with correct HW revision from TP-Link website.
For example for HW revision 10.1 it is wr841nv10_tp_recovery.bin.
Since there was no instruction on which image to download, I accidentally upgraded router with the OpenWRT upgrade image and now I cannot telnet 192.168.1.1 into my router.
TP-Link WR841N router supports flash from TFTP server.
Go to Luci Web interface http://TPLIN-IP-ADDRESS , login (with root), and select choose the System menu, "Backup/Flash firmware", "Restore backup".
If you have any other HW revision replace v11 with your revision number.
