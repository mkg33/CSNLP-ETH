When you're bandwidth limited, then it offers the better experience.
But mostly because I don't need the local experience with them.
It gives me a better "local" experience than accessing it through RDP.
I also find the lack of headers, footers, and frames to improve how much screen I can use in that VM without scrolling.
When I run a VM in workstation, I access it from the console.
Loading the VI client, and then opening the console there, rather than running straight up RDP takes a lot longer to actually get in and running with.
It allows me to precisely define how much screen real-estate I want to give that window, rather than rely upon the built in VESA resolutions.
However, our LAN is robust enough that the console view (once the VMTools are installed), does give a better user experience.
It has better compression, selectable visual features, etc.
I don't use Unity mode because it's still not that great in this OS, though it could do a lot of what I need.
For our servers running on ESX, I generally hit them with RDP.
RDP has sound passthrough, even on Linux, so I can watch flash video on it just fine when it isn't working so good on Linux (still a far too common occurrence).
Also if I'm working with several server VMs at once, then I'll probably use the console view, since I've generally got the VI Client running already.
If I'm running over VPN, then I'll avoid the VI Console as much as possible, and try to stick with RDP.
I'm running a Windows XP workstation in VMWare Workstation that I use to do various administrative tasks.
However, seeing as you're using Workstation on a local computer[as opposed to over a network], the benefits are most likely negligible.
RDP is faster than admin console due to better compression and provides an encrypted means to connect to a Windows host.
