You should use the List#toArray method, you want to use the generic method, so not the one returning Object[], for this to work you need to supply an array of the correct size, such that it can store the data there.
IMO that is completely overkill and reduces the readability of code.
compare your code [^] with how I would have written the same instructions and decide for yourself which is better:
In java there is absolutely no need to purge references, the garbage collector will do that for you:
Note that the array need not be the same size, there are two cases to consider:
You put every single instruction on a separate line with additional newlines around.
But aside from that, you seem to mostly ignore the Spacebar, which cramps your operators together and makes them hard to find in between all the letters.
It's harder to subdivide code into logical sections when you read.
Use a list for building your array, then convert your list into an array before you return it from your function.
