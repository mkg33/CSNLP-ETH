Another place to look is in files named /etc/*-release, if such exist.
There's no one file you could read that would tell you this on every Linux system you might look at.
Each distribution identifies itself to the world in it's own way, though there are some conventions.
The distribution is what you are thinking of as "the OS" and the distros vary quite a bit.
See in Linux Land, the OS is the kernel and it's toys.
If you really are only interested in the version of the kernel and you really don't have clues about which distro you're looking at, I would start by looking for kernel itself and hope the distro named it with it's version.
Not all distros install the LSB packages, but those that do, like Mint, will have a file named /etc/os-release and one named /etc/lsb-release.
I can only access the filesystem but I cannot boot the system as it is for a different architecture.
I have a bunch of different Linux Operating Systems for many different architectures and for each of them I would like to determine their Linux kernel version.
For example, on my Linux Mint 19 system, the kernels are in /boot/:
Redhat, Fedora, CentOS, SuSE, openSuSE all have a file named like that - /etc/redhat-release and /etc/centos-release.
Is there a particular file in Linux that contains the Kernel version that I could possibly cat or strings?
