Assuming that you are in Windows Server 2008, Go to ADUC, enable the advanced mode and there you will see a Console Tree: under that there is a category called Builtin and over there you will find 'Account Operators' You have to put your managers list in another group called.
If you wanted to stop Bob from adding users to the "Service Technicians" group and Jane to the "Sales Gerbils" group you could create sub-OUs under the "Groups Managed by Delegates" OU and delegate control there (a "Sales Groups" OU and a "Service Groups" OU, for example).
By putting groups that Bob and Jane are permitted to manage the membership for under the "Groups Managed by Delegates" OU and using the Delegation of Control wizard to grant "Delegated Sales Managers" and "Delegated Service Managers" the "Modify the membership of a group" right on the "Groups Managed by Delegates" OU both Bob and Jane would be permitted to add users (users they create or other users that already exist in the Directory!)
You're looking for the Delegation of Control functionality in Active Directory Users and Computers.
Give it a shot and test out your solution before you roll it out to users.
'Account Operators' which allows them to administer the domain user and group accounts.
Assuming you'd like Bob to be able to create new Sales users and Jane to be able to create new Service users you'd:
This would allow Bob and Jane to create user accounts in the appropriate OUs, but it wouldn't allow them to make the users members of groups.
I don't prefer @Harry Johnston's answer because, while technically valid, you really should use the "Wizard" so that you don't have to muck about with the specific entries in the access control lists (ACLs) you're trying to manage.
The nice thing is that you can create a test OU in your Directory, create some test accounts and groups, and play around with this functionality without impacting the rest of your Directory.
