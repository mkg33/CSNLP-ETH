I made sure that this data line has the correct conditional formatting I want to use across the entire data field.
When you cut and paste, the conditional formatting stays the same!
Not being as talented of a programmer as some of you are, what I did to solve the problem is a short two step process.
You lock the cells that are conditionally formatted.
But it's better than resetting the rules by hand, I guess.
first, I created one additional line of data separate from the data field I am working on for my project.
It isn't automatic, but once you create the "Standard" line preserving the conditional formatting you want to use, it is very easy to apply to even a very large data field in just two steps.
Locking cells is not a solution, tested and does not work!
If you Paste using "Paste Special - no formatting", this will not break already formatted cells, and you don't have to worry about your user having to turn on Macros in order to fix the formatting.
Technically this works but I'd rather find a solution that doesn't require me to press ctrl+e every so often.
Next, I simply select the "Standard" line by highlighting all of the cells which have the formula of which I wish to copy.
I click "format painter" (upper left corner of the screen below cut and copy), and then highlight the cells that I want the formula to match the formula preserved in the "Standard" line.
Easy fix/workaround for already deployed solutions!
I managed to find one solution, I recorded this macro:
