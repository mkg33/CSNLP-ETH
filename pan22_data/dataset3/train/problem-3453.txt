Transfer a file from one PC to another PC via the wireless link and watch the transfer speed.
Unless you're searching for much more specific metrics... but no mention of that was in your post.
This won't give you a kb/sec rate unless you want to do some math with the ping packet size and the ms time.
Ping it with various packet size, but forget the math.
Grab the IP address of the router and measure ping response times.
Get a network speed showing utility (like Gkrellm) and see what speed does it show to you.
As others have pointed out, it is very, very unlikely that your access point hardware is a realistic candidate to be the bottleneck.
Got it, here are the steps i took to determine the speed:
If you want to rule out your ISP and test wireless signal quality, just copy a file from one WiFi connected PC on your network to another WiFi connected PC.
Don't forget that speed is variable due to different parameters, like distance between your laptop and the router and obstacles between them.
