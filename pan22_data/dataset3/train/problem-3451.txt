The LDIF is causing problems, but that is off-topic.
Upon further investigation, there were some executables left over in /usr/local/ from the original from-source install; removing these fixed the connectivity issue.
However, I'm trying to set up SSL, and I understand that with the version i installed through apt-get needs to be configured in cn=config, and therefore must use the -H ldapi:/// -Y EXTERNAL options below, however it is unable to contact the server when I try.
I later disabled ldaps:/// listening on port 636, suspecting that ldapmodify was contacting the SSL server by default then quitting when not given a certificate, but this had no effect.
I first tried installing from source but then reinstalled using apt-get, which caused some migration errors, but I believe those are all resolved.
I've been pulling my hair out for 3 days now trying to configure ldap.
I am able to execute ldapsearch -x and its cousins when I properly specify a root DN (for some reason the base specified ldap.conf isn't working), which I assume indicates that the server is functioning properly; I have as well verified that the server is listening below.
