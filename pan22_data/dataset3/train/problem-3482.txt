The chances of your office and an external host blowing up at the same time are fairly remote.
Even a shared hosting account will do (although VPS preferred).
Backup your source code to Amazon S3, that would be safe, and it's offsite backup!
If possible, can you reference a good service that solved your problem?
Ta-da, all your data - including backups - is on the mercy of the cracker.
Offsite is good, but if it's pushed via network then it's not enough.
I tried searching google for something, and I guess the best solution would be some online backup service.
Possibly you could combine these to get the best of both worlds... but then, one good backup scheme is better than two faulty ones.
Considering you can now fit 8-16+ GB on a keyring, there's not much argument against doing this.
If you do this password-protect the backup but make sure a bunch of people know the password.
Meaning even if your office went down in flames, you could still retrieve your source code
Imagine someone breaking into your main server, which contains credentials to your off-site backup server.
One is kept in my boss's house and one is stored inside the company building.
Our company already uses version control, and is already doing daily's backups.
If you're using something like Subversion I'd recommend copying the repository to a remote location probably once a day.
Physical backups on DVDs stored off-site is way safer than any of these cloud hacks, IMHO.
However, it is my boss's concern to keep the source code somewhere "safe enough" in case of multi-robbery or some natural disaster, ecc..
As long as they are off-site "enough", you shouldn't necessarily need an online solution.
If you're using distributed version control (eg Git), you can simply set up a remote repository and push to it once a day.
Some will also go so far as to put the repository on an external drive that is taken with them off-site.
