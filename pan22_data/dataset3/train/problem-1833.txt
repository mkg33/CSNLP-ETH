The tips here helped me proceed with Trial and Error.
I found that buy unplugging the mouse then plugging it back into the kvm the problem will go away for a while but returns somewhere down the line.
I'm using old PS2 KVM and too cheap to upgrade to USB since it functions.
Problem wasn't caused by clicking the Back button but apry the Wheel Up (to top) action activated the Back button action.
Another trick: In Wheel Button, define action to: Click with middle button...
let it with that spec mouse and you don't have problems.
I also have same issue, pretty much boiled it down to the KVM switch, I think it has to do with faulty KVM, we use several and only have this issue on a couple of them.
Or you can try another solution, try changing your mouse type (for me worked with Wireless Intelimouse explorer 2.0) and deactivate button 4 and 5.
I just installed Intellimouse x64 driver and tried various options for a few mintues.
This problem of Navigate Back when using Wheel Up with Win XP.
I settled on Intellimouse Explorer 4.0 -- wired model -- and disabled the Back button.
I am using a Kensington mouse, previously using a Logitech.
I solved that with 32-bit Intellimouse driver from Microsoft.
