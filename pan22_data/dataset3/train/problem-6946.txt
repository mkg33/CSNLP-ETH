If you can wait until Windows 10, a package manager will be implemented with PowerShell.
My question is that, does cmd prompt allow for programs to be got from the web and installed, in a similar fashion to Linux terminal, cause it would greatly improve my day to day work
This software will let you download and install packages from repositories maintained by third parties (or even your own repositories).
If you cannot wait until then, you can also do a poor-man's download and installation using the "wget" command in PowerShell and launching the downloaded executable.
First, cmd.exe (command prompt) is slowly being replaced by PowerShell.
This is a front-end PowerShell-based command line installer which interfaces with many different online repositories (Chocolatey, etc.).
I currently installed a dual boot Ubuntu and windows 8 and as a new guy to Linux I love all the features it has over windows, like for instances the terminal, which allows me to install programs in two sentences etc, so as I go back to windows 8 and begin installing the programs, I feel like its a burden.
The one I hear most about is Chocolatey (available from https://chocolatey.org).
You should be using PowerShell and forget the command prompt.
First, a couple of third-party "package managers" do exist for the Windows platform.
There are a couple ways, but they're not necessarily first-party supported or as smooth as Linux.
Ok, now that you're using PowerShell, you should be using OneGet (https://github.com/OneGet/oneget).
Speaking of Chocolatey, you can also just use that - (https://chocolatey.org) - but I recommend OneGet because you can hook it right into the choco repo but also use your own (among several others).
OneGet is an open-source project which can be installed on OS's as old as Win7 and comes as a part of Windows 10.
