There is nothing like seeing first hand how a running production engine work.
The core rendering components are hidden from you in this closed source engine however, so you won't learn much where the hardcore rendering is concerned.
It is arguably regarded as one of the best designed engines in the industry in terms of getting your game from zero to market.
Its also a hell of a lot more fun than reading a book cover to cover.
You could start with Unity - I personally really love its high-level component-based game development design.
Almost all the key components are represented in Ogre and its scene managers are actually pretty well designed.
To be honest I think the best resource here will be to simply pull apart some existing games and engine to see how they work.
The examples that come with Ogre will provide you with the entire end-to-end process, and there is some really cutting edge stuff going on in Ogre development right now too (Procedural terrains, DX11 support, etc).
For the really core components of an engine I would go take a good look at Orge.
