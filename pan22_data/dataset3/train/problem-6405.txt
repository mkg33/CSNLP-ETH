I don't see any particular really bad practices here but there are a few minor things that make me uncomfortable when I look at your code.
Your sql is a query and it would be fine to name it like so.
Returning an ObservableCollection is a questionable practice.
As the important things are correct (everything is disposed and you use parameters to prevent sql injection) there is not much left to review.
It's a collection and for collections we usually just use a plural noun.
PersonName or FullName should be a readonly property of the ContactModel and it should have two normal properties for the first and last names.
Your repository shouldn't care and know how to build a person name.
Try to name things by what they really are instead of giving them misleading names.
You should use constants here like reader[Column.ID].
You know everything there is yours so there's no need to emphasize it with my.
If you do sqlCon.CreateCommand() then name the variable command or cmd not a query.
The my-prefix ;-) It doesn't hurt but it doesn't look professional either.
I suggest to use a List instead and update the real observable collection with the new data.
In my review I assume you cannot use EF or alike...
