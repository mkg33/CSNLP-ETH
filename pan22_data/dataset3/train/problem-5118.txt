I was about to suggest you desactivate mod_security after looking at the HTTP response headers, but it seems it has been done already.
If you've had your browser open for a bit then its probably full of all sorts of messages, Clear it and then try the action again on your site and see if anything shows up in the log as you go through the process.
Mod Security check transactions between clients and Apache, it is rule based and the rules define what should be done in case of a match.
Do you get any errors in Firefox's error logs related to your Javascript, or any kind of security type errors?
Firefox's log is accessed via Tools -> Error Console
PHP is server side code and should not behave differently when being requested from different front end clients.
If one of those files returns something other than an HTTP 200 (OK) response, other browsers may ignore it, but Firefox might throw the error you're seeing.
You might want to try changing user agents and masquerade as IE when you connect with Fx (the User Agent Switcher addon lets you do this quickly and easily).
In other words, when the browser requests index.php, all the files included in index.php (graphics, CSS, external JavaScript files, etc.)
Clearly at least one rule match when submitting with FF and result in a 403.
You need to check paths and permissions for all included files.
You should ask your provider a log of rules matching for your website so that you could correct your code or disable mod_security when accessing this one file (through .htaccess).
It might be an included file (CSS, JPG, or even a PHP include) with bad permissions that's being ignored by IE and other browsers.
This will tell you if it's code on the server side preventing Fx, or if it's something else.
