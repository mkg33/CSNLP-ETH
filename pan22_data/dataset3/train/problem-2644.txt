I miss being able to hit F12 and going to the definition of a method.
After doing this, F12 began to do what it was supposed to do.
Because my solution consists of like four separate projects, when I hit F12 and the method (or property, or whatever) is in another project, it opens up the completely worthless object browser.
Slightly different from the OP's question but my ability to Go To Definition was suddenly non-existent.
In the end, I just had to close and re-open Visual Studio.
You probably have added a binary file (dll) as your Reference.
F12(Global) was still associated with GoTo Definition, but apparently the F12(Edit) was taking precedence.
(2) locate and remove the reference to the class containing your method/property
I use Resharper so I thought maybe the issue was there.
Since I wasn't really using JustCode, I uninstalled it.
Is there some setting I can fix so that it will just go to the correct file and method?
(4) click on the "Projects" tab in the "Add Reference" dialog
(3) under the same client project, add new References
You can then OK your way out of the dialogs, and that should restore the functionality.
I found that a recently installed code productivity tool (Telerik JustCode) had hijacked the F12 hotkey.
It may be you installed an addon/extension which remapped F12.
I am assuming that your Solution includes both projects.
To reset it, you can go toTools > Customize then click the button at the bottom of the dialog which says Keyboard....
In the dialog that comes up, type Edit.GoToDefinition in the Show commands containing: textbox.
There was something wrong with my JustCode install, so it was not working, and F12 utlimately no longer worked.
