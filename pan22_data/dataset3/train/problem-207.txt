Noticed that this had popped up again (in a broken state) after the recent Fall Creators Update.
*The Group Policy Editor isn't available on Windows 10 Home Edition by default.
Just in case anyone else gets this annoying thing showing up again.
I found a setting tweak using the Group Policy Editor on this page which we are instituting as part of our deployment images.
Save it like removeOneNote.bat and run it as administrator (by right click on file).
I knew it was the right place because Dropbox (which I do want) appeared in the same location as a separate key.
I was searching for an answer to this question as well, preparing Windows 10 for possible deployment on our network.
Eventually went on the hunt for the relevant CLSID (this ugly beast: {018D5C66-4533-4307-9B53-224DE2ED1FE6}) and found it here:
According to asd, you can disable OneDrive with the Windows 10 Group Policy Editor.
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace\{018D5C66-4533-4307-9B53-224DE2ED1FE6}
Tried the existing tips from several places, but they still weren't working.
