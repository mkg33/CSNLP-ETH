Can I save files on the SD card directly, or should I use an external USB drive?
I am using a Raspberry Pi Zero W and the picam v2 to record videos continuously for several days.
"Sufficient space" will obviously depend upon what size card you have, and how big your video files are.
See: https://superuser.com/questions/17350/whats-the-life-expectancy-of-an-sd-card
If you're worried about SD card corruption, you can always record to an external USB drive.
You can record as it is like any other computers do, you just need to have a free space left on you sdcard todo so.
You can save your video files directly to the SD card - provided you have sufficient space on the card.
To do so, you'll need to mount the external drive, and of course use that drive as the destination for your video files.
I assume you can calculate this, and you haven't provided file or SD card sizes, so...
If you need help mounting an external drive in Raspbian, there's a guide here you can follow.
Also, there is a life expectancy for every storage device, it is called the read and write cycle, it may not affect your sdcard directly but it may in a longer run.
