However - I don't know how do I start a stream manually, without using the control page, and how do I embed it in a web page (i.e.
So for example if, on your webpage you have the following html code for the stream:
To access the stream again - just puth the src url back.
So far I only found this man page: http://www.linux-projects.org/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&artid=13
As soon as you stop reading from it - the camera stops.
I am okay with using the MJPEG, uv4l has a great example of an embedded MJPEG stream on the camera control page.
I only have a b+ model, so unfortunately I can't use the WebRTC streaming.
what do I put for the src attribute of the image?)
I recently found out about the new Raspberry Pi camera driver - uv4l
Once you access the stream URL (by default its http://raspberry.com:8080/stream/video.mjpeg) - the camera starts recording.
<img src="http://raspberry.com:8080/stream/video.mjpeg"> - just remove the src attribute so the browser stops sending requests for new frames and the camera will stop.
