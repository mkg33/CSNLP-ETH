I suggest you find a different key to map so you can have consistency.
Roughly once a year there's been serious discussion in the Vim Developers' list about fixing this problem by various means, including switching to a more capable API, but nothing ever comes of it.
The problem is that in a terminal, a Tab character is ^I (Control-I).
GVim can support this because it doesn't have to rely on the terminal to tell it what keys are being pressed in what combination--it has more direct access to keyboard events, so it has no trouble seeing modified special keys.
[1] It is my understanding that with "modern" terminal emulators this is no longer true, but it was true for so long that there is a huge legacy hurdle to overcome because the terminal library that Vim uses (Ncurses) doesn't even handle this event, so even though the terminal technically may support it, Vim can't because the library API it relies on can't.
This means that pressing control while pressing tab is not something the terminal even bothers to pass through to Vim.
