You can also try to get efficient with unity 2.6, since it's just javascript and C# and boo (a pythonic language), as it will maybe be supported by google and become a standard 3D game quick developement.
I don't want to be dramatic and all by telling you C++ is the standard in game industry etc and that you will have to learn it one day or another.
Anyhow, I can't refrain myself from advising you to try pygame.
Seeing that your already using Java, then I suggest you head over to JavaGaming and read around.

What I really want to know is, a good place to learn, and a country that developers are well payed to be able to pay my course and still have money to do something else.
There's a lot of stuff there that would interest you.
If you want to go and learn C++, SFML is also quite awesome (SDL also is, but is old).
I'm brazilian and I want to learn how to develop a game in some college or something like that, but I don't know any place here to learn it.
I'm a Java programmer, still learning a lot, but I want to do it later.
So, I was thinking about working in some place else, while I study it.
Here is not that good either to develop games, as we don't have many companies to do that.
