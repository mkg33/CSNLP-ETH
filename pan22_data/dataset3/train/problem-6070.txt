You could try some acceleration techniques mentioned below to see if it makes a difference.
https://people.netfilter.org/kadlec/nftest.pdf here states that the performance of the boxes halved when being used for NAT.However, the performance was tested with a large number of chain rules.
So, I don't think stripping the VLAN tags is something you should be too concerned with.
I ran into a problem with iptables myself, but replaced it with Cisco's CSR1000v(licensed) since this was production.
You have a Gigabit NIC card and with a 500 mbps fiber line (which is the maximum throughput you can go up to), i think you are in the clear.
In your case, you might have a single public IP to which you are NATTing.
This would be better suited to a comment, but my current reputation prevents me from doing so.
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/High_Performance_Firewall as well as section 4.3 of https://people.netfilter.org/kadlec/nftest.pdf and see if it helps.
However, the company was paying and CISCO is expensive.
Coming to iptables, I agree this could be an issue.
The NATTing would happen from IP to IP, which means some machine's IP which lies in your LAN VLAN would be able to access the internet by being NATTed to an IP which lies in the WAN VLAN.
