The txr_shell environment variable is set, so that the re-executed script knows it is the re-executed recursive instance.
The prologue is written in a conservative shell dialect, using test for file existence tests, and the ${@+"$@"} trick for expanding arguments catering to some broken old shells (which would simply be "$@" if we were in a POSIX conforming shell).
On a system where /bin/sh is dash, you can see that the above logic will find /bin/bash and re-execute the script with that.
(In my script, the txr_shell variable is also subsequently used, for exactly two purposes: firstly it is printed as part of an informative message in the output of the script.
Secondly, it is installed as the SHELL variable in the Makefile, so that make will use this shell too for executing recipes.)
The idea here is that we find a better shell than the one we are running under, and re-execute the script using that shell.
On a Solaris 10 box, the /usr/xpg4/bin/sh will kick in if no Bash is found.
In the ./configure script which prepares the TXR language for building, I wrote the following prologue for better portability.
The script will bootstrap itself even if #!/bin/sh is a non-POSIX-conforming old Bourne Shell.
