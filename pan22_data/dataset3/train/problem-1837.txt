You want to just turn off displaying Apache the index of the folder.
You should already by using this to restrict access to the .ht* files.
This way when Users visit http://www.url.com/folder/, they get a Directory listing denied error.
Then you allow any IP address to pass, so requests are always authorised.
It allows the authorization to satisfied by either credentials or IP address.
Yes, you can secure files and directories by name or pattern.
So now browsing this directory or any of its subdirectories will require a login, but directly retrieving a file from it won’t.
If you want the index to be dynamic you'll need to use some sort of script (or server side include) to generate the index.
Do a chmod 777 on the files, but not on the main folder.
But when they visit http://www.url.com/folder/file.jpg they can see the file.
* for the <Files> section will match –, which effectively means the enclosed rules apply to files, but not to directories.
In the amended rules for files, the key is Satisfy any.
Then you amend this restriction for files with at least one character in their name – this is what the glob pattern ?
Add an index.html file that lists the contents of the folder and restrict access to that file with .htaccess.
