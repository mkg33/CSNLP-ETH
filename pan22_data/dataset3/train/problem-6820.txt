I know this description is a bit cryptic - have a look at a youtube-video
into the command line with the cursor over the second /.
if you can do it interactively you may try it with easymotion-plugin:
I know that I could v/hea to select until hea but when I then delete the text I will have removed the leading h in head as well.
However, each one required me to count or calculate the offending characters.
Thus, the best solution that I have found is to simply dth and if that doesn't delete up to the character that I need, then I can just press .
When you type v to visually select a region, then type / to begin the search for the end of the region, Vim will enter
It works, but I would like to know if there is a better way.
I could just h back a character, but this is now a chain of workarounds.
Even my own question does require me to already know that there exist offending characters!
Then you type the 2 or more characters that you wish to terminate the region with and hit Enter.
If the cursor is at the first | and I want to delete until head, how could I do that with t?
Is there any way to have t depend on two or more characters instead of a single character?
The b-1 tells Vim to search for that pattern and put the cursor one character before (-1) the beginning of the match.
d;;fh -> will grey out all text and mark all h letters red but substitute them by a,b,c,â€¦ and then you may hit b to delete to the second h.
I appreciate all the great answers, and I've learned a bit from them.
