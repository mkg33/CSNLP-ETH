What needs to be done basically depends on what your problem looks like:
If your problem is with many stations transmitting data at once, you might want to use stations with beamforming capabilities for transmissions (basically 802.11ac or stuff advertised as MIMO for the time being).
If your problem is concurrency of the data sent through the access points (you have the transmission channel saturated for extended periods of time), you should be looking at access points with segmented directional switched antenna arrays.
And, of course, if you happen to have high access point density, centralized automatic transmit power management and channel hopping for access point radios (as implemented in WLAN controllers) does help tremendously as well.
Use a spectrum analyzer to check the frequencies in question over a period of time to find vacancies in the spectrum.
Take a look at your current AP's stats data to get an idea about your current data throughput.
Enterprise-grade APs for any 802.11 standard (including the old 802.11b/g) with this feature are in the market for a while now.
If your problem indeed is noise, you should be looking at a band with less noise.
While I certainly agree that wireless networks in general are a troublesome area if you want them done right (tm), I do not agree that wireless in itself is FUBAR.
