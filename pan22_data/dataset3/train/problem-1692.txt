Unfortunately these formulas are easy to recognize, so they are easy to solve.
Input: $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ ($x$ is indexed from 0 to $n-1$)
The output 3CNF is clearly satisfiable only by the assignment.
For $0 \leq i < n/3$ pick input variables $x_{3i},x_{3i+1},x_{3i+2}$ and add to the final formula the seven clauses on these three variables which are satisfied by the input.
Another RANDOM process is to add to the formula random clauses among the ones which are not falsified by the given assignment.
Formulas generated in this way are usually hard to distinguish from purely random  3CNFs with a similar clause/variables ratio (which are unsatisfiable with high probability).
Output: a 3CNF with $\frac{7}{3}n$ clauses (assume 3 divides $n$)
The formula will stay satisfiable, but no other assignment will satisfy it if you add many generated clauses (I guess $100n$ would be more than enough).
The way I understand it leads to the following construction which is an invertible function from $\{0,1\}^n$ to 3CNFs:
This procedure is well defined for every input and it is invertible.
