WSUS should automatically handle installing the new update revision, and uninstalling the old one in the progress.
On my servers I can confirm that there are two version of the patch for 7 and 2008, and that one of them shows it's declined because of attribute being expired.
Under normal circumstances this would be fine because I would just then set that patch to Approve for Removal then deny it.
Hope to get some clear answers as our users are having issues again!
I think WSUS gets automatically any updates that get re-released - that's how some of the definitions are distributed.
AFAIK, it will not, however, automatically decline the old superseded update.
The other one is with a later date of revising that corresponds to the article's one.
How do I tell the WSUS to delete the old and get the new one from Microsoft Update?
You can easily see this by searching for KB3097877 and then right clicking the patch and selecting Revision History.
Do I need to set the patch for removal, wait until I get 100% compliant, then approve it again?
I'm a little unsure how WSUS behaves in this scenario.
For KB3097877, Microsoft had an issue and it was causing problems for many users so they pulled it.
We have a main WSUS server and a downstream server at a remote site.
I'll use the latest KB3097877 issue as an example.
Or will this approve the same old, previously downloaded patch and screw up users again?
However they decided to re-release that same patch (fixed) under the same KB.
When I approve patches on the main one, they get pushed to the downstream and then all clients will install the patches.
This scenario is called "supersedence" in Microsoft terminology.
