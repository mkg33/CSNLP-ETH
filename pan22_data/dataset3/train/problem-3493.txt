I read that autovacuum should be canceled automatically, when submitting DROP TABLE command, but it doesn't happen.
Can I disable autovacuum on those particular tables?
Furthermore I don't have any delete or update operations of those tables — only inserts and drops.
If You use Linux you should list processes with ps aux and find Autovacuum process.
In any case, it is possible to completely disable autovacuum for a particular table, with:
"In any case, it is possible to completely disable autovacuum for a particular table."
No, you can not disable autovacuum if it is to prevent transaction ID wraparound.
See Automatic Vacuuming for the relevant configuration parameters.
Autovacuuming process holds RowExclusiveLock and ShareUpdateExclusiveLock on the table, which I want to drop.
If so, PostgreSQL considers that an emergency and refuses to yield the lock.
Is the autovac "to prevent wraparound" (as reported in pg_stat_activity)?
If no delete or update happened, autovacuum shouldn't process the table, per autovacuum_analyze_threshold.
You may set log_autovacuum_min_duration to zero to help figure out what's being autovacuumed.
Which is rather unfortunate in this case, as once you drop the table the situation will be resolved.
Then just kill it(autovacuum should be working as another process if it's turned on).
