If you are opening the files directly from Windows Explorer, try turning off the Preview Pane in Windows Explorer as well.

Go into Word Options there's a check box under Start up options:  Open e-mail attachments and other uneditable files in reading view.
If the file is opened while this lock is in place, it will open in read-only mode.
That was the only thing that ended up working for me.
I just went to file properties, and applied Read Only, and after that removed again (click apply to take effect).
Try turning off the Preview Pane and Details Pane in the File Open dialog box from within the Office application.
Not sure if this is the case for anyone else, as I have tried and failed several times using the above suggestions.
The problem is worse with larger files over slower network connections.
Only to realise that I opened the file which was in a compressed folder...
If you've tried everything else and it's still opening as Read-Only despite that box not being checked in the properties.
There seems to be an issue with the Preview Pane issuing a temporary lock on the file in order to preview its contents.
