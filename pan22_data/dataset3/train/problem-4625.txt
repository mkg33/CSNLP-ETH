The best way to characterize it would be political campaigning or marketing surveys.
In the end we went with a VoIP provider called Swyx, and then wrote our own predictive dialling code using their extensive and well documented ActiveX API (integrated it into the Do Not Call register, automatic callback requests when calls failed or went to answering machine, etc).
We ended up going with a different provider (not Asterisk) but from memory the choices were mostly fairly poor, especially for highly customised environments.
We use Vicidial for as much as 220 seats at a time with a multi-server Asterisk setup.
We have in-house programmers that do the customization of the CRM, etc.
As I don't really have a problem per se, this might need to be marked Community Wiki.
And their interfaces were all clearly an afterthought designed by someone with only basic HTML skills.
Is anyone out there running predictive dialers or Call Center type products on Asterisk/Trixbox.
You could contact a consultant from their webpage:
Also, I really am just trolling for good or bad news either way on the product.
