Exim4 is preinstalled and I'm trying to get TLS working.
By default exim4 looks for CONFIGDIR/exim.crt and CONFIGDIR/exim.key  (CONFIGDIR is for my /etc/exim4)
I have checked the certificates, that the key and the certificate match, as in the following test where the modulus is the same:
I've covered all of those areas yet still it fails.
Remove all of the configuration entries you previously added, so that exim4 will look for the default entries without any distraction.
From a second server I then try and connect to SMTP and start TLS like this:
I tried adding various entries to my configuration file like:
And the debug log from mynewserver looks like this:
I also configured the new server to allow Debian-exim to login, logged in and was able to view the certificate files without problem.
All of my research has identified problems with the certificates being readable, having correct content, matching up, and having the correct permissions, or being specified in the exim4 configuration correctly.
So, copy your certificate and key to these two file names.
Ensure you certificate and key are readable by exim4:
I have copied the snakeoil key and cert into the /etc/exim4 folder and set the correct permissions and ownership:
It is a literal meaning - it really can not read the [certificate] file.
