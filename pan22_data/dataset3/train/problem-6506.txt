All other domains and IPs are in accessible on this package.
I think there must be some sort of proxy or firewall hole.
i tried to capture packets from android but cannot see any packets because the packets capturing tools also setup vpn like monitor in android & they cannot capture such packets.
This means they have some kind of firewall or URL filtering which only allows these specifics URLs.
Mobile carrier in our country has a daily social bundle in which we can use ONLY whatsapp, facebook and snapchat & twitter unlimited.
Normally my openvpn works like a charm on wifi & other data bundles which don't have such firewall.
But there is a paid android VPN which can connects successfully through their firewall.
OpenVPN uses UDP:1194 (and a properitary handshake) so it will not work.
Well I have spent last 48 hours trying to debug this but I'm about to give up now.
So I configured my own OpenVPN server but it is unable to connect to target VPN server on this package.
Try SSTP (like Microsoft does in its RRAS) or another SSL-Tunneling VPN.
You don't have to root the app itself, just wireshark the WLANs traffic.
My guess would be that some traffic on port TCP 443 (HTTPS) is allowed.
So my question is how this other paid VPN is able to bypass the ISP firewall in which only domains like whatsapp facebook is allowed.
