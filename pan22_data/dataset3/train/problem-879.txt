Despite the warning about detecting a package install version, I allowed it to overwrite.
I found out that on Linux guests (Ubuntu in my case) and Windows 7 hosts (I guess that doesn't matter) you just have to restart the following process on your guest machine:
I was on .22 and having lots of separate issues so I downgraded to .18.
It's a long read, but you may find some suggestions in there useful.
Afterwards start the process with the above command again and the clipboard starts working again.
Then once booted I ran the Devices -> Insert Guest Additions iso and ran the .run installer as root.
One other thing that I remember reading was to change the clipboard sharing from bidirectional to host to guest.
I think the key thing, at least for my distro is to play off what the official package is, but use the iso that comes with client.
Find out the PID of the process with ps and kill it.
Finally, if nothing solves the problem, I suggest you to open a bug report in VirtualBox's Bugtracker yourself, because you are not the first one having problems with the shared clipboard.
Try running vboxadd-timesyn start to restart the service.
Here you can find an old bug ticket that looks similar to your problem.
