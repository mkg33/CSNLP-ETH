The worst that can happen - you buy a graphics card later.
Unless you have a specific reason to be concerned about graphics performance, I say don't worry too much about it - but do check that your motherboard isn't a total dog for integrated graphics performance.
Although I don't believe that they would support a very demanding video game, for most games the video settings can be tweaked down.
That depends on the quality of the onboard video chip.
I have seen Windows 7 computers with onboard video running Windows 7 and using Aero.
AFAIK, the Vista and Windows 7 pretties are well within the capabilities of any modern integrated graphics, ahem, card though.
My view - these days, you worry about graphics performance in modern systems if you want to play games - and I don't mean "casual" games.
On board graphics have come a long way in the past few years, so I personally wouldn't be afraid of removing a GPU from my budget IF I had picked a suitable motherboard/CPU combo (I hear good graphics from the i5 processors).
I wouldn't say a graphics card is necessary but it may make the glitter of Windows 7 (Aero effects) look a bit better.
