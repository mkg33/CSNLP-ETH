Of course, with large images this can take an awful lot of space (but you can purge it once you're finished with the file).
Is there version control software for images that allows you to view an image in it's current and previous states?
Being a programmer, I know that that isn't really a good way to do version control.
When working with images, I tend to start saving things as image_001.png and image_002.png for different versions of the same image.
The way I would do it would be to get a program that could compare two images, and then just use a regular source control tool like Subversion.
Popular clients for Subversion, like TortoiseSVN can be configured to use different programs to compare two versions of specific file types, so you could easily set it up to use that image-comparison program for .png files.
Straight-up version control for binary files is provided by Subversion.
I realize that there are some tools that I could use to do this such as git, but there is no simple way to view the history of a file using such a tool.
Every time you save the file it creates a revision, and you can roll back as far as you've set your history to go.
But then I'm a programmer, not an artist or designer.
If it's single user I can highly recommend FileHamster.
For an image diff, though, I have no idea what that'd even look like.
