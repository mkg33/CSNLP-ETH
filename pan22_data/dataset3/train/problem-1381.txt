(there is also an open source edition) I am running the open source version of Vyatta in a few locations.
I have it connected to a stack of Dell Powerconnect 6248 switches.
One thing to be aware of with the HP 2900 series 10GbE backplane, it reportedly acts like a 10-pack of trunked 1GbE lines.
Based on what you're looking for, I'd look for the following features in a new switch/router:
I recommend that you look into Vyatta it markets itself as a direct competitor to Cisco.
The command line is similar and the features rich.
Vyatta make a number of appliances and they also sell the software to install and run on your own hardware.
For my largest install I have a Vyatta in-front of my DMZ servers as a bridge providing firewalling and ThreatStop and another one routing between 3 networks.
This is just fine when working as an inter-switch link, but is less useful when attached to something like a large filer node.
Another setup I have in the Amazon cloud and another setup is providing VLANS and failover for a large serviced office (with QOS).
