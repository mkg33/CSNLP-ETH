I found the desktop entry didn't work on startup (on 16.04).
Ran sudo gedit and saved an executable one-liner to /bin, named sugedit
sugedit is now visible in the dash and I dragged a copy down to the launcher.
Knowing that sudo wasn't doing the job, I thought I'd try it with 'su'.
Now I just need to get user options ('Open with', etc.)
I do KNOW that 'Terminal=true' is essential because I've not found a way of using su as root without having to enter the root password, and it needs the terminal for that to happen.
; I just pasted it in from another .desktop file and made the obvious changes.
(to make it executable, right-click it in (sudo) Nautilus after you've saved it, and look in Properties > Permissions.
I downloaded the source code for Gedit-3.33.90 from the developer's site, but compilation failed due to a missing file.
The terminal window remains open in the background, but it closes when you close Gedit.
I also encountered the same issue with LibreOffice which is solved by this fix.
Another sudo gedit and put a non-executable, '.desktop' file in /usr/share/applications, called sugedit.desktop.
I don't know how much of that is unnecessary, but who gives a s**t with 2TB of spare storage!?
Its importance has been set to critical, so it'll probably be solved soon.
This is a confirmed bug, which seems to have been there since the beta2 version of 16.04, as some users reported in Ubuntu Forums.
After a fresh & complete re-installation of Ubuntu 16.04 yesterday, I encountered Gedit's missing menu problem for the first time.
People have reported two different ways to solve this:
I also pointed 'Icon=' to one I'd been using before.
onto the context menu in Nautilus/Files running as root.
