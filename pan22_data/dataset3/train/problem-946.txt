I perform periodic maintenance on my VMs by running all important updates (OS and other software), clearing all the snapshots, and then shrinking the drives.
I use this all the time for splitting and expanding and it has a shrink option too.
If you set the Disk(s) to grow rather than being pre-allocated, and don't have snapshots (this is the hard part).
See here which has details for Windows and Linux hosts.

Have you installed the VMware Tools into the guest?

Just create a new vmdk file of the required size and copy the files to it from the old vmdk.
You can use any of the disk imaging utilities like Snapshot (www.drivesnapshot.de) to make the copy easier, as they will copy the boot sectors, ACLs etc, but you could actually just copy the files.
