If so, is there a better way of having Windows-PCs names published on my network without installing/configure any software on that Windows work stations?
As Greg stated in his answer, WINS is obsolete and shouldn't be used.
Do I have to install/configure WINS on my Linux server to have a WINS name resolution for Windows-PCs?
They don't register in either if you don't have a DNS or WINS server.
If I'm correct (please correct me if I'm wrong), a Windows-PC's name on a local network is not published via DNS but via WINS
Now let's assume I have a network with Windows workstations and I'm going to setup a Linux server for DHCP to be installed.
If you want all of your hosts (Windows, Linux, etc.)
If I'm correct (please correct me if I'm wrong), a Windows-PC's name on a local network is not published via DNS but via WINS.
Windows clients will attempt to automatically register an A record in DNS if the network adapter has the box checked "Register this connection's addresses in DNS".
to register their names in a central "repository" and to be able to resolve names from that central "repository" then you'll need to install a DNS server somewhere on your network and you'll need to configure it and your clients appropriately (DNS zone on the server, DNS suffix on the hosts for that DNS zone, configure the clients to register in DNS, etc.
Enabling NBTNS name resolution on the client is a critical security risk and should always be disabled unless absolutely necessary.
