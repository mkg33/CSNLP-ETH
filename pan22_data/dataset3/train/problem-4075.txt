And, once the Bash script works, where can I put it to make it execute on startup?
Read this about startup scripts and this about a python daemon library.
Also, don't you have to run tornado behind a real http server?
I was hoping I could write a Bash script and use Screen to get them running in the background, where I can check on them every now and then, but where as
Its failing because sudo is prompting for a password.
This eliminates having to deal with screen, while still allowing you to daemonize the process.
If you're running this as root, you don't need to launch it as sudo.
Assuming your script is a well behaved daemon and that you have set up sudo to not require a password for running your script.
The python-daemonize library provides easy tools to allow you to do this.
Since there's no TTY open, its just waiting for you to enter one--or may, in fact, be instantly failing.
I've got a few Python based servers that I need to run, and would like them to start automatically when I start my Ubuntu Server box.
However, what you likely want to do is alter tornadoDeploy.py to daemonize itself--that is, to detach itself, so that its not running with an open session.
Or whatever the equivalent is for your distribution.
