After pulling out all of the memory modules other than 2, the server booted into esxi as normal.
The server was refurbished and... yes I know, I should to this from beginning.
I tried different esxi versions, removed memory modules, add boot parameter, remove disks.
After systematically adding memory modules to the server, booting, checking if bootup was successful, I narrowed the issue down to a bad memory module.
After 2 days of searching I had the idea to reset bios to default and wow!
In addition to John P Boyle/masegaloeh's answer about setting ignoreheadless, you can also disable headless under your ACPI settings in the BIOS.
At least on Supermicro Servers this appears to help and you don't have to hack a boot argument for ESXi.
What you do is hit "Shift + O" and add the following:
Believe it or not, HP DL380 G9 server, same problem, I was deliberatly choosing F9 boot option then selecting Usb flash drive and getting same error, I let it boot itself (probably UEFI) then boom!
Before that the Unetbootin menu was loading in slow motion, now is normal.
A lot of times it is a bug or incompatibility between VMWare and the hardware you are using but this doesn't mean it can't work.
Leaving that particular module out, the esxi server booted correctly/successfully.
I finally pulled the server out of the enclosure and began testing the hardware.

After you should login by SSH and make the change permanent (otherwise you will have to manually hit Shift + O and the above with each boot):
