In modern networks, trunking generally refers to the idea of passing multiple VLANs from one switch to another, not teaming switch ports for more bandwidth, which probably won't help anyway.
This sounds very non-trivial (and expensive, probably).
example vlans 1,2,3 in the create vlan setting under vlan management.
That means you are allowing vlan 2 to pass through the trunk port.
This will allow you to load balance traffic across multiple physical links, thus increasing the total available bandwidth between the switches.
Then choose your trunk port and select the radio button on the "Tagged" choice.
What you are looking for is actually called a "LAG Group".
After that navigate to "PORT TO VLAN" Setting and choose your vlan number in the top box and click go.
Having said all that, here's a little article from Cisco Press on how to turn trunking on, and some other trunking basics.
Trunking refers to passing multiple VLANs over one physical link.
