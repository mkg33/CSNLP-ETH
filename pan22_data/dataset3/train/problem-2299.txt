The drive is held into a metal frame that is sitting between some cushions for shock absorption.
I have a Toshiba Tecra A9 laptop that I want to upgrade the 120GB drive (HTS722012K9SA00) to a 500GB drive (HD20500 IDK/7K).
Remove two screws and the panel will pop off with just a little pulling.
Here is the procedure that I followed to intall the new drive.
With the second partition moved, I used fdisk to resize the first partition care of this website that I pulled out of Google Cache since the website was down.
Will I need to go through activation again due to hardware changes?
The physical removal and installation of hard drives is super easy on the Toshiba A9.
The final step prior to opening up the Toshiba and installing the new drive is to resize the filesystem to match the partition.
In the case of XP, I've only seen reactivation required after a full motherboard and CPU replacement.
According to this  6 or more changes  of the following hardware items are needed before your prompted for re-activation:
One for C:\ and the other for squirreling away what is is memory for XP to suspend.
I spun up my Linux VM and used parted to move the second partition to the end of the disk.
At this point I set partition one as a NTFS and boot partition.
The drive is in its own compartment on the the bottom.
Clarification: You'll still need to activate, but assuming the hardware didn't change beyond the HD, it should succeed automatically online without any difficulty or a call to MS support.
If you're not cloning, but installing to the new drive (starting over, in other words) then yep.
