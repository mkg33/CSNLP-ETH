It is compatible with ATX, mini-ATX, and mini-ITX motherboards.
Although it is a slim case, it will be well ventilated.
It comes with a 275 Watt power supply, which is stock, that I'm going to replace.
My hope is that being that the PSU will probably only be used at 50% of its max, the noise will be at minimal.
I'm building a custom PC that HAS to be a slim mATX supporting case.
If you pay enough money you should get a near-silent PSU.
The difference is that ITX only supports low power VIA chipsets that only need passive cooling.
I found one that has good reviews except for the fact that some say it is loud.
You may discern a slight hum, and that depends on the quality of the PSU.
The computer will not eat the 400 watts that the PSU has been shown to provide.
My assumption is that it will work as long as it has the correct connections.
A switched-mode PSU will definitely make less noise in a low power situation.
Other factors may make the PSU in question rather noisy, and they are related to design and manufacture.
I've read a few articles that say this PSU will support mATX boards; Newegg says mini ITX boards.
mini-ATX and mini-ITX are interchangeable as far as mounting and connections.
FlexATX is an Intel specced design that is usually smaller (to fit smaller cases) than a standard-sized PSU.
Does load typically have an impact on the "noise" a PSU produces?
I'm not too familiar with ITX boards, but they clearly have to support the same processors.
