Edit: Nagios and the plugins are free, plus you can write your own plugins to suit specific needs that aren't already addressed by the community.
I use a tool called Server Density which also monitors various other metrics from the system, but I use it mainly to log statistics for my mysql slaves/masters and alert me if the get too slow, or if they go down.
If you're using Nagios there's a build in plugin to monitor all you want and more
For example, I have the following Perl code in my setup:
http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/MySQL/check_mysql_health/details
If you're currently implementing your monitoring in general as a bunch of one off scripts you should probably look toward moving to a more centralized tool such as Nagios to manage the checks, threshold and paging policies.
It's quite handy :) Though it does have a hefty price tag.
You could quite easily write a simply Perl or PHP script, running on a cron, to periodically check the MySQL server and alert you to any problems.
MySQL Enterprise Monitor http://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/monitor.html may be helpful.
Obviously &SendAlert can be set up to do what ever you like (email/SMS alerting)
There's a separate tab for replication where you can see all the information as well as set triggers using 'Events'.
