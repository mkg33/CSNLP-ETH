If your current job won't provide this, setup various networks at home and put them through the paces...
I personally used a Sybex study guide for the Network+ exam with a pretty solid understanding of networking already.
That said, I wouldn't discount 'book learning' either...
If you would like more detail on the underlying technologies and theory, 'Computer Networks', by Andrew Tanenbaum was the seminal text when I was studying; again, highly recommended.
Like look at the trace of loading a simple web page, file sharing, SSL, etc.
If you're looking into being a UNIX admin understanding topics such as VLANs, subnetting, and various types of tunneling are fairly important.
W. Richard Stevens' books 'UNIX Network Programming' and 'TCP/IP Illustrated' are must reads, no matter which career you go with.
It's a good guide to practical networking - the protocols and techniques that are actually used in modern networks:
Honestly, there is plenty of information out there to learn, but in the end, you can't beat real-world experience.
Another resource is to play around with network traces.
I would recommend a Network+ exam study guide at a minimum, or a CCNA if you want a real education in networking.
