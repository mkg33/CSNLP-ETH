Now you have told php, that the mysql socket file is actually present in the /tmp folder
I did the following to resolve the issue (Mac OS x) -
IMP the ";" in front of the first line, that is commenting out the first line
First go to your apache webroot (path available from /etc/apache2/httpd.conf  -> DocumentRoot).
I also saw that php was using the mysql sock file from /var/mysql/mysql.sock
copy those lines and create a new entry, like below -

This will show you what configuration file your apache server is using
Open it and find all the lines which have mysql.sock.
If you don't want to muck about with config settings for either mysql or php, then set up this hack:
