Try rebooting, and also try ejecting from inside the computer - right click on the disc in My Computer and click 'Eject'...if that doesn't work, I hope some else has some suggestions...
I tried the below things, and eventually managed to get it out.
I noticed that there was a clamp like  thing preventing the dvd from ejecting, exactly in the center of the slot load.
I had the same problem, dvd jammed in my Dell Stuido 15, no disk drive showing in Explorer, and a really annoying noise coming from the laptop!
I was not worried about damaging the DVD, so I was able to force it a little and get it out.
Eventually it ejected itself when I switched off, switched back on and repeatedly clicked on the above mentioned eject key whilst the computer was booting.
I have a dell studio laptop with slot load dvd drive.
I had this happen on my Dell Studio with slot-type drive.
Before I moved it, I could see the very edge of the dvd in the drive and this is why I used the knife to yank it out!
Pressing the Eject key next to the function keys didn't work and the drive did not show up in My Computer.
Ultimately if none of these work you last option is to remove the drive and try and get it out once it's outside the laptop.
Admittedly some of these have potential to get you into a worse mess than you already are :P
With another dvd i tried to lift the clamp along with pressing eject button pressed simultaneously, suddenly the stuck dvd ejected out.
Using a sharp knife I was able to prize the edge of the DVD out just enough to get a grip on it.
A dvd got stuck inside the drive, i tried to insert another dvd but it didn't even enter a millimetre.
I had this happen to me, only worse when I learnt the hard way not to put miniCDs into slot-load CD drives!
