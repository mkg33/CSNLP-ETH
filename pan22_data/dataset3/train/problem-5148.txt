Or try your luck with a free bootable Linux distro like gparted.
After relocating the shared and user directories to another partition, I will save 2 Gb which is not enough.
And there is no official way to get rid of that mess.
I cannot extend this partition without deleting the one sequentially after this one, but I have many applications and server components installed there.
where Windows stores all DLLs from all programs installed on the system.
I've used it, it worked fine for me; but I also didn't care if I lost the data in that case, it was just to save me the time and trouble.
I have windows server 2008 R2 installed on a 40 Gb partition.
There is one Folder under C:\Windows\ (don't know the exact name; WOW64?)
I have made a mistake in designing my partitions for a home server.
This is what Microsoft calls the solution for the "DLL-Hell".
Backup everything, rebuild your partitions, and restore.
So an update of a program duplicates the required space of DLLs from that program.
But maybe a skilled Microsoft Administrator or Microsoft can give you better information about that.
