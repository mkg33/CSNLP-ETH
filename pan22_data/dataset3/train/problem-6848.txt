"y" is a default value so it doesn't have to be specified.
Unfortunately on Linux the copy "cp" command doesn’t have an option to automatically answer this question with a "y" or "n" answer.
This command will output a string repeatedly until killed.
As these are large files and take some time to complete.
How can I stop the cp command from prompting to overwrite.
In addition to calling /bin/cp, you could do one of:
is to use the binary with a full path, so that bashes alias function does not take over.
I want to overwrite all the files with out having to keep going back to the terminal.
I still want to keep the alias I just don't want it to apply to this instance.
However, I agree that you should not get accustomed to using an alias like cp -i or rm -i -- if you sit down at a different shell, you won't have the safety net you've become dependent on.
I could see that bashes alias feature was causing the problems.

There’s more than one solution to this problem depending on what you want to do.
If we want to overwrite all of the files in the destination directory you can use the "yes" command to answer all questions with a "y".
If we want to avoid overwriting any of the files in the destination directory you can use the "yes" command to answer all questions with a no "n".
Use "man yes" for more information about the "yes" command.
