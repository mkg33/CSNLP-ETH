Inside the DigitalOcean web interface you can rename the droplet Select Droplet->"Settings"->"Rename"
To view the metadata on DigitalOcean log into the host and run the command:
When you bestowed a name on the droplet/VM you signified to the metadata service that you wanted the hostname to be called that value.
You can do it, but you're only making things harder on yourself.
cloud-config is honoring the request put forth by the DigitalOcean metadata service.
On DigitalOcean (and some other cloud providers; Openstack for example) they're providing metadata on each boot of the machine (either provided via cloud-config  or via the options you provided in the DigitalOcean web interface).
As to why the option in  previous answer does not exist, CoreOS does not ship Python cloud-init had to be re-written in a compiled language (hence it being written in Go.
This is actually a design pattern and operating outside of it would me much like trying to avoid uing convention over configuration in Rails.
