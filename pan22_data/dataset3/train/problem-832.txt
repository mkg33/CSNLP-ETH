The timeouts you're seeing are likely due to packet loss (yes, there are packet loss, mainly in wireless links).
From what I can see, most of the pings receive a reply, and with a relatively good RTT.
I may be misunderstanding the problem, but at least if it happened with me I will start this way.
To further diagnose the problem I will do bandwith tests mostly comparing UDP and TCP,  as UDP doesn't have this mechanisms for controling congestion.
As you most likely are using TCP for the tasks you refered (uploading files and sending email), the packet lost you're seeing can explain the low bandwiths.
Also, I'm not realy an expert in TCP to know if the packet lost ratio you're experiencing is enough to explain the low bandwiths and the failed operations.
Packet loss are an implicit method of determining newtork congestion.
When a lost packet is detected the congestion window of the TCP protocol lowers what (in simple terms) means that the bandwith will lower too.
The TCP protocol doesn't deal very well with packet loss.
