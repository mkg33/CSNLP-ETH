Is there an extension for Firefox that will pick up the default internet proxy set by Microsoft (it's stored in the registry, after all) and use it, when it's set?
Type "Route Print" in a CMD shell to get started...
While IE picks that up automatically (the standard "default internet proxy"), Firefox doesn't, which is a pain.
You can try using a Firefox plugin like FoxyProxy to do this.
Yes, I know - I can have Firefox look at my DOS environment variables like http_proxy and use these - but that's still a pain.
At work, I need to connect to a customer network via VPN at times, and doing so, I need to set a proxy.
If you have it set to route anything not going to the VPN to your local default gateway, then you will not need to worry about the internet proxy settings being used by your customers.
You need to have the ip assigned by dhcp for this to work.
If you set your proxy settings to "auto-detect settings for this network", this should work on firefox too.
Another way to do this is to create an entry in your systems routing table which differentiates between VPN address space and internet address space.
:-) Sounds like that shouldn't be all too hard, really.....
Firefox used to have the add-on Quickproxy, but it's not ready for 3.5 yet...
