I am looking for some way to isolate the USB plug ground from the raspberry pi ground so that this doesn't happen.
Use an earthed power supply, or bond the Pi Gnd and all other exposed metalwork to Gnd.
USB -ve pin is connected to Pi Gnd, and the shield is also connected to Pi Gnd.
I built a retropie arcade system for my father-in-law as a Christmas present.
I haven't been able to find anything online, what most people suggest is to just use a grounding strap.
NOTE there are good practices in grounding, and also safety issues to consider - e.g.
Your fundamental problem is that most switch-mode power supplies are double insulated and float WRT real Ground and often are capacitatively coupled to mains voltage.
I am more trying to stop the chip from rebooting every time someone gets shocked.
Since then, I have noticed that whenever one of my nephews plugs in a USB controller there is an ESD discharge on the USB Terminal from whoever is plugging in the controller.
This isn't a viable option because my nephews won't remember to put the strap on every time they want to play pacman.
I am using a Raspberry Pi 3B+, and from what I have read the chip itself is protected from ESD discharge.
