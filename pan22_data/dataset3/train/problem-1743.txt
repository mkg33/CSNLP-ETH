There are many ways you can run Windows and Linux distros on the same physical machine without rebooting the PC or notebook, use any of the VMs suggested, including Virtualbox which I am running on my MacbookPro and running both XP and other linux distros, CentOS, Fedora, Mint, Ubuntu, or use KVM or Xen.
Check them out and configure your systems to install any one of these as the host and put the guest OS on it.
kexec allows you to boot a new linux kernel without rebooting your PC.
Your guest OS will be just like another program inside your host OS.
It should be an interesting starting point though.
Without a hypervisor or virtualization system running underneath the OS, managing the hardware/OS interation and the switching, this is not possible with x86 architectures.
Currently, it only runs on linux (So it won't work on your particular setup, but would work to boot, for example, fedora from ubuntu).
The OS needs to interact with the hardware, or at least it has to think it is.
This proyect seems to be attempting to port kexec to windows, though I've failed to find how much progress they've made.
If you had two different OS running as virtual machines under a third operating system, you wouldn't strictly speaking have to restart the PC to switch between them.
