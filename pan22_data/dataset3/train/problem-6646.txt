I don't receive any error messages, except one time, I received a fault report that a mail couldn't be delivered, but that was only one time.
I already checked http://www.dnsbl.info/ and http://mxtoolbox.com/ for ip and domain but all sites report an ok, I don't seem to be blacklisted, which would have been the most obvious solution.
I use a Lotus Domino Server for it (I am or was a Notes Developer)
The only thing that happened was that my server was restarted by the provider during a maintenance period a few months ago, but everything restarted automatically via scripts.
I don't ask for advice with the config of my server, the config did run fine for several years now.
Nothing more, Didn't found any more clues in my logs.
It said "Router: Failed to connect to SMTP host GMX.DE because : SMTP Protocol Returned a Permanent Error"
The server is Linux based and has a static IP adress, also I am using my own domain.
Do you have any idea what I could do or check to find out what's wrong right now?
Also my mails don't seem to be delivered to the spam folder, I already checked that.
I have a private root server and use it, among other things, as a mail server.
Get the error code, it will give you the failure root cause.
In the last weeks I get reports that my outgoing mails are not received, some work, some not.
