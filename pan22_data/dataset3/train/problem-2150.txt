On Windows with Internet Explorer (versions 6 - 8), I've been able to do this simply by highlighting the entire table, then choosing Edit:Copy (or right-clicking and choosing copy), then pasting into Excel.
If you're lucky, the data will end up in proper columns and rows.
Easiest thing to do would just to start at the top of the table and end at the bottom.
You can take any html file with table, rename it with a "*.xls" extension, and Excel will happily open it up as if it were a native document.
You can then re-copy and paste it wherever you want it.
Copy it and paste it in to a new Excel file, extract the data you require and put it in to the final spreadsheet.
I've not even attempted it on Mac, nor with Safari nor Chrome.
On Windows, with Firefox, I can still do it, but it seems a bit trickier -- I feel like I have to highlight a little above the table and a little below it, then trim that in Excel.
Found a video that explains it for Excel 2000, but Excel 2007 is basically the same.
I imagine in the Windows world, if Safari and Chrome were using the Clipboard correctly, they'd "just work" like Firefox does.
There are a few tricks you may need to do, but excel can understand a wide range of files including web pages, so it should be able to extract the data in a tabular form.
