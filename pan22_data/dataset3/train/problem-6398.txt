The practical answer for you is to continue to use VPN.
To have IPs that can be routed, you either need to ask your ISP to provide a prefix of public addresses, or you need to create an AS (autonomous system) and ask an LIR or RIR (local/regional Internet Registry) to assign you a PI (provide independent) prefix.
With IPv6 Addresses, you will be able to establish end-to-end communication via the Internet.
Setup a VPN directly to your Internet Router (provided it offers this feature - easiest/less secure option).
Also they involve a much more complex setup for your network infrastructure.
Both solutions are more expansive than your current setup.
I am using a dynamic IP service to access my home PC's remotely and maintain that DNS is updated when my IP changes.
This way I could access all my local machines without having to VPN in, or setup some complex port forwarding.
I run 5-6 machines and I would love to be able to do machine1.mydomain.com and have it route to the right LAN ip.
When you have a dynamic IP, you will use private prefixes for internal networks.
Setup an SSTP VPN Server (on Windows Server) or setup an OpenVPN Server (On Linux - more secure/more involved).
Yes, you can - Check IF your ISP assigned you Public IPv6 Addresses and see if your other provider supports IPv6.
