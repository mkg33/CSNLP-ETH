What I've tried so far to increase performance is increasing virtual memory size,disabling some useless windows animations and cortana too as well, cleaning cache and temp files every day,I've no useless software that would decrease my performance, only the most used ones,scanning viruses at least twice a week but no viruses, disabling hardware accelerator in chrome..As well as clean reinstalling Windows 10 but it helped only for a short time, then my performance became slow again.And I would really like to know a reason why my pc performance is so slow, if my ram never goes full?
my pc performance became very slow lately just doing basic tasks like browsing on the internet, watching 720p youtube videos, working with MS word or excel, for example it hangs for few secs when I'm just opening a new tab on chrome, my cpu usage while watching 720p videos on youtube goes to 100% but temp is usually at 50C.
Even opening calculator takes at least 15 seconds...
I also forgot to mention that I'm cleaning dusts regularly too
(I always check task manager), disk space isn't full too, it has plenty of space free
