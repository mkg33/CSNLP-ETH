LCDs come in 3 varieties: Transmissive (light goes through, Reflective (light bounces), and Transflective (some light pass, some bounces).
But indoor ambient lighting, weak as it is, can't illuminate a triple layer of LCD color brightly enough for it to be visible, and color ePaper is still ridiculously hard to get a hold of.
This technology is used for TVs at this point but if demand is high enough there is no reason why it can not be used for computer displays.
Only transmissive has good ability to reproduce colors.
Reflective, like pocket calculators and similar devices have basically no ability to produce appreciable color.
As you can see, it's incredibly hard to see the picture at all.
If you are really adverse to looking at a bright light, try turning down the brightness.
They are eInk displays and there is a significant difference.
Kindles and other eBook readers do not have LCD screens.
The newer LCD screens with full field LED back-lights will dim the LEDs on those parts of a display with dark regions, as in a movie's night scene.
If you think you have eye strain from looking at a light source, it pales in comparison to trying to read one of these:
It's not the same as an eInk display, but I don't believe those are available as general purpose displays yet, and have an refresh time measuring most of a second (not 5 thousands of a second like a "typical" LCD).
If you want to go monochrome then there are plenty of passive display devices available (although the price varies widely depending on what you're looking for).
Here's an example of what it looks like when the backlight burns out.
