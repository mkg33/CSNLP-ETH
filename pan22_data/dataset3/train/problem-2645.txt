Also, I've noticed that this process will recover individual frames of a video file as .jpg images, potentially bloating the recovery size.
Mind you, this process takes some time and depends on the size of the disk you are attempting recovery on.
As someone who has used TestDisk to recover a corrupted partition table, I would highly recommend it.
Escalating your recovery attempts to this step again will require some financial expense on your part to supply an adequately sized disk to recover files to.
I've utilized this tool to successfully recover one of my disks on two separate occasions, as well as a few more disks for others.
This is to reduce the possibility of overwriting data on the disk which you will be attempting to recover.
This means that instead of looking for partition headers, the tool will scan for various types of file headers and recover the artifacts.
The general idea is that the TestDisk tool can perform a quick scan of the disk, which will recover recently lost partition data, followed by a deep scan of the disk which will scan for partition header data.
In the event that TestDisk itself is insufficient and cannot recover the partition, you could also utilize PhotoRec to perform data carving operations.
Also, I would recommend reading through the documentation and tutorials on the TestDisk website.
It is best to understand the process of recovery before attempting to recover your disk.
Unfortunately, this will require an additional drive to write recovered artifacts to.
First of all, it is in your best interest to not utilize the disk until you have performed recovery.
If artifacts remain on the disk it will mention these after the scan completes.
