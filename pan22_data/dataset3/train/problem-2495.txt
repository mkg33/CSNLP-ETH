Its cost is comparable and it includes many features that are simply not available in standard server.
As far as I understand, domain control would make life easier for at least the following tasks:
We would like to know if it is beneficial to use the domain controller instead of configuring a workgroup.
The more people you have in a network, the more difficult your transition to a domain will be.
What are the pros and cons of each and how easy is it to migrate from workgroup to Domain Control if at a later date we plan to switch between them.
There is a crossover point where the additional overhead of managing a domain has to be balanced against the overhead of not having one, so it depends on how you work in your current environment.
I would not recommend Windows Server 2008 for a small company.
We are a company of 10-15 people and are planning to take a server with windows 2008.
Last time I worked in a 10 people company I didn't use it, however, now that I work with 400+ people I find it extremely useful and would quite possibly do it in a 10ppl company, too.
A system based on Small Business Server 2008 would be more appropriate.
We don't plan for a System admin on board (in the near future) hence our objective is that the login mechanism to be simple to use with lesser troubles.
Whether it is worth it in a 15 people company, probably depends.
For me, Domains provide easily configured networks that frankly, I rarely have to touch more than typical windows updates.
This includes remote access features as well as Exchange Server for shared Calendars, Contacts, Tasks, and Email.
If you find that you're sharing a lot of data between users and fooling around with multiple local accounts, then yes, a domain is going to give you substantial benefit.
