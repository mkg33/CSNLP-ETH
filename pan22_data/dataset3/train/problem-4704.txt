The system will simply fail to load if the Fonts folder is empty or missing entirely.
In Windows XP, for example, you would get this error:
At the very least the vgaoem.fon file needs to be available; earlier versions such as Windows 95 also require vgasys.fon.
Additionally, Windows failed to draw the text on system dialogs due to its lack of font resources, so dialog boxes and buttons were rendered blank.
Plus, it caused performance issues, causing the system to run very slowly.
After doing so, the Start button was rendered with a question mark in lieu of the 'Start' label.
Will the system menu,layout containing characters just disappear?
If there's backup font, what then will happen if I delete it as well?
I saw once on YouTube where someone tried to destroy a Windows XP Virtual Machine (of course, being a VM, it could have behaved differently from a physical installation) by deleting all the system fonts.
Just curious but not dare to try out, what will happen if I delete all fonts in windows FONTS folder?
Or does windows have some backup unknown font in some hidden place to avoid such condition?
Also in this video, I did see that Windows regenerated some of its basic fonts, such as MS Sans Serif, Times New Roman, Arial, Impact (as I seem to recall), and a few others, but I still would avoid doing it due to the critical issues it would cause.
And if there's no other font, everything will look some kind of retro game.
