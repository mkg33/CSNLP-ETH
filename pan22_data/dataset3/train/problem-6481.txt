Your graphics cards is an integrated chipset (built into the motherboard chipset and it shares system ram) and back then the Intel integrated chipset's were not very good.
These MacBooks only had 1 Mini-DVI for external video.
To be blunt, your MacBook is not going to have the power to drive the larger monitor.
This was in the Original MacBook (13-Inch), MacBook (13-Inch Late 2006) and MacBook (13-Inch Mid 2007).
Also how are you connecting the display since it uses a Display Port and I don't think you MacBook has a Display Port?
How do you have it connected to the new Mini-Display Port 27" Cinema Display?
I didn't think the integrated graphics supported 2560x1440.
No, your graphics card is struggling with the large resolution not your hard disk.
Or upgrade your MacBook to one of the machines compatible with the 27" Display.
To quote Apple's website and page for the 27" Cinema Display:
I'd look at an older model display from Apple or look into a non-Apple display.
"System Requirements: Mac computer with Mini DisplayPort, including MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Pro, Mac mini, and iMac Mac OS X v10.6.4 or later"
