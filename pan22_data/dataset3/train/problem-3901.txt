Both processes complete successfully, however the problem persists.
Now when I access the site from a windows or mac, the certificate is processed correctly and everything is hunky-dory.
I obtained a new one - and installed it on the site (running on Debian 9 under nginx).
Since the certificate update, this service started failing.
I attempted to manually add root issuer certificate to the ca-certs store and update-ca-certificate, however that resulted in a warning of a duplicate certificate.
Disabling certificate check is NOT an option; accessing the site over HTTP is not an option either.
At the same time, I have a service that runs on this same server and connects to this same site.
Trying to debug this, I came to realise that the system itself where the certificate is installed does not trust the issuer.
The TLS (SSL) certificate on one of my site expired yesterday.
This seems to point to a missing ca certificate on the system.
I tried running update-ca-certificates and dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates.
Here's the certificate details from Chrome on mac:
