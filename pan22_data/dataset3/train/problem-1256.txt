However, AFAIK improved interrupt handling is a major reason
Software-wise, once the interrupt went into the operating system (which are all multi-threaded now), it should be able to pass its handling to a thread running on the other CPU and then handle new incoming interrupts.
two cores would allow you to handle twice as many interrupts as
become common on desktops since I/O is the most important thing for
Caveat : This would be true of a multicore system such as the Intel
high-end systems that are expected to handle high rates of I/O
Hardware-wise, since the two processors may even share hardware components such as RAM, my guess would be that more synchronization would be required between them, so more interrupts would occur than in a mono-CPU system.
Does increasing the number of cores result in the increase in the number of interrupts that can be handled by that processor ?
systems where interrupts are handled differently (such as a dedicated
server systems were designed to use server CPUs before it started to
As a comment to davr -- knowing how a system handles interrupts can be
