I'm not very familiar with the actual system, but from a logic stand point that seems to be the issue.
If the npc believes it does 50 damage, and has to use two turns to destroy the tree, then the new belief is that the tree has to have less HP than or equal to 100.
It's based on an existing belief that the npc does 50 damage.
So, you may be missing the npc's beliefs of its own abilities.
While one belief, that the tree has >50 HP is true.
It would seem that you are missing some beliefs from the model.
The other possibility is that the npc will not know how much HP the tree has, but rather how long it takes for them to cut down the tree.
Then their beliefs about many things will be relative to turns, and not relative to the underlying HP stats.
Then there is a second belief that is missed, and that's that the tree has <=100 HP.
You can't believe the tree has any specific number of HP, unless you have some way of knowing how much damage you do.
In which case the belief would be described as taking 2 turns to cut down the tree.
It can only build beliefs based on what it observes.
