Can anyone provide any assistance, whether it be a circuit diagram or a module that I could reverse engineer, that can convert a 1-bit output from a GPIO pin to a relay capably of safely handling a mains supply?
I know that I could use that device, but it is quite bulky, and there is no way to accurately view the status of the device (i.e.
I am also worried about any feedback or other circumstances that could cause damage to the GPIO controller (or worse, the entire device).
To do this, I am going to open up the light switch, install a small 5v transformer to power the pi, then build a GPIO interface board that will control a set of relays that would be handling 240v, and a maximum of 13A (that is the fuse rating in the main fuse box).
I love my little raspberry pi, and I am reviving an old home automation project, but instead of transmitting (in the old project, a butchered remote control) a signal at 433MHz (described here) to control plug sockets, I am trying to wire it up to the main lighting circuit in a room.
I have done some searching so far, but the only components I can find so far that can be triggered by a GPIO pin can't handle 240v.
As Gerben said, a transistor to control relay and an optoisolator are the 2 parts that I reached at after a lot of search.
As far as I have read, using an optoisolator is a MUST-TO-DO thing to keep your board and yourself safe and sound from high voltage mains.
Now, the interface between the GPIO pins and the Relay is causing me some issues.
