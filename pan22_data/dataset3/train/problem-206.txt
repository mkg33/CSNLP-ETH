I have a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000 v2.0 that was bought paired with a Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000.
all I had to do was supply them with the model#, serial# and where I purchased the item from.
Go to Settings, Ease of Access, Keyboard ... change the 'Filter Keys' to 'off'
The keyboard is still detected by Windows when the receiver is plugged in.
I just had the same problem, was about to give up and throw a perfectly good keyboard in the round tin when I found this 'Filter Keys' post.
I too  had this same problem with my 3000 keyboard, because the transmitter is a nano transmitter there is no resyn capability (no mouse with this keyboard...the keyboard IS available without the mouse combo).
My problem with the Microsoft wireless keyboard 3000 v2 not working was the battery power indicator not on.
There are no on/off switches on the keyboard or mouse, and no re-sync button on them or the receiver.
Well done, it fixed the problem for me with Windows 8.1 on Surface Pro.
In my case like above the mouse had always worked, the keyboard had been in the cupboard for about a year and I was trying to use it with a new system.
Results are the same when using the receiver in a different USB port, or on a different machine.
This setting states it is to 'ignore or slow down brief or repeated keystrokes and adjust keyboard repeat rates' ... immediate result, keyboard was working in 1-2 seconds.
the battery contact (especially the spring had corrosion.
I contacted Microsoft and explained the situation and seeing as the keyboard has a 3 year warranty, they replaced it right there & then, no questions asked.
Anything else I might try to fix this, or should I hold a funeral for the keyboard?
I cleaned the contacts installed  the batteries and it works
