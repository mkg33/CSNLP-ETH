(I know that no password is needed so that isn't the problem).
I got a message box to pop up with the connection string right before the connection opens.
In case you need some additional information, the connection object is an ADODB.Connection object and the Provider is MSDASQL.

When the program is run for the first time, it creates a production database, using the existing template database.
I know how to fix this on the command line by changing the template database's encoding to sql_ascii, but ideally I'd like to figure out how to get the program to create the new database using the new UTF8 encoding.
Remindex is the database to be created and template1 is the template DB.
It happens when the connection to the template DB is being created.
I'm not all that good with database stuff, so I apologize for my lack of knowledge.
I'm upgrading a program for work that uses postgres 9.2.4.
Also there are in fact two driver flavors that get installed: ANSI and Unicode.
to get the most recent version and update your system.
The second time the program goes on and attempts to open the connection, which is when the error gets thrown.
The program used to run with postgres 8, which uses sql_ascii for its client encoding.
Presumably you need Unicode if you decided to switch to utf-8.
For some reason, it is hitting the messagebox code twice, even though it should only hit it once.
However, the 'Client encoding mismatch' error gets thrown before that line ever gets executed.
Client Encoding Mismatch is an error message from old versions of the PostgreSQL ODBC driver.
