HOWEVER, someone has managed to reverse-engineer it for an Android app, and someone else asked for permission to make a C program that decodes the video stream and outputs it as a pipe.
But the guy made it for Zoneminder machines to connect to.
An easy way to find the URL is to look at the regular web interface's source code, specifically the video element.
rtsp://192.168.X.X:554/user=YOUR_USERNAME&password=YOUR_PASSWORD&channel=1&stream=0.sdp?real_stream--rtp-caching=100
It's not perfectly reliable, but here it is: http://www.zoneminder.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=18137
After even deeper Googling and some lucky guesses, I have found that the DVR in question does not use RTSP or HTTP, or any URL for that matter.
Just my 2 cents - here is a detailed blog explaining simply how to find ip cam URLs using onvif :
The rtsp port might be configurable in your DVR and as such differ.
Many other cheap DVRs that work with vMEye do this as well, such as Zmodo and Swann.

I have yet to figure out how to make VLC or SecuritySpy open the pipe on my Mac or in Debian (just because I'm new to pipes and video streams), but it should be possible.
It connects to IP:port and gets some proprietary video stream from it.
My Elec web interface uses Quicktime and it passes the RTSP address in the following format:
