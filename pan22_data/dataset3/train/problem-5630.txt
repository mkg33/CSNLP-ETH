There are a lot of free tools to test the DNS configuration of your MX, A, and SPF/Text records for incoming and outgoing spam protection.
This will depend on your DNS provider or configuration depending on if it's self managed or outsourced.
Since you just changed your ISP and were allocated different ip addresses, I would suggest looking at the NAT configuration of your firewall to make sure you've got the correct external ip address NAT'ed to the correct internal ip address.
There is such a thing as "propagation" when properly updating SOA records in the DNS world, a record will hang around in another systems cache for as long as the minimum and TTL settings are on that DNS record.
Basically, if your TTL / Min timeout is set to a week, and you make a change, test it, then make another change, the DNS server you test on won't update again until the TTL expires.
Web email access doesn't matter, as xeon stated, you must be able to reach the MX server's IP on port 25 in order to receive mail.
In most cases this is under an hour or up to a day.
At any rate, it looks like the problem is a firewall issue, based on the fact that your tests seem to be indicating that you can't telnet to port 25 of your email server from the outside.
