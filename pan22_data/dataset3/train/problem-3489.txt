Following the docs, I got to the situation where I can see the share externally, but my AD credentials do not allow me to connect.

Find the original error message and do a Google search.
Is there something about the way Windows provides the credentials that Samba doesn't understand?
This is only necessary when the windows machine is not joined to the domain.
The first thing you should do is check your Samba logs, and if need be turn up the log level:
I want to share a directory out from the server and use AD authentication (security = ads) using Samba.
Something like svnauth, and replace BINDUSER/BINDPASSORD above.
I cannot get it to work from my desktop using my AD credentials, but I can connect using a set of Unix credentials so it seems that Samba can't resolve my AD details, but that confuses me as I can use AD credentials using mount.cifs as stated above.
Using the same credentials from the server itself works using mount.cifs -- i.e.
When connecting from a windows machine to a share like that you need to specify the domain:
Samba is fairly verbose and helpful when it comes to explaining why a connection was not permitted.
I can ssh to the server using my AD credentials and home directories get created and all is fine.
It's important to note that AD will not allow anonymous binds so you'll need to create a user to bind with.
I have an Ubuntu server joined to our office Active Directory domain  (Windows 2008) and it all seems happy.
I haven't set up Subversion on the server yet, but when I do will I be able to use AD credentials to authenticate on HTTP access via Apache?
You'll no doubt find some very good hints as to what your problem is in the logs.
With regards to you second question, the answer is yes.
