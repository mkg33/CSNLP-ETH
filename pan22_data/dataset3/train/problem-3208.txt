find the new drives located amongst the other drives.
basically go the RUN command type \YOURNASIPADDRESS and enter, if you get the SMB1 error then as far as i can tell you as well as I my friend are screwed
the easiest way to check if this is your issue, is to follow this instructions
Once I started this service, I immediately had access again to the DS.
Go to> Control Panel>Programs and Features>Turn Windows Features On or Off
my nass will appear by dlna on tvs etc and on my network but i cant access the files.

On my Windows x64 the TCP/IP Netbios Helper was disabled (might be a standard thing, while MS wants to promote the Homegroup function?).
Ive had the same issue and after several forums and tech support etc, my issue (most likely yours as well) is the the obsolete smbv1 protocol.
SMBv1 is shown there as not active so just click to put a tick next to it and select ok.  That should sort the problem.
I went into Control Panel>>Programs and Features and select Add/Remove Windows features from the side menu.
Scroll down and make sure that SMB1.0 and SMB Direct are checked.
No one is screwed, Windows Updates unchecks a box in the system settings.
