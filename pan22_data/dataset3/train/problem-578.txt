whatever.www.domain.com and whatever2.www.domain.com all pointed to my_webserver.
Because wildcard CNAMES aren't supported by all providers (such as GoDaddy), I wouldn't advise using it in a case where you suggested it for various customers (where you don't know their provider's capabilities).
For example, let's say you set up a CMS system that allows you to have *.mycms.com as the site name (it uses host headers).
For example, GoDaddy won't let you set up a wildcard in a CNAME record.
so that exception.www.domain.com pointed to another_server.
when you create a CNAME record end the pointed server with a dot, ex:
to my zone file in my bind config and that worked perfectly (ie.

So you can safely use Route 53 as your DNS provider.
It was also possible to to add exceptions to this by adding the line
Just because it is possible doesn't mean it is supported by all DNS providers.
In that case, you could advise them to set up a wildcard CNAME called *.cms.customer.com to www.mycms.com.
In terms of whether it is advisable or not to do this, it depends on your usage.
We use wildcard dns all the time, and we haven't had any issues.
At one point it was up in the air a bit until 4592 clarified that it should be supported.
You want customers to be able to easily set up *.cms.customer.com, without worrying that you might change your IP address at some point.
