Take it back to work and have your system administrator re-join it to the domain.
So from "My Computer" properties I changed it to be member of the workgroup.
And now I'm unable to login at all, probably because I don't have a local account.
I brought it home and wanted to connect to home network, which is a workgroup.
Accessing other computers on your home network is another story, if you simply need access to files and folders or a printer you can access them via UNC path and provide the appropriate credentials when prompted.
But I don't have the administrator password to change it back.
You'll have access to the physical network and internet connection.
You could remove the Administrator password with a custom linux boot CD.
The laptop with WinXP was configured to login to company domain.
(Not sure what your work Administrator would say about that though...)
Next time you take it home just plug it in to your home network and login with your domain credentials (which will be cached on the laptop).
