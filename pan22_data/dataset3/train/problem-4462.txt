If I find a way to open them using W8 Mail, I will edit this post.
In Windows 7, i was using Outlook and .eml files were automatically associated with Outlook and opened properly.
You might wonder why I'm still using Outlook 2007?
View your email in different formats (Normal, HTML, Hex, MIME, etc.).
Alternatively, to open just a few eml's you can use the online viewer at http://www.encryptomatic.com/viewer.
Cons: You have to tell Windows that you allow the program to make changes to your computer when you first open it and you have to search for your emails to view them.
I agree, Win8 Live Mail should do the trick for you.
All I can suggest is to install Windows Live Mail (part of Windows Live Essentials), then you will be able to open .eml files using that program.
It installed and associated .eml files automatically and then could open them by double clicking the .eml file.
If anyone knows an easier way without installing Windows Live Essentials first please post it here, I haven't found it.
I did a test install on my windows 8 RTM PC, I had an older version of live essentials 2011 (version 15.4.3502) which I prefer over the newer versions.
I hope this is useful for people using the same combination.
I'd rather not use an external program to do this.
I tried also, seems the Windows Mail for W8 is an app and will not run by executing the application from the program folder, will only run from the Start Screen.
With Windows 8, they are not associated, and i tried saying "Open with" and pointing to the Windows 8 Mail program, but to no avail.
I managed to use Outlook 2007 to open .eml files on Windows 8 as follows:
