I do not fully understand your question, but if I explain the route DNS takes it should answer your question regardless.
It is possible for the DNS server it contacts to return: "Sorry, I do not have this address" in which case it does skip quickly to the secondary DNS server.
The first thing that the OS checks, is the hosts file.
The reason one would use the domain servers DNS + google DNS is only in case the server's DNS server goes offline to not fully trash the internet.
This still can be the DNS server of the router, but it can also be google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8) or another one on the internet.
A DNS request is executed by the browser on a device.
If DHCP provides the DNS servers, then in the DHCP server settings one or more ip addresses are listed.
If it was set to manual, then whatever the ip address of the DNS server is, that one will be contacted and used.
If the hosts file has an entry for the DNS, then this entry is always used, regardless of what comes next.
That said, when you can have more than one DNS server, the primary DNS server is always contacted, and only if it times out, the secondary DNS server is contacted.
These ip addresses do not have to be the DCHP server's own ip address, but it can be, if the DHCP server is on a router and that router also has a DNS server.
Either the ip address of one or more DNS servers were provided by the DHCP server, or it was set to manual, and configured by the user on the device itself.
If no entry is present, the OS will query the network card settings.
Setting multiple servers is really only used for fail-over, not to get many lists of different DNS, such as one for all the domain stuff, and the fast ones on the internet for internet DNS.
