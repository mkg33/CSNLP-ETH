So you could have the server on the Internet network as far as the ASA is concerned.
A traditional DMZ would have a firewall between the DMZ and the internet, and one between the DMZ and the inside network.
You can do this all on an ASA, but it depends on the model and licensing.
This is probably the closest to what your Sonicwall was doing.
You could make that first firewall a software one, running on the spam-filter server.
If you have spare ports on your ASA you could just assign one to the outside network (so you have two) and connect your spam server to that.
Then create a firewall rule allowing traffic from the spam-filter server into your inside network as required.
Then I have a static NAT rule on the outside interface for the source 192.x.x.x (inside ip of your server) for service smtp with the address x.x.x.x (outside ip of your server)
Would the solution be to put a switch after the modem and connect both the ASA and the spam filter to the switch then put a ACL to allow data from the filter to the internal network?
I am not sure if this will work for you - but I have a cloud spam filter that can talk to my internal exchange server so it seems like a similar situation.
I have an incoming access rule that permits the source 24.172.x.132 to talk to the destination x.x.x.x (outside ip of your server) for the service smtp.
If you don't have a spare port, you will need a switch before the ASA.
You could get more fancy using a DMZ vlan on the ASA itself, and use the ASA to firewall the spam-filter, and the inside network.
