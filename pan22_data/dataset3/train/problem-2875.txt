Making sure the certificate was created for local system (not user)
You also need the certificate thumbprint for your certificate.
This will not work when copying to another PC with a different computer name "Server2".
However when I try to configure with SQL Server Express on the new PC, the certificate does not appear in the dropdown.
Basically, find the SuperSocketNetLib key for your installation/instance.
Now use the following from an elevated PowerShell session to set the thumbprint value and enforce encryption.
I'm not sure if SQL Express is different than full SQL.
The registry location depends on the SQL version being used.
And yes, the CN value is one of those things it is picky about.
The feedback I've got so far is that the certificate CN value is set to the computer name it was created on "Server1".
So your first option is to generate a new self-signed cert that does match and use that.
And finally, restart the SQL service to pick up the changes.
So if the CN doesn't match the server name, it won't show up even if the server name is in the Subject Alternative Name field.
When I export the certificate to another PC I can import fine and can see the certificate in MMC under Personal > Certificates.
The other option is to bypass the GUI and set the certificate via the registry instead.
I've created a self-signed certificate and configured with SQL Server Express.
I have tried a few things suggested on other forums
The SQL TLS configuration GUI is super picky about the certs it will show in the drop down.
Copy the value in the Thumbprint column for your cert.
