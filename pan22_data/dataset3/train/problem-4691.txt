As was mentioned elsewhere here, a lot of other restart-needing problems are from plain old bad/broken software (hung services, infinite waiting on shared resources, etc etc.).
In the latter case of running applications, it's often just simpler for an IT guy to say "just restart it", instead of "close all of your apps, check the task tray to make sure they're really gone, make sure they're not running any background processes or services..." you get the idea.
Obviously the same applies to all other operating systems too
Basically because anything that's got in a mess gets the chance to start over.
Gradual slowness and other restart-needing issues can often be chalked up to memory leaks.
Contrary to @user2630's comments, this is still a very real problem in modern Windows.
The longer answer is that Windows has limited resources for applications to use (Memory, Window Handles, File Handles etc.)
IT support people use "Try restarting it" as the first response because:
I think that leaks and pending library changes explain the majority of the boilerplate-restart-troubleshooting out there, though.
Throwing it away and starting again is one way to fix that problem and will always work out better than scraping the burnt bits of toast off.
Either from services/system components that stay running, preventing their memory being reclaimed on quit, or just from a plurality of running applications that a user started, leaks occur all the time--sometimes severely.
if a badly written application doesn't give these resources back to Windows when it's finished you Windows run out of resources.
I know this is an ancient thread, but I feel like this post by a Microsoft developer explains why:
