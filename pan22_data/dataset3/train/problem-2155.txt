If that really was a system crash, you would have found an event such as this in the System log:
Also, your ILO logs seem to confirm that a power failure was the actual reason.
I'm going out on a limb here and assuming you have the Hyper-V role installed, based on the issue being identical to the one I was having.
It turns out that the Xeon 5000 series CPUS, which your machine does use, have an issue with 2008 R2 and Hyper-V role.
I'm going to go waaaaaaay out on a limb here, and say that you might need a firmware update.
I installed it on my system, and it has been trouble free since then.
The absence of such an event log and of a subsequent reboot means the shutdown was caused by an external event (power missing, hardware fault...).
Also, being configured to save a kernel dump and then reboot, the server would have done just that.
I had this EXACT issue happening on my Server 2008 R2 box.
My ML310 G5 was doing the same thing, and that is what fixed the problem.
We had something similar with our DL380 G6 a while back.
It's most likely a faulty power switch/LED cable kit.
