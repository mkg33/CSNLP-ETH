If I then paste again, I get a new floating selection which I can move around freely.
I want to place the red floating selection arbitrarily within the "Clipboard" layer, without it disappearing over the border.
It's as if the new layer has a smaller canvas size than the rest of the image, and space outside it is meaningless.
I also want to scribble on the Clipboard layer and do other stuff, so pasting a new layer isn't a complete solution.
If I try to paste again into this new layer I can only paste within the current selection.
Now the selection has a yellow dotted border which I can't unselect.
If I paste this into the background image, it has the dotted border to indicate a selection and I can move it around.
I go into another photo and select and copy a small selection.
by clicking-and-not-dragging an external point with the Rectangle Select tool) then the floating selection merges with the rest of the image.
The floating selection in this case is bounded by the non-transparent part of the "Clipboard" layer.
