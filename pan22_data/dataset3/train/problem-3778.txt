Give the man page a good read, as the options go far beyond this.
Also note that I explicitly added a --serial option, as we need to make sure that device exists to get a console on.
# virt-builder centos-7 --arch amd64 -o /var/lib/libvirt/images/centos-7.qcow2 --format qcow2 --size 20G --hostname fubar --ssh-inject root:file:~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
This creates virtual machine disk images with fairly generic acceptable defaults in a minimal installation.
It will also inject my public ssh key into root's home directory, as well as set the hostname to fubar.
It's a highly customizable tool, just as virt-install is.
What you're describing is either a boot system that is not configured with serial console settings, or a VM that does not have a serial device added to it.
There will be one big difference, in that we will specify --import alongside --disk so that we point to an existing image rather than make a new one.
virt-builder will grab signed virtual machine images from a few dedicated repositories and build a disk image file with those contents (disk image format depending on options chosen).
This will start the "installer" which in this case is just starting the newly provisioned VM and connecting to its serial console.
Also be sure that you have included a serial device in your virt-install line, as I do not see one added.
You could use something altogether better suited to this whole task and use virt-builder.
# virt-install --name vm1 --network bridge=br0 --ram=1024 --vcpus=1 --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/vm1.qcow2 --import --nographics --serial=pty --os-type=linux --os-variant rhel7
For example, this following command will create a CentOS 7 disk image in qcow2 format, thinly allocated to 20GiB.
In most cases, you will have to modify your installer boot options (specifically, kernel arguments) to include something along the lines of console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200.
We also won't be specifying "size" within --disk, as --import excludes that option.
This disk image is ready to connect to a VM, which can be done using virt-install, almost identically to the way you have done it in your question.
