You're going to have fun with permission inheritance too.
On Windows groups don't really own files, with the exception of files created by users in the Administrators/Domain Admins.
Or is everybody just in the groups that their in and there is concept of primary and secondary groups?
See: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc961992.aspx.
Of course on Linux and other *nix you switch over to using Posix ACLs, in which case the group that owns an object may not matter that much and you don't need to worry about newgrp.
Everything else about file access is controled by the entries in the Access Control Lists (ACLs).
This is because the old POSIX permissions system is relatively simplistic.
You can set an entry in an a directory's ACL that controls what happens when new files are created.
Active Directory does provide an option to select primary and secondary groups for compatibility with unix OS's, but otherwise does not exist in an Active Directory environment.
The concept of Primary and Secondary Groups does not exist in Windows.
The newgrp command is primarily used to set the group that owns files that you create under Linux.
When a group of users need access to a file, that group owner needs to be used when files are being created.
Users in windows can be in as many groups as you want, the only predence is that Deny permissions settings override an equivalent Allow.
