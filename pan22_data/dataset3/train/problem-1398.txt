I am assuming the configurable settings are exactly the same in both cases.
The only "guarantee" is that if the driver reports that a particular feature is done in hardware then maybe it is, except when it's not.
It's impossible to make this guarantee; there are just so many variable factors.
Case in point: nVidia Quadro cards have identical hardware as the consumer-level Geforce cards, but are controlled with different drivers or firmware.
If someone could provide a source confirming or denying it, it would be great.
Look at it this way, Joe Walmart end user has no idea what color calibration is and so even across the same card and drivers the players will be seeing different colors.
Let's say that I run the same game in two different computers with different GPUs.
Is there a guarantee that the output for a given program (game)  is going to be the same regardless the manufacturer or model of the GPU?
If for example they are both certified for DirectX 10.
I heard that it is not the case for DirectX 9 and older, but that it is true for DirectX 10.
Not even OpenGL's invariance rules go that far, and OpenGL tends to be much more specific about this kind of thing than D3D: http://glprogramming.com/red/appendixh.html
The Quadro cards do more precise calculations which can produce more accurate graphics.
You're not going to get binary perfect output even between different driver versions of the same video card, much less different cards and manufacturers.
Will the output be exactly the same or just perceptually the same to the human eye?
