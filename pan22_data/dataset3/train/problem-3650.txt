Files with the .pyc extension are the compiled version of .py (Python) files that get automatically generated when the .py file is run.
and save it with a .py extension somewhere, then from the command line run python ./path/to/that/file.py and it will echo out 'Hello World', then if you check the directory with the .py file in there should be a .pyc file next to it that was created when the Python script was compiled and run.
These are so you can check all the correct software is working when you set up a site, not very useful I know but they're there all the same.
You can test this out if you want, on a UNIX/Linux system create a file with the code
By default, when you set up a site, Plesk will install some test files for CGI, FCGI (Fast CGI), ColdFusion (CFML) and PHP.
You can just delete those files if you don't need/want them, anything in the /test directory in httpdocs is just test scripts.
As for how the script got there, my guess would be someone like GoogleBot came along and hit that file on the website, this caused the file to get run with Python which created that .pyc file.
The next time someone hits that URL, instead of having to re-compile the Python script again it can just use the .pyc file so it'll be faster.
