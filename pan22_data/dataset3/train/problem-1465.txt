I got another one for the second bay and it just simply does not want to show up in the current bios or Windows, but will show up when I use a Linux based partition manager just fine.
Any idea on how I can make the new HDD usable in Windows 7?
I have a G73JW-XA1 and was able to get the drive to work as my windows drive but also wanted to use it as you have described.
This is simply a bigger HDD(2TB) than the one before  and it's new and unsused.
But when I boot with the tool Partition Wizard, then I can explore the new disk, format it, test it, whatever.
Frustrating that I know it can be seen by the computer, but not used.
This HDD is a SATAIII NTFS formatted MBR disk (not GPT).
You may be able to use it in the first bay and still boot from the second bay if you reinstall Windows to your SSD in the second bay.
I also rebuilt the boot record already, updated my BIOS and of course all my drivers in Windows 7.
The new SATA HDD is not recognized in BIOS and also not in Windows Partition Manager.
