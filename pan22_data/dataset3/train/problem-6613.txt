Does anybody know of a similar hack or some other method to make win 10 allow page file on a removable device?
You are just asking the wrong question, fundamentally speaking.
You can also put a page file on them and everything works flawlessly.
You need to use a device that has write-caching enabled, or more importantly, the ability to change write0-caching settings.
It doesn't matter how effective that page file actually is, it is only required to fill a virtual memory requirement for launching a specific program that doesn't actually do anything with it (the way I use it).
The issue with doing custom pagefiles in Windows 10 at least comes from if the device has support for write-caching and SuperFetch, the spiritual successor to Prefetch from Windows XP.
After installing the driver, all usb drives, removable or not, appear as fixed drives.
For windows 7, there is a wonderful kernel hack driver referred to as "diskmod".
Windows won't let that happen of course, it won't let you create a page file on a removable device nor on a VHD (the way the win 10 installation lives on the usb stick).
I want to run windows 10 off a live flash drive and I need a page file.
I want to upgrade to windows 10 for its native usb 3 support though since the boot times on usb 2 are terribly long.
