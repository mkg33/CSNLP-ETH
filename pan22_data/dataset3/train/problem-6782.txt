At its core, it's just a hint for the mail server about where mails allegedly coming from this domain should originate from and a mail server can do anything in between outright ignoring it, using it as a contributing factor in a spam filter or following it to the letter.
Below are the headers for the email which show that it was sent from 191.185.233.11 but somehow through my webmail IP 185.116.214.97
I just received an email from feedback@ranelaghhouse.com to feedback@ranelaghhouse.com which was caught by my catch-all and emailed to me.
Note that DKIM validation and signature would prove to be an even more effective security measure, although it generates a bit of overhead on all sides.
DMARC is intended to complete SPF records to define how to treat them.
Based on the headers you provided, it looks like it might be possible to send emails to other people through your contact us screen.
I did run your IP through a blacklist scanner - They are clean, which is good news, a lot of times if a server is being abused you'll show up on a few lists.
That means that your MTA is not set to reject mail based on SPF failure or that it only does so with the proper _dmarc record.
Looking over the information you posted, your MX and A record are both 85.116.214.97, so your SPF is a little overkill.
If you post the code for that section, we can see if that's what's being abused.
I looked at your contact us page on your website, I'm guessing this is where the Feedback is sent from?
My SPF record is v=spf1 a mx ip4:185.116.214.97 -all which should work so HOW in the world was this possible?
