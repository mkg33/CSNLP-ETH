It automatically reads the log files of your system, searches for multiple failed login attempts and blocks the malicious clients for a configurable time via iptables...
After installing rsyslog these errors disappeared from my console: apt-get install rsyslog
You get these messages because there are many failing login attempts via ssh on your system.
It seems the above analysis is not completely correct.
If this is the case, you shoud consider installing a tool like 'fail2ban' (sudo apt-get install fail2ban on Ubuntu).
It is realy anoying when I am working over ssh and these errors keep popping up all over my screen.
I have vps that I use to run a webserver on, it currently runs ubuntu server 12.04.
It doesn't, which I think is a bug (which I just reported with openssh).
There doesn't seem to be a retry= option for pam authentication (I did find one for pam_cracklib, but that only concerns changing password in the "password" section, not authentication in the "auth" section of pam).
After 3 retries, pam returns the PAM_MAXRETRIES error code to inform sshd of this.
Could someone please tell me what these errors mean.
While the other answers are correct in elimiating the error message you got, consider that this error message may just be a symptom of another underlying problem.
sshd should really stop trying in this case, regardless of its own MaxAuthTries.
Instead, pam_unix contains a builtin maximum number of retries of 3.
There may be someone trying to brute-force into your box (was the case when I got the same messages on my system).
After upgrading from Debian 6 to Debian 7, i ran into the same troubles.
In my case, the problem was that rsyslog was not installed anymore after the Debian upgrade.
Since a few weeks I keep getting a lot of errors in my ssh console.
Until that bug is fixed, it seems that setting MaxAuthTries to <= 3 is the only way to prevent this message from showing up.
