If your public key is id_rsa.pub, your private key is probably named id_rsa.
According to the documentation I've read ~/.ssh is the correct directory as the jenkins user for this file to exist.
I can do a clone with my jenkins user just fine and it doesn't mention the host at all as jenkins user.
You can either copy the corresponding private key to the jenkins ~/.ssh directory as well, or you can generate a new keypair for your jenkins user and import that public key in bitbucket.
Had to login as the jenkins user and do a git clone again, this added the bitbucket url again to known hosts.
You should have the private key there, not just the public key.
I've got an ssh key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub when I login as the jenkins user.
I've imported this into bitbucket correctly and it has accepted the key.
I assume you copied this public key from some other system (perhaps your local desktop)?
When I try to do a git clone (to the correct URL) I still get....
The actual problem appeared to be the bitbucket server wasn't in my list of known-hosts.
EDIT : My jenkins user does not have a known_hosts file in ~/.ssh but my root level ones do - should it?
Does anyone know of a reason why this would occur?
