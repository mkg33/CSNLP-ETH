Maybe someone here knows if a driver (or its default configuration)
Particularly, after the RTL card has been successfully detected (like you state).
and reboot with PuppyLinux to find that the Ethernet port remains in a link-down state.
Alternatively (or if miitool/ethtool are of no help) you might need to figure out real manufacturer of the card (which is NOT realtek) and use their DOS config utility to change PHY setting.
If the card has other than TP connector (or even if it is set to full-duplex) you might need to use ethtool and/or mii-tool (both included on ubuntu live-cd) to make the PHY to work in 10baset/half duplex
First, check that your linux see everything connected by using the command "ethtool eth0" - you'll have to do this as root.
Presumably you can actually shutdown from your network connected XP system
I would expect compatibility or configuration problems to surface as
If not, you may need to assign one, or set the box into DHCP mode so that it can request an address.
This card has NO DMA thus it will load CPU fully when working at 10Mbps.
You could probably update your question with the RTL card details from that.
an inability to dial-up your ADSL connection -- not as a physical link-state problem.
I would suggest you ask admins at work if thwy have some Intel or DEC/Tulip 100Mbps cards, if they have no more - go and buy a RTL8111/8168 based Gigabit card at 5-10$ - they may not be perfect for gigabit on server but for 100Mbps they do all checksum offload with DMA for 100Mbps.
The next thing I would suspect is that Linux is not setting the port up for DHCP.
When you bring up the linux box, check on the ethernet port with "ifconfig" - it should tell you many things, including the IP address of the port.
As a next step maybe you could get some diagnostic information out for reference.
