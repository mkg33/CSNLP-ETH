Snort is great for intrussion detection but it is not so much a connectivity tool as it is a security tool.
MRTG is an excellent program that for stuff like monitoring your routers, switches etc.
The question about how you intend to measure the internet traffic.
One decent internet monitoring tool is Snort (http://snort.org).
I will suggest a couple of options since I do not know your specific target scenario.
It is free and it has the ability to monitor a great many things.
It will connect to the SNMP port of your router and you should be able to get all kinds of useful data about your connection at that point.
Now if you are trying to monitor your internet connection to see who you are talking to, you can always use the "Netstat" command from the command line or you can use TCPView from sysinternals to show you visually what your system is talking to over the wire.
NetLimiter has a good real-time display of upload/download speeds
It provides nice intrusion detection and can monitor the traffic hitting the internet quite nicely.
Another good application that does this is MRTG...
