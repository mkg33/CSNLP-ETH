Looking at Mystery files, "not a directory", I found someone with a similar problem.
I have the same symptom from a CentOS client on a CIFS mounted resource.
The trailing / denotes that you would like to delete the contents beyond the symlink
That CentOS is a guest on VirtualBox on a Windows 7 host, but that should not matter because the network device is virtualized in this scenario, and not the file system or storage device.
I don't have ssh privileges to that machine, but I can FTP.
They were able delete the "mystery file" by ssh'ing into the machine that was doing the sharing and delete the file from there.
For me, the problem is related to whether the target of the symlink exists at the point in time where you try to remove the symlink.
I tested it on a local filesystem and on a network filesystem (NFS) and it worked.
My CIFS client is a CentOS 7, using the cifs-utils package.
My CIFS server is a Synology NAS box with DSM 5.2, with symbolic link support enabled in its CIFS/SMB options.
The same test when performed on a local file system, works fine (i.e.
I guess the problem was a combination of Samba and bad ln calls.
If the target does not exist, removing the symlink fails.
I managed to solve this, even though I don't fully understand how or what really went wrong.
(Only the last few lines - starting from 'unlink' or 'newfstatat' are needed.)
