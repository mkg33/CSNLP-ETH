Amongst other things there's a rather nice live graphical display showing the current traffic in and out, with each machine's IP address displayed.
Install the Squid one first, configure it as transparent, and then install the reporting packages.
I need to find a solution to monitor, in real-time, the traffic currently used by an office of about 25 peoples.
We already have Zenoss for SNMP monitoring, but I'm looking more at something that would tell me who is using most of the bandwidth "right now".
Something similar to this interface: ClearOS Network Traffic Report
A linux proxy running squid will do what you need.
If you're using Squid with PFSense (and I strongly suggest you do, in transparent mode it has almost no downsides), it can give you a real-time traffic log along with historical reports.
On the downside, the historical logging isn't as useful, except for the data for the firewall's own interfaces.
Since ClearOS has this functionality, it must not be very hard to reproduce, yet I can't seems to find it in things like PFsense or in Cisco Small business routers.
If you're only after instant monitoring and not historical, I'm fairly sure there's a PFSense package for that too (without installing Squid), but I can't remember its name off the top of my head.
We use Smoothwall for our firewall and it has this kind of thing standard.
Squid even supports SNMP so you should be able to get this info into your Zenoss dashboard.
I find it very handy for locating torrent downloaders on the network.
