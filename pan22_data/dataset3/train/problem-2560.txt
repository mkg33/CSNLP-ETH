I'm hoping it's counting and verifying the RAM, but I'd expect to see some output from the BIOS or maybe a beep or something.
Try booting the laptop with only one module installed at a time, swapping out with each success until you get a failure.
According to this post on the Lenovo forum, you can install an odd number of DIMMs, but if you have three, two should be under the keyboard and one on the back.
If the machine doesn't POST with a certain module, you've got your dead stick.
Many machines can't support having an odd number of RAM modules installed, and that could be what you're experiencing here.
I have a Lenovo W530 that had a single 8G RAM stick under the keyboard.
I can hear a faint hum, maybe from the hard disk or a fan, but it's not doing anything and the screen is blank.
Also make sure the speed of the new RAM matches the speed of the old.
If so, you need to wait for the last module to arrive before you can install them.
So you must have 2 or 4 sticks of RAM installed, 3 will not work.
First, you should check the documentation on your laptop to see what kind of RAM configurations it supports.
When I power on the computer, the disk spins up briefly and the camera light turns on.
Am I not waiting long enough or do I need to add a stick under the keyboard?
On the bottom of the laptop, there is a panel you can remove, and I installed 2 more 8G sticks, for a total of 24.
If your laptop does support asymmetric RAM configurations, you could have a bad stick on your hands.
I've waited about 15 minutes so far before I took out the memory.
