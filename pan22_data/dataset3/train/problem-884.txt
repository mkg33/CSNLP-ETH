Simply changing your DNS server doesn't necessarily avoid a content block (though in some cases it does).
Both DNS and web traffic is commonly intercepted invisibly (DNS for filtering, web for caching and/or filtering).
I am able to access these sites using an anonymous proxy though.
More than likely, your service provider (or anyone in your network path) are running some sort of filtering tool.
I get a blank web page when I try to open certain websites.
For instance, when I try to open the site, http://imgbox.com
I have tried accessing the site using a Perl Script as well and again the same response.
A quick Google search shows that imgbox.com hosts adult content so this is likely the case.
Either it has to be an issue with my ISP's DNS Server or the Web Server itself is filtering the request.
I have even tried setting my Primary DNS Server to the Google Public DNS: 8.8.8.8 but again the same problem.
Very likely though you were hosting content they deemed unacceptable and have blocked your IP so by changing it you should be back up and running.
However, I am able to access this site via a proxy.
Only two possibilities but to narrow things down if you can, change your IP Address by resetting your modem (verify its changed) and see if you can access imgbox now.
This can be done anywhere in your path to the Internet (at your home router, at your ISP, etc.
Of course if it still doesnt work it doesnt mean they aren't blocking you since they can still block a whole network but at least it tells us something.
Also, I was able to open the site imgbox.com properly a few days ago without a proxy.
