I highly doubt that google is resolving that address for him.
If internal only, then no public DNS will ever resolve the address for c206.hsr.ch.
Therefore I would conclude, in your VPN you are using another DNS, an internal one.
Look for multiple DNS server entries in working PCs.
Please connect to the VPN and run the commands ping, nslookup, host and traceroute (like in the OP) and provide us with the output.
You could try digging deeper into the network configurations of working PCs for more details.
MS Active Directory provides DNS; maybe your Windows-using classmates resolve the address with the help of Active Directory (?).
Ask the IT support if an internal DNS server exists.
I believe he has another DNS entry in his configuration (one can often enter two DNS servers in a network configuration).
My provider also does not have a DNS entry for c206.hsr.ch, so we can assume your target host is on an internal school network only.
You mention in a comment that another classmate uses google-DNS successfully.
I assume the PCs which work in the WLAN have a second DNS entry of the internal DNS server.
