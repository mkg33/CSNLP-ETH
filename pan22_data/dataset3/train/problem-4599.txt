There is always a fine line between protecting from errors and hindering work.
By not doing the same with test systems, the distinction is very, very clear.
Although I am a dedicated admin, our organization is small enough so it is not practical to implement all the extra overhead and red tape that big enterprises like to have to keep their production safe.
One thing I've seen implemented is to use an "intermediary" terminal server between your operational network and your production network, so any changes have to be done (for production systems) when in a terminal services session.
My main methods for doing this are as you stated, changing the colour of the background, changing the layout, making it significantly different to the development server.
Another thing you can do is change the password on the production server to something that you have to think about to input, that way you are conscious that you are logging on to the production server.
Another method I have seen used in other companies is to actually have a method for promoting work from development to production, using a web interface or batch script, so that you don't actually work on the production server, but just promote work when it is ready.
