err:mshtml:init_xpcom NS_InitXPCOM2 failed: 80004005
When I run the program through wine, it prompts me to install Gecko which I do.
I'm currently trying to get a windows compiled program to work through Wine to run on Linux and MacOSX.
err:mshtml:HTMLDocument_Create Failed to init Gecko, returning CLASS_E_CLASSNOTAVAILABLE
I'm using Wine 1.1.34 and a similar bug was supposedly fixed in 1.1.33
winetricks is my favorite wine tool and allows you to fix large array of problems.
Later on in the program, it attempts to use MSHTML to render HTML but I get these error messages on my console instead.
I've been at this all afternoon, is there anything I'm missing?

If this is a .NET application, you'll need to use mono to run it.
So if you type "wine iexplore.exe" does it open up the wine version of internet explorer (gecko)?
Even with winetricks wine doesn't support com so creating the com component will cause this error.
