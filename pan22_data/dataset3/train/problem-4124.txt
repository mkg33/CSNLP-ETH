"The colo support said something that ICMP traffic is deprioritised on their routers and that is expected...
My guess is that it starts off something like this:
What should I ask or what can I do on my side to prove the point?
After getting down-voted a couple of times I stopped.
I can tell becuase the service I consume sends me local timestamps.
Surely many of you were in the situation like this.
You might consider setting up response measurements from the co-located server to "near" (within the co-lo) and "far" (outside/beyond the co-lo) samplings too.
I pinged the IP address which is immediate hop to my box and it shows jumps in ping times.
That will provide more information as to what may actually occurring within the co-lo and/or its connectivity.
I am getting weird cyclical lags - several times a minute latency jumps and then gradually drops back.
I used to tell people posting here that pinging across the internet was not reliable because ICMP was low priority.
I told that to the colo support and they said they see nothing.
I synced with local Stratum 2 and normally bias between my local time and the remote server is +-2ms.
What would you guys do to make the colo admins to do something about it?
W2008_R2_server ------  Switch ------  Router ------  ???
It is commonplace for ICMP traffic to have low priority.
I just have no experience and I am not system admin anyway.
It is not at all clear to me what the configuration is that you are having difficulty with.

the remote server is firewalled and I cant ping it to provide MTR to the end-point.
The remote server synced with Stratum 1 with atomic clock and very precise.
