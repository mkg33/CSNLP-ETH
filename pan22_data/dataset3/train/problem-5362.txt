You're invoking the masquerade after you've gone through all of the network stack except the last bit, and this is the last thing you're doing before the packet goes out the door.
If this is the case, your source constraint was already applied earlier and you don't need to duplicate it.
Now I am adding OpenVPN for roaming devices to this VPS.
There may be performance concern for having more general rule.
One installation for the VPN guide suggests adding this MASQUERADE rule -
I understand the principle of "better safe than sorry", but is there really anything to worry about?
So this packet has already managed to convince your system it's safe to send outbound.
Situation: A VPS already serving web pages via nginx.
If there are no bad side effects, I would prefer to use the more general rule, then I wouldn't have to worry about it when changing VPN configurations.
Either you are letting things forward through your computer you don't want, or you will come up with a very limited set - like maybe localhost and your VPN.
Yet browsing around I see many examples of this more general rule -
The more generic one will apply to ALL packets leaving your system (including locally generated ones) and this may (or may not) increase the load on your VPS.
The one which restricts MASQUERADE to only packets with certain source addresses will just do that.
