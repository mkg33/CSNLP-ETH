There are 2 "sockets" in each connector, so if you really, really want to connect USB2 cable into a USB3 socket you have to match pins manually:
This would be fine and dandy but this motherboard only has two USB2 headers and they're already occupied by my case front panel USB pin blocks.
Looking at pinouts and discussions online, it seems like it could work if I connect the USB2 pin block to the first 9 pins of the USB3.0 header, though I'm afraid of frying the wireless card, motherboard, or both.
However, there are at least two USB3.0 headers free on the motherboard; can I just connect this internal cable to a USB3 header?
And even if they were compatible the physical connectors are not - the spacing between pins is different.
This is a dangerous procedure so if you don't know what you're doing just buy a separate controller and use that.
Some sites even say that the USB3.0 motherboard header isn't standard, and can vary in pinout depending on manufacturer!
This board comes with a wifi/bluetooth card that goes into a PCIe x1 slot... but the card also wants to be connected to the motherboard through an internal USB cable:
If I can't do this, then is there a way to 'split' my existing USB2 motherboad headers?
On page 33 of the motherboard's manual you can find the pinouts for both USB2 and USB3.

I've been working on my new PC build with the GA-Z77X-UD5H-WB WIFI motherboard.
