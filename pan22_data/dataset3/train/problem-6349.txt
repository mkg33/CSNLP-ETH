I have a i7-2600k processor and am leaning heavily towards the Asus P8Z68 Deluxe motherboard, with one of the main considerations being the LucidLogix Virtu technology, and being able to use both Quick Sync and a discrete card for Eyefinity.
I found this review, which is current, that suggests that using the virtu technology in D mode did not provide any performance gain from the Intel GPU, and introduced a lot of potential driver issues.
I know that this configuration is supposed to work fairly well and the setup should be straight forward.
(Ie has anyone got this setup and run some benchmarks?)
Can anyone advise what sort of performance can be expected compared with running the discrete card flat out?
They didn't note a performance loss in D mode, though there was a dramatic one in I mode (no surprise there).
I have set up Eyefinity 3 monitor on an i7-870 with a ATI 5770 in the past as part of a display and am planning a new system for the near future.
If I don't find more direct evidence to support the Intel Quick Sync performance gain, I may personally opt for a p67.
