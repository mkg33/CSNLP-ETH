An extension called "(E)RSPAN" allows the same across several layers of switches.
"Broadcast domain" only applies to traffic which actually is broadcast – most of it is not.
I read that it can sniff only in local segment and often it is referred as collision domain.
The collision domain for a switch is each single port therefore you can only sniff your traffic.
Some gray-area methods can be used, such as ARP spoofing, to trick another host into sending you the data directly.
Of-course, where that computer is a router, it gets all traffic going through it.
That's correct – with a switch, you will only see traffic belonging to you (plus broadcasts and multicasts).
Where you use a packet sniffer on a computer connected to an ethernet switch it can typically only see traffic going to and from that computer.
I don't think a "collission domain" is an appropriate term when talking about a switched network (but would apply to hubs and wifi networks).
Many managed switches have a dedicated "Mirror port" feature (also called "SPAN") which copies someone else's traffic to you.
