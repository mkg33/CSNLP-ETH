Functions are typed alongside parenthesizes, where in the arguments if any are listed in between.
A formula starts with an = sign, such as =(D1+D2)/A$3.
Additional functions can be defined using Visual Basic.
A formula is statement written by the user to be calculated.
For example, if you enter =AVERAGE(A1:A56), that is a formula, using the AVERAGE function.
They are similar in that both return a result based on the calculations that each performs.
The difference is that a function is a built-in calculation, while a formula is a user-defined calculation.
A function is a piece of code designed to calculate specific values and are used inside formulas.
If you enter =SUM(G4+A5) - 25 * MIN(B3:B6), that is a formula which uses both the SUM function and the MIN function, as well as standard mathematical operators (-, +, *).
A formula can contain values, references to cells, defined names, and functions.
A formula (also known as an equation) is something that the user defines, and can use/refer to various functions in it.
Formulas can be as simple or as complex as the user wants.
A function is a built-in operation, such as SUM(), AVERAGE(), etc.
Functions to sum values, calculate a trigonometric cosine, and to calculate the current time are built into excel.
