I'm having little weird problem with Apache web server.I created 3 virtual host for my web server.
Put the entry into hosts file, created root directory for them in /var/www/html/ and created index.html file as test page.
Extra Note: Do not mix "Allow" with "Require", if you are using 2.4, use only Require where appropiate.
In the subdirectory you show it is finding an index.html file it is showing you so.
But i want to know why when i call for particular page instead of loading index.html apache shows "Index of /"
You are inheriting "Options Indexes" from a previous directory, and that previous directory is which is for directory listing:
And as you can see in your own screenshot the file in your documentroot screenshot is called "index" not index.html so that's why Apache not finding a index.html file is showing you a directory listing.
here is my hosts configuration as they are in different files with .conf
Now what is actually happening is that whenever i call for anyone of the page I'm getting "Index of /" with directory of pages that i have created.But when i click on anyone directory the index.html page is loaded and displaying the page.So page is working fine.
