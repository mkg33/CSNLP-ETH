Google Chrome without rendering issues, but small controls

And click OK. Screenshots below from the reported issue.
When the problem still persisted, I found these options, in the Display tab of the control panel.
I had already done the compatibility fix mentioned in the answer below.
Chrome doesn't offer support for retina at the moment:
The options shown in the image, will turn up only after u check the "Let me choose one scaling level for all my displays" checkbox
This will render the fonts correctly, but all of the controls in the "omnibar" (back, forward, reload) are extremely small.
In addition to disabling the scalining on high DPI devices you should adjust the scaling of web content inside of chrome.
This appears to be a bug (reported in Google Code here and here) within Google Chrome currently, having to do with Windows using display scaling when a MacBook Retina (if you're using high-DPI modes and display scaling at 150% or higher, which is the default).
Settings -> show advanced settings -> web contents (175% works on well for me)
Although coming at a slight compromise, you can disable display scaling for Google Chrome specifically.
Won't make the omnibar or favorites bar any bigger but it will scale pages really well.
In my case, adjusting the size settings, fixed the issue.
