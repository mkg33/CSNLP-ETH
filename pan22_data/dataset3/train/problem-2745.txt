This company has it's own IT Department witch provides Financial Software tools and all other ERP-Like tools for this company.
also they don't want to use other software tools and want to remain in the current software and database solutions.
of course any simplified and tutorial based approach suggestion will be appreciated.
How is it possible to monitor an Sql-server database to prevent any intended manipulation by database admin?
This question rises from a dispute between "Financial Department" and "IT Department" in a Production Company.
the solution must be in a way that insures the system works fine but any manipulation by system admin will be traceable for financial department and system admin will not be able to erase his/her manipulation traces.
Because the IT Department itself is part of this company actually the salary of software developers and database admin is calculated and paid through the software and databases designed and maintained by themselves.
so the financial department is feared of database manipulation by the system admins.
