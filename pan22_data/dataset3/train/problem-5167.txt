I can vouch for Acer Revos (as a HTPC in my case), but you can probably find something cheaper that will work fine for your needs.
Touch screens are simply using your finger as a mouse.
Basically test it and see if you can run multiple instances and if it can, you may be able to do it.
I recommend instead getting a bunch of cheap nettop PCs and throwing Linux on them so they're not annoyingly slow to use.
You might get the occasional "weirdness" with multiple touches at the same time.
So it depends on your application; can you run multiple instances of it at the same time?
Possible with Linux (check out multiheading), but I suspect it's more trouble than it's worth.
Although...this does bring up the question of whether you can have multiple simultaneous mice.
Would it make sense to run a seperate VM for each monitor - with the VM set to load full screen?
With multiple low end systems at least you have a working node while repairing the other one.
Certainly with Linux its possible - the X Window system was designed around exactly that kind of operation although it will probably be significantly simpler to use X-Terminals rather than driving all the screens directly from the host machine (a X-Terminal requires very litle hardware - a gumstick PC is more than adequate).
You'll be well off the beaten path, and likely to find things that only work under specific conditions and/or are unstable.
Also, keep in mind that if you have 2 monitors and 2 instances on one system and that system crashes/acts odd/dies, you lose everything.
It also depends on how the application works (if it uses a database in the background or a particular config file, again, it depends on how it does it, it may not be able to have concurrent access for running instances).
I have applications will, and I have some that detect it's already open and refuse to open a separate instance.
