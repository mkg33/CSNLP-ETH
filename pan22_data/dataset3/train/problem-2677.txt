A client OS will live with the disc being stuck for a minute.
Your biggest risk right now is if another drive in the RAID fails.
Or, that it scanned SMART status of the disk and came back with an imminent failure.
The only specific risk I am aware of from using a different brand for the new drive is if it turns out not to be exactly the same size, but rather be slightly smaller than the current drives.
The more you delay the replacement, the greater the risk of data loss is.
Formatting the drive you removed from the RAID was not a clever move.
Using a bigger drive should be no problem, but may be pretty hard to find.
If you have another drive failure, you'll be faced with a data recovery task, which would have been a lot easier, if you had not formatted that drive.
For higher reliability I would recommend RAID6 or using a hot spare.
Taking the drive out, reading the SMART status from the drive, and reading the data from the drive sector by sector, would not be such a bad idea though.
Raid controllers hate drives without - once the drive has an issue.
In any case, when a drive dies from a RAID array, it is normally recommended just to replace it with a new one of the same brand and model.
Adding a hot spare is an easier transition for an existing RAID5, but it does not offer the same protection against data-loss as RAID6 does.
It could be that the controller recognized the disk's serial number and compared it to it's error log.
The SMART status could give a hint why the drive is marked as bad by the RAID.
