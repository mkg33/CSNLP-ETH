We currently have servers with up to 7 shelves but I was told it goes up to 12-14 shelves.
Oracle is on the business of selling storage hardware so I hardly think they want people building their own solutions (the 7000s appliances) with their own software (Solaris).
It doesn't use AVS but I guess that doesn't matter.
I didn't understand the 12TB RAW but the way it works is that the 7410/7420 has a head node (or two for clustering) and you add 24-disk shelves to them.
Take care with OpenSolaris code before the COMSTAR enhancements because in our tests the IOPS was simply to low.
They are not going to shoot their own feet like Sun did.
Option One: out of all proprietary options you'd have, the Oracle ZFS appliances are the ones that lock in the least.
We have a few 7410s with remote replication acting as reliable storage for our Exchange, VMware, Xen and Linux servers with NFS and iSCSI and it works just fine.
You can always drop to the Solaris 5.11 command line and do your send/recv.
You should look at the Oracle Sun Cluster Geographic Edition but I don't think it offers the same functionality that AVS did.
It offers scheduled and/or continous remote replication and the iSCSI support is excellent.
