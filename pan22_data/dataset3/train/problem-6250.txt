If you are looking to use ROOT on your system - this link may help you a little bit:  http://snowleopardtips.net/tips/enable-root-account-in-snow-leopard.html
Of course - you can move them anywhere if needed (may be needed for access to EC2 due to permissions)
In OSX all ssh keys are generally stored under the user/.ssh directory
Alternatively, you can access hidden folders (those whose names begin with a '.'
scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub (or whatever name you gave it)  www.servernameorIPaddress.com:/root/.ssh/authorized_keys2
If you wish to copy the SSH key to another linux/nix based system simply use scp
/) simply use the cd command as you normally would, although bear in mind that only root is likely to have access to /var/root.
From the terminal window simply run:   ssh-keygen -d
In OSX, SSH keys are stored in ~/.ssh/id_dsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa, where ~ is the home folder of the user.
I would suggest always using the -d option when doing the keyGen simply because RSA keys are generally not used in Version 2 of SSH.
I hope that helps - if not feel free to ask for clarification and I will help you along.
In OSX (Linux), how do I get to the SSH keys  with my root directory?
from the Finder by selecting "Go to Folder..." from the "Go" menu and typing the desired path into the input box that comes up.
Bear in mind that you will need to activate the root user before you can log in using it on the client version of OSX.
Be certain you know what you're doing and understand the risks before you enable the root user, especially if you're going to do so on a computer that arbitrary machines will be able to SSH into.
Once complete if you were to browse to your terminal and then once it is opened simply type
Normal users' home folders are generally stored in /Users/, but root's home folder (on OSX; not on Linux) is /var/root.
Chances are since you are asking - YOU MAY NOT HAVE AN SSH KEY GENERATED YET...
In case you get a warning about "UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!
