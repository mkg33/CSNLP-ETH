It appears to be in HKEY_USERS.DEFAULT\CONTROL PANEL\DESKTOP in the registry.
I followed this document, and downloaded "Resource Hacker" (linked on the page) to edit the dll.
To put your favorite image or picture in the background of the logon screen :
You can use use Resource Hacker to copy out the bitmap, and to bring it back in.
The whole box is composed of a bitmap image on top, a little bitmap to the left, and text strings all contained in this dll.
I originally thought you wanted the background too, and gave the same answer as the others, but I think this is what you want.
First, the bitmaps are actually contained within a dll, but the part you are concerned with is not one bitmap image.
The rest is still contained within the msgina.dll, and can also edited using Resource Hacker.
Note that the bitmap only covers the top half of the login box.
The exact bitmap depends on the version, and frankly, I am not which one it is.
To anyone trying this: BACKUP MSGINA.DLL BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING.
I did not check in detail, but this also covers your bonus question too, I believe.

If you are using XP Pro, the image you probably want is in Bitmap>101 or 107.
You can also use HKEY_USERS.DEFAULT\CONTROL PANEL\DESKTOP\TILEWALLPAPER to set tiling on (set it to 1).
