Jeff Erickson will not say this himself, but his online lecture notes are among the best out there to cover the basics of algorithm design at a level that doesn't patronize the reader.
I am looking for a concise introductory text on algorithms with a high ratio $$\frac{\mbox{theory covered}}{\mbox{total number of pages}}.$$ It should begin at the beginning but then progress quickly without spending too much time on real world examples, elementary proof techniques, etc.
it has coverage that is much broader than TCS such as hardware concepts etc, but it appears to cover significant parts of TCS eg:
Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming" would probably be the book with the highest ratio.
There are also many lecture notes and a few Wikibooks on algorithms.
As a research mathematician I have a solid background in mathematics which I happily employ to understand formalisms and condensed proofs, for example.
If you want a more textbook style book then Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein's "Introduction to Algorithms" would be my suggestion to a mathematician.
it is a 902pp abridged version of the complete encyclopedia, Encyclopedia of Computer Science, 4th Edition, 2064pp
try Concise encyclopedia of computer science, Wiley.
This book is intended for those with a heavy math inclination IMHO.
This would go well with Algorithms: Dasgupta & Papdimitrou, I believe.
It will go you a good overview of algorithms with a constant focus on optimization.
I use them in my grad algorithms class, and for a research mathematician, these notes convey the right kind (and level) of intuition, allowing you to fill in the details yourself easily.
unfortunately a complete/thorough table of contents for this ref does not seem to be available on the web [a somewhat unusual omission nowadays, maybe Wiley could correct this on request] but the complete index appears to be browsable on amazon.
I'd go for Combinatorial Optimization: Theory and Algorithms - Korte & Vygen.
