If I get a Blue Screen of Death, I won't be able to investigate why
So in other words, if I get a Blue Screen of Death, I won't be able to investigate why, just because I put my paging file at a more efficient location.
Is there a workaround to having my paging file on a separate drive and still get error dumps?
I've got a secondary harddrive (a separate physical device, not a logical partition) specifically dedicated for the Virtual Memory paging file.
Can anybody give me a less nonsense explanation for this?
The drive is 3.5x larger than my RAM, so it's plenty large.
You can configure the dump file location independently of the page file location.
I don't want to have to tell Windows, "Sure, go ahead and continue managing a paging file on the primary drive," just so I can get a debug dump, as that totally defeats the purpose of a physically separated paging file.
The best explanation I can find from searching the web is that Windows just doesn't want to make error dumps on a drive separate from the operating system location.
When I configure Windows 7's virtual memory to put the paging file on this second harddrive and not the same drive as the operating system, I'm warned,
