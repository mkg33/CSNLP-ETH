When the scanf fails, the program should not continue.
I have re-indented your code, I do not know how your code is on your side but you should definitly indent it properly.
I changed the text messages, so that they don't contain unnecessary brackets.
Is it a good habit to add some documentation telling what your code is supposed to do.
Instead of leaving these statements in the code, you should write unit tests.
isPerfectSquare would probably be easier for everyone to understand.
Most of the empty lines in your code are unnecessary.
I changed the return type to int, since that is the required return type since the year 1989.
In your case, it could be nice to also tell the reader how it works.
There should not be an extra newline and space in front of the word Enter.
You wrote a colon at the end of the line, which suggests that some text follows.
I changed the return type to bool, since the function either returns true or false.
I also removed the printf statement, since that has been only for debugging.
