Having a 4 GB page file will not cause extra wear and tear, however, that does seem excessive for 256 MB of RAM.
But why invest in more memory if you feel the performance is accetable?
As expected the PC became slower however when I tried to increase the page file to min 4GB max 4GB it become quite fast again to an acceptable level.
You would be better off investing in a new machine.
You might actually have an issue finding memory for your machine at a reasonable price.
Granted it isn't as fast as RAM but you shouldn't notice the difference.
I've a 10+ year old XP PC which surprisingly still works however one of the 256MB RAM finally died.
Get a further possible improvement by using a defrag utility first, then run the SysInternals' PageDefrag tool.
A fragmented paging file causes a lot more disk head seeks and that's slow.
The only way your machine could have gotten faster is by the paging file getting relocated to a less fragmented part of the disk when you changed its size.
You can most likely reduce it to 1 GB and be just fine.
It matters a great deal since you'll be using the paging file a lot more frequently with this little RAM.
