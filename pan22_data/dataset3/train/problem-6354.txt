Does the IIS handler mapppings have an entry for .vbhtml?
Does anybody know how to do this, or where I might find a good tutorial?
I don't want to use the WebMatrix Web Deploy feature or anything, I'd rather just move the files over manually and have them run.
You could also publish locally and then move those files across manually.
I have to migrate the project over to a local server running IIS to deploy it.
My understanding is that you don't have to build your solution with this method, as you do with ASP.
I find it works quite well in most small development servers.
There's no current programmer, so I've used what knowledge I have to build a new feature using MebMatrix Razor VB.NET pages and our current SQL Server database.
I use the Publish solution, File Copy option and push to a shared drive for deployment.
I assume that IIS just needs to be configured to process .vbhtml file extensions.
With version 6.0 there are some special configurations needed.
I've come into a company that has been using asp.net for some web applications stored on our local servers.
