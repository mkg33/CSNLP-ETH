Hi everyone, I'm trying to create an effect like this, the underwater effect (water distortion).
And you would have much more flexibility with shader (for example - add shading somewhere).
For fixed graphics pipeline this effect is only possible via grid distortion.
If you can't, you can always dive deeper into the engine to see how those effects are made and create your own effect.
Play around with those effects and see if you can get close.
I've looked around and I've seen references to "water caustics" but I'm not sure how to create this in Cocos2d or if it's done with obj-c only.
Here's an old Youtube video showcasing these effects and others (you may want to mute the sound, though).
While I don't think they'll give you what you're asking for out of the box, you should definitely check out these two classes because they might be able to get you something very close.
If you use Cocos2d 1.x version, take a look at Joe D answer.
It's easy to do this effect in fragment shader (offset texture coordinates by some function of x, y and time).
