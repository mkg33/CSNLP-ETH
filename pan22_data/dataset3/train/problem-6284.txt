Each machine will have a single purpose, and security is a priority.
At the first installation, I am confronted with this:
I am exploring CentOS as a possibility for hosting a number of servers (mail, web, database, etc).
Would like to add my bit of findings and what really helped me.
It seems that these security profiles are created as a matter of legal compliance, audits, and business concerns foremost, rather than being defined strictly in terms of security itself.
As well as each server instance having a single function, they will be non-graphical terminals with ssh access.
These policies are about reporting that certain configuration declarations exist and are not being violated, which is somewhat orthogonal to actual security concerns.
Furthermore, use of them without understanding what they do will cause confusing behavior.
Information about these policies is here but it's a bit overwhelming.
I was also searching for a direct explanation which is short and to the point.
These two sentences were enough to cure me of the paranoia.
And I turned off the security policy and moved ahead with the next steps.
Presumably not all such things translate exactly to CentOS, but I'm an Ubuntu user so I don't really understand the extent of the equivalence.
The aim of this profile is to check security and audit settings that improve security level of the system without being intrusive to practical usability.
To add to discussion, an alternative to default policy, which won't do anything to your system, is to select Standard Profile.
What's the best option for "I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing just get but for now I want to be paranoid"?
