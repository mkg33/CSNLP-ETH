For the OS, just set each one to automatically download and install all updates.
What other options do I have for making this task as painless as possible?
For a lot of common software packages, check out Ninite.
You can set the time and day it applies any updates, if you need to get specific about it.
Splitting OS & user data sounds like a heck of a lot of pain to me, using AD you can have your users' data stored on the server, roaming profiles & folder redirection will make your users much happier, their data will be transparently stored on the server and easy to back up.
If you want this to be painless, then Active Directory is exactly what you are looking for.
I'm looking for suggestions on how to best manage a group of 5-10 Windows 7 PCs.
My primary concern is making sure the OS and applications stay up-to-date.
I've found instructions for splitting the OS & user volumes, but somehow I doubt this is realistic.
Keep the user account as a standard account, so that they have to ask you to make changes and you know what's on each one.
For some additional peace of mind, have 2 accounts on each workstation: 1 user account and 1 administrator account, and put a password on both.
Any software not on their list will have to be manually updated (or some other solution).
My ideal solution would be to partition separate system and user volumes, then periodically push out an updated image containing all the updates.
Wouldn't the system partition need to know about the user logins?
Deploying new images will be simple, as you've no local data to worry about.
I'd rather not have a Windows server but would consider it if necessary.
You can create a group of programs that you want installed and kept current from the available programs.
