The involved field strengths are orders of magnitude lower than those of cellphone communication.
In particular if there is Internet coverage using mobile services.
If you want to get paranoid about the effects of electromagnetic fields, at least get paranoid about the largest offenders first.
Those can cause high-frequency acoustic noise, just like CRT-based television sets did.
One thing you need to consider with all the anecdotal "evidence" is that people being able to detect whether a Wifi device is on or not might not actually do so based on the electromagnetic emissions of Wifi itself.
So putting some walls/doors between your Wifi routers (and other things with switching power supplies) and your child, while not doing much for the actual Wifi signal strength, may still improve its sleep.
Routers are one of many devices using typically semi-cheap power supplies.
You'll do much more for your child's sleep if you switch your mobile phone off (yes, off, turning it silent does nothing) and thus keep it from talking with the next cell tower several times an hour.
Whether or not Wifi may have an impact is pretty irrelevant as long as people are allowed to use cell phones in your vicinity.
This kind of stuff is hard to trace without special equipment since most microphones, particularly good ones, roll off beyond the standard audible frequencies, and that's actually good for the quality of digital recordings since it decreases sampling artifacts.
Children have quite better hearing at higher frequencies.
If you are sensitive to that, it may well cause headaches and annoyance.
