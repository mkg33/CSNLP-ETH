Now in Sheet 2 I want column A to equal the Sheet 1 Column A if that value is even.
So I'd want A1 to be empty, but A2 to equal 2, and so on.
For example, I have Sheet 1, and inside this sheet I have Column A with the following data, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (A1 = 1, A2 = 2, etc.)
If not, can you be more specific in your description so we can better help you out.
I know how to define the criteria, but I do not know how to set up the rest of the formula.
Go back to Sheet 2 and you'll notice that it auto-updated as you entered in Sheet 1.
When a new row is added to TABLE1 in SPREADSHEET1, I want select data from that row to be pulled and automatically added to the information to TABLE2, but only IF it follows certain criteria.
Just use the reference in an IF statement, or whatever your criteria is.
Now go back to Sheet 1 and continue filling in the sequence up to 20.
You will see that A1 is blank, A2 is 2, A3 is blank, A4 is 4, and so on up until A10 is 10.
Then put your cursor at the bottom right hand corner (until you see the the little black +), and click and drag down until however many rows, say 500.
