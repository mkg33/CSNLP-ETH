Depending on your proxy, that Anonymous entry in the log file could just be the initial request from the browser before it knows it has to provide proxy authorization.
In addition to what everyone else already stated about subverting your proxy...
As long as you are monitoring from an appropriate point on the network you'll see what traffic is bypassing the proxy and where its going.
"Getting around the proxy" =/= "hacking the proxy".
(And as someone who believes logging browsed pages is evil, I do know quite a few ways to do that.)
If the HTTP response code for that entry is 407 (proxy authorization required) then this is probably the case, and should be followed pretty quickly by another authenticated request (assuming the client has authorization) for the same resource from the same IP.
They might have just used their own proxy for that.
Why not use something like Wireshark to see what is moving on the network?
Your servers would only see the user connecting to his own remote system.
If it's not followed by another request for the same resource from the same IP then it's possible that the client just bailed on the session prompted for proxy authentication.
