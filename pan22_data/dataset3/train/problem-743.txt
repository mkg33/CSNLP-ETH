It looked and worked much like those used for cigarette packets and the like seen in many stores.
Some of those will work with LTO cartridges and are a whole lot cheaper than the "professional" racks.
This worked pretty well, assuming you trust whoever's transporting the tapes for you (or you do it yourself.)
We now use an offsite, fireproof, data-rated safe as suggested above, but in a previous job, we used a secure offsite data storage service.
Of course there's no reason such a rack couldn't be built or placed into something else, such as a fire rated safe.
Cut out (or otherwise remove) the long divider and the tapes should rest easily in the tray standing up right.
we swapped them out once a week in a 4 week rotation.
I want to say old ice trays (you know from before the fridge had ice in the door).
They're basically just book cases with a lot of shelves.
One with the shelves tilting back a little would probably be nicer because they won't fall out if you bump one.
The added bonus was that it provided automatic tape cycling, with the one being required being pulled out of the bottom and the old one being placed back on the top of the stack.
We had 4 big plastic storage tubs, with 20 tapes in each tub, eg, an autoloader's worth.
The tapes should be about the same width as the ice cube openings are.
The plastic tubs kept the tapes relatively dust free, too.
We had the option of transporting the tapes ourselves, or Chubb would turn up and do it for us.
This is budget and location dependant, but companies exist that will store your backup tapes offsite and bring you the relevant ones for changing each (day|week|month) and will courier them to you in the event of an emergency situation.
Not really creative, but you might want to consider a fireproof safe (preferably as far away from the server room as possible).
There was something that someone told me they used years ago.
I once made a rack that attached to the side of one of the server racks.
