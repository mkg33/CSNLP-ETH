I don't know what kind of policies exist in your company but before attempting such tunnels make sure you don't break any.
and i could add server2 ip addres and port to firefox proxy's and access ofice network.
or if you really want to use your existing tunnel you could use:
i cant use server1 as a direct proxy from home because its behind firewall.
then in your firefox add localhost and port 3128 as proxy config.
if you really want to be able to enter server2 as a proxy in your client's firefox settings make sure that in server2's sshd_config (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) GatewayPorts is enabled:
what i need is configure server2 so it forwards port server2:3128 to server1:3128
when i log in to server2 ican ssh root@localhost -p 12312
I have two linux boxes(centos 5.5), one in the office(server1) behind firewall, other at colocation(server2)
like this you don't need the configuration of GatewayPorts and only people with a login on server2 can use the tunnel to server1
iwas able to create ssh tunnel from server1 to server2 and
I need create ssh forwarding to other linux box that works as a proxy.
If I understand you correctly you want to connect from your client with a browser to server2, which then tunnels the connection to server1 and thus allows you to access the office net via the squid-proxy installed on server1.
If you do it in the way explained above everyone who can reach server2 (no login required) can use port 3128 as proxy port and thus access your office net (if no other measures are in place)
then instead of your existing tunnel you could use:
also make sure that no blocking iptables rules are in place for the ports you want to use.
just to get the guess work complete I think you used something like
