I've recently started trying to use VirtualBox for my new machine so I can prevent the base OS from any artifacts/etc.
The problem is, I made my Base OS install 20gb, and now with all my dev tools, my differencing disk has filled that - and although everything I google about it says that a snapshot will just keep growing (and I made my original disk to keep growing before making it immutable), it is telling me I am out of room trying to copy new files on it.
I've created a Base OS and removed the drive, marked it as immutable, and created another for development, attached that drive, made a snapshot, changed the drive to the snapshot and marked the snapshot so it won't clear each time.
I haven't got in my UI, however, the checkbox that flags it as a differencing disk - I'm assuming it is one because I am attached to the snapshot and it is saving each time, etc.
Is there a way to make the differencing disk auto-grow/set the size larger than the Base OS immutable disk I started with, or have I missed something?
