Pass the -t option to have a terminal if you want to run interactive commands.
I like to keep a file .bsa somewhere convenient (maybe ~ will work in this case) so I can just .
Then put your favorite configuration files in that .HOME.drew directory.
Insert obligatory grumble about shared accounts, but if you at least have your own ssh key, you can (ab)use the command= option in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
Note that I put line breaks above for legibility, but this actually needs to be all on one line in the authorized_keys file.
For punctual use, you can explicitly source a profile file or run any shell command.
A key with a command option is good only for running the specified command; but the command in the authorized_keys file runs with the environment variable SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND set to the command the user specified (empty for interactive sessions).
Maybe try to hack something together with "LocalCommand" (see man ssh_config)?
If you only want to edit or copy files on the remote machine, you can use a network filesystem such as SSHFS (for unix clients) or Tramp (for Emacs) and work from the comfort of your local environment.
So you can use something like this in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:
