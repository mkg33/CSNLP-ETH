Also in case you are using python, have a look at Tensorflow dropout respectively Keras dropout as they both also offer some sort of documentation as a further reading.
Is there a factor to decide how long and how many epochs are enough to train recurrent networks?
Now that I think about it I wonder what if I continued to train for more epochs and loss of model started to decrease again?
It occurred to me that while training there were sequences of epochs which their loss did change just a little bit(less than 0.005 or so).
If the loss is not changing by a large factor for some number of epoch, we stop training.
• Every time validation error improved, store a copy of the weights
Every time I took this as a sign that my model is not going to be better and stopped training.
Dropout layers try to break dependencies between different Neurons by randomly leaving out Neurons, such that Neurons are (sometimes) encouraged to learn weights / patterns by themselves.
Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting
Thats the whole point behind early stopping, don’t train the network to too small training error.
Generally we track loss on validation set during training.
This is just a small description of a very good paper I would recommend you to read:
Here the large factor and number of epoch are hyper parameters and you need to tune it according to the dataset.
It is always a bit tricky with early stopping but following framework might help.
I've been training several auto encoders containing two GRUs as encoder and decoder during last year.
After early stopping of the first run, train a second run and reuse
• When validation error not improved for some time, stop
