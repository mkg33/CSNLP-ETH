Or fix the software that's got this ludicrous requirement
I would forward the VPN to a windows server from the firewall, have the windows server handle the VPN connections.
The only way to properly do this, if their IP HAS to be the same as their desktop, is for them to RDP onto their desktop over the VPN.
Just be aware you will need to set up a tap tunnel in order to bridge it with your lan and not a tun tunnel, which is routed.
As long as the windows box is in the same subnet, users should receive the same ip's from DHCP within the same subnet as the windows box.
If you need more help on than contact me, I could share with you my working configuration.
There are a lot of examples on the internet apart from the very nice documentation they have in their site.
Doesn't solve your imediate problem but given your title LISP would most definitely  allow for a user to have one ip address in various "zones" although it probably still a bit complex for work/home usage.
