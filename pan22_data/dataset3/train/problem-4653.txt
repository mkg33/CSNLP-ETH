Click the Install button and Boot Camp Assistant will resize your Mac OS X partition and create the new partition for Windows.
Click the Format option to format the partition as NTFS, and then click Continue.
Go through the installer and install Windows on your Mac like you’d install it on any other PC.
You can now divide your Mac’s system drive into two separate partitions — one for Mac OS X and one for Windows.
The Boot Camp Assistant will copy the Windows installation files from an ISO file or physical disc to a USB drive.
Select the partition labeled BOOTCAMP when you reach the Where do you want to install Windows?
When you use Boot Camp to install Windows on your Mac, you’ll need to re-partition your drive.
Windows will install itself on your Mac from this USB drive.
The latest Windows drivers will also be downloaded from Apple and placed on this drive, and they’ll install automatically after you install Windows.
You’ll also need a USB drive at least 8 GB in size.
Your Mac will then restart and boot the Windows installer from the USB drive.
After your Mac finishes creating a USB installation drive, you’ll see the Create a Partition screen.
