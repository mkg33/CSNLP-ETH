I know I could just copy and maintain two DNS servers, but ideally I would like this:
I would like to publish this web server to internal clients as well (clients on the domain corp.local), without them going to the external IP and back.
I have a web site on the address www.corp.com, which actually points to a published server on the domain corp.local.
So I just setup a new zone on the DNS server the internal clients (corp.local) are using called corp.com, and add an entry for www.corp.com, this time pointing to a internal IP address.
Also, I'm running Windows domain with Windows DNS servers (Windows Server 2008).
I have read this article on split-DNS: http://www.isaserver.org/tutorials/You_Need_to_Create_a_Split_DNS.html.
I think I understand the concept, but to set up the optimal solution suggested in the article I need to control the DNS servers on "the outside" (which I cannot in my case).
To my problem: I have a lot of other entries on the external web server which should be left as they are.
Hope I made myself clear, looking forward to your input!
My scenario is as follows: one internal domain called corp.local.
What happens in reality for Case 2 is that the Internal DNS server thinks it is authoritive for the zone corp.com (which it kind of is), and if it does not find a record for someother.corp.com it responds to the client with a negative answer.
