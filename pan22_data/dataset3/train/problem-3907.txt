How to get thumbnail view for Photoshop (.psd) in Windows 7 64 bit OS?
If it doesn't work, consider purchasing Ardfry Imaging's PSD codec.
I've had good results with FastPictureViewer Codec Pack.
If you are looking for a light weight thumbnail viewer then I agree with the user TIm above recommendation of Pictus - it works out of the box even on my Windows 8.1 Professional notebook and took seconds to install.
I am amazed that Adobe have not included anything in their products to allow previewing of PSD files (and other formats) this is a basic requirement for any graphics program and you would think they would have realised this after so many years!
The catch is (as one commenter pointed out) you need to change the file size limit if you're working with files above the default.
Sage Thumbs still works even with 2016 Photoshop CC.
The author notes that it might not work for all documents.
Photoshop saves previews (if enabled), so I don't see why not to check Prefer image file embedded thumbnails and hope this speeds it up regardless of filesize - but I'm unable to confirm for sure.
