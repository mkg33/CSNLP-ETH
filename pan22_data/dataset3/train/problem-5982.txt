Same issue in our Company - we are working via a proxy server for http/s traffic and after adding the FQDN of our Exchange server into the proxy exclusion list on Chrome.
This would cause them to be prompted for their password when opening their profile.
File> Account Settings> Data Files tab> Settings > Connection Tab > Exchange Proxy Settings
Is this issue definitely related to accounts and not PCs?
I would also check to see if the users who are getting prompted are set to use Outlook Anywhere (RPC) and have "On fast networks, connect using HTTP first, then connect using TCP/IP" checked.
If one of these steps works for you, please post what solved it.
I Had this issue and applied the Office 2010 SP1 - it is a known error with Office 32bit on a 64Bit version of windows 7
I've seen this happen before, but it was caused by intermittent DNS issues on a badly set up network; the network was re-wired and reconfigured and it solved the problem, so I couldn't give you the exact change that solved it unfortunately!
I could regurgitate this set of posts, but here is a link that helped me solve this in the past: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/office2010/thread/cd38f3f2-892f-470c-b52e-17b8beeb275e
ie, if you set up one of the new accounts on another PC with their Outlook/Exchange working fine, do you still get the problem?
Close outlook reopen and all was working again, this also fixed my Out of Office issue.

Also, windows logs on the effected computers aren't showing anything relevant?
