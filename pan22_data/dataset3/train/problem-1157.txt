In short, Disk Management says my C: drive is 600GB when in fact it is only 300.
This just adds to the confusion as to where my 300GB of unallocated space went.
Going to the C: drive properties shows that is only 300GB but in Disk Management it says it is nearly 600.
Edit: I just noticed that up top in Disk Management it shows my C: drive as 300GB but in the lower part where it shows partitions as boxes it still says 600.
So I figured now I could just shrink both my Windows and OS X partitions and then merge the unallocated space into a new partition.
I tried to make a GParted Live USB stick using both tuxboot and by burning the iso directly but both get stuck on the message "waiting for /dev to be fully populated".
Does anybody know how to recover the other 300 into unallocated space?
Then I booted into OS X to shrink that partition to 200GB, also worked fine, but it was showing that my Windows partition was still 600GB, not the 300 I shrunk it to.
Anyways, first I got both OS X and Windows partitions up and running, with ~400 GB for OS X and ~600GB for Windows (this was before I decided I wanted a third partition).
I know I could get away with two but I think three will be more organized.
In Windows, I shrunk my partition down top 300GB and it worked fine.
In my PC I currently have a 1TB hard drive that I am trying to make into three partitions: one for Windows, one for OS X, and one as a storage for movies and Steam games, just to keep them separated.
Figuring this was just a bug, I booted back into Windows only to see that my C: drive was back to 600GB, but this time it won't let me shrink it anymore.
