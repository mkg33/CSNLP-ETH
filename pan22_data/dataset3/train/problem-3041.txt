I haven't found any documentation that says you can control connection speeds directly on the Belkin Wireless Router.
If you're living in a fairly dense area there could be other Wireless G networks operating on channel 6.
If not, if you have an old computer lying around you could set that up running IPCop (or similar) and use it to control connection speeds, this will allow all users to have a fair go at using the Internet.
That said, I recently had a problem with my computer disconnecting because of WPA strangeness surrounding TKIP (I think).
You could also try assigning static IPs to all computers on the network (or at least the ones you will be using the most).
To piggyback on one of Ciaran suggestions, you can use inSSIDer to help track strength of signal.
You should look into an app like Kismet and see what channels other networks in the area are operating on and adjust yours accordingly.
Is the Wireless adapter also your Broadband Modem (or do you have a spare)?
The router, and all the PC's connecting need to have the same time.
otherwise part of the wireless security (the TKIP) fails.
that way your packets can be encapsulated over PPOE etc without fragmentation.
Some materials can interfere/disrupt a wireless signal.
One thing which helped was to reduce overheating- turn it off regularly, prop it up so that the vents underneath are more exposed.
Fragmented packets don't work if anything along the way uses a microsft TCP/IP stack.
Also, what kind of materials is your home/office constructed with?
This might meanu making sure the router has NTP enabled.
