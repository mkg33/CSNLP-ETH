I've finally figured out that this only happens when closing gnome-terminal itself (i.e.
I have seen this happen before but it was a problem with disk errors that were happening in increasing frequency.
If it turns out the drive is fine, I would check to see if this file is not surpassing an arbitrary shell history limit.
Additional benefit: you'll get command X in shell 1 in the history of shell 2.
It never happens when using ctrl-D to close the shell, letting the terminal follow.
If I can pin it down well enough, I'll file a gnome-terminal bug report.
My experience was that shells updated the history file at exit time.
Something that might be able to keep that from happening would be to keep pruning the file back to 80 lines or however many commands you want the history to be.
No idea why this happens, but maybe you can circumvent the problem by forcing bash to write to its history file each time it displays a prompt:
Sorry to answer my own question, but none of the other answers really address the problem.
The result of this is that you can get commands coming and going from the history, depending on how other shells started and stopped.
So a shell's initial "history" depended on the most recently exited shell's view of the history.
This will write (-a) and then re-read (-n) the history file each time bash prompts for the next command.
In the meantime, perhaps this will help some other people who get here from google!
file > exit, the 'x' button, alt+F4), and even then generally only when closing several terminals in quick succession.
