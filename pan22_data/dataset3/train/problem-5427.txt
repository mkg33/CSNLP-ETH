Then you can use the finder to copy files to any folder on the Pi as you please.
Just use FileZilla and set a new site from site manager on File Menu.
If you were looking to copy the file or folder world2, this is how I would do it:
Installing MacFusion on your Mac will allow you to mount your Pi over SSH, similar to how you would mount a usb stick on your Mac.
You'd be able to use the -P flag (for --partial --progress), which is handy when you're anticipating a long transfer with potential interruptions - that way the partially-transferred files will be retained (under normal circumstances they're deleted), so that when you resume the transfer, it won't take as long to finish the transfer.
if you can use ssh, then most probably scp (SSH copy) will work as well.
i would install samba anyway, because there are too many winboxen everywhere and the next thing you might need will be the access from windows.
Because without it, it won't perform a recursive copy.
Then select SFTP and fill in with you Rasp username and password and you're good to go.
If you have a lot of files, you might also consider using rsync.
(assuming that world2 is a directory, this command would copy the contents of world2 to the /world2 directory on the remote machine)
