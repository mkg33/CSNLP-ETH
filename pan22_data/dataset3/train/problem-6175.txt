Neither PuTTY or Windows' command line can directly do file transfers without some something additional in place first.
It depends if you want to use PuTTY / Windows CMD to download (pull) the file from your Linux server, or if you want to use a terminal on your Linux server to upload (push) the file to your Windows client.
As it sounds like none of those might be options, the easiest way may be to start a log file on the terminal emulator, cat the file, capture the output and then close the log file - editing out the bit at the top (and maybe bottom) showing the commands manually afterwards.
I'm assuming you're using PuTTY to connect to your Linux server via SSH?
The "best" solutions would imply modifying the server and or Windows box to make this easier (so you can use scp, ftp, SAMBA/Windows File sharing, NFS or similar).
I would like to transfer a text file to c:\tempdir folder on my local pc (running xp-pro)
I am using emulation software to connect to a remote linux server via ssh
If you're pushing/uploading from the Linux server side:
(Try using the program "sz" to initiate a transfer)
I've never used a wyse50 terminal, but was around in the "BBS" days (prior to the wide use of the Internet), and the standard way to do what you are trying to do would be to install a program like "zmodem" on the server (alternatives include "xmodem","kermit","bimodem" among others, but "zmodem is where I would start because it was simple and ubiquitous") and ensure the terminal emulator had support for it, then issue a command to send the program with xmodem and it would be capured to your system.
If you're pulling/downloading from the Windows client side:
I'd be willing to bet this could be made to work if your terminal emulator supports it - and most will.
