I have surfed for some info that has gotten me to the point that I was able to get my Norton to scan, unfortunately, it cannot get its live updates.
The laptop has regained its speed and is virus free.
It appears as a legit pop-up to start an anti-virus program that I have never seen before.
My laptop running old WIndows XP is being viciously attacked by sltpfektssd.exe?
MBAM, download, install it, and update it twice using the update tab.
If it is allowed to get started off of a reboot or logon, it will constantly block starting any program with a pop-up that it is infected.
I switched back to the native Internet Explorer with AVG Free keeping vigilance over my laptop.
It tries to get on the internet so I have my lap top's wifi turned-off and took it out of my router's setup (reserved IP, allowed mac-addr for the wifi, etc.)
Eventually different pop-ups and fake programs start running, so there is a scheduling component.
There were several trojan horses and if I continued to use Firefox, they would reappear in a matter of hours.
You are infected, try running these 2 scanners one at a time.

Does this sound familiar and does anyone have experience in cleaning this up?
AVG Free was able to find and quarantine the malware.
So you have to quickly bring up the task manager and keep it open to kill unknown processes and processes with legit names - but are bogus (jupdater.exe, jusched.exe, wmiprvse.exe to name a few.
