I have a lot of designers send me layered PSDs of their designs and I need to break out the pieces of the designs to place on web pages.
Select the layer you want to export to a new file.
I am aware of the script called "Export Layers to Files" but it took about an hour and exported ALL of my layers to a huge number of files.
Unfortunately, the interface for slices hasn't been updated and they can be a little awkward to use, but see whether they help in your situation.
My old way of just copying the image that's in a layer and pasting into a new image seems to take forever as I screw around with cropping and such.
The second is for the destination of the new layer, either your current document or a New document.
In the top menu, Click "Layer" --> "Duplicate Layer..."
the old fashioned traditional way of doing this - say pre-CS would work as well, in this case:
I've got Photoshop CS5, so I don't need external software to do anything, but I just need to figure out how to take a single layer, that may hold something small like an icon, and export it as a PNG or JPG.
The traditional way to export only part of a layer is to use Slices:
Most people don't use slices any more, since they were designed for the earlier days of the Web when individual images were often sliced up and then reassembled in HTML -- rarely done now.
I can do a decent number of things in Photoshop, but I'm hardly efficient with it.
