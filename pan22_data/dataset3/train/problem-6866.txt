I can move the mouse, but I can't interact with programs.
You can enable it (don't remember exactly how, but it should be easy to google) or just use the proper combination, which is SysRq + K. SysRq may be a secondary function of another key on some layouts, so for example on a qwertz keyboard you are actually pressing AltGr + Print + K.
I think a reboot is the best thing you can do, unless you have something important and long running in background.... Anyways, restarting gdm will kill your apps.
Mostly it should be possible to restart the Window Manager via Ctrl+Alt+Backspace.
This stops all GUI processes running, including all processes started from a gui terminal window.
Sometimes the you cannot switch to the text console, but then it still may be possible to login using ssh from another PC.
The Ctrl+Alt+Backspace doesn't work on Ubuntu, they disabled this shortcut.
Like private_meta said, you'll probably want to restart X.
In recent (upstart - enabled) Ubuntu versions you can type:
For other uses of the SysRq key combinations, read this Wikipedia article.
What else can I do at the terminal instead of rebooting to deal with this problem when it comes up?
Although this kills your foreground apps, it still isn't a full reboot, it might be a compromise for you.
Restarting gdm is then also possible and may fix you hanging display driver.
The only thing I can do is go to a terminal window with Alt+Ctrl+F(n).
It gives you more controll over the system than you'll probably need.
