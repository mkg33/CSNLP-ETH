the subtitle is placed right after the first timing it supposes to appear.
What I do to solve this problem is that using this way:
One more thing i want to add, this may cause when we are directly translating from one language to other language using online translater and  as the effect time format become garbage in translated language, ex - 00:00:02:160 --> 00:00:05:760 time format became - 00:01:36, 644 00:01:44, 644-->  so this type of subtitle are not known by video player and shows only displays time instead of text.
I used to had the same problem if using the VLC Player and the subtitle isn't shown but showing the "--> 12:00:21" instead.
The "replace" function of your text editor should make short work of fixing the issue if this is the case - worked for me.
- i got same problem after converting the substitle from english to hindi using google translator and bing translator.
I had the same issue and in my case the problem was that in the subtitle file the time was given in the format 00:00:02:160 --> 00:00:05:760 while it should actually be like 00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,760.
Looks like you have "->" between your time segments where there should be "-->" instead (ideally with space characters on either side).
