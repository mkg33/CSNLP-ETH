Different browsers have different sets of CAs built in.
Check the instructions provided by your certificate issuer and make sure you're actually serving any intermediate certificates.
Different browsers, settings and network environments make it almost impossible to determine the cause of why the user is getting the error.
Are you sure that you're including the certificate chain provided by the issuer?
Many issuers these days use intermediate certificates to establish the chain of trust back to the root CA.
But, and here comes the question: when I try the same site on my machine, I get the security error in Firefox (v22) and not in Chrome or Safari, or in a VM running Windows 7 and IE9.
The certificate is not trusted because no issuer chain was provided.
The site in question forces https for all traffic but it throws a security error for some users.
www.domain.com uses an invalid security certificate.
Is this an issue on the back-end and is Firefox the only browser failing because of it, or is it a problem in Firefox, thus making it a local browser problem?
