The backup scripts are doing their jobs, stopping all services, making the backup but now, all services are restarted except Apache.
Both servers uses Apache 2.4.27 x64 binary build from Apache Haus.
After searching on the Web about the recently installed updates, the KB4338818 is the one causing problems.
These scripts are working fine since several years (almost 4 years).
We have some backup scripts running on both servers.
So I hope Microsoft will fix this in a later update!

I've just uninstalled this Security Update and now Apache can be started/stopped as normal!
I was having a similar problem with Tomcat on a Windows Server.
After investigating, I found that Apache 2.4.27 service can't be stopped.
So I presume the problem is from one of these updates.
But this is false, as the httpd process is always running!
As a work-around I tried loading IIS on the problem server setting up the default web site so that it used non-standard ports and the problem appears to have gone away without having to uninstall the update.
So before uninstalling all of them, is there someone which have the same problem as I, I mean Apache 2.4 becomes unkillable and can't be stopped on Windows Server?
I had another server with Tomcat that was not experiencing the problem however, and the only major difference I could find was that the working server also had IIS installed and running on other ports.
The only thing to do to unblock the situation is to reboot the whole server.
Microsoft is releasing KB4345459 to fix the issues in Windows 7 and Windows 2008 Server.
So I've updated Apache from 2.4.27 to 2.4.34, but the problem remains.
KB4338831 seems to fix the issue for Windows Server 2012 R2.
So I tested to kill the process with pskill from Sysinternals:
We have two Windows Server, one in 2012 R2 and the other in 2008 R2 which uses Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.4 in proxy/reverse-proxy mode (usage of ProxyPass, ProxyPassReverse and Virtual Hosts configuration).
It's available as a recommended update on Windows Update.
I checked the installed updates, and some of them were installed the July 11, 2018 so one day before:
When using the Services console and trying to manually stop the service, the console shows "Stopping" and nothing happens.
This is happening for other softwares, like FileZilla Server, as detailed here.
So I checked the running processes and seen that a httpd.exe process is running.
The big issue is, if that httpd process can't be killed, Apache can't be restarted as the port 80 is already bound.
Seems like Microsoft is starting to fix the issue, until now only for Server 2016 and Windows 10:
They stop all the services (including Apache) then do the backup and restart all services again.
But starting from July 12, 2018, the behaviour is now strange.
