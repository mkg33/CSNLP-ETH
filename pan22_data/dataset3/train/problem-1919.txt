Of course this is a Linux-only solution, but it can handle massive ammounts of data.
Also many people can access the player from all over the network simultaneously, without actually sitting at the computer that is playing the music.
When I'm at work, I simply connect to the MPD that I have running at home with my MPD-Client and then listen to the stream it generates.
What I also like about that solution, is that I don't need to have a player running to listen to music, MPD will play the music, even if no client is connected to is.
My music library consists of over 500000 media files of various kinds.
And if the computer that runs the MPD client crashes, the music is still playing.
I use it to control my MPD over WLAN when I'm not sitting at my desktop computer, and also stream the music through the network and also into the internet.
This is great for parties, you just take a netbook into the living room or kitchen and control the playlist from there.
I use MPD and GMPC on the same machine for managing and playing music.
