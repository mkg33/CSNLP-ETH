should give you most, although not as nicely human readable like Chrome presents it.
Depends on what kind of information you want, but:
In Chrome, clicking on the green HTTPS lock icon opens a window with the certificate details:
echo | openssl s_client -connect google.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
When I tried the same with cURL, I got only some of the information:
The --script ssl-cert tells the Nmap scripting engine to run only the ssl-cert script.
Whether you should have Java installed on your system I do not answer.
From the doc, this script "(r)etrieves a server's SSL certificate.
All ports will be scanned if it is omitted, and the certificate details for any SSL service that is found will be displayed.
shows the chain (as served) with nearly all details in a mostly rather ugly format.
The amount of information printed about the certificate depends on the verbosity level."
Any idea how to get the full certificate information form a command line tool (cURL or other)?
If you only want the expiry date (which isn't exactly the answer but is 9/10 what people use the Chrome cert details for), you can use:
For completeness: if you have installed on your system Java 7 or higher
