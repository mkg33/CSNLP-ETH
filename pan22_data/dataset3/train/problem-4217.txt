Is there a way that even though two objects that have different y co-ordinate collide?
it will creates a rectangle from your both movieClips and then it will calculate the collision for those rectangle witch may be the parts of empty spaces of your movieClip.
i.e hitt) the x and y value of the object and found that it is still there on the scene.
When I added the code, the object now dissapears from the scene even though it's x and y co-ordinate are in the scene.
you have to accurate your collision control by using hitTestPoint that detect hitTest between a rectangle of first area ( and that should be your bigger MovieClip ) and the point that you need to check for collision:

In my game, I wanted to make my object rotate as explained in previousquestion.
I traced(in the function that kills the characer if it touches it.
Or for the best collision detection, you need to use hitTest of BitmapDatas.
