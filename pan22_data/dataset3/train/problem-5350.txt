We have a Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 development server.
Has anyone ever heard of a 64-bit OS identifying itself as a 32-bit OS?
Unless the OS was installed from MSDN media shipped to you or downloaded from the MSDN site, it may not really be a MSDN distribution.
I tried to install a 64-bit version of SQL Server 2005.
Similarly, if you got the install key from the MSDN site, you need to be super careful that you are getting a key to the MSDN release you actually have -- Microsoft seems to delight in having a large number of images with subtly different names.
I usually have my keys handed to me by my overlords, so I am not sure how MSDN works.
I don't know how the product key activator or the SQL install program attempts to divine the type of OS, but could it be...wrong?
It's not show in the compatibility grid (nothing after Windows Server 2008)

Also, we have both a "Program Files" and a "Program Files (x64)" directory.
For example when I was doing a MSDN Win2K3 install, it took me three tries to find the right distribution to get a key for.
We've been trying to activate it with a product key from MSDN, but it keeps telling us the the key is invalid.
Windows Server 2008 R2 is only available as a 64-bit OS.
Your issue is probably athat the hotfix is failing to install on the unactivated OS because the key you have doesn't work.
Are you sure that SQL Server 2005 is compatible with Windows Server 2008 R2 ?
If your key doesn't activate the OS, then the key (probably) doesn't match the OS.
I recently asked some co-workers if I could re-use it for R2, and several replied immediately the keys are different (and we use MAK keys).
