You can use PartedMagic (a Linux Live-CD) to do it, or the tool built into Windows.
Click on it and you will get a virtual view of the disc.
You have to, in some way, start your computer from another media than the drive you should change the partition table on.
If you edit the partition that Windows resides on you will need PartedMagic.
In the control panel you will find the option security and security you will find and option at the end called create and format partions.
Right click on the partition and you ll get an option to create the drive.
Right click on the drive and you will a shrink option.
You could use Windows Disk Management by typing diskmgmt.msc in a Run prompt.
I have used both them and they have self-explanatory interfaces which makes the process pain free.
After which you will see the that a free space is seen.
I would suggest using i linux boot cd and then run Gnome parted (gparted).
If you find that scary, you could use MiniTool Partition Wizard, EaseUS Partition Manager among others.
