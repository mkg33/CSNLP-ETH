Core i7 is Quad, so presumably this is due to Hyperthreading being enabled in BIOS.
The only time I would not use Hyperthreading is if I am 100% sure I will not benefit from it - During the P4 era, I managed several servers than had Hyperthreading and I decided to run benchmarking tools on them for the purpose they were being run, and there was just one that for some reason, (I forget it's task now) that simply outperformed by about 15% when it was turned off.
With that said, it probably is not a large benefit unless you are running more than four CPU intensive threads at a time, but it should not hurt.
Even though most pieces of software may not be multi core intelligent, the operating system is and if for example, you have sixteen processes, it will put two on each core that it sees.
My question is simple - given that most software can take advantage of only 1 core, is having 8 pseudo-cores, rather than only 4 real cores, actually hurting performance?
I could imagine that Intel's HT might allow one core to max out when the other "half" is idle, but then wouldn't the OS have to first use the even/odd numbered cores?
I've got an Intel Core i7 920 in an Asus P6T, for which my OS reports having 8 cores.
Hyperthreading doesn't really cost anything if nothing is being run on the extra CPUs.
