I have a VPC setup with a public subnet, and a private subnet.
I can even ssh connect to the private instance from the public instance.
By default AWS will check the source and destination of network traffic, so an instance must be the final destination of any traffic it sends or receives.
And I can't seem to find any log messages about dropped packets.
I didn't want to use the NAT for this since AWS apperantly pre-configures the NAT instances when you set them up and I heard using iptables can mess that up.
To route traffic from one instance to another you will need to disable this check:
Ok, so I've been racking my brain for DAYS on this dilema.
and 1.2.3.4 should route it to the internal server 10.10.10.10.
These are the rules I have setup on the public instance (not the NAT).
But I need to set it up so that I can connect to the private instance directly using the 1300 port number, ie.

My security groups and ACL settings allow communications on these ports in both directions in both subnets and on the NAT.
I can connect from SSH into a instance in the public subnet, as well as the NAT.
I changed the SSHD configuration on the private instance to accept both port 22 and an arbitrary port number 1300.
Now I heard iptables is the job for this, so I went ahead and researched and played around with some routing with that.
Another potential problem is that routing has not been enabled at the kernel level by running something like:
