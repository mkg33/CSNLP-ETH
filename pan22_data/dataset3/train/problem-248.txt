Bandwidth use will be slightly higher than something such as FTP due to the HTTP overhead.
theres no reason why s3fs won't work reliably under debian 5 that I'm aware of.
As ccame mentioned, it's limited to your server's upstream bandwidth.
Here's a great feature comparison table (made by S3QL, so it is biased).
We are constantly running out of space on our backup server so I want to move the backups to S3.
I've benchmarked s3fs from EC2 instances at rates over 100mb/s
If you are at all concerned about bandwith, S3QL's compression and de-duplication are certainly advantages.
Re bandwidth, you need to understand that your backups may run a lot slower, they can only run as fast as the bandwidth you have to amazon because everything is pushed over the internet to S3.
Yes, I primarily develop under Debian (now squeeze)
On this basis you need to carefully consider your data volume being backed up, the bandwidth you have available and consider whether this is going to exceed the window you have available to conduct your backups in.
