I have tried on different computers, operating systems, USBDeviceView, testdisk, device manager's disk management, It does not show up anywhere.
I am not very good with the hardware side of computers, though I think I read a comment somewhere saying someone used a usb to sata cable to attach it to another computer, could this help me at least retrieve the data on the drive?
I read on another question here with the same type of problem "I suspect the interface board on your external drive is bad, but the only sure way to test that is take the drive out of the enclosure and connect it to a known-good controller."
It does though power up and make sounds as if it works, when you plug the power in or attach it to a usb port.
I have read the other relevant questions and searched the internet for hours.
I know now that Maxtor and Seagate branded hard drives are nightmares and should be avoided.
My Maxtor one touch 4 external usb hard drive stopped being recognized.
Someone said if the cables aren't correctly configured or attached it could burn the computer's motherboard etc?
