The following code takes the subdir test's .htaccess file, which has a PHP MVC structure in it that uses the "direct everything at the index.php file", detects that "www."
I almost had it in my example I provided in the original question.
However, I was thwarted in my testing because I forgot about browser cache and 301 permanent redirects.
If one connected to the page previously when experimenting, you may need to clear your browser cache.
My client's advertising campaigns specifically required that "www."
The fix is to add the subdir information into the .htaccess file.
And if I had this file inside /test/test2, then I would need to add /test/test2/ into that .htaccess file there.
added in because the purchased campaign could only use one domain, not two, without additional expense.
So, if I have a subdirectory named "test" with its own .htaccess file inside, then I need to add that information in.
This is because a 301 redirect was used during experimentation, and this tells the browser to cache that redirect locally.
A 301 redirect will tell your browser (look in your cache before you go to this url so that you know where to go), while a 302 redirect will tell your browser (I will decide on the fly where you should redirect).
A 302 temporary redirect wouldn't do that, but actually in this case a 301  permanent redirect is better because it's faster in browser connection time.
