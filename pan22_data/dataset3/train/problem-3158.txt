(or https if that's what the nexenta speaks on port 2000).
I'm trying to access the NexentaStor web console via port 2000 from a different subnet than the system's main IP address.
In my situation, this is either over a VPN or to access a remote Nexenta appliance over a private network.
If the approaches others have suggested don't help, and nexenta can't tell you how to reconfigure the box to disable this feature, you might consider trying to "bounce" the connection off a local box (meaning one on the same subnet as the Nexenta) running sshd.
I recommend contacting Nexenta support, or this is not an option, to reach out to #Nexenta on irc.freenode.org.
NexentaStor might be ignoring your traffic based on your IP.
I can see the system via ping and telnet to port 2000, but the NMV interface does not work.
The details of ssh port forwarding are pretty widely-documented, but the upshot would be to make a connection from your desktop (client) to server (the box on the same network as nexenta) as follows:
In which case, you will need to either reconfigure the NexentaStor to allow this (if possible), or use NAT so that the device will see you as coming from within its network.
I agree with those others who have suggested that it's likely the nexenta is ignoring requests from "offsite" addresses as some kind of half-arsed security feature.
