High power only works on outgoing signals, not the inbound ones.
What you read is completely incorrect and misleading.
Also, how does the interference, does it also goes bigger?
I just want to know, I read on the net, that one way to avoid channel overlaping is by increasing the power of your AP.
The reverse of this is that where a signal is weak or being interfered with by another sources there will be a lot of retransmitting, which of course means the throughput is less than it theoretically could be.
While the AP/base station may well be able to override overlapping signals the same will not be true of the hosts trying to communicate with it.
Given enough power you will simply swamp all other signals and make yours the only one stations will receive.
The relationship of power and overlap to throughput is that when a channel is "clean" the stations do not have to retransmit as frequently.
The reason it appears to have have an effect is nothing more than that it may be overpowering other overlapping signals.
However, I can not find any adequate explanation, how does it solve the problem of channel overlapping, related with the throughput that we receive.
