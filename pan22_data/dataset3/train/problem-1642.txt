Personally, I prefer to run WinSSHD on my pc on campus  (on port 80 rather than 22)  and then open a tunnel from the outside using Tunnelier client.
This isn't a VPN and so you have to manually map ports... things aren't wide open like on a VPN connection.
The campus network only has port 80 publicly open and I'm almost positive that they do traffic shaping and content filtering.
HTTPS is not distinguishable from anything else running on a SSL enforced socket.
Is my only option here to change the port OpenVPN is running on in Tomato USB to port 80 and connect from the campus within the client from port 80?
Not making advertisement, but in my campus SwissVPN service (which runs OpenVPN) works fine because that guys configured the OpenVPN server to accept connections on port 443 (often used for HTTPS) and since the OpenVPN socket is SSL layered, to the stupid firewall in my campus it's like I'm doing HTTPS with some server.
I have my router at home running Tomato USB with OpenVPN running on port 1194.
Just an idea in case your VPN method doesn't work.
If it doesn't work and you have much spare time, you can try to find some HTTP tunneling tool but it's not clean as OpenVPN.
Try it out (setting your own VPN server on port 443 or try SwissVPN free test), it might work.
