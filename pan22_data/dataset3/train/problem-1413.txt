     I am creating a java 2d game for my year 12 major project.
I have further functionality that i would like for my disc, however i think i should wait until i get this set finished.
Once installed, the disc dose not need to be used.
Even where to look as i have had no luck over 3 weeks.
I hope this was the correct place as this question, if you can answer please do, the more detailed the better.
As a summary, how do i code a disc to automatically install my game when put in the computer
     I would like it to generally install my game to the given directory assuming the given conditions have been met.
Lets, say you want to run Setup.exe (also present in the root folder), below will be the file contents of autorun.inf,
This project contains a section detailing that i need to package this game as if i was selling it as a commercial product, including case, manual and disc.
In Windows, you can simply achieve it using an autorun.inf file in the root folder of your disc.
All you need to do is, create a text file at the root folder of your disc, name it as autorun.inf and configure as to which EXE you want to execute when the disc is inserted.
