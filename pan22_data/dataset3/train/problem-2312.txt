so, the packet that computer2 receives has the source IP 192.168.1.11, but the MAC address ::cc.
The IP address however is made to pass between networks, so it remains constant.
the packet gets re-encapsulated in a new frame every time it crosses a router, but the IP packet itself remains unchanged.
so we have three networks, the LAN computer1 is in (.1.X), the network between the two routers (.3.X), and the LAN that computer2 is on (.2.X).
You are half right, in that the MAC address changes with each hop, but the IP addresses of the connection do not change unless there is NAT/PAT technology inline, or an application proxy is in use.
So a mac address is only good on the network that bears a device with that MAC.
MAC addresses are for addressing frames, so they are tied to the implementation of each LAN.
this is important, because if Computer2 in your scenario recieved a packet from 192.168.1.1 with MAC ::cc, it would have no way to tell that it didn't come from the router, and when computer2 responded, router2 would have no idea who it is responding to.
you can use the mac address ::aa to send frames around the network Computer1 and Router1 are connected to, but if you tried to send a frame to ::dd on this LAN, it will not reach its destination.
Note, I believe the address for computer2 should be somthing like 192.168.2.12, rather than 1.12. that would imply that your packet doesn't go through router2 at all.
NAT/PAT makes this a little more confusing, in that more info is needed to make source/destination decisions, so remember, a scenario with real home routers is a little more completed.
