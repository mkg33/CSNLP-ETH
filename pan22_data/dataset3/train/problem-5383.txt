As you were looking for a solution that resets all Kerberos tickets, you need to use the special identifier:
We're trying to find a way that allows as little disruption to the user as possible.
to force logoff after 5 minutes using shutdown /l /f /t 300, the /l for logoff is not available remotely with /m \\target.
I'd like to see if there is a way to update a users machines group membership without having to restart the computer, and without having their login information.
Ideally looking for something I can execute remotely with a script.
I've found different ways to refresh the group membership, but most need the login information of the user, or direct access to the machine.
You could either use it as is or adopt the methods described:
Restart is not necessary, but a logoff-logon cycle is needed to refresh NTLM authentication.
There is a script for Purging the Kerberos ticket cache via klist on a remote machine.
Additionally, Kerberos authentication tickets can be reset with klist.exe since Windows 7.
