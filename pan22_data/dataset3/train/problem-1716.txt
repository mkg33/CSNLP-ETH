I suppose I could leave the 2nd router acting as a router and plug it into the Steam Link (which does not need Internet access) and use the 2nd ethernet port on the PC (which does need Internet access) but I'm also unsure if the PC will know how to manage Steam communicating across both NICs.
Performance over wireless has been lackluster, so I really need hardwired networking.
I have a second router that can reach both the computer and the Steam Link.
Wireless access has worked fine for more activities, but I'd like to set up a Steam Link for streaming games from a computer to a nearby TV.
My cable modem is unmovable and is in a remote part of the house.
I have a very large house that, unfortunately, lacks in-wall networking and I haven't dealt with it yet.
I was thinking about setting up the router as a wireless bridge and connecting both devices, with the assumption that they would be able to utilize their gigabit ethernet connection since they're on the same device.
However, I'm not sure if this will work in practice - I assume that the 2nd router would end up acting as a switch and I don't know enough about networking to understand if the router has to actually route packets itself or if the switch+devices are smart enough to figure out the best route to one another.
