In fact, it's fairly uncommon for any software to offer Oxford spelling.
Right-click on each word in turn and choose to add it to the dictionary.
Go to a website that contains a text box you can type in.
There is not a way to "enable" an additional dictionary with these words or bulk add words in Chrome (or just about any modern browser).
In Settings > Language add 'English (United Kingdom)`:
Under Spell Check click Custom Spelling and you can paste words in, one at a time.
Then 'English (United Kingdom)' is available in the Spell check section and can be enabled:
In Google Chrome open Settings > Advanced, and scroll down to and expand Language.
I'm not sure if this is strictly Oxford English, but there is a way to get British English spell checking...
Find a list of words you wish to add, copy these, and paste them into the text box.
You can, however, manually add words to the dictionary.
Although Google products offer a British English language option, they don't support Oxford spelling (-ize suffixes, among other things).
