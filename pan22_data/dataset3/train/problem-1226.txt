First of all, the smtpmail library can now do plain SSL.
It looks like Emacs 24 (currently on pre-release) has made several improvements and things are a lot simpler.
In particular, it ensures that the CRLF character pair at the end of the 220 greeting from the server does not get altered.
I determined that a fix is to change the line in function "smtpmail-via-smtp" in file "smtpmail.el" that reads:

The changes discussed there--that make the fix--made it into Emacs 24, but are not present in Emacs 23.3 or 23.4.
The general title of that discussion is "Changing the default for `send-mail-function'" (it began on 6/26/11).
This insures that no coding conversion takes place when the server response is inserted into "process-buffer".
It asks how one should configure Emacs mail sending packages on MS Windows for use with secure SMTP server such as gmail, which require TLS and STARTTLS.

With this one additional change I was successful in sending a test email via smtp.gmail.com:587.
Bug #7789, discussed at newsgroup gnu.emacs.bug, reports this signaling deficiency in MS Windows (aka Woe32).

The advice was unearthed by Uday Reddy and can be found at http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.windows/3250.
My Emacs version information is "GNU Emacs 23.3.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600) of 2011-03-10 on 3249CTO".
The authentication credentials (login and password) should go into a file ~/.authinfo or ~/.authinfo.gpg.
I later found that my fix is covered by the discussion at http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/140976.
I also followed the advice to make this change (in function "starttls-negotiate-gnutls" in file "starttls.el") but I was still unsuccessful in sending a test email via the server smtp.gmail.com:587.
The following is advice that led to the question of the moment.
