Doing it through WSUS is a much more productive way to go about things in general.
Salt stack has the added benefit of being cross platform- the same tool for linux and windows.

Is there an "apt-get install .NET-Framework" for Windows Server 2008+?
that way you can "activate" the server module for .NET (3.5, 4.0, ...) for your server (installing the MSI would not work, anyways)
If you just want to update the system, then that can be done with salt, too (since 2014.7):
To rephrase: If you can run one command to install the update on 30 machines, why would you click through windows update?
This works at least for windows server 2012, i guess it should also work for windows server 2008
They even have a sample repository to give you an example on how to create your own.
Since I don't have the points to directly respond to @TomTom, I'll say it here;

No need to play around with non standard software.

To be on-topic of the answer, there isn't exactly per se an 'apt-get install' or 'yum install' but you can use saltstack to do those installations, you just have to define it.
but if you had a hotfix, or something that had bad luck applying with WSUS, salt is a great way to go.
Windows update is nice for administering a single box, but when you have 30 windows hosts that need updates, some type of configuration management in place.
Some way I can update to the latest .NET Framework 4+, preferably using Saltstack?
