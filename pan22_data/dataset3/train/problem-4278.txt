One of comment says that you're doing a 2048 clone, as such, the centralized place could be a class called Block.
The issue is that, somewhere in your code, you're determining which i to give to this method and you're testing it against known fixed values only in the method.
In the case where the Num array doesn't have the given value, you have a special else if to handle the last case.
You could even make it an enumeration of all the possible blocks, each with its respective value and color.
You should refactor this code so that the logic of "which number corresponds to which color" is centralized in a single place.
You actually don't need this: you can safely let your code exit the for loop normally and return the last value in this case:
That said, you can improve a little bit the current code.
A second point concerns the variable names: you should try to respect Java naming conventions.
An example could be the following (with perhaps a better name for the constants):
As such, don't use use Strings to represent blocks, use proper objects with attributes; this is what Object-Oriented Programming is about.
Your method is technically correct, but the problem is that it relies on a given magic int i to determine which color to return.
The local variables should start with a lowercase letter (num instead of Num, which could arguably have a better name also; emerald instead of Emerald...).
