Even with another solution in place -- monit is a wonderful 'backup' that can email you when issues arrise -- or even be configured to resolve them itself (restart Apache on high memory usage due to a leak in PHP).
After you have a heart attack at the price, you should consider Nagios.
Often times there is a server performance issue that I only hear about after the fact, and it would be great to have an app that continually monitors a server and can alert me if server load gets too high.
It will run on linux & you can run it as an appliance & access everything you need via a browser.
It runs on Windows and you need to enable SNMP in your linux box.
If you have deep pockets, HP Open View can run on windows.
Monit is fairly trivial to configure to email you on resource triggers (memory, cpu usage, etc).
For a long term monitoring and history I use NetMRG.
Is there a desktop app (for Windows preferably) that will connect to a remote Linux server, and provide a realtime meter/history graph of the server load and other metrics on that remote server?
