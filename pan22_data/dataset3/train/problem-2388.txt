The reason is that you need to know exactly what data the game will require and if there is anything you can just straight out omit.
There is also always the option to go with lower quality assets (art, music) and less sophisticated code/AI.
Such an inquiry might also prove to show that the scope of the game is just too broad and should be simplified regardless.
On the other hand Team Fortress 2 takes up 18.4GB of my hard drive except that my current hard disk is a 1TB drive so it's only 20/1000 or 2% of the disk space.
Most people don't balk at a 10GB game these days because their hard disks are very large.
I remember that Neverwinter Nights 1 was ~4GB of disk space back when my hard drive was only 80GB.
A game requiring 7 DVDs seems rather insane to me, but if the players will buy it and play it.
The fact of a captive audience that needs a game to play on their console seems relevant here.
I'm sure there are any number of approaches, these are some of them:
The core game/mechanic may not require that level of detail or accuracy to approximate realism and still be fun/playable.
In any case the point is that there's some hardware use target and they develop toward it intentionally, probably even more so on a console.
You can also just shove the requirement at at the player and hope for the best.
I am giving PC numbers, but the PC/console difference seems less and less every year.
Obviously that didn't keep people from playing it.
It's almost certainly a balancing act in the end, you may actually have to immerse yourself in such a project to know beyond a doubt whether it's viable.
It sounds like you need to flesh out the idea somewhat and figure out exactly what is contained within the Open Street Map data.
