At some point I stopped, using MySQL as backend for Exim 4 would simplify my life a lot but I think that it is not the best solution for performance.
The load on the server will be very low, there will be more or less 50 websites with not more than 150/200 email accounts in total, so it doesn't really matter but I want to do some experiments and tests to find out the best possibility.
There are consistent differences in terms of performance and/or resource consumption between using MySQL, SQLite, DBM or plain text files?
I am setting up a web server using Exim 4 on Debian 8 and, as usual, I was going to use MySQL as backend to store the settings related to the domains and users (like quota, emails, aliases, forwards, enabled/disabled account/domain, antispam/antivirus on/off, whitelist, blacklist and so on).
For example, would be a good solution put a CDB or a DBM in a in-memory filesystem?
For that reason I don't want to put the spool in memory, there would be very few emails.
I would like to do some tests but I have very little time right now, so any direct/indirect experience would be really appreciated!
