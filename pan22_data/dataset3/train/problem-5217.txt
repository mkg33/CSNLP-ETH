the one i have now is (65w  19.5v  3.33a) I've looked online for a new one and the ones compatible with my laptop are (65w  18.5v and it varies with the amps) Is it okay to use those ones even though its lower?
it turns on now and it works but the charger wont charge it at all.
I have an HP Pavilion g6-2211nr I got it about 2 years ago.
I did find one however that is 19.5v but Could they have given me the wrong charger and maybe thats why it stopped charging the second time?
this happened earlier in the year while i still had my warranty with HP and they fixed it and replaced the charger and battery then too.
But now my question is what charger is safe with it?
The charger is not covered in the warranty so i need to buy a new one.
For a while It would if i held the cable a certain way but if i bumped it in the slightest it would stop charging.
This last couple of months i havent been able to use it because It stopped charging.
I consulted hhgregg with the warranty and they shipped me a new battery.
In most cases for laptops these days, you can use a charger that has a higher Wattage that what your Laptop needs to charge - Most chargers indicate that they can pull a "Maximum" of "X" Watts, and the laptop will only draw the power that is needed - However, if you try to use a lower wattage charger, you could potentially damage the charger, laptop, or both.
That was about 4 months after I bought the laptop.
Another good bet would be to contact HP Support to see if you can purchase a verified charger for your laptop, or even see if there are any certified chargers online for your specific model.
I need a charger soon but i dont want to get the wrong one and mess up my laptop further.
As long as the polarity is the same on the chargers (your old one and the new one), and the AC Adapter fits, you shouldn't have a problem.
