In the end, you can simply TeamViewer from the tablet into the desktop work like that.
It won't have all of the features of a drawing tablet, and there might be some lag depending on the quality of your connection, but from my brief experience it gets the job done!
I have a tablet laptop running Windows 10, which supports touch and stylus input.
In Windows 10 in the Anniversary Update, there are three special apps that work with a digital pen and is meant for touchscreen laptops or tablets.
You install it on your tablet/laptop and on your desktop, and it lets you use the tablet as an input for the desktop.
The built-in apps feature post-it notes, a sketch pad, and a screen capture and annotation tool.
There's an app called VirtualTablet that I believe does what you're asking.
TeamViewer is very similar to VNC, but it allows more functions for their free version.
Tip: if successfully connected, the device will be identified by name instead of its model number.
It is possible to run a connection over the local network (which increases speed).
You can use the feature to find more apps built to work with Windows Ink.
