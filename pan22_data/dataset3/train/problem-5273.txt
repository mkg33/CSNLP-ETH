Uninstall and delete everything to do with thunderbird, then reinstall, worked for me, lost mail, but it's all on gmail anyway.
You said you've tried ending the task in task manager, but have you tried ending the process in the task manager?
Oh, by the way, Windows has notoriously bad process management, so be careful not to mess with the operating system.
What I experienced yesterday must be a major bug in Thunderbird.
The folder for my corresponding profile is completely gone in C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird.
Also use Win+E to start Explorer, then browse to C:\Users\your-username\AppData\Mozilla and delete the Thunderbird directory in there.
I will update my answer with more details, when it becomes more clear, what you did exactly and which results you got.
While the steps you described seem inconsistent, the most likely cause is probably an inaccessible or missing profile.
Download Revo Uninstaller and then uninstall Thunderbird with that.
Does it ever work correctly, for example the first time after rebooting your computer?
