You can't create a trust relation with an SBS server domain and another, existing domain.
We invested in a pack from www.sbsmigration.com to help us through it, but ended up not needing it.
This case scenario started me wondering about the limitations of Small Business Server:
I have a client who came to us initially regading building them an intranet for managing staff training and document sharing etc.
I found some links but would like to hear some real world experiences
staff member and their overall turnover I would guesstimate at a conservative AU $16M /year between 8 stores.
There is a restriction of a single domain in a single forest, but there should really not be any need for more than that in a small business.

We migrated from SBS2003 to individual Server 2003 and Exchange 2003 servers for this reason.
but as they use two other software packages (one for POS & one for inventory [they are not linked >< ]) I have advised them to start with looking at their overall I.T.
SBS2008 (and SBS2003) is limited to 75 users (or desktops, depending on whether you opt for per user or per device licesning) in total.
Beyond that you are looking at Winidows Essentials Server.

We found that the migration path is weakly supported by MS, and I was worried to death that it wouldn't work.
Aside from that, I cannot think of any compelling reason not to run SBS.
