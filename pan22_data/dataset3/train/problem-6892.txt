Anyone have experience with a setup like this in EC2, that can hopefully point out something obvious I'm missing?
So, my next plan was to add the new IP to the existing internal NIC, which results in this config:
The generated iptables rules appear sane, however, I do not have connectivity to the 10.0.81.0/24 subnet (either pinging or nmap)
All of the  instances are within a VPC setup, with the following subnets:
Have you tried adding another private IP to it through the AWS console (right click the instance and click manage network interfaces, or something like that)?
Heres a table: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#AvailableIpPerENI
My initial plan was to just add another NIC in the 10.0.81.0/24 subnet, but that seems to be impossible.
I'm currently working on setting up a QA environment on EC2 along side our production environment.
I have a EC2 instance running as a gateway machine that is already has 2 NICs, which seems to be the limit (One NIC for the external IP, the other for internal).
I then set up shorewall for the new address, and restarted it:
I dont think you can just alias an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) into another subnet.
And then insuring the virtual NIC is in the correct security groups.
Also, different instances have limits on the number of interfaces they can have.
