Alternatives to what I'm trying out are welcome as well.
Usually I use it when do some testing with software compiled from source.
What folders, binaries, files would I need to copy and is this even possible?
I use Puppet to automate setting up servers for work.
So you can set it before running make install and have all files installed in $DESTDIR path.
A standard makefile should honor DESTDIR environment variable.
Best way is to create/download replacement deb packages so you can rollback/upgrade apache anytime you want, also you must satisfy dependencies.
For the software in production use it's better to make your own package, deb, rpm or whatever your distro use.
For example, I use Apache 2.2.25 but Ubunu 12.04 currently has 2.4 as the base.
The first version to get 2.4 will be the upcoming 13.10 release.
Since I didn't want to upgrade right away, I setup Puppet to compile and install Apache from source.
The only problem with this is that installing the specific version of the software in my stack is a bit tricky as dependencies are sometimes not met.
Since this generally takes awhile I was wondering whether I could build and compile Apache and keep reusing the built version?
You can create local repository and easily manage updates/downgrades with puppet.
