"umask 002" says that write permission wont be stripped off group rights for new files or directories
What I do at the moment is an occasional recursive chmod g+w, but it would be much better if subdirectories were created with the correct permissions in the first place
So your problem could be solved by a smart placement of "umask 002" in /etc/profile or /etc/bashrc, if you want to make this the default system wise option, or in individual .profile or .bashrc
Is there a way how I (as the superuser) can enforce that all subdirectories created - no matter how - always get the group-writable flag?
umask is the simplest way to go: you'll find a complete explanation here
Users access this directory both via NFS from Linux boxes and via SMB from windows boxes.
acl is a more elaborate solution, which allows to specify which users and groups will have what permissions on new files and directories
My working group uses a shared directory on a linux server which is made group-writable (and group-executable).
Occasionally, users create a new subdirectory (which is ok) inside this shared folder but this subdirectory is often not group-writable.
