I figured it was likely a corrupt mail profile, so tried to create a new one - however, it won't resolve the username/server and continually throws up the "Outlook must be online or connected to complete this action" error.
There are no other firewalls or security between the laptop and our mail server.
We have a few thousand other users on the Exchange and none are having this problem.
From another comment you posted, it sounds like you're having issues with your DNS client on that machine.
I would run SFC /scannow and if that doesn't find anything I'd reinstall the OS, as painful as that might be!
To cut a long story short, here's a list of fixes I've attempted based on extensive Googling - NONE of which worked
If that doesn't turn up anything, run 'detect & repair' from within Outlook (under the Help menu).
I've had a look and it seems Outlook will not go online at all.

I'm currently investigating a baffling issue on one of our user's laptops which has me pulling my hair out.
This morning, he logged a call to say that his Outlook was offline and he couldn't seem to send or receive any mails.
The user has Outlook 2003 and this has been connecting to our 2007 Exchange server for months with no problems.
