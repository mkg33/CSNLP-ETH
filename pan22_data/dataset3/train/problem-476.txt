In a sense, I want it to be a separate section, and create a pipeline between two pages at a different position.
They have to appear in my list of figures in the beginning of my document, though, so they need to be part of the document structure and numbered by page!
I am currently in the midst of preparing a thesis, and in Microsoft Word (I am using version 14.7.2 of 2011 and I am a Mac OSX user!)
In this way, I want to prevent that images jump around in the text, or prevent to have them sloppily inserted by means of text boxes etc.
I guess a work-around would be to add figures and tables only when the document is finished (e.g.
What's the smartest way of going about this, perhaps by using sections or tables, for instance, or subdocuments?
I would like to have pages of figures and tables stand next to the descriptive parts of the text, where I explain what is going on in the figures/tables figures by means of continuous texts and notes.
In effect, however, this also means that I would like the page with the figures and tables to be a steady, immobile page, and that when I edit the "text sections", so to speak, my cursor moves by skipping over a page and leaves that particular page of figures and tables unharmed and isolated.
Here is an image imitating what I want to achieve!
