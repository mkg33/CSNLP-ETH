I have a contingency table listing individuals with certain traits.
This approach achieves the clustering purpose by a mixture of multinomial distributions.
I want to cluster individuals with similar tastes together.
Finally, I want to know which foods are correlated.
If you want to know which foods are the best separators for the clustering, you can check the parameters of the multinomial distributions for each component.
Here is an example (considering that your data are stored in object "x".
Would hierarchical clustering be appropriate for this kind of data?
You can use the Latent Class Model (see Goodman, L., 1974.
Moreover, you can perform a variable selection simultanously with model estimation.
Exploratory latent structure analysis using both identifiable and unidentifiable
I also want to know which foods are the best separators for the clusters.
Can I use Spearman's coefficient on this kind of data?
For the sake of simplicity, let's say the table has individuals in rows, and the type of food they like in columns:
This approach (with and without variable selection) is implemented in the R package VarSelLCM.
