The ssh-agent on my Mac causes a pop-up for certain hosts:
If you have different identities, then one might not be configured in the OS X keychain.
And then I get the dreaded "Enter your password for the SSH key 'id_rsa'."
To fix the problem I had to generate a new public/private key pair and distribute that.
How do I stop the pop-up for all hosts and make it always use the ssh-agent?
I copied the pub key to the servers I was trying to log into, and for some reason one of them accepted the key with a client hostname mis-match and the other did not.
It turns out that I had copied my id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files from another laptop.
The same thing happened to me if ~/.ssh/id_rsa existed but ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub did not, if you delete the pub file auth with the key still works but asks for your password every time
This blog entry (not mine, just found via google) discusses how keychain works with ssh-agent in OS X Leopard.

it worked for me on my mac lion with this command: rm ~/.ssh/*
Do you use different identities for these two hosts set up in ~/.ssh/config (or elsewhere)?
I know the ssh-agent is running and working because it worked for the first host.
