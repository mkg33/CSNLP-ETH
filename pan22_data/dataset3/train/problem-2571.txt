Perhaps other issues would pop-up as you would go.
In an ironic twist, perhaps one or more of this problem cannot be solved by the human brain, at least efficiently.
One can argue that there is a TM that does the same in just $n$ using the speed-up theorem, but that would require storing $2 \log 10^{10^{100}}$ times more information in every step of the sped up algorithm.
So, if you would like to precisely calculate what problems the human brain, given the constraints of actual life, like distractions, attention span, etc.
In that case, we can safely say that the human brain itself as part of the material world, can be simulated by a Turing machine.
Assuming that the Church-Turing thesis is true, whether the answer will change or not depends on your view of the world (philosophical, spiritual , religious and other).
Since every TM needs a transition function, a human can imitate the TM's steps, therefore, the human brain is Turing-complete.
you should have an upper bound on the number of steps done in total, an upper bound on the number of steps done consecutively (even the most devoted researcher must sleep and eat), a limitation on the space (not just in the tape, but also in any "internal" registers), a simulation of how memory acts because unlike TMs , we can forget something we write in our "work tape" or the exact state, and of course, determine the relation between machine time steps and time in seconds or "human brain steps".
The rest is up to debate and , at least in my opinion, not related to TCS.
But we are talking about the power of the brain itself.
In the reverse direction, can TMs compute everything humans do?
Of course, a specific lower bound would be needed to ensure a faster algorithm (constants included) does not exist.
One could argue that if $P \neq NP$ all problems in $NP-P$  would dwarf a lifetime.
If we choose to study the human brain itself rather than how humans use their brain to solve problems,I don't believe this is an issue of complexity, but rather of computability.
The transition table and the work tape could be passed on from generation to generation until the answer is solved.Even if we require that problems solvable by humans do not exceed the lifetime of a single person, does $10^{10^{100}}n$ , which is just linear , seem like doable?
