This is a good thing, but I kind of like having a full image of the drive (because I'm paranoid).
Otherwise download and read the code for their scripts.
while I know dd doesn't have such abilities, does such already exist, and if it does then does that app use dd.
It will copy only the blocks used in the filesystem.
Have a read through the forums there and you should find mention of it.
Basically, you want a tool that understands the filesystem and only saves blocks that are used.
CloneZilla uses dd, and only saves the used sectors.
dd doesn't know anything about 'used' and 'free' blocks.
When you image a drive with dd, you get a image usually of the same exact size of the drive.
For quick and dirty sort-of imaging of a Windows box, I boot a SystemRescueCD, and execute the following script (located on an external USB backup drive mounted on /mnt/backup):
That way the image is as compressible as it's going to get while still being a bit image.
You should not create an image from the drive but make backup of the filesystem.
In order to do that, and minimize the space needed for a compressed image, I use (on Windows systems that I want to image) the SysInternals 'sdelete' to write zeros to the unused sectors.
Oh, the external drive is usually formatted NTFS, mounted with "-t ntfs-3g".
Such as with a fresh install of an OS, is it possible to only copy up to the last block utilized by the new os?
You can compress the image, but that is really Dependant on how many continuous null's or zeros their are on the drive.
My question is, does another tool exist to only image the critical blocks of the drive.
