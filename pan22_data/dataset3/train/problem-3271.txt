From my experience, always leave a little slack too in terms of storage for YOU, not the users.
Often users will take as much email storage as they're given (especially Outlook/Exchange shops), so if money is tight and storage is at a premium, lower the retention policy a little to alleviate future financial/technical headaches.
Legal issues aside, I am in favor of keeping emails as long as I possible can.
From then on I would focus on common metrics within IT such as the total number of users, avg.
Disk space is cheap, and getting cheaper, and machines are getting faster and cheaper as well.
My own email database go back about a dozen years, and it is quite useful at times to have access to that information.
I would talk to the legal department first and foremost to avoid any headaches later on, and for possible compliance issues (HIPAA/SOX/PCI).
I agree with squillman in terms of addressing legality obstacles.
to determine how many days to keep online storage (if legal hasn't mandated anything).
Seems to me that industry usually dictates compliance in tandem with legal more than anything else.
