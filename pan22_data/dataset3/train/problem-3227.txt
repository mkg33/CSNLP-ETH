You could do something like storing the username in the registry under a custom key (HKLM\Software\MyCompany is pretty common).
The trick is to launch the script under a account with local admin rights AND with the administrative access token requested (by default a local admin user doesn't have full admin rights prior to the request).
It depends on when Windows is populating that registry key and how it's determining the last logged on user.
I did some testing on my Win 7 x64 Enterprise machine.
I'm guessing that Windows 7 is configuring the registry sometime after you run the script.
Then you make a Shutdown or Startup script which does:
You can use remote registry (either regedit or reg.exe) to determine the data in the WinLogon values.
The script can be launched by a user without administsrative rights, and all prompts are correctly displayed.
To correctly run your script, launch cmd with admin rights (Start, enter CMD in start menu search, right click cmd and choose 'Run as administrator') and then launch your script from within this CMD window.
