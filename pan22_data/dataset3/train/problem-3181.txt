Often people press too long the shift key for the colon and make the typo but actually wanting to type :w. You've possibly got this mapping by copy and paste of snippets into your vimrc or by using a pre-configured vim setup such as spf13-vim distribution.
However, as pointed out by Sam Stokes checking the meaning of commands via
in VIM sometimes when saving, I accidentally hit capital W instead of its lowercase brother.
The normal mapping of "W" advances by a WORD, where WORD is defined by a sequence of non-blank characters.
is a general approach to find out what a command or keycombo does.
I am prompted for my system password, so I assume it is running a sudo command of some sort, but do you know what?
I guess you have a common mapping for :W in your .vimrc  to save the file as typing :w does.
:W doesn't do anything in my copy of VIM (6.4), for what that's worth.
(For me, it just takes me to the help for :w, which wouldn't be, um, help-ful for you.
As others have said, :W isn't defined in vanilla vim (7.0 here), so it sounds like some plugin you've installed has added it.
