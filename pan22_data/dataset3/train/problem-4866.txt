If you want to backup and restore the whole cluster, you should use "pg_dumpall", not "pg_dump".
But it is also a bit harder to document, and more likely for files to get out of sync with each other.
If you run "pg_dump" with -C option, it too will emit "CREATE DATABASE" commands.
If your primary use case to restore a single database but without knowing ahead of time which one it will be, this would be faster than the previous options, and could be run on a smaller machine than the original.
If you don't like any of those options, you could do a pg_dumpall -g accompanied with a pg_dump -C of each individual database.
If you want to do something different in the future, then do something different in the future.
The question you are referencing is a bit of a mess, I think you would be better off not referring to it at all.
Or you can restore the whole, and re-dump what you do want out of it.
Using "pg_dumpall" without any of the restrictive options will emit the necessary "CREATE DATABASE" commands.
Or use vi or sed or awk or perl to munge the "pg_dumpall" .sql file so that it does only what you want.
You can restore the whole thing, and then drop databases you don't want.
It just introduces misconceptions to then partially remove some of them.
Or just dump what you want out of the original server, if that is still around.
