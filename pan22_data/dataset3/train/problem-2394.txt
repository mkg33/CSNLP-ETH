I haven't gotten it to work all that well, but you may have more luck.
This is screen for X application - you attach and detach X apps just like console ones.
There is this program called xmove that in theory can do this.
I have some simulations that take a long time to run and my work has a very messed up collection of Exceed and Go Global window shares.
I also would do this using SSH tunneling to encrypt the connection password, too.
So sometimes I need to run things from Go Global and then I need to share the simulation with others.
It would be nice if I could just dynamically send the simulation to a new $DISPLAY without restarting it.
(I would much much prefer to have a simple VNC instead).
So right now I have to quite the simulation change the $DISPLAY to the Exceed display and restart the simulation.
I don't think I've ever seen this done except maybe in Plan 9; I think the displays are kind of bound to where it's currently running.
If you're running a console application you can run Screen as a utility, which lets you suspend the display (running in the background) then reconnect from another login later at another location.
I personally would look at running VNC server (which if you're running Ubuntu is in desktop sharing: system->preferences->remote desktop), just as you mentioned, and control your different access needs by connecting to your central workstation.
It seems to me like this should be do-able but I wanted to ask the experts to see if it is possible and if anyone has done it before.
