I've seen advice claiming that the latest input isn't available until Update(), but experimentally this is not true for any version of Unity I've tested.
Ensure you've assigned a valid component into your controller field in the inspector before running your game.
Add a Debug.Log to print out the name of the object in Start() to help track down the spare, uninitialized instance.
Instead, you can read and use your axis input in FixedUpdate() directly to get the latest info "hot off the presses."

It might be superstition left over from an older version, or an over-application of the rule to not naively handle instantaneous inputs (eg.
