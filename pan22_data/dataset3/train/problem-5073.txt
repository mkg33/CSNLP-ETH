There are much simpler ways to do this with add ons and other extra software, but the way it is intended to be done can be quite time consuming if you already have a large movie collection built in the Windows Media Center Library.
This will carry over and organize in WMC after you have opened your library, it make take a few minutes.
I've been using MyMovies to do that - it's good for both on the shelf dvds and downloaded movies (include auto import of information from amazon/imdb ...)
It works on Windows 7, gives you coverflow, poster view, themes, detail view, deep metadata search capabilities, filtering, advanced sorting, TV metadata (from thetvdb.com), Movie metadata (from themoviedb.org), ITunes trailer, DVR-MS metadata, podcast support and more.

Every File has properties and in the file that you're movies in their are spaces for you to input data, (ie) Director, producer, year, synopsis.
There are loads of Addons that do this kind of thing, this is one
Windows assumes that users input this data naturally however that normally isn't the case.
For cover art it is very simple but also time consuming, each movie file should be in its own subfolder within the folder you're collection is derived from, and in that folder a .jpg file should be inserted under the name "folder" (Lowercase) This .jpg will serve as the cover photo.
