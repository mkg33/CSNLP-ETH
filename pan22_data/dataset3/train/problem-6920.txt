It's not strictly a multi-monitor tool, and it performs some of the same functions as UltraMon (like moving windows between monitors), but it also provides the ability to resize/rearrange windows on a single monitor.
It doesn't do many things, but what it does, it does well.
You can configure which edges of your screens go to other systems.

For example, using Ctrl+Alt+Numpad 4 will move the window to the left half of the screen.
For situations that involve multiple systems (rather than monitors):
Exceptional for situations with single monitors, or low resolution multi-monitor setups.
Allows me to use the mouse to push on the edge of the screen to switch to the next desktop, and easily set up multiple tasks so I don't have to clutter my work area with a lot of unrelated windows when I'm working on multiple things at once.
Multiple desktops on windows, even for multi-monitor setups.
This is useful if you have a lot of screen real estate (e.g.
Basically does what UltraMon does, and it's freeware.
