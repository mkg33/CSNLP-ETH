We have done multiple power cycles, disabling the network adaptors, tried both network ports and get similar results (10.0.1.13 or 10.0.1.9)
I can't figure out what is going on other than some weird virus that has installed a virtual network layer of some sort.
Because it is a router with separate network, find the device by following the physical wire from that pc to where it leads.
The network control panel still shows just two network ports and they are configured for normal DHCP allocation.
Addresses are allocated starting with 100, so 192.168.10.100, 10.101, etc.
Find the 2nd router and disable DHCP or completely remove the device from the network.
The reason for this conclusion is the fact that the traceroute goes through both network.
Any device with just DHCP would cause internet to stop working.
One computer on the network recently started showing an IP address of 10.0.1.13 with a gateway of 10.0.1.1 and can still see the internet fine.
I ran netstat /b and don't see anything unusual, and have run a scan with MS Essentials that turned up clean.
Our work network router does DHCP in the 192.168.10.# range with gateway=192.168.10.1, behind a centurylink/qwest modem at 192.168.0.1.
A tracert of google shows what looks like another router in front of our normal router - here's an approximation:
It seems like someone plugged in a router in the network with a DHCP server which gives out the 10.0.1.1 range, and the WAN port is connected to the LAN in segment 192.168.10.x
