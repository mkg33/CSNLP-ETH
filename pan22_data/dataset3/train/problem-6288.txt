The vast bulk of power issues are due to lousy power supplies and the lower current requirement of the B+ may make them SEEM more reliable.
Have you an application which you have benchmarked which indicates over-clocking is effective.
I do not believe the power supply affects SD failure, as the SD Card runs off 3.3V (well regulated on all models) and the SOC runs off a combination of lower voltages.
You would be better using a Pi2 or Pi3, which have multi-core processors and more memory as well as a higher clock rate.
May I ask if it is true that if I activate turbo on the raspi-config, the pi  doesn't always run at the maximum speed at 1Ghz.
The B+, Pi2 & Pi3 all have similar power circuitry, which is also more efficient than that in earlier models, but no more reliable.
In 3 years, with 5 Pi I have had one SD failure (a new card which was replaced under warranty) and one corruption (during an upgrade) - plus a few "operator error" issues.
The Pi2 & Pi3 draw more current, which means they have more issues with poor supplies.
