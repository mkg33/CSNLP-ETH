I would like to only maintain one DNS server and when I go to create the AD DS role I have some interesting questions to answer...Do I set up the DNS options during the Promotion to Domain Controller steps?
In the domain controller options I have a checkbox for Domain Name System(DNS) server but I never added this role to Server B.
Do I add a new Forward Lookup Zone before the ADDS role is created?
Server A, Domain Controller with DNS Server and Exchange 2010 (domainA) Server B, New Server going to add AD DS role for new test domain and Exchange 2013.
I guess what I am asking if I need to set up a second domain to test Exchange 2013 for an application and I cannot use my current domain since I cannot have two exchange servers on the same domain, do I set up the domain role and how do I do this while staying with one DNS server?
I want this to be a new domain but i want to use the DNS from Server A....
During Deployment configuration I set up "Add a new forest" and then I name my domain.
