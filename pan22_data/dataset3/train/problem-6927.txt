Cloud providers allow you to dynamically add servers during heavy load.
In datacenter-grade equipment, you're looking at at least $1000/core currently, with large memories.
Have a huge process that needs to run for 3 days at the end of every month?
The time-value of money is what drives people to the Cloud.
I am currently 16 Cores Shared CPU VPS with 512MB of memory.
If your load doesn't fluctuate a lot or can be handled by a single server, then the cloud is probably not for you.
Please tell me the reasons why people are going for cloud service like RackspaceCloud, EC2, etc..?
I'm wondering why would people choose to go for cloud with budget about $50 a month for only about 1-2 cores of CPU power..
Versus $10,000 for having a server sitting around doing nothing for 25-28 days a month losing money.
A lot of that is underutilized, even using tools like Surgient or VMware/LabManager.
I'm thinking to upgrade to cloud, but it seems not worth it for me as it costs more, and lower spec (2 Cores and about the amount of RAM)
It may cost more in the long run, but can you get more for the dollar you have now, versus the dollar you MIGHT have then?
Because they have a services that will not be always on?
