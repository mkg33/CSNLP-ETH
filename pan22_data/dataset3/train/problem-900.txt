Finally I ended up with a single 27" wide Samsung monitor.
Working nicely imho for both my Win and OSX laptops.
So I decided to get 2 cheapo widescreen VESA-compliant 22" monitors and just join them together to make a bigass screen.
(you'll note there are many similar items that support from 1-4 monitors and most are well received and inexpensive.
As you suspected, you might run into problems with Clear Type font smoothing when in portrait mode since it assumes a vertical array of RGB (or BGR) pixel bands.
Combine that with any DisplayLink capable USB-video card (I use this, but there's ones that support 1920x1080), and any relatively new laptop can swing a dual monitor setup for about $400.
So that got me to thinking: what kind of tilting support do you need?
Dual LCD Monitor Stand desk clamp holds up to 22" lcd
Only full HD (1920x1080), but given the size of the display you can use small fonts and you gain lot of space.
Then I realized something when I saw a coworker just tilt his 16:9 monitor 90 degrees (most OS's support monitor orientation shift)... he's in legal so it makes total sense (he likes seeing a legal-sized page in entirety).
If this doesn't give reasonable results, try using old-style anti-aliasing instead (an option in Windows XP) or switching off font-smoothing altogether.
Try running the Clear Type Tuner (Control Panel on Windows 7 or download for Windows XP).
