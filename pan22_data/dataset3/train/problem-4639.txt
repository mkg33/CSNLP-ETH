Locate the timeout configuration and adjust it to fit your server.
It may be that you have a thread or two that stays open causing the value to revert.
If I have understood everything right, the MySQL command line client causes mysqld to use interactive_timeout instead of wait_timeout.
As for MySQL, have you tried looking to see if there are other my.cnf files that may be overriding the base one?
MySQL is currently set to a wait_timeout of 28800 on our server which I understand to be the default.
I'm afraid you might have run into one of the several gotchas of MySQL.
Apache isn't involved with this process so you can skip anything dealing with it.
The my.cnf seems to be the only such version of the file that I can find.
However, if I wait a minute or two, it reverts back to 28800 again.
Here's what I've tried while logged into Linux as root and MySQL as a database user:
SELECT @@global.wait_timeout, @@session.wait_timeout;
2) Editing the my.cnf file under /etc and adding the following line to both [mysqld] and [mysqld_safe]:
When I try #2, the option doesn't seem to take at all, even after restarting Apache and MySQL.
Also, instead of restarting actually shutdown the MySql server and then start it.
When I try #1 and choose to show the wait_timeout variable right after, it shows correctly as 60.
I've been attempting to change this to 60 as recommended by a consultant, but the changes don't seem to take for long.
