Stop those annoying Javadocs commenting the obvious.
Reading the Documentation at Oracle, it says »StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code.
It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead.«
But while skimming through the code, two questions come to my mind:
In order to understand 1 single line of code, I have to go through 6 lines of commenting junk, 1 line boilerplate Java and at least a closing bracket.
1) Why is this called a FastReader - besides the case, Chris mentioned, what makes it really fast?
Anybody with little experience knows what this one line does, so why spend time on commenting it?
So I could use directly a BufferedReader, read a line, and if necessary parse a line to an Integer.
At best, you have some kind of DSL which describes your Inputfile.
I see nothing special in your code, that makes it fast.
Why waste time and put a wrapper around concrete data.
In this case, I think, the whole idea is overengineered.
