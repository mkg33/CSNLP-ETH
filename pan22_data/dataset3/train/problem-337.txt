Consider if the inability to connect to the L2TP host only when OpenVPN is active/connected and if your OpenVPN connection is configured to 'tunnel all' or with a route that looks like 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0.
I ran Windows network diagnostics and surprisingly found some interesting information:
In your case you perhaps want this particular traffic to be permitted even when running almost all your internet traffic through OpenVPN.
Perhaps I would need to use the OpenVPN client instead of the NordVPN client to tweak such configurations?
The route table looks pretty sound, but it seems that OpenVPN is blocking the connection to the IP routed through my L2TP VPN.
Does anyone know of a way to really force the route to the L2TP VPN?
I think they install a Windows filter driver to achieve this and this driver makes sure only traffic going through the NordVPN tunnel is allowed.
If you take a peek at that post you can see that I have two VPNs.
A personal VPN from NordVPN, which is basically a OpenVPN TAP-network under the hood, and a L2TP VPN, which I use solely for connecting to one IP address.
It might be that OpenVPN is trying to prevent other connections as part of a 'leak protection' service.
This can also happen with DNS requests so various solutions implement some kind of protections to block such traffic.
I'm assuming that this "filter" is on the OpenVPN server.
This is technically a cross-post from a post I made on SuperUser, because I wanted to get some other opinions.
According to this article, NordVPN supports a kill-switch feature for protecting your privacy.
Crafty websites can prompt your browser to make connections otherwise than through your VPN tunnel to reveal('leak') your direct IP address or identifiable etc.
