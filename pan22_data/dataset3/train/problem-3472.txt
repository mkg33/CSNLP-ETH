or if you want to change your skybox each time interval use insideout shader which you can get it

Not sure if my idea is logic or if there are a better ways to do it.
Or it's more logic to say to move the new camera that the skybox is with in it in the new layer.
This is a screenshot when the game is running then i can see the skybox in scene view and game view:
For example the space station is moving around the star or moving to the star.
I have in the Hierarchy a RigiBbodyFPSController and a child MainCamera.
If you want to rotate or move your skybox which can be possible
and link it with sphere using material, add your skybox texture in it.
Moving the new camera and the skybox to new layer and move the skybox ?
The general idea is to make movement effect like the space station is moving around the star or to the star.
I can't see the skybox in the scene view i see it only when running the game in the game view.
and change that sphere by each interval,scale it as much that your rest of models will fit in and look like skybox.that might help you in your project
But instead moving the space station i think it will be better to make effect of the skybox moving.
