I had the Unifying device plugged into the front USB sockets of my desktop PC, but it was on the ground under the desk.
I've noticed that on some machines when windows is busy with the network it can affect the mouse and launching apps as well.
This may be exacerbated if WiFi and the (dongleless Bluetooth) mouse share the same "radio" hardware in the computer.
moving logitech usb to back of computer rather than on top (it was very close to the wifi device) worked for me.
I had no problems when I plugged the Unifying device into a laptop, and this now makes sense, because it was so close to the mouse.
Make sure you have the very latest wireless networking drivers and ensure you've done a windows update as well and see whether that helps.
Though the two are supposed to operate independently, they may not do so in retry/recovery scenarios.
When the system is encountering network errors and performing retries the network software is apt to "lock out" other activities for brief periods of time.
Distance gained by move was only about 2 feet actual, but that was all needed to solve the jerky pointer problem.
I've seen this issue with my wireless mouse, as it is in a similar frequency range to wifi - I resolved the issue by moving my wireless mouse dongle further away from the wifi antenna at the rear of my PC.
Because this worked, I surmise the jerky pointer issue was about Wifi/mouse transmissions interfering with each other as Will suggested.
Now it is much closer to the mouse there are no more problems.
It's probably related to the networking and networking drivers in windows.
I just resolved the problem using a USB extension cable.
So the mouse movements (or keyboard clicks) may be being received from the mouse (or keyboard) just fine, but the software can't "service" them.
I'm confused as to why a wired keyboard would suffer the same fate though... something you'll have to come back to if this resolves the wireless mouse issue I guess?
