The card was not overheating or anything apparent.
When it crashes, run your fingers over the hardware and touch all parts.
WeÂ´re on superuser here, you have a couple of disks lying around, havent you?
In my experience, the CPU never got all that hot, but the temperature would spike and cause a shutdown.
Right click on my computer > Properties > Select the 'Advanced' tab > and under 'startup and recovery' click the 'settings' button.
I've had a similar problem in the past with my P4.
If anything is so hot you remove your fingers instantly, it is too hot.
51C is not especially hot for a CPU, but do you know the temp of your GPU (the processor on your video card)?
What fixed it for me was replacing the "goo" that sits between the CPU and the heat sink.
From what you tell, my first guess is the system gets too hot.
I swapped out the card for an old one I still had and all the issues stopped.
Try having the computer run 48hrs on memtest in the end.
If the computer runs more than an hour with that, start looking for other stuff.
If it is rebooting without a BSOD or other error being displayed, you could investigate the Windows Crash Recovery settings which may give more clues.
It had a vaguely voodoo feeling to it, but I picked up a $10 tube of the pretty good stuff at Fry's, reattached the heat sink and the the problem went away.
The goo that came with the CPU had essentially dried out over the years and was no longer making much of a connection.
Also, the part with the photo of Elkos is a good idea.
Thats not just the CPU, but any part like the RAM, the power converter, stuff like that.
This will open a new window, and under the 'System Failure' heading, uncheck 'Automatically restart.'
Download the current release, burn and boot the CD.
Download the "ultimate boot cd" and fiddle with what it has to offer.
I had nVidia driver issues once which were causing exactly these sort of random reboots.
