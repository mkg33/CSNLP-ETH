Is smb tunneling over ssh (with putty) a better solution?
Depending on how you configure it, you can point your authentication at a centralized location.
The downside to WebDav, is that is is an extension of the HTTP protocol.
As an example, I have run WebDav using Apache with LDAP auth.
If there is no major difference I would choose Webdav
That, was my biggest problem with WebDav as a system.
If your WebDAV client is fully-featured and works well I'd highly recommend that over SMB over anything in a WAN scenario.
Unless you do some magic then the files on disk will be owned by the webserver user.
That being said, for anything bigger than a single network it is likely going to be better than SMB.
WebDAV over SSL is as secure as the SSL implementations in the server and the client, the mechanism used for user authentication, and your trust with the certificates in use to authenticate the server computer and, if you're really paranoid, to authenticate the client computer (mutual SSL authentication isn't common, but it's certainly possible and used in many security-conscious deloypments).
Single network being organizational, not broadcast domain.
I think that in both case you want to do a performance test to see which one will be faster when used with SSL/SSH.
If you use SSL, then you have encryption in transit.
As Evan Anderson said, webdav can be made fairly secure.
