Are you running Wi-Fi certified firmware on your AP?
Is there any chance your equipment is from two different regulatory domains?
I don't think that the original slot is bad (since it previously had a video card connected there), but it works now so I'm not going to worry about it too much.
Are the antennas out in the open and not inside your enclosure?
Sorry to ask this, but is there any chance you forgot to attach the antenna array to the back of the PCI card?
By the way, a 1st gen MacBook from 2006 has an a/b/g card, unless you meant a 1st gen iBook from 1999.
There could be an internal interference source inside your PC enclosure that's hurting part of the band.
Open source firmware projects like DD-WRT and Tomato never go through Wi-Fi interoperability certification, so their level of correctness is an unknown quantity.
When it was moved to another PCI slot, it could see (and connect) to the wireless network.
If the AP and MacBook are both from Europe, you could have them on channel 12 or 13, but if the PCI card is from the US or Canada, it may not support those two channels.
Did you try putting the PCI card into IBSS (a.k.a.
I'd also temporarily try no encryption just in case.
"ad hoc", "computer to computer") network mode, or software access point mode, and see if you can see it from the MacBook?
