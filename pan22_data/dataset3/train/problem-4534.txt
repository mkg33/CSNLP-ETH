To add a Linux machine to an Active Directory domain, you will need:
It might very well be part of the Linux distribution that you have installed.
I'd suggest looking at an excellent public domain package called Samba.
Basically I have a Linux computer and I'd like it (or my user on that computer) to be associated with my user on the Domain, so that I can browse the network and all that stuff windows has.
In order to get all the benefits and security of AD, you'll need a solution involving Kerberos (for authentication) and LDAP (for authorization).
Sorry if I am misusing terms here; I actually don't know much about Active Directory and the related technologies.
It's more complex to implement than just using samba/winbindd, but you'll get the benefit of being able to use the UNIX attributes in AD to manage your linux users, groups, uids, gids, etc.
What do I need to look into to do something like this?
There's an excellent tutorial here that I've used in the past and it works amazingly well.
Set up pam_krb5, authenticating to the KDC of the AD domain.
