My work around was changing the margin size to narrow, and all the borders seemed to show up in print preview.
I then set it to the custom margin setting with .375" on the sides, and the borders were still there, although any bigger of a margin and the borders seemed to disappear again.
What solved the problem was to change the cell format type from accounting to text.
None of the above worked for me, i did not want gridlines shown.
I had the same problem where I had created some small cells with a surround border for the purpose of entering a check mark if a condition applied.
There are 4 sub-sections there namely: Page Setup, View, Print and Window.
What helped was at sheet option i changed print from draft to black n white.
Under the Print sub-section, check the Gridlines option.
The complete cell border would be visible and would print prior to anything being in the cell but when I entered a check mark the left side of the border would disappear.
a version later than Office 2010), Navigate to the Layout tab.
When the borders disappear, you can get them back by changing the column width, by even .001" and the border will reappear in the print preview, although that may cause a border somewhere else to disappear.
For example if your last line with the border is line 20, drag it a bit and then check again the print preview.
I have been having the same problem, and have not found any answers online.
