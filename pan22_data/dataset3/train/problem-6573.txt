Randomized Methods in Computation: Tentative Collection of Reading Materials
Regardless of what a few grouchy internet reviewers claim, the book covers all of the most important topics in elementary probability clearly and with strong motivating examples.
Just to add to the suggestions others have given, this note by Oded Goldreich is one of the most useful ones I've found so far.
It gives a lot of examples of how probability is used in various branches Computer Science.
Another classic of TCS/Combinatorics oriented probability is Alon and Spencer's The Probabilistic Method.

Much of probability is figuring out the size of your universe, and from there figuring out which fraction of your universe you are interested in.
The canonical undergraduate textbook for probability theory remains A First Course in Probability by Sheldon Ross.
The references at the end of the book are also definitely worth looking at.
This book is used for an intro probability class at MIT.
The book is an excellent reference/refresher for everyone else.
