I don't think there is an easy way to make this hack work.
When you BCC someone, they can see the "To" email address.
When a mail with multiple recipients is sent, the MTA then sends a copy of that email to each person in the recipients list.
I don't know of a way to do that, but to accomplish what you can to accomplish (Assuming it doesn't matter who you want in the TO field) you can address it to DONOTREPLY@My.org, most people get the message.
So everyone will get an email from you, addressed to you and thats it.
If your BCC recipients are on a different server than your TO recipient then you might be able to block the IP address of the to: recipient, although it might stop the entire email from going through depending on how the mail transfer agent works...
I don't think you can block the sending to the "To" address.. unless I'm not aware of new things that is out there.
Though in all honesty, using postfix to do Always-BCC with an alias (that sends to /dev/null) might be cleaner.
Basically, we want to make it look like an email was sent to the TO person for all of the BCC people but not actually send the email to the TO person
They can only see the email address as an information.
Whether the email is actually sent / rejected / bounced / marked as spam / etc by the receiving address, it won't matter as the people BCCed won't see them and they won't know nor care whether it get sent or not.
Is it possible to address an email to a specific user and BCC someone then prevent the email from going to the TO person while still allowing the BBC email to go through?
They can't even check if it is actually sent or not.
If the person in the To: field is non-existent, you will get a non delivery receipt for the To:, but the BCC will go through.
