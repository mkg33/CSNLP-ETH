You remember that the question doesn’t just ask which of the options produces some result, but which one is best to use.
Then by summing at axis 1 (y axis), we add each row numbers to a single number (much like the solution with the for loop in $2$).
On every run we will get a number, so after 5 times, we will have created a vector of size [1,5] with our product.
First by doing $matrix1 * vector1$ we end up with this matrix
To multiply two matrices with [ROWS x COLUMNS] the columns of the first must match in size the rows of the second, so we need a scenario like the following.
Now let’s play with each possible answer and see what fits and what not!
Here we try to make matrix multiplication at [1,10]*[5,10].
We have an **exception **here, so (1) cannot be correct.
So from the example above, we are allowed to multiply since the inner dimensions of the two matrices match, and we will gain a new matrix with the outer dimensions of the two matrices.
Remember the question asks for “the best way to computate the inner product”, so there should be more than one ways that works, right?
However, this answer is better than the answer (2) since it is computationally cheaper, since in answer 2 we make a for loop, while here we get the result with a single algebraic calculation.
So for 5 times, we will multiply each element of the matrix by the equivalent element of the vector and add them together.
The resulting matrix is a [5,1] matrix and gives the same result as with the case of answer (2).
The resulting matrix will have the dimensions of the outer dimensions of the two matrices
Our resulting matrix will be [A,N] dimensions in this case.
We have an exception here, so (3) cannot be correct.
We cannot have a dot product since [1,10] * [5,10] don’t match the inner requirements for matrix multiplication.
But before we do, let’s see how matrix multiplication works.
The inner dimensions don’t match and we have the same problem as with (1).
Now lets actually create a vector and a matrix with numpy
With Numpy, what’s the best way to compute the inner product of a vector of size 10 with each row in a matrix of size (5, 10)?
