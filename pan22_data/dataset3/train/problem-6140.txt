You should always make backups if you don't have at least RAID 1/5/6/10 etc.
There are a lot more examples of this and people have used SSD-baking to fix drives not being recognised by the host PC, read/write errors and more.
I haven't tried this solution myself, but quite a few articles on the web are referring to over-heating the SSD (in the oven!)
By dead I mean: Not recognized by any OS/Controller and no physical damage
You can also use windows machine to upgrade the SSD firmware, so that the same soft issue won't happen again.
I already had this particular case and to my surprise the following procedure is working:
Many issues with SSDs are soft issues which can be fixed by formatting the drive.

John Gude references this BBC piece in the comments of another article (http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/data-recovered-failed-ssd/) as the inspiration for his solution to a failed SSD which he baked at 250 fahrenheit.
For example, when you are facing read or write errors, you can perform following procedure (using Linux operating system):
The only way to recover data from SSD is to send it to data recovery laboratory.

Most read and write issues with SSDs and also USB Drives can be resolved this way.
For Crucial SSDs there is a method to get dead looking drives back to normal.
