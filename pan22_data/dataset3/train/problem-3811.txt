That should point you in the direction whether this could be an issue with your WLAN adapter.
If Proxy details have been configured in this section and you are not expecting them to be, feel free to remove.
The latency that you are seeing when pinging your next hop (192.168.10.253) is ludicrously high.
If it only seems slow for yourself you will need to investigate your Computer.
Aside from your partner's device, can you test the ping latency from another device connected to that AP?
If no proxy settings are configured, look within the TeamViewer network settings to see if a Proxy has been manually configured for whatever reason.
The first place to check will be Control Panel > Internet Options > Connections tab > LAN Settings.
Although it is possible that malicious software has confirmed proxy settings on your PC, this should not impact ICMP (ping) traffic as only web traffic is proxied.
Try connecting via LAN and run the same ping tests.
Regarding Teamviewer, I believe the TeamViewer client will try to use the system proxy settings by default (if any are configured).
