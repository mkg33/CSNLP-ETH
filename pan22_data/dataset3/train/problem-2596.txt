Of course, there are multiple ways to set this up, with the simplest being a separate subnet on each ethernet port.
However, without providing a router make/model, we wont be able to give you instructions.
when a device sends a packet to the router, the router will then forward the packet to either the other local network, or your internet (WAN) connection (assuming a 'home' set up).
Can the same router "host" 2+ subnets of the same parent network?
Some routers can listen on multiple IP addresses on multiple subnets (usually one IP per subnet).
As mentioned by others, not all routers will do this; I believe DD-WRT and Tomato has these features, and personally I have a MikroTik router at home which works well with a similar set up.
I was wondering, in networking, what is the relationship of routers to networks?
Can the same router be the gateway for 2+ networks?
When a device tries to send a packet to another network (outside its subnet), it will send the packet to the router, so the router can forward the packet as needed (this is a simplification).
For example, if I have a wireless router at home, can I configure it to "host" 2 home distinct LANs from it?
