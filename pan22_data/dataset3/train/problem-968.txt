In this case, I wouldn't use it for temp directory ops, like /tmp, /var/tmp, /var/run, and swap.
For my desktop, I moved the files that I used frequently on the SSD device,
/usr might be the next place, if you have enough space for it.
If you didn't buy a high-end SSD, wear and reliability are a bigger issue.
(there are various other suggestions re: SSDs in that thread as well)
For the partitions you may not be sure (tmp, swap1, swap2, opt), you can try without moving
This screams editing, and high-bandwidth applications like A/V work.
I would venture to use memory based file systems for this, but it's a bit harder to set up, and can be a little risky if you don't know what you're doing.
them and use the iostat -p command to see how often they are accessed.
Based on what I've read, LVM may not be the best choice with SSD since currently there's currently no TRIM support if you use LVM:
I agree with using the SSD for some caching operations, but you should probably critically examine the exact use case.

This is probably your home directory, but might be a special directory elsewhere, even a mount point under your home.
The SSDs shine where you can have random read/write without having to move disk heads.
Most of your binaries and libraries are in /usr, and can benefit from the random read order the SSD will provide.
