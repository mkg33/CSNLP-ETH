It could be that you have some system files stored on the drive (pagefile, or user profiles), but most likely the problem is that the Windows Search Service is indexing the drive.
Remove the drive letter assignment from the volume manager in the control panel and reboot.
Use the disk management console to unmount the volumes on the drive.
That way there's no high-level access possible to that drive and that might be just enough to allow VMware to access the drive.
Within disk management, right click on all partitions on the target drive, select the drive letter, and click "remove".
Use the LockDismount utility referred to in this boot-land.net post to temporarily unmount the drive from the Windows volume manager.
If your can't obtain a lock, that says that the system is using the disk for some reason.
(I have a German Windows so I can't tell you the exact name)
To see what handles (files) are open on your external drive
This is mostly speculation, but have you tried disabling the volume (but not the whole device) in device manager?
This will unmount the volume(s) and should allow your tools to have full access.
