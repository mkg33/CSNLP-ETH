Executing DBCC OPENTRAN (tempdb) may show an open transaction with sort_init in the description.
A suitable covering index that would avoid the need to sort in your query is:
This open transaction can prevent tempdb log space being reused until the sort completes.
In addition, the sort starts a system transaction in tempdb to ensure sort allocations are correctly undone in case the transaction aborts.
You should also review the SQL Server product documentation and this article to determine how to configure your tempdb database optimally for your workload.
The allocation of sort run space in tempdb is a logged operation, which directly contributes to tempdb log space usage.
You can verify this is occurring by looking for a Sort or Top N Sort operator in the execution plan:
When an explicit sort is needed, if SQL Server does not (or cannot) allocate sufficient memory to perform the sort entirely in memory, it will use tempdb.
Without a suitable index, SQL Server has to perform a full sort of the data to satisfy your query.
