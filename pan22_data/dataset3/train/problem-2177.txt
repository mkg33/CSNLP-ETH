You won't have any control over where the saved file lives on the machine though and likely won't be able to read it back in unless you have the user navigate to it themselves.
I don't know anything about cocos2d but this is really a question about JS.
With JavaScript you don't have a way to persist things transparently other than local storage.
First you can fake your browser into thinking you want to download something, you can do this by using a library like https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js.
The second option is just to accept localStorage's limitations.
Depending on what you are trying to achieve this is probably a good way to go, just know that not all browsers support it and the amount of data you can store is limited.
The third option is to use a server to handle saving the file.
You can write your own or use something like Firebase which is awesome and has a free tier that is pretty solid.
If you really need something persisted you have a couple options.
I know you asked for how to store something locally, but I think this is your best bet unless you can't require an internet connection.
