I'm trying to apply automatic fine tuning to a MLPRegressor with Scikit learn.
Furthermore, i know that the dataset is too small for a MLP, the idea is program the model now and use it later in a larger dataset.
After reading around, I decided to use GridSearchCV to choose the most suitable hyperparameters.
The dataset is a list of 105 integers (monthly Champagne sales).
Before that, I've applied a MinMaxScaler preprocessing.
The problem is that for some reason the GridSearchCV isn't operating (at least correctly, I think).

However, MLPRegressor hidden_layer_sizes is a tuple, please change it to:
Although, the final dataset is not very large, so I'll be very thankful of hear any idea to improve the accuracy of the model in a small datasets!
It would be helpful to get the ouput of the program (or at least the error thrown)
When I print the parameters used by the model, appear some values out of the range defined in param_list.
