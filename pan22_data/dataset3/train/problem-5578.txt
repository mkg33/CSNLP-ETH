When used in the auth group, this module automatically updates the Samba account upon logging in.
Just for the record, I have been struggling with this problem and after trying different solutions, I have found the one that seems to work.
Is there anything I missed, or is what I'm trying to do not possible?
So a sudo apt-get remove libpam-smbpass fixed the problem.
Then to prevent the Samba Password from sync with the Unix Password on next login do the following:
I have disabled the unix password sync option, but the Samba password eventually gets replaced by the shell login password.
If you disable it, your passwords will remain separate.
Your Samba password is replaced because you have pam_smbpasswd enabled in your PAM configuration.
I need Samba to use a different set of credentials for home shares.
you should search "pam_smbpass" instead "pam_smbpasswd"
The unix password sync option is for the opposite direction â€“ it causes the Unix password to be updated when Samba is told to change its own account database.
Then from the interface that pops up Un-check "SMB password synchronization" and hit "OK"
The shell login password is different from the Samba login password.
