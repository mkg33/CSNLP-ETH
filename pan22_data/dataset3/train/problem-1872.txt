You may wish to connect to a proxyserver (search for one on google).
your DNS change can take up to 48 hours to filter down through all DNS resolvers.
Just sit back and wait, if you can not get to in 24 hours you might want to contact the oporator of the nameservers.
Your problem will probably be solved within 48h, but in the meantime, if you need your pc to translate ablazex.com to another IP then the one your DNS comes up with, you can add the IP in your host file.
This will flush the dns cache of your PC and maybe solves your problem, be sure to restart your browser after editing the host-file or flushing your DNS cache.
Once your external  IP is different (as confirmed by checking on cmyip.com), do the following:
Sometimes the only problem is your PC's DNS cache.
Why is that when I try to access the site or even ping it, it still resolves to the old server?

I have a domain for which I updated the nameservers to point to my new server not long (~ 1 hour) ago:
This is something that can not be avoided in almost all cases.
In windows it's at c:/Windows/System32/Drivers/Etc/Hosts, you can edit it with notepad and add the following line:
If it is possible that you can instruct the users in person, you can also ask them to execute on cmd "ipconfig /flushdns" and restart all browser of user's computer.
The problem is that your internet provider (or internal network's) cached DNS server has not yet been refreshed.
Same thing happened with me but since I was knowing that the TTL should be reduces prior doing server transfer so I did following and it solved my problem.
Presuming your using Windows, you can type in a command prompt:
Where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP you want ablazex.com to point to.
