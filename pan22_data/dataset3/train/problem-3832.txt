I think that a reasonable next step is showing them variables with an I/O basis.
At this point, we would have introduced: types, input (and output), repetition, conditionals, and possibly some mathematics.
Then a conditional can be introduced that does or does not print their name depending on some boolean expression or similar.
The "Hello World" program gets the ball rolling because you can ask, "How is text stored?
It connects programming to mathematics, and introduces lists, loops, and if conditions in a fairly simple wait, with an interesting story.
I very much like "The Devil and Daniel Webster", as introduced to me by Devika Subramanian.
I agree with the answer proposing Hello name, and the answer that proposes students inputting their name and then repeating it x times.

The lecture notes I've found for them are below, but the problem is:
Students need to know what kinds of data are "understood" by a language.
Are there other types of data that can be stored as well?"
