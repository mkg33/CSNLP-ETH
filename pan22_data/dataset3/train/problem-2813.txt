Especially that the global file settings don't take precedence.
Remove (or comment out) every SSLProtocol ALL -SSLv2 -SSLv3 line and change them into your SSLProtocol TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2.
I found this issue on Bugzilla and was going through it when later on someone mentioned that Let's Encrypt has an isolated file /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf within this file there is a setting:
I managed to solve this and it was definitely an unexpected fix.
Using virtualhosts it's keeping the first vhost option for all further vhosts.
When you have multiple TLS VirtualHosts and use Server Name Indication (SNI) it is an allowed syntax to have a SSLProtocol  directive for each VirtualHost, but unless you have IP VirtualHosts in practice the settings for the SSLProtocol directive from the first VirtualHost are used for the whole server and/or all name-based VirtualHosts supporting TLS1.
The fact that Virtual Hosts inherit their siblings settings is a bad decision in my opinion.
No need to specify -all if you only enable what you need.
Certbot automatically installs a reference to this file in the virtual host configuration, and that cert happened to be installed on the first Virtual Host in my server configuration.
Only disabling those two would still allow TLSv1.0.
I changed it to match my previous setting of SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1.1 +TLSv1.2 and it worked perfectly.
At least this happens in CentOS 7.6 running Apache (httpd) 2.4.6.
