Quick Way to Find Process/File Open that is Preventing Unmount:
The 2 most reliable ways are ones that nobody has suggested yet because they are sometimes the most inconvenient:
Double click to highlight the process in the main window (top) and file (bottom).
Or the AV is monitoring the drive - turn off AV to test this.
Often this will be because the drive is being indexed; right click the drive>properties, and uncheck index.
From there you can right-click the process to kill it or right-click the file to close the file handle.
After changing the drive letter i could savely remove it.....
This will show you all the open files on your removable volume, the processes that own the file handle and the PIDs of the processes.
With Process Explorer (free download) this is really easy.
In my case, even though the remote computer was off, it still had a lock on the directories.
I could not kill the accessing process cause it was PID 4 (system itself), which opened H:\$EXTEND..... (did see it in Process Explorer).
If it's none of the pedestrian/common options, it could be you have the drive listed as 'shared' on a network and have accessed it via another computer.
WOW, Windows is a never ending adventure game..... :))))
