(bearing in mind you will have to clear cache file which gets generated in mysql-cluster/ folder) and ps aux | grep ndb or ps aux | grep sql exit them all before trying it out.
Your config file looks to be pointing only to 1x SQL node.
Another way to check is to find by typing all report memory and check if it has replicated the data only then proceed if it has.
However, when I start everything up and show the nodes, I see this:
I want the management server and two data nodes to run on mysql1 and two other data nodes to run on mysql2.
It happens because your data nodes are still starting.
What do I have to do to get 3 and 4 in one group and 13 and 14 in another?
With this configuration I would expect, as per the MySQL Cluster documentation, that the two data nodes 3 and 4 would be in nodegroup 0, while the two data nodes 13 and 14 would be in nodegroup 1.
Start them one by one, this way it will connect two data nodes to each SQL Node.
Node-group IDs should be shown correctly once they are started completely.
Wait and be patient till it connects and shows automatically on ndb_mgm > console that node x: has been started only then proceed.
Put "NodeGroup" value in each data node and it will solve it .
