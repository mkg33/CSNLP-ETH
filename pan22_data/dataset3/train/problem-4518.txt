They also offer a commercial version called LDAP Administrator, but I've no experience with that product.
I certainly recommend the freeware version though!
For more complex scenearios I prefer Apache Directory Studio.
If you're only concerned about Windows and Active Directory, adsiedit.msc is hard to beat.
Ldap Admin is free Win32 administration tool for LDAP directory management.
I've used Softerra LDAP Browser (http://www.ldapadministrator.com/) before in the past.
It lets you get right in under the bonnet with absolutely everything.
ldapvi - it returns the results of the search into $EDITOR, where you can change all of them at once, then just save and it handles the details.
Better hope you don't have admin rights when you're using it though!
Is pretty lightweight and useful for simple query operations.
As for a more heavyweight LDAP browser, I second Apache Directory Studio.
Would something like phpLDAPadmin be like what you're looking for?
It's reasonably lightweight (GUI based, but pretty nice for perusing LDAP - made my life easier on multiple occasions!).
