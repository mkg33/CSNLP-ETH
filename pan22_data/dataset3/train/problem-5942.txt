The things that can be implemented with the standard password policies are described here.
One of the possible options is to prevent reusing passwords.
As far as I am aware this only prevents users from using identical passwords, it does not prevent them from using identical passwords.
There are hooks where an application can intercept the password change request and get an unencrypted version of the password.
This is another standard option that can be set on a domain.
When the password is being changed the application would probably decrypt all the passwords and use something like the levenshtein distance to see if the passwords where different enough.
Here is one OSS project that provides a hook (http://passwdhk.sourceforge.net/).
The administrator can set how many old passwords are saved.
Another possibility is that the password could be stored with reversible encryption.
Most security experts suggest that enabling this is a very bad idea.
Presumably, the mentioned grabs the passwords they are being changed and then stores them using a reversible encryption.
When the password changes are made a reversible version of the password is transmitted to the domain controller.
