My answer assumes that you are on the server side, although similar reasoning also applies on the client side.
Is it too soon to be considering this move as it looks like much of the networking gear and OSen are ready for it?
Usually you don't switch from IPv4 to IPv6, you go from IPv4-only to dual stacked networking: IPv4 and IPv6 combined.
The question is now two years old, but the issue still exists.
In that way you can steadily progress to an all IPv6 environment once IPv4 is getting faced out.
I think you should first opt to run a dual stack, meaning to run IPv4 and IPv6 next to each other.
I am thinking of upgrading our networking situation and am considering a migration of IPv4 to IPv6.
It certainly isn't too soon to start implementing IPv6: we're rapidly running out of available IPv4 space.
As long as most users use IPv4, problems on the IPv6 side may go unreported and undetected for hours.
The main problem is that the number of support calls will go up dramatically.
Get to the point where you can simply flip the switch by adding AAAA records to your DNS.
You will have to deal with two main problems: people whose IPv6 is simply misconfigured, and ISPs whose IPv6 is flaky.
Some countries do not speak IPv4 anymore (like China) and others haven't opted in for IPv6 or only partially.
The IPV6-only internet is very, very limited at this moment.
