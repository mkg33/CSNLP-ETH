Looks like OpenSUSE installed a boot loader which chains (loads) to the Windows boot loader.
I would bet the black screens are from some form of Secure Boot which is on by default on any Windows 8 supported hardware.
(Or try Windows 8's new restore function: http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/http-wwwbleepingcomputercom-tutorials-automatically-repair-windows-8-with-automatic-repair-/)

Instead of dual booting use a Virtual machine (Vmware or Virtualbox) and install Linux to that.
Secure boot was designed to prevent what you are trying to do now (if you were some malice guy trying to get into Windows).
Windows was teased as a smaller OS, and developed differently than all the other OS's.
Windows does not like to follow any standard or convention and likes to do things his own way.
This is default on all Linux installations because Windows just doesn't like to share his toys (its bootloader).
Just run the Windows 8 installer disk and click "Repair Windows" when prompted.
