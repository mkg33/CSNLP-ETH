We login via a web page using our DS Gold cards and a pin and the get the option to open a terminal services session to a server.
We can also RDP to our own servers from their or vnc to our own desktops.
From a google of that it appears we are using software from HOB.
You can even take advantage of having multiple screens at home.
A new option they have just added for those of us with the new standardised desktops is to instead of choosing to connect to a terminal server we can now connect to our own desktops.
All you need on the client pc is a web browser and Java.
I'm only a user, so I don't know the specific set-up.
On the terminal servers we have installed the basic applications we need; MS office, SQL client, putty, various in-house apps, etc.
Can't comment on the administration, setup or TCO.
Were I work we are actively encouraged to use our home machines rather than use work laptops.
The only clue to what we use is the name of the java applet.
Probably HOB WTS Computing and HOB Desktop-on-Demand.
Using this method we are always using the company's own machines for working on.
There must be tens of thousands within our company that take advantage of this and it is a strategic part of our continuity of business plans.
