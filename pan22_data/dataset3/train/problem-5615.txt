Is there a way to block the copying of a company logo when sent in an email signature?
No, there is absolutely no reasnoable way to block it.
Supposedly this can be done, but the only 'sort-of' answer I found was using Information Rights Management, and I am unsure how or if that really works, or if its worth the hassle on an SMB (40 email users) kind of budget.
Obviously, this does not means that he can not (and sometime, he should) put a discaimer stating that all images (and/or other contents) are copyright of its company.
Information Rights Management is overkill (even that is an understatement) and way to expensive.
You should really explain this to your customer: he has to understand that, when he put any content on the internet, you basically lose control over it.
As you already knew, this is eventually the way it works even for the most computer-illiterate users.
This may be a pointless exercise, but after searching web for answers, I have not really come up with any answer.
But for a client who is asking, I'd like to know if its possible regardless so I can furnish some sort of legitimate response.
And if the image is not embedded, then it can be saved from the webpage it is placed.
But images in signatures will also be sent directly to the recipient in most cases, so he can simply save the file on the disk.
You can use the very same example you wrote above (screenshot, photo, etc) to explain it the basic problem.
I realize that if someone REALLY wants to copy a logo for ill intent, they will do so no matter what.
Basically it's like that: If the receipient sees the image, he can save it to disk because you have no control over his computer or what he is doing with it.
If they don't, they don't see the image in the first place.
