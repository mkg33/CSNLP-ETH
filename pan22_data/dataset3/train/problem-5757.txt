We then apply all patches contained in the package.
They have one configuration ini in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini which contains settings for apache+php and another configuration ini in /etc/php5/cli/php.ini for php cli.
of course make && make install or whatever you need to do at the end.
that is the best way to confirm what you are currently working with is actually what you will compile with.
let's say you get the source package for PHP in Debian 7
when you compile php, you will need to compile it twice.
if you want to apply it just for the php.ini location, in for example PHP 5.3 source, you can try to delete in debian/patches/ all of the files except 0004-006-debian_quirks.patch and then move it in the PHP 5.3 folder.
All further steps assume you are in this directory.
./configure <more-configs-here> --prefix=/some/prefix/dir --with-apxs2=/path/to/your/apache --disable-cli --disable-cgi --with-config-file-path=/etc/php5/apache2
We will create a patch that fits in this hierarchy using the tool called
<?php print phpinfo();?> will give you your config command for mod_php.
Be sure to look over the scripts, there may be more configuration related to this, that I am not seeing with a quick grep.
On a Debian/Ubuntu system do an apt-get source php5, to get the source package, which will include all the build scripts, and patches that are used.
./configure <more-configs-here> --prefix=/some/prefix/dir --with-config-file-path=/etc/php5/cli
In this directory, you can find the "debian" subdirectory, which contains a "debian/patches" directory which contains the patches that
a simple php -i for your cli version will give you your cli config command.
I'm looking at the ubuntu sets up php for both apache (mod_php) and php cli.
it is importantly to not configure apxs2 while you are configuring your cli.
On Debian/Ubuntu packages these paths appear to be modified via the patches/006-debian_quirks.patch patch that is applied as part of the packaging process.
so what you can do is first check out your php info for the mod_php and than your cli.
The quilt patch system manages a stack of patches to the original source.
