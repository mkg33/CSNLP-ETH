Yes there is a lot of literature about object detection using RNNs and it often consists of object detection and tracking in videos or action detection.
Actually, I do not think it should be a good way of using RNN only to do object detection work, because there is no "Receptive Field" conception in RNN compared with CNN, which I think should be a key point in doing vision related task.
You can try this https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/lstm_object_detection.
The link of paper: http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Liu_Mobile_Video_Object_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf
It implementation from Tensorflow mobile video object detection implementation proposed in the following paper: Mobile Video Object Detection with Temporally-Aware Feature Maps (CVPR 2018).
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are the state of the art algorithm for sequential data and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are an extension for RNN.
This method can be used on object detection in case detect object in video or moving images, etc.
