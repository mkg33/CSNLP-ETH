Standard options for me to check would be the following, but this has been done by you or does not match exactly because the backup at least starts:
Error code 27 suggests "The drive cannot find the sector requested.
Database backups are failing for all (larger) Databases on a particular server.
MS SQL Server 2008 running on Windows Server 2008R2 (Virtualized)
I tried manually copying one of the old backups to the drive using Windows Explorer.
Backup to a USB-Drive / Stick is usually a very bad idea because of this.
I've tried failing the VM to the other node, but this doesn't help.
This issue has been puzzling me for some time now and I'm running out of ideas!
I created a new blank database and was able to back this up.
Next step would be to check throughput of backup drive because SQL Server backup is sensible in this area, some timers in the background are watching.
Manual backups of the main Databases fail (using 'right click' or TSQL).
It feels like a problem with the drives, however it's only an issue from within SQL Server.
I am able to backup the system databases without any trouble.
They get to 30% and the fail as if they have run out of space.
This is a virtual server running on a two node cluster.
Tried splitting the backup into five parts, but the job starts hanging again at 30%.
There is plenty of available space on backup drive, and I have tried backing up to other drives on the server which also fail.
