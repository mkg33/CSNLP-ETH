Say Palo Alto has external IP 1.1.1.1 and CP has 2.2.2.2.
Some log output the CP admin talked about gave me the idea, that CPs use Strong Swan, and I have been able to replicate the above behaviour using my PA and Strong Swan on a Linux box.
Pinging 2.2.2.2 from PA and watching the sniffer shows why: PA sends an unencrypted ICMP echo request, which is not answered.
These are the IPs they use to communicate to each other, and these IPs can be seen on a sniffer attached to PA's external Interface.
We have to specify it via crypto access list (or something equivalent)
but what I know for sure is that we can't route traffic through the tunnel and expect it to be encrypted.
IPSec Tunnel gets established, and if the CP has a second interface, everything works as expected.
The solution I'm trying to deploy is, of course, junking these over-priced pieces of crap.
Now I can test faster, but no idea remains how to make PA differentiate between encrypted and unencrypted packets in matters of routing.
When instead the CP admin pings 1.1.1.1, sniffer shows an ESP packet comming from 2.2.2.2 to 1.1.1.1, then PA answers with an unencrypted ICMP echo reply.
But some of these CPs have only one Interface, only one IP, and this IP should be reachable throug the tunnel, but it is not.
How can I make my PA send all traffic through the tunnel, except IPSec traffic?
I regret to inform you that you are now able to share in my frustration:
There is a Palo Alto firwall (which I have to configure) and an industrial controller (they call it CP) which I don't control.
