I've heard something like "XP (I think NTFS) allows only 64 chars for file names" and I'm totally satisfied with that.
Right-clicking on the damaged file shows no useful options.
Looks like it can stay with the file without being over-written.
Using a root browser like WinRAR, I thought of editing the file.
If it does, then it shouldn't have allowed me to rename the file the first time.
Once it was downloaded, I was able to give it a long name.
Dragging it to Paint or Photoshop or to desktop didn't have an effect.
(I don't think there's a way, because I've tried many) It's not a problem for this file.
Today, when I renamed the folder where I had saved that jpeg file, the image turned to some useless file all of a sudden...
I downloaded an image (JPEG) and gave it a long name for it.
Does this happen often (when we use long file names) in XP?
Resting for these many days and showing up when the folder was modified seems ridiculous to me.
I downloaded a fresh copy of the same file and renamed it again with the same long name.
