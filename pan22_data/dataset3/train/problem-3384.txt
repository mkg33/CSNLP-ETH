I'm wondering if there are any gotcha's I may have missed in my extensive (2 hours of) testing, or if there are any more efficient ways of doing this.
This was wonderful, but solving one problem created a new one - now I have a proliferation of log files and I have to keep the collection of files under control.
There's no need to keep a list of the naxLogsToKeep newest (or oldest) files in memory, only the one I'm looking at now and the one known to be the oldest I've looked at so far.
After implementing some logging in my system, I got tired of digging through very long files trying to determine where specific runs started/stopped to look for differences, so I began adding a date/time stamp to the file name so I'd get a new log file each time the processing kicked off.
By not having an array, collection, dictionary or other structure of all the files, there's no need to sort anything, so this should be fairly efficient.
I've written the following procedure to do the pruning and it works quite well.
But, I don't know it all, so I'm open to suggestions.
