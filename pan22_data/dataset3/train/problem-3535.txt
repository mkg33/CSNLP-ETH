I've seen many how-to guides that show how to do similar things using some other VPN client.
When connected I see a tun0 device connected with the IP address I'd expect to see on the VPN network (let's call it 10.0.0.50).
I can browse to sites/ssh/whatever just fine to systems in the 10.0.0.0 subnet using this configuration.
For whatever reason, I can't seem to get any other VPN client to work and I've been told that they're "not supported".
I use a Nortel SSL-based VPN suite (it loads some Java Applet which sets up a VPN connection) that works great under Linux.
The bit that I can't change [so far as I know] is the VPN client.
In addition, I still have my LAN (internal) IP address on eth0 (let's call it 192.168.0.50).
However, what I'd really like is to be able to share this connection so that other machines on the LAN (say 192.168.0.60 and 192.168.0.70) can all somehow point to the Linux box which would forward requests through the VPN tunnel rather than routing requests through my ISP's gateway.
I speak in great ignorance -- I've played with iptables a little bit but am mostly in the dark as to the details of how these things even work.
