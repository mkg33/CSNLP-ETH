One idea for a hash is the minimum of $h''(x,j)$  for all $j$ (or the minimum across all $j$ and all directly and indirectly associated $y$).
I might try one of these, though I'm not sure the hashes from one random AND/OR will be meaningful the next time around.
But considering a uniform distribution of random $v$ and large number of replications, maybe?
From what I gather, the primary hash function is $$h(x,v)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0 & \mbox{if }\textrm{sgn}(x\cdot v) < 0\\ 1 & \mbox{else}\end{array} \right.$$ for some random vector $v$, after the AND this becomes $h'(x,i) = (h(x,v_{i+1}),...,h(x,v_{i+r}))$, and finally after the OR, $h''(x,j) =f(h'(x,rj),j)$ or $$h''(x,y) =\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1 & \mbox{if }h''(x,j) = h''(y,j) \mbox{ for any }j \in [0,b)\\ 0 & \mbox{else}\end{array} \right.$$ Now you can AND/OR using $h''(x,y)$ as you describe.
At this point to continue hashing, you'd need a mapping $\hat{h}:S\to S'$ of the bins such that each vector only appears once in $S'$, but doing so will also likely introduce false positives and/or negatives.
You would then just be choosing candidates based on AND/OR logical statements; you're not really hashing anymore.
I've been looking for a practical treatment of amplification in LSH and what you've presented makes a lot of sense.
