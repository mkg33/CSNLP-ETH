Nativity Windows Vista does not allow for Concurrent sessions.
If you want to allow multiple users to log in via RDP you will need Terminal Services on a server machine.
Using Windows Vista Business, is it possible to have a user sitting at the machine using it, and another user simultaneously logged into a different user account over remote desktop?
Try installing and using any of the VNC family of software.
The Windows Vista Business license limits the number of users able to use the OS at a single time to 1.
For this reason, any time you try to log in remotely, it automatically logs out the local user.
So the answer is No you cant log in to the physical machine and a Remote desktop from another machine with different accounts.
However, this being the world of Microsoft there are those who have figured out how to do this, see this artical.
It allows a remote user to tap into the pc, and control the mouse, keyboard, and see the screen simultaneously as a local user.
The Server OSs (Server 2003, Server 2008) allow multiple, concurrent connections.
There are ways, I will not link them here, but out of the box, that version of windows only supports one RDP connection at a time.
I personally always used RealVNC, but TightVNC, and UltraVNC are all excellent choices.
