After this started happening again, I took another look.
The solution is to reinstall Windows, and slowly transfer data over to new drive.
Sounds like the system is still up, but not outputting a signal.
I started to do a backup of the data on the suspect drive and after the *.tar.gz I was creating to back these data up got to around 12 GB, the computer just shutdown.
I started it up again and repeated the compression and it happened again, same spot, right around 12 GB.
So I bought another drive, put it in the same machine and installed Ubuntu on it.
For Windows 7, right click a clear area of the background, select Personalize, choose Screen Saver and then set it to none.
Check your settings - do you have the system set to turn off the video or to go to sleep?
THe only real bummer is that I can't back these data up all at once.
Or just leave the old drive in there and access data as normal.
This indicates that the drive has some bad data on it at that point, and in the past when I've encountered these data on a backup or under load, it crashes.
Under Power management, go into your current power plan, change the plan settings and make sure your video is not set to turn off the display and not sleep.
