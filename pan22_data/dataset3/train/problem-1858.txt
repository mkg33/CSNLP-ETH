So can someone explain what is meant by the announcement when it suggests a particular level of performance (e.g.
Then I may choose to use "/" or "-" as my delimiter whenever I list the bucket contents, so I might consider my prefixes to be either
+5,500 requests per second to retrieve data) for "each s3 prefix"?
But since the GET Object API uses the whole key, the concept of a particular prefix or delimiter does not exist for object retrieval.
But since prefixes and delimiters are just arguments to the GET Bucket (List Objects) API when listing the content of buckets, how can it make sense to talk about object retrieval performance "per prefix".
It says Each S3 prefix can support these request rates, making it simple to increase performance significantly
So can I expect 5,500 req/sec on a1/ or alternatively 5,500 req/sec on a1/b- and 5,500 on a1/c-?
On 17 July 2018 there was an official AWS announcement explaining that there is no longer any need to randomize the first characters of every S3 object key to achieve maximum performance: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/07/amazon-s3-announces-increased-request-rate-performance/
Every call to GET Bucket (List Objects) can choose whatever prefix and delimiter it wants, so prefixes are not a pre defined entity.
