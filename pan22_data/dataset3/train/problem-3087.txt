After running sdelete inside the virtual machine did you shut it down and compact the drive?
Once the process finishes you should end up with a .vhd file size that matches (or close to) the amount of space used in the VM.
Sometimes even when I delete some stuff nothing happens with the free space.
I've already tried to defrag the VM and also tried the SysInternals sdelete utility,
I suggest running WinDirStat inside the VM to determine what is using up the most space.
You can locate this information by opening the Virtual Media Manager (File > Virtual Media Manager...), select the drive to compact and look at the Location listed below.
You need to run a command to tell VirtualBox to look for unused space and release it back.
You will need to know the location of your .vhd file.
but it doesn't helped, in fact, the VM lost a little more space.
I have a Windows XP VM (with VirtualBox 3.1.2) that is slowly getting its HD full.
Perhaps you have some sort of virus or trojan running inside your VM slowly eating up the available diskspace?
