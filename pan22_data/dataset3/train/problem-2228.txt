These take advantage of the Routers2 additional features to give you combination graphs.
I am trying to monitor Disk usage over SNMP using MRTG on CentOS5.2.
To be able to use the dskPercent OID nickname in MRTG, you need to load the UCD-SNMP-MIB, which you are doing.
To make sure the snmp tree does contain the dskPercent table after such a configuration, check with a CLI snmp tool, for example:
This table is only populated if you have one or multiple disk configuration lines in your snmpd.conf configuration file (provided you use net-snmp).
Rather it is your snmp agent on the machine you're trying to monitor which doesn't have any entry in the dskTable.
Give the command snmpwalk -v1 -c <communityname> localhost hrStorage, and you will get list of values you are looking for.
So essentially I'm wondering where can I find a mib file compatible with mrtg for it's reference or a working config file.
I'm open to any suggestions as to the best way to achieve this (I would also like to do other metrics like CPU).
Since you are using MRTG with Routers2, there is a generic cfgmaker host template available at http://www.steveshipway.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=1616 which will automatically generate MRTG configurations for many things, including the storage OIDs.
You can use it with standard MRTG cfgmaker like this:
From forum surfing etc the suggestion is to use the fully qualified OIDs, I'd like to avoid this (for readability).
(or, if your snmpwalk is not configured to used OID nicknames)
So the error you see has nothing to do with the MIB not being loaded into MRTG.
