If not you may need to create the /var/run/freeradius directory and give it the proper permissions using chown and chmod.
The other possibility is that the Socket is getting created as root and then privleges are dropped.
See the manpages for umask and chmod for more information about this.
If you installed from a package the directory should have been setup for you.
What is the result of ls /var/run/freeradius/ and what user are you running freradius as?
In that case you may need to make the umask for the freeraduis daemon 002 and  /var/run/freeradius directory sgid to the group user for freeradius.
If you aren't sure which package to install use apt-cache to find out.
apt-cache search freeradius should tell which packages for freeradius are available.
If you installed the package from the Ubuntu repository both issues should have been handled.
These changes would need to be done in the script that starts freeradius.
Two possibilities occur to me off the top of my head.
apt-get -s install package tells you what will be installed and apt-get install package actually the packages.
If you didn't you may want to consider installing the package using apt-get or aptitude.
The first is that the directory /var/run/freeradius doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to write in that directory.
