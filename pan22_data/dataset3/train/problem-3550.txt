It appears some of the other solutions won't work if the configuration files of the package are managed with ucf.
You need to reinstall mysql-common with this command:apt-get install --reinstall mysql-common
dpkg -i --force-confmiss mysql-common.deb will recreate any missing configuration files, ie /etc/mysql/my.cnf in your case.
