Supposedly, the new RDP technology as part of Win7 SP1 will help mitigate this in the near future.

When I use a browser over RDP, I tend to use flashblock and disable gif animations to get around this.
Apparently it's not enough to just have it on your box... you have to manually enable it.
you can invoke local group policy editor using gpedit.msc administrative templates->windows components->remote desktop services and do certain configurations like 1 session per user and can also configure like the session should get disconnected if the user stays idle for a long time.
This has really helped me, although it still doesn't feel quite as fast as XP.
It really helped  disabling the mouse pointer shadow.
this might apparently increase the performance of the system.
I had a lot of lag on the mouse movements on a win2012 server.
I find that once you encounter anything animated over a WAN RDP, unless you have a 10+ mbps both ways, then you're going to get bad performance no matter what.
