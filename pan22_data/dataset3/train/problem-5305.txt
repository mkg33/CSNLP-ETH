If it is working fine on a different machine(as you say), the problem is with your PC.
Once it has done this go to devices and printers, and if it not there click add printer, and go through the steps.
I don't know why this isn't easily googlable after soooooo many years of dealing with problem.
Once you have found it, and added it as a printer, it should give you the option to print a test page.
WHen you plug it in it should recognize the printer and say it is installing the drivers.
This worked for me and i hope it helps a few people out.
Within this somewhere there is an option that says print test page.
On the computer physically connected to the printer, go to Start > services.msc > Printer Spooler > restart.
It's the same fix for when a print job won't cancel and the print queue continuously says "Deleting"
It you have tried all of the above, checking the drivers, turn on off etc, try unplugging it from the USB port it is in, and try it in another port.
The thread c4400 c4480 false paper jam fix has some more procedures in addition to the ones mentioned in your link :
If it doesn't right click the printer icon and go to printer properties.
I have no idea why it did this as mine was working absolutely fine aswell but there you go.
Turn printer power off and after a minute back on.
