Then, keep LockHunter open, open the task manager (CTRL + SHIFT + ESC), kill explorer.exe and repeat the previous step (Unlock and Rename again).
This happens with programs hard-coded in the system's PATH variables, etc.
A workaround for this was to create a hard link between the old path and the new path:
I managed unlock AppData\Local to create the hard-links by using LockHunter, a freeware utility that shows the processes locking a file/folder.
After the hard-link is created, open explorer.exe by pressing Windows + R and typing explorer.
Right click on AppData\Local -> "What is Locking this Folder?
When you do it the first time, only explorer.exe should still be locking the folder.
Now you should have all your AppData moved and without any PATH hassle.
Complementing MarkS answer, even after you manage to move everything by checking "No" when it asks if you want to move the files and you move it manually, some programs will still try to execute using the old path.
The problem is that, to create the hard-links, there can't exist a file with that name, so you have to delete it first, and in my case some programs were locking it from deletion.
