Basically, I have two servers (one Linux and one Windows) running at my house behind a standard Linksys router.
I have an interesting problem, and I thought I'd see what you guys thought would be the best solution before blindly trying random stuff.
So when a request from the domain blah.example.com hits the Linux Server I want it to send it directly to the Windows Server to process, and if it's any other domain, the Linux Server should process it itself and not forward it.
Obviously I can't have the router forward 80 to both, so I was wondering if there was a way to have the Linux server automatically (and transparently) tunnel/forward/whatever any requests with a given domain to the Windows machine.
Ideally I'd like this to be done in such a way that the Windows Server doesn't need to be configured specially: it shouldn't be able to tell the difference between requests forwarded by the other server or requests forwarded directly by the router.
Right now Port 80 is being forwarded to my Linux machine, because it hosts a number of websites.
I understand this might require modifying the IP tables or something similar, and if so, please go slow, because I've never fooled with those before.
Also, I don't have physical access right now, only SSH, so please warn me if anything you suggest might disrupt/disable the SSH connection (which would be really bad, obviously).
Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!
But with the addition of my Windows server I need that to be able to use port 80 too.
