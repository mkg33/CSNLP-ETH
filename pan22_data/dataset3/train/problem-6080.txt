I had this problem and I just changed the language on Advanced Settings to English (UK) rather than English (US) and the keys went back to usual.
You should check your keyboard configuration settings under the language and regions section in the control panel.
I know the original post was from almost two years ago, but I thought someone else may find this in a search like I did.
In the lower right corner you will see time, volume, wi-fi, and battery.
There you will be able to see if your configuration has changed, and change it back if it has.
At the end of that string of icons are letters that indicate the keyboard setting.
I had a similar issue, but mine was with the letters.
It was set on "UK Keyboard," so every time I typed @ it came out as ".
Under the language and input settings, someone had changed the input settings to US Workman Keyboard instead of just US Keyboard.
You probably have changed your keyboard layout inadvertently.
I had to figure out what letters it was giving me so that I could login and check the settings.
