They look like numeric, but you cannot do any calculation because it does not make any sense.

They are actually supposed to be characters or strings.
I am studying caret package in R. I know in this package, all the data are assumed to be numeric.
The matrix will be so huge after transferring that we cannot deal with.
So, we cannot use model.matrix or dummyVars to transfer them to numeric because 1).
What you're looking for is called "one-hot encoding" which can basically convert an N level factor like your product categories to N binary columns.
But I always have some data that has a lot of strings or factors.
Here is a post describing a few ways of doing that:
Yeah, some (not all) libraries have that numeric input limitation.
