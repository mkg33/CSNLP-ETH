The first issue I see right away is that the Win 7 boot entry gets overwritten by the less mature Win XP boot loader - so how do I make a system that will allow me to dual boot into both  given this scenario?
The 1st partition  is the 100MB system partition that the Win 7 installation creates.
That way no damage will be done to your PC, partitions etc etc.
Reboot into Windows 7 and add Windows XP to the bootloader: EasyBCD is a good tool for managing the Windows boot manager or you can do it manually using part 2 of the resolution here.
I would be installing Win XP 32 Bit SP3 on the second partition with Win 7 on the 3rd partition.
Install XP; you will now have an XP machine which cannot boot into Windows 7 so you have to change the active partition back to be the Windows 7 boot partition (ie back to what it was before you changed it).
Using the Windows 7 disk manager tool, create a primary partition on which to install XP.
More over you can install and try many other OSes including Linux!
You can install XP without making a mess of the Windows 7 bootloader if you temporarily change which partition is marked active.
Also - would the 100MB system partition that the Win 7 installation created be a problem for XP ( it might want to be on the first partition? )
As already you have win 7, the easiest way is to install a virtualisation software like VMware Player (free) in win 7 and within that install XP.
