Unlike most companies, even top level managers (like CEO, CFO etc) are not allowed to do just whatever they please.
Just give your users the proper rights, put them in custom groups that have necessary rights to perform their daily tasks.
I used my own version of runas that was limited to run specific applications.
Developers need full rights in the areas where they need it and nowhere else.
I have been working as a developer in a banking environment as well where they treat security on ALL LEVELS as a top priority.
It takes a little time to configure everything correctly, but it's certainly not impossible.
The only people in the company who have full admin rights were the system admins.
For some cases if people still need elevated priveleges for their tasks.
Also, you can untie user rights by setting Power User and playing with policy editor.
Take a look at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sudowin/
A lot of them don't know what makes a computer tick and handing out admin rights will give a lot of system admins a lot of extra work!
These test environments can even be virtual machines that have limited or no network access and are easily restoreable.
Worst case scenario, they can always perform their tests in a controlled test environment where they might have some additional rights to evaluate what customers with full rights may experience.
As a developer I always used user account for secure daily work.
When I implemented limited user policy, I had so little work as admin in 100 workspace office, month before it was constant virus nightmare.
This can be achieved with corporate policy, because people do not like limits and it will be hard for the first time.
But again, you need to be good as a system admin and spend some time to make a good configuration for your developers so they can do their job properly without any complaints.
Developers are not system admins with good reasons.
