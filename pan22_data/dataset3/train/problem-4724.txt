However if we do this from an external number we get "Sorry I couldn't transfer your call" message.
We have a Deployment with Lync and UM enabled with Exchange, both 2013.
When we dial the number of a person in a response group and cannot reach him/her we get the Voicemail auto attendant, also we get the message "To speak to an operator press 0".
I would suspect the format of the extension configured in the rule is something that can't resolve from Exchange UM to go back to Lync Server.
I suspect you have an Exchange UM CallAnsweringRule configured on UserX's mailbox.
We have checked the dial codes configured and the dialing rules set on the UM Dial plan, and everything seems to be set to allow outgoing calls.
You should be able to test by dialing into EUM directly (not a user extension, but the Subscriber Access number) from the outside, and try to transfer to a Lync-only extension.
It's configured to do the "To speak to an Operator, Press 0" action, and then transfers back to a configured extension, the Response Group.
I was unfamiliar with the scenario you described, because it's clearly bouncing between Lync Response Groups and Exchange UM.
If we press 0 from an Internal phone it dials back again to the response group number, hence we get the response group auto attendant.
