This is useful to the router because the netmask does not easily give you this information (without additional operations).
performing an OR operation on the network results in the range of IPs (192.168.248.96-103) that may be permitted or blocked in an ACL or OSPF network statement (remember that OSPF only looks for interfaces that fall within the specified ranges -- i.e.
Today, they are still useful in other cases, as Aaron has already mentioned.
What is the practical use of wild card masks vs normal subnet masks?
I've always wondered what the use of wild card masks was.
They are somewhat a hold out from when bits were precious and processing data in certain ways (binary AND or binary OR) was less taxing.
When I learned about them in college  I wondered what the use was, we saw that you could separate subnets by for instance even and uneven IPs.
It's very easy to check whether an IP is in range with:
The AND operation on the IP address with the netmask results in the network 192.168.248.96/29.
The two questions overlap somewhat, but it comes down to binary math (as YLearn hits on).
As I understand it, the question is what is the reason for the two different masks, not what are the differences between the masks.
