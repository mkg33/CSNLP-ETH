Perhaps ask the meeting organiser to remove you from the schedule, and add you again?

If you open the declined meeting from the 'all calendar entries' view, you can choose to accept it, cancelling the decline.
About an hour after I declined the second meeting, the first one was rescheduled.
In Lotus Notes 8.5.1, I ended up declining a meeting due to a earlier, conflicting meeting.
Or just manually book the time on your side, and use a post-it on your monitor to remind you of the meeting :p
Sort by an appropriate column to find the request (Last Modified worked for me since it was a recent request).
Once you've found the declined request you can open it and accept it.
Then you should be able to find the declined meeting request.
With Lotus Notes 7 you can go to the calendar view and select "All Calendar Entries" tab in the main window.
IBM have a tips document that describe how to do this.
From the calendar Views panel, under Lists select Entries and Notices.
Off the top of my head, I don't think there is a way.
