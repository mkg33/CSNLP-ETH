I had notice a strange problem on my Dell Latitude E7440.
Sometimes the CPU frequency never goes above 1.0 GHz (even when running some cpu intensive program, such as MATLAB), and the computer runs quite slow.
Another possible cause is the power supply to the laptop is not enough, but the AC adapter is the original one with 65W output, and I think this is enough for a laptop.
Any ideas of how to find the cause of this problem, and how to solved it?
Sometimes switching the power plan to "Performance" and switching back to "Balanced" solves the problem, but sometimes not.
I have checked the drivers on Dell website, and all my drivers are up-to-date, my BIOS version is also up-to-date.
The power plan I am using is "Balanced", and the maximum CPU usage is set to 100%.
Another strange phenomenon is if I use the CPU stress test in this program the CPU frequency can rise to 2.4GHz, but after the test the CPU frequency is still kept below 1 GHz.
The operating system installed is Windows 10 Enterprise 64bit.
If I switch to "Performance" the CPU frequency rises instantly to 2.4GHz, and the speed of the computer recovers.
I had used Intel Extreme Tuning Utility to see if any CPU throttling is on, but when the problem arise none of thermal throttling, power limit throttling and current limit throttling is on.
This problem can arise even when the computer is kept awake, and several minutes before the occurrence of problem the CPU frequency can rise up to 2.4GHz.
However after using 3 different software I found the temperature is normal, and the fan is running.
