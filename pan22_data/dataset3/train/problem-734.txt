I remember hearing that boot.ini was no longer used in Windows 2008.

I have a server that had Windows 2000 on the C drive and WIndows 2003 on the D drive with dual-boot.
This will let you interactively select which device you want to boot from at that moment, provided that your BIOS settings allow those options.
I haven't used 2008 yet myself so I have no idea if this option is still around, but you might want to see if you can edit the boot settings under msconfig as well(it's there in windows 7).
I then formatted C and installed Windows 2008 on that partition, and now when I boot up it boots right into 2008 and doesn't give me the option to boot into 2003.
I haven't done it, but sounds doable: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/winserversetup/thread/42336a7c-c286-4d6f-b14e-32ff9f06ddbd
Win2008 doesn't have an easy boot.ini file that you can just edit, you need to work directly with the bcdedit application...
So, essentially, it's like temporarily changing the BIOS boot order for 1 boot only.
The easiest way is probably to use the BIOS boot options menu, which you can usually open by hitting the ESC key as the computer boots (key may vary...).
Is there any easy way to fix this so that I can boot from the OS on the D drive without having to reinstall Windows 2003?
