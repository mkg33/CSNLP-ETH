For example, if you shuffled together two decks, and the top two cards of the shuffled-together deck are both "club queen", should those be represented by the same Card object, or should one card object represent "club queen which is at position 0 in a particular deck" and the other one "club queen which is at position 1 in that same deck"?
and then define a "card" to be an object which has a suit and rank, and always sits in some sort of card container, but can be moved from one container to another.
"spade jack" or "diamond six") or is it supposed to represent an entity which can only be in one place at any given time?

I would suggest that you define a concept of a "card container" [used for hands, decks, etc.]
Is a Card object supposed to represent a kind of card (e.g.
Moving a card from one container to another should cause it to be removed from the former and added to the latter.
