I am thinking about using a larger (physically) ATX power supply outside of the case, but need to know if there are any special accommodations I need to make (e.g.
Again, no single answer - many entry level systems can be passively cooled save for CPU fan.
An overspecced power supply cant damage your PSU provided the voltages remain correct - a wattage rating refers to the maximum output.
I am currently working on building a PC and need a power supply.
With respect of cooling it depends totally on your case and build.
Id imagibe the only thing ti be sure if (and it shluld happen anyway) is to make sure tje metal paer of your case is grounded to the PSU.
Generally systems which draw lots of power will (a) have a fan and (b) have built in protections - so if something does get hot it slows down.
That said, unless the system has been specced specifically fir low power I would add at least 1 case fan assuming a 350 watt PSU.
I have not found a power supply that will fit in my case and also accommodate the 24+8 pin connections on my motherboard, in addition to my (approximately) 350-watt requirement.
My motherboard is a microATX with 24 pin and 8-pin power supply connections.
If you are drawing substantial power, extra fans in the case can help, as long as they all push air through it the same way - typically suck from front, push through back (and assume the case us not open).
Its  better to overspec rather then underspec the PSU (but that can waste energy depending on the efficiency curves)  No one can answer your minimum requirements without knowing the components - 350 watt will likely be OK for a typical new CPU with integrared graphics, but a decent discrete GPU will want more.
I would also like to know how much wattage the PSU can supply before causing damage to my system or causing low power draw and not turning on the PSU.
I am using a microATX case that I had before (not bought for this project but still fits all components except for power supply).
