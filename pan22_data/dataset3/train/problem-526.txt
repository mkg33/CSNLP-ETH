Alternatively there is a URLScan ISAPI filter that could assist, docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/working-with-urlscan/â€¦.
I then added union to the URL section under Request Filtering but this doesnt work either.
*union (i tried other variations too) but non seem to block the above script?
Cloudflare could also be used to provide such a service in the cloud.
So i tried adding another rule with the Regular Expression ^.
I've installed IIS URL rewrite and added rules to deny php requests (which was the initial problem) but now they're coming back with SQL attacks.
You need to deploy a WAF (Web Application Firewall) in front of the actual server, it can filter all malicious requests out.
Unfortunately i cant make any changes to the site in question as its third party.

Does anyone have a more feasible way to block these type of requests from reaching the server?
I'm looking at our Windows Server 2012 R2 logs and can see many of these type of warnings/errors
http://example.com/page.aspx?aa4=1&bb3=20999999.1 union select unhex&c=E,1,4rln7NsBMfSHKp1Oxq9pnezDOpERYplN_SU,&typo=1(hex(version())) -- and 1=1
NGINX could also be used, but I have no experience with this.
Have not used it recently but it could potentially help.
