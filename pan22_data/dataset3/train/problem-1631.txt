Multicast, only starts working after choosing this option, so if u don't get this far it its another issue.
So my question: if I want to do this, will I need to have a router/firewall that supports multicasting in order to multicast to client computers on my internal network?
If you all your computers are behind the router and on the same subnet, thus the router is not required to route any packets, then the router should not have to support multicast.
The WDS server needs to be configured, DHCP needs to support multicast addresses and the router/switch needs to understand it.
Yes, all parts of the network between the server and the client will need to support multicast.
I have a WDS server, an image captured, and an answer file setup.
I want to install a Windows 7 image on 40-something computers without touching 'em
Does your PC successfully boot into WDS and you simply don't see the options in the boot menu ?
I think it may be because my router doesn't support PIM (it's an IPCop firewall) but I'm not sure it would need to if I'm just multicasting to client computers within the network that the router.
I go to create a multicast transmission out of the image, but I can't see it on my client computer.
