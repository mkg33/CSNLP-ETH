This is the absolute easiest solution if you aren't concerned about the backups being off-site.
rdiff-backup can be obtained either as source code or you can also install it  prepackaged binaries through systems like Mac ports.
If you are developing software, rather than manual backups and snapshots, you should start using source control software, like Subversion (which you mention but clearly have no idea how it works) or git (slightly more difficult to learn but gives you more power in the long run).
Having said that, if you really have to use manual backups, first note that Xcode provides a snapshot feature, which may be enough for you.
Since you have a svn server running on windows I would try learning using it first.
rdiff-backup would fit this very well (I've used it to back windows network shares).
Still, if you don't trust Xcode, one solution would be to use something similar in spirit to time machine, where you have a full copy of any directory plus differential backups for a specific amount of time.
Time Machine will make daily backups to a local external hard drive, or network-attached Time Capsule.
