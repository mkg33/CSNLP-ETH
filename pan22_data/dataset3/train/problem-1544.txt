Our Control panel allows a user to perform a scan against their own server - as well as schedule various services such as Qualsys, McAfee, BluePay PCI etc...
Is there a way to scan for available IP addresses on Linux?
If you are not running anything on your own server AND your ISP does not - it is time to get some security in place as well.
You wuold not say "Hey, go to some totally unrealted message board and ask people who have no way to know".
HOWEVER just random traffic will most assuredly for any DataCenter worth its weight in spit - get you into trouble.
We allow Port Scans by users to their own equipment - but routinely will disqualify traffic coming from IP Addresses doing port scans.
There's probably no way without asking the provider, as most don't have a DHCP setup quite sophisticated enough to hand out IP addresses to specific machines in this manner (if they even have DHCP at all).
Normal answer you would say is "*****, ask amazon".
As a datacenter Operations Director - I will tell you GO TO YOUR ISP.
When purchasing the IP, the only email I received was a notice saying it will take between 24-48 hours for the IP to become usable.
Can dhclient list all IP's without assigning them to an NIC?
There are a ton of ways to do a port scan - HOWEVER chances are doing a port scan will be against your providers TOS and AUP (Terms of Service / Acceptable Use Policy)
I suggest you check out www.ConfigServer.com for the CSF firewall and/or R-FX networks for APF/BFD as well.
We run a number of tools that would automagically kill your traffic.
I purchased an additional IP for my server a couple days back and I have no idea what that IP is.
