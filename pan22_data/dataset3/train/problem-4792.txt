passwords that I can use for KeePass itself and for other purposes where I don't want the passwords to be stored anywhere but in my head (like my internet bank.)
I would think that a human friendly password is more succeptable to a dictionary attack.
I found a good website with a few interesting options for password generation, strength testers etc.
What I'm looking for now is a way to create good rememberable/memoable (what's the word?)
I'd try to creat as strong and secure a password as you can remember.
This site will allow you to test it's strength against multiple criteria.
I'm using KeePass for storing my passwords for various sites, because you're more vulnerable than you think if you use the same password on multiple sites (especially if it is short enough to be reversed through rainbow tables.)
Keepassx has a pronounceable password generator built into it.
They don't necessarily have to be easy to remember mentally; as long as they're generated to be fluently written on the keyboard, they should be easy enough to learn.
It isn't flawed terribly like some of the major websites that people are currently using for password generation and testing.
