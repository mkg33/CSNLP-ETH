In the future, you might want to put this little line in your bashrc and stop running as root on your server:
You deleted everything in / probably in alphabetically order, until the point where you cancelled the command.
I suppose you realized the problem and cancelled the command?
You just deleted pretty much everything on your server.
I was trying to remove a directory on my server when I unintentionally ran the following command (notice the space) as root
can someone tell me, in what ways this must have impacted my server, since I can see I can no longer access some of the sites on my server.
You've potentially lost files in the root directory level of the server, starting alphabetically with /bin, /boot, dev... Did you allow the command to run in its entirety or did you Ctrl-C to stop it?
You should use this alias to prevent this from happening:
(since you're saying that some of your sites are still alive).
You can recover some files if any running processes have them open: http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/58142
