Domain and Forest Functional Levels, are properties of (respectively) domains and forests, not of individual servers.
I already have a domain controller setup on Wind2k8 R2 Standard and am trying to get another system running on Win2k8 R2 Enterprise to also become another domain controller for the same domain.
Your SERVER-B is Windows Server 2008, thus is too old for this domain.
I'm trying to determine the domain and forest functional level of SERVER-B, but I can't seem to do.
I have determined the domain and forest functional level of the SERVER-A to be set at Windows 2008 R2.
I'm getting the forest or domain functional level incompatibility error as shown:
For the sake of simplifying, I'll call the first Win2k8 as SERVER-A and the second Win2k8 Enterprise as SERVER-B.
Additionally, if your SERVER-B is not yet a domain controller then it cannot report on a functional level.
It looks like your issue is that the domain functional level is Windows Server 2008 R2, which means that all domain controllers must be Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.
To promote SERVER-B to a domain controller you must first upgrade it to Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.
