To find the MAC addresses of your machines (in Windows) run Command Prompt and type "ipconfig /all"
With my router, if I enable "Traffic Shaping", it does that automatically.
However, if you can find help, then you can choose between these free firmwares: DD-WRT and Tomato.
Look for the connection that maps to your router (IP address will probably be 192.168.1.xxx) and note the MAC address in the table.
If you are using DHCP (do your computers get IP addresses automatically?)
The only solution is to change the firmware, with the risk of bricking the router.
I don't know about unofficial firmware, but most routers these days have an option that levels bandwidth so each gets a fair share.
So the answer to your question is: Not possible with your current setup.
One of my motivating factors in switching to DD-WRT was the more robust QoS settings available.
DD-WRT might be able to enable this missing features on your router.
What you are looking for is called Quality of Service (QoS) under Applications and Gaming.
Frankly, I wouldn't advice it if you describe yourself as newbie.
and have people connecting wirelessly I would recommend using MAC addresses to filter out machines.
Give your computer a higher priority than the others and your issues should go away.
Many people recommend Tomato for better QoS support.
It allows you to restrict bandwidth based on different criteria (MAC address, IP address, application, physical router port).
