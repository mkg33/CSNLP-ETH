this means a lot of utility/partition programs will have problems with it in the future.
I'm really a fan of software RAID 1 (as long as I don't need hotswapping)...not so much a fan of software RAID 5, but that wasn't really the question :-)
Now I'm planning to use the Windows Server built-in software-RAID-1 instead.
The server will only be used for Business Administrations, so I don't need high performance.
Good quality hardware RAID (servers should never run low quality hardware) has a long proven history of reliability and disaster recovery is more reliable.
Are there any disadvantages by using the Windows Server 2008 built-in software-RAID for mirroring?
That in itself can be a real problem when things go wrong, because most recovery tools won't work well, if at all, with dynamic disks.
Since you're not concerned about disk performance, the biggest thing to note - It will convert your disks from "basic disks" to "dynamic disks".
In order to use Windows software RAID you need to run "dynamic" disks.
problems resizing partitions, if you need to do data recovery can be more tricky.
I have had some problems using hardware-RAID on a server.
You probably (hopefully) will never need to fight with lowlevel disk utilities but that is the biggest disadvantage i've personally had.
Probably not enough to outweigh the advantages of having a software RAID.
The operating system is Small Business Server 2008 and the server is HP ProLiant DL320 G6.
If you are having problems with hardware RAID you need to discuss it with the manufacturer and vendor.
All that said, you have the advantages of hardware portability, not having a RAID card as a point of failure, and much better pricing.
