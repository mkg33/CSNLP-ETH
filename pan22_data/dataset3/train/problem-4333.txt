But there's no way to tell what the long-term effect of a short circuit might be.
You'll probably find a lot of requirements for short-circuit protection in the USB specifications (which probably vary depending on the USB port type you have on your laptop).
Did your event degrade long-term reliability of the part in question?
Unknown without further information about the event and ICs involved.
I think you are probably fine though -- any reasonable laptop design would have that current limiting device there, and those devices themselves generally have thermal protection to keep them inside their SOA.
Generally a host USB port will have ESD protection on the data lines, and power will be supplied through a current limiting power-switch like the TI TPS2557.
And your USB port manufacturer probably followed the specs when implementing the hardware and software aspects of this protection.
These devices will limit current to a programmed amount (generally 500mA for standard USB ports), and have output signals in event of a power fault that go back to the USB controller informing it of an over-current event.
