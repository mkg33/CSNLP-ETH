If I understand your question correctly, you are referring to:
You can add the key to the registry with a different value and it will take effect after a reboot (tested on Windows Server 2008R2 in a production environment).

In Windows the value is dynamic for established conections, though the default for initial connections is 72 seconds.
By reducing the value of this entry, TCP/IP can release closed connections faster and provide more resources for new connections.
This interval between closure and release is known as the TIME_WAIT state or twice the maximum segment lifetime (2MSL) state.
This number in seconds is doubled each time it retransmits before timing a connection out.
TcpInitialRTT: Defines what the initial time-out settings are for new connections.
TcpInitialRTT and TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions may not be present in Vista and Windows 2008.
TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions: Defines the number of retransmissions before timing a connection out.
Adjust this parameter if the running application requires rapid release, the creation of new connections, or an adjustment because of a low throughput caused by multiple connections in the TIME_WAIT state.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Tcpip\Parameters\TcpTimedWaitDelay
16,000+ connections in netstat -a when you even manage to RDP to the server.
This is an absurdly high value given the quality of modern networks.
During this time, reopening the connection to the client and server costs less than establishing a new connection.
I had an application literally less than a month ago running on a server that exhausted the maximum number of connections Windows can support and killed every network service on that server regularly.
This key determines the time that must elapse before TCP/IP can release a closed connection and reuse its resources.
We set the value to 30 decimal (30 seconds) and voila, the issue was solved - less than 10,000 simultaneous connections (since the app was rapidly opening and closing them) and no throughput issues.
The Registry settings are defined in this article:
And this says at least TcpInitialRTT is gone, although I don't know how reliable it is.

You may not have it set if you are using Win2008 or later, but the default is 240 decimal (240 seconds or 4 minutes that is).
