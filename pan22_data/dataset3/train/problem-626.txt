We want to get functionality similar to Yousendit or one of the other services that allows end users to upload large files.
I just installed and configured Droopy on Ubuntu 12.04.
There seems to be software for practically everything else for Linux, I can't believe there isn't something that will meet our needs.
Externally: a public Web server serving a directory accessible by a CIFS share, which users can e-Mail out.
Apache has a tendency to use as much memory per process as the uploaded file is in size.
It should behave in a more sane manner: saving chunks to a temporary directory you define and not consuming all the RAM you have.
http://drop.io is really slick and free up to 100MB in file size; may also have an embedding/customizing option.
Have you tried to setup lighttpd for your upload receiving needs?
BasicAuth configuration for password protection, if necessary.
Have you looked through Freshmeat and Sourceforge?
Internally: wiki and general file sharing solutions such as NFS and SAMBA.
But we have a few Linux servers and want to use these instead of a third parties.
If you don't mind spending money, I've (easily) branded/integrated a YouSendIt "corporate" account within a Website I was doing contract work for: we embedded the YouSendit form into a page on the site; took all of 15 minutes maybe.
they charge based on how many uploads you do per month and how much data if I recall correctly, but it wasn't much.
http://www.popscript.com has one, but it's $139 USD, and no idea how well it works either.
That will kill your server very soon if you continuously receive large files.
I've used a rebranded sendthisfile.com for a while and it worked great, but my use is sporadic and I couldn't justify paying for it when I run my own servers.
