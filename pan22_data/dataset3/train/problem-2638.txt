However (and my strength is in perl so don't expect much from my reading of python), it seems to me that the script only checks one block per line matching '-'.
You download the file listed as oem3sr2.zip in the linked MS page above in Ans #1.
python sector_correlator.py badsectors.log k: badfiles.txt
So if the log file reported 200 consecutive bad blocks (the second number of the logfile line) , then the script has not checked the last 199 blocks for different file associations.
I found that with the current version of nfi.exe you do NOT need to dig out the drive path.
This is more an addendum to the Answer (#1) based on my attempts to check my failing drive.
In linux you can use ddrescuelog -l- badsectors.log to expand to show all the bad blocks.
1) you can still get nfi.exe and use it (with winxp at least).
Unfortunately, and I don't understand why, Ubuntu's implementation of ddrescue does not include ddrescuelog (but it's fairly easy to get the latest from debian, and compile & install it,  about the simplest I've seen).
