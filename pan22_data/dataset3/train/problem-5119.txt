I can't seem to find a definitive answer on whether it could be my motherboard that is having trouble with this.
How can I get Windows 7 to recognize all 4TB of the drive?
I was able to format the entire 4TB of the drive as expected.
The board must have just had a problem reporting the unallocated space to Windows.
So I deleted the volume hoping that would reveal more options in the disk management tool, but it did not.
Oddly, I took the new drive out and put it back in the old usb board and windows has no problem seeing all 4TB.
The problem is that Windows 7 only sees about 1.5TB on it.
Also, I'm actually using a board I took from an old external usb drive to connect the drive to the computer.
Recall from my question that I had the new hard drive connected to the computer via an usb board from an old external hard drive.
I circumvented using that and plugged the new drive directly into my mother board.
I thought it might show me more once formatted, but it did not.
From what I discovered through googling, I found that I have to initialize the disc using GUID Partition Table (GPT), instead of MBR.
So if these boards can be limited, I suppose it could possibly be the reason.
This is my first time working with disks larger than 1TB.
