Note that, with the improved code, I made sure to use clear variable names.
Most users will understand what h means in context, but Height is clear to any user.
Aside from the couple of instances of a single ratio being matched to two different aspects, they are fairly consistent.
In turn, we have a very simple function to get an aspect ratio from a width and height:
We could improve this a bit further by employing the use of constant values and such, but overall this will point you in the right direction.
Even better would be WindowHeight so that, even if your reader was completely dumb to reading code, they would know what that variable was.
The firs thing worth pointing out is that you are ignoring a lot of special meaning with your current approach.
I took your original code and calculated each aspect ratio in order.
Aspect ratios are a function determined by Width : Height and thus we can use an aspect ratio and an inputted Width and Height to get the aspect we want, instead of looking through a list that are just saying the same thing in different ways.
So then I checked each of the original aspects and their results:
