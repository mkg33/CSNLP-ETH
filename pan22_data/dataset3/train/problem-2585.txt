With twisted pair nearly everything supports autonegotiation and unless your equipment is very old autonegotiation works just fine.
The big question is are we talking twisted pair or Fiber?
Most 1Gbps fiber gear uses pluggable transcievers and it may be possible to get a 100Mbps transceiver that is compatible with your 1Gbps switch and is compatible with the fiber standard used by your 100Mbps device.
Occasionally you may find a crossover cable is needed.
Be aware that mixing autonegotiation with manually set full duplex is likely to lead to a duplex mismatch.
1Gbps fiber standards are not compatible with 100Mbps fiber standards.
Alternatively if the gigabit switch also has twisted pair ports it may be possible to use a media converter to go from 100 Mbps fiber to 100 Mbps twisted pair.
Fiber on the other hand is a mess of diffent incompatible standards.
You should only use manual speed/duplex if you have problems with autonegotiation and if you do use it you should use it on both ends of the link.
