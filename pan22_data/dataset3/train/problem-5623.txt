There are so many different versions of both HDMI and DisplayPort standard.
I'm using 2 DisplayPort to HDMI passive converter cables from the KVM switch to the monitors and I can use both monitors fine when I'm on the laptop.
For some reason the monitor still isn't being recognized.
However, when using the desktop, one of the 2 monitors isn't detected by the video card.
My video card has a DisplayPort output (working with one monitor).
Any ideas what I could be doing to fix this setup (HDMI output to DP switch to HDMI monitor), without having to change the current KVM switch?
I realized that I couldn't passively convert an HDMI signal to DisplayPort, so I'm now using an active HDMI-to-DisplayPort converter from the card to the switch.
I recently got a 2 port Dual DisplayPort KVM Switch so that I could use both my work laptop (the docking station comes with 2 DisplayPort outputs, hence the choice for a DisplayPort switch) and my desktop with my existing 2 HDMI monitors.
First of all, you need to check the harward version of the HDMI video out of you PC and the DisplayPort version which your DisplayPort KVM switch can support.
