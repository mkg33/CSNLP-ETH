I'd hesitate to think that this would be workable from a security perspective, either - hypothetically, someone with a task running cmd.exe with a certain set of parameters, having those parameters modified at execution by a non-admin user?
No - parameters are configured within the task itself.
i have a batch job which expects parameters during run-time that is created in scheduled task.
how can i run schtasks from command line such that i can pass in parameters during run time.
i was hoping if there is a way to do like, i need to run this task from schtasks using command line, because i can set the task to run as Admin and give user with less role invoke the task on demand
I'd take Shane Madden's comment into account though, whoever has access to writing to this text file and executing the scheduled task, has access to a modify the behavior of the process
Another solution could be to have your powershell script print out the parameters or data that your batch job needs to a text-file, and then have the batch job read from the text file at run time.
i cannot have a fixed parameter so i cannot provider the parameter when i first create the task i need to provide this during the run time.
