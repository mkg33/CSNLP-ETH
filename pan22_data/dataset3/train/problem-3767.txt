The hardware should be pretty replaceable cogs once you're dealing with any sort of scale of computers.
I have hot swapped drives using the software RAID builtin into the Linux kernel on many occasions.
That may depend on your hard drive controller and how it responds to a drive failure.
Perhaps you would save more money by not getting all those second hard drives?
I believe it is possible to make it automatic, but in the places where I use it manually running the command to add the new drive has never been a problem.
I think the other posts have answered the question but I have a somewhat related thought to add.
Make sure you're using Puppet and Kickstart for setting up and maintaining the configurations on the servers.
Because you'll eventually have to deal with the following situations....you need a plan on how you're going to deal with them now.
So with this many server for a single project, aren't a lot of these servers redundant?
You may need to run a command to add the new device.
Also make sure you have a good backup solution....rsnapshot works pretty good.
I am not entirely certain that the computer will survive with zero downtime.
I only ask because you said with the number of server you are purchasing, that controller will increase the cost a lot.
