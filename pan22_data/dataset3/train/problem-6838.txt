If you just highlight the worksheet (easiest by clicking the top-leftmost blank corner for the row and column headers) and on the data toolbar click the funnel(filter) icon you get dropdowns for each column.
If I have a column A with a Master List of 500 items and there is a neighboring column B for typing a value or Quantity for selected text items, how can a list be automatically generated on it's own worksheet page?
How can I create a summary list of items and quantities based on whether or not there is a value (quantity) in a cell?
Identifying the selected items depends on observing if the Quantity Column has a value in the cell next to the item.
This assumes for example, that of the 500 items on the master list, only 20 may be selected with varied quantities in the neighboring cell.
This allows you to display only rows where that column matches the selected filter.
In the dropdown for column B there is a "Numbers" option the "Does not equal..." where you will see a dialog to set the  "Does not equal 0"
The point would be to create a concise, printable list, including quantities, that ignores the other 480 items that have no quantities in the neighboring cells.
