At this point your only LEGAL recourse is to purchase a boxed copy of Windows.
Unfortunately, I run into this a lot at work, so I would have to agree with @Greg about ordering the recovery CDs as the quickest and easiest route
The recovery CD will put that key back in, activated, but if you install Windows from a CD, even the same edition, that key won't work.
They should be able to identify the version on your OS and possibly even the Windows key with the computer serial number.
Just a note for everyone saying to use a keyfinder, it doesn't always work.
For big-box companies, like HP or Dell, they set up ONE computer with a special CD-key (called a Manufacturer key), which is pre-activated, and that key will NOT activate another copy of Windows, even on the same computer.
If you enter the servcie tag from the BIOS at the Dell Warranty site there is a tab for original configuration.
You will need the service tag to get the recovery CD/DVD as well.
That is why they have the OEM key on the sticker on the bottom.
I am not a lawyer, but it has always been my understanding that if your computer does not have an COA (Certificate of Authenticity) sticker on it, then you do not legally own an OEM copy of the OS.
Unless he/she reinstalled Windows MANUALLY using the sticker, the key finder method won't work.
