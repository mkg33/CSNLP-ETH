I was setting the "range_offset_limit" in squid.conf to -1 so that if any part of a windows update was requested, the whole file would be downloaded.
I would guess you're seeing those because your users are hitting sites that subscribe to their services.
Notice how in your output, your proxy also has direct connections to google.com and acast.com?
Amos Jeffries from the squid-users mailing list tipped me off that this could could backfire if a client requested only a small piece of a large file (like a video) hosted from one of these CDN's; squid would be forced to download the whole file, even if the client stopped listening.
Thanks to audiophilth and James Sneeringer for getting me on the right track.
You generally don't want to block them, otherwise you're going to break a lot of high-profile sites, if not make them completely inaccessible to your users.
llnw.net is just a CDN source, not sure what you mean by "bogus" connections.
It isn't blocking the connections because your caching proxy is initiating them, and you have no OUTPUT rules, and the default OUTPUT policy is ACCEPT.
I would guess that just about all of your outbound traffic on port 80 behaves the same way.
MSECN is Microsoft Edge Caching Network, and LLNW is Limelight Networks, both of which are content delivery networks similar to Akamai.
