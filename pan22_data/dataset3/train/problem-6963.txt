So if you are on a 128MB VPS you might want to look into that.
One thing to note about Fail2Ban is that it seems to use about 10MB more memory than DenyHosts.
There are a number of important security techniques you should consider to help prevent brute force logins:
If you need it to protect other services as well, Fail2ban is definitely a better choice.
It is configurable to watch nearly any service if you are willing to tweak its configuration, but that shouldn't be necessary as the newer versions of Fail2ban include rulesets which are suitable for many popular server daemons.
Don't let them get to your machine in the first place!
Also, out-of-the-box fail2ban is only setup on SSH which means that with no changes to the config - DenyHosts does the same thing in less memory.
Actually, I think denyHost is able to prevent many other services besides sshd service.
There are plenty of ways to stop brute force attempts before they get to your host, or even at the SSH level.
so if we set BLOCK_SERVICE variable to be ALL as above we can watch our ssh service.
I've used fail2ban with great results on a number of production servers and have never seen one of those servers breached by a brute force attack since I've started using it.
Using fail2ban over a simple iptables rate limit has the advantage of completely blocking an attacker for a specified amount of time, instead of simply reducing how quickly he can hammer your server.
In its configure file - /etc/denyhosts.conf, there are some lines of code said:
Fail2ban is slightly different to DenyHosts, though they do play in the same space.
Having said that, protecting your Operating System with something like fail2ban is a great idea.
