I think that when we put things together, the router is not aligned in its natural axis and by imposing voltage to the fan during the assembling process, it will find its natural axis.
Desktop fans are replaced easily enough (they're all pretty cheap), but since you mentioned this is a laptop - which often have unique/hard-to-find components - a replacement might not be feasible.
I opened it and detached the rotor from the stator.
By the time a fan is tilted/wearing on bearings, the fan's days are numbered.
After some searching I found that lubricating it may help.
Sewing machine oil is designed to work well with parts that move at high speeds, which is exactly what your computer fans are.
I put the rotor in the stator when the fan was under voltage!
If you are hearing noises, it's already way too late.
You'd just be oiling the windings and magnet, creating a big mess and a dust trap.
But after cleaning and putting them together, another problem showed up: Noise!
Adding lubricants can make the problem better for a short period of time by filling the space around the worn parts of the bearings, reducing the fan's ability to shift temporarily.
and it's working like the day one with no lubrication or anything else.
Computer fans typically use sealed fluid dynamic bearings, so it's not  possible to lubricate them anyway.
But very soon the lubricant will get squeezed out and the fan axis will shift again.
Maybe it's not the case for every one but it's something that should be considered.
The bearings are worn and allowing the fan to shift its axis slightly, causing rubbing that wears the bearings more.
One tried and true lubricant is sewing machine oil.
It's a bit too long to copy/paste it all over into an SE answer, but here's the gist:
But if you can catch it quickly, you can prolong the life of the fan for quite a while.
