After I connect to the VPN I can access my web server by visiting 10.8.0.1.
Recently I discovered it is best to protect my IPMI web interface behind a VPN.
you do this by adding this line in your openvpn config for the server.
My problem is that I do not know what IPs to assign my IPMI port to access it with a private IP when connected to it.
Do I enter my public gateway IP or an internal gateway IP?
Currently OpenVPN is configured to use 10.8.0.0 and 255.255.255.0.
This way your private network inside the OpenVPN can be safely shown to the people who have access to that network.
What you want to do is create a subnet that can be pushed from OPNVPN server.
I went ahead and configured IPMI with IP 10.8.0.10, netmask 255.255.255.0 and various gateway IPs and none seemed to work.
add this to your server config you will allow openVPN client who can connect to 10.0.0.0 to be able to see equipment that is on 10.10.2.0
I went ahead and installed OpenVPN on my server and connect to it using tunnleblink on OSX.
if you want route on the client to be seen by all you do this on the server
