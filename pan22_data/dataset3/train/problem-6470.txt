We have three Netgear GS724T and a fortinet router.
A Trunk can have exactly ONE untagged vlan (also called the Native VLAN), and one or more Tagged VLANS.
If you set a VLAN to be untagged on a port, there is no PVID associated with it; there is no PVID field in the Ethernet frame.
My first test would be to put the ESX Ethernet port Trunk on VLAN 2 to test with a single VM on VLAN 2, and the other VMs still untagged on VLAN 1.
It's either tagged or untagged, unless you have two (or more) interfaces at the same host.
A port with more than one VLAN associated with it is called a Trunk.
If I configure a port to be Untagged on VLAN 1 with a PVID set to 1, and Trunk on VLAN 2, will it accept and transmit untagged packet on VLAN 1 and accept and transmit Tagged packet on VLAN 2 ?
If a trunk port is configured with VLAN1 untagged, and VLAN 2 tagged, then all devices that use untagged frames (PCs etc) will communicate on VLAN 1 and be blissfully unaware of any other VLANs.
You don't change the configuration for this management network  for all of your hosts and then you don't lose access to yjt machine, no matter how unusual this or that requirement for the host.
One interface with restrictive firewall rules and VLAN for host management and another for data.
I have never used VLANs before, so I'd like confirmation that it will work as I think.
I don't know if I understood your question correctly, but if I did, you can't use both tagged and untagged packets at the same interface on end devices.
If a device can tag frames with a PVID =2, then it can communicate on VLAN 2.
I would like to keep the current default configuration of every port untagged on VLAN 1 and start to add new VLAN as needed without breaking the Internet access or access to the ESX virtual machines.
