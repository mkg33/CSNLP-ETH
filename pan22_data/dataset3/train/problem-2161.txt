Some terminals automatically remap the numpad key to send the same codes to the shell.
I have the following in my ~/.zshrc to get the keypad working:
For example: The numpad-1-key sends KP_1 while the 1-key just sends 1.
If in-string is typed out-string is pushed back and treated as input.
zsh does not do the mapping automatically, but you can use bindkey to do the mapping on your own.
If you use Kitty to access a linux server on SSH and that the keypad is working fine with Bash but not with ZSH, you may try adding the following in your ~/.zshrc config file:
The actual codes (for example ^[Oq) may be different on your system.
bindkey -s in-string out-string binds in-string to out-string.
The numpad key do not send the same key symbols as the 'normal' number key in the top row.
You can press Ctrl+v followed by the key in question to get the code for your terminal.
On my Mac OSX El Capitan, the period key is ^[0n instead of ^[01.
Also I have a Logitech wireless keyboard for the Mac and it has an = sign on the numpad too.
Logout and login again to reload the ZSH config, or alternatively you can type the following in your terminal:
Also, some shells (for example bash) just interprete the numpad keys like their equivalents in the main block.
The solution others proposed works correctly however.
