In case your computer just swapping to HDD, extending RAM capacity should be enough.
According to the images here, it's just a normal laptop drive that can slide out of the side.
I would like to put a SSD into it, maybe something like this one.
Although it's very old, it's more than enough for the job I want it to do.
Although file copy transfer should also increase significantly.
Your laptop has SATA drive, so any 2.5 drive will probably fit and work.
Without further information, I would wager to say that you would benefit from an SSD.
I frequently check out Lifehacker Deals for SSD's, they always seem to have at least one on their list.
Yes you will benefit changing drive to SSD despite older SATA controller.
Here is a video showing an installation of Samsung 840 SSD on Inspiron 1525:
Before you buy SSD drive, I'll recommend you to increase memory as much you can (at least 4G) to prevent swapping, which can rapidly decrease SSD lifetime.
I have seen many laptops that are a similar age running very smoothly, thanks to a shiny new SSD.
I just purchased a few 120GB SSD's for just shy of $70 each.
One final note, I have seen better deals out there for SSD's.
However, as far I know after some tinkering people got it working.
The key feature of SSD is very low access time in compare to HDDs, you should notice gain in performance especially on system boot and running apps.
There were some problems with physical installation due to the drive being slightly slimmer.
Did you decide to get the SSD and if so, were there any problems with installing it?
When laptop react slow and LED lights up and you have enough free memory (check in Task Manager), then HDD is bottleneck and SSD will improve performance.
Most modern SSDs (SATA3) are backward compatible with the SATA 1 & 2 - at least in theory.
