There are several problems with this line of reasoning.
If this understanding is right, your questions can be answered as follows:
Firstly, we don't know that all your instances will automatically cluster on the same hardware (this may be so; I just don't know that it is).
Thirdly, even if we did, Amazon aren't stupid, and there's no such thing as a free lunch; if you run enough instances to completely monopolise a backend server, you would expect to pay about the same as simply renting a backend server.
It seems to me that the upshot is to recognise that (a) virtualised servers are cheap primarily because one can oversell them on the basis that not everyone uses all of their server's resources all the time, and (b) if you really want resources dedicated to you, you should rent a dedicated server.
As I understand the article, it's suggesting that if you have a number of instances, they're likely to all be present on the same underlying hardware, and to use all that hardware, thus preventing other (potentially noisy) instances from running on that hardware - or at least making it much less likely that any such will.
Secondly, even if they do, we don't know how many instances you need to run in order to close "your" underlying hardware to other people's instances.
