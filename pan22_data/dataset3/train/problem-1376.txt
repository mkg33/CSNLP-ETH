You're dealing with two different classes of products here.
As such, the VMware vSphere client is not really meant to be used for heavy day-to-day operations.
I have guest additions, but I only can choose from pre-defined resolutions.
I use VMWare vSphere Client to access Windows 7 VM from Windows XP host.
Provide it with a sufficient amount of video RAM, and you can choose from many more resolutions, and RDP becomes stable.
You'll find performance to be significantly better if you enable remote desktop on the Windows 7 VM and connect via an RDP client.
Virtualbox is a desktop virtualization system, and ESXi is a server virtualization system.
whenever I resize the window of VM, it internally changes resolution to whatever obscure resolution just to fit the window size, e.g.
When your Virtual Machine has not enough Video Memory, then the available modes will allow for very small screens only, and will cause severe stability problem with RDP also!
But note: this won't solve the original problem with dynamically adjusting the size to VMSphere's window.
In Virtualbox, with guest additions enabled, in Win-Win machines pair, I had by default the dynamic screen resolution adaptation in the guest (i.e.
Is this achievable with vSphere Client (I have 5.0 version)?
