If you copied from the source you state make sure that the quotes in the code are proper straight double quotes ("), it looks like WordPress changed them to typographical ones.
Make sure the last entry in /etc/rc.local is edit 0.
I'm a bit of a unix neophyte myself and I had a similar problem.
(Feel free to tell me I'm wrong, if I'm leading people astray)
I followed the instructions that you're pointing to and it just wouldn't start the vnc server.
Presumably :0 was already taken by the GUI that was loading automatically, since I wasn't running headless.
I read on that site that the a visitor said that the script is buggy.
Hope that this helps anyone who has fallen into the same trap.
You can also try the script from the official documentation for Raspberry, http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/README.md.
As soon as I changed the script in init.d to :1 rather than :0 it worked perfectly.
I finally realised that the error message about 0 being locked (which I assume is effectively 'GUI' 0) was telling me exactly why it wasn't working.
Run the shell script from terminal and if there is an error in code, you'll see.. Other method...
I have model b+ and I've installed tightvncserver, and can successfully start the VNC manually, but once I reboot I need to start it again, although I have configured it to start automatically, by following the instructions here word by word.
