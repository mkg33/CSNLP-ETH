We leave them as active users in the domain of their old site but obviously this causes problems as when the user's password expires after 90 days or they forget their password, we have to contact the user's old site to request a password change.
If a user moves from one of these sites to another, how do we move their user account and mailbox in O365?
We leave the Mail attribute blank and put them in an OU which doesn't synchronise with O365 so their e-mail account remains unchanged.
all of the staff across the 5 sites use firstname.surname@ouremail.com).

Each of these domains use AD Sync to sychronise usernames and passwords with our shared Office365 tenancy.
We all use the same Office 365 tenancy and domain name (e.g.
Having to do that for ~20 users is a bit of a faff though.
Our organisation used to be split across 5 sites with 5 separate domains (and physical locations).
At the moment, we simply create a new AD account on the domain of the user's new site.
