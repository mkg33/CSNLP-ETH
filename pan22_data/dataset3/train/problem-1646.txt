Is there a way to get the drac to give more information about why it's sending failed?
In this case I'd get my sniffer situated to capture the iDRAC's connection to the LAN and see if it's even sending anything to the LAN at all.
There's nothing in the exim logs about connections from the drac.
This is one of the many times when I'd sniff traffic.
Set up a packet sniffer on another machine and mirror the iDRAC6 switch port to the packet sniffer machine port and see what's coming out of the iDRAC6, if anything.
you have to put in the DNS name of your domain to get this to work.
While you could capture traffic on the SMTP server I'd be more apt to watch what the iDRAC card is saying first.
If that's not possible, then I'm in agreement with Evan.
I wonder if it's possible to telnet into the iDRAC6 and make an SMTP connection from there to your Exim server to test sending an email.
Exim is listening 192.168.1.1 and is set to allow mail on 192.168/16.
If your switch doesn't support port mirroring, you can connect a hub in between the iDRAC6, the packet sniffer machine, and the switch.
I'm trying to setup the email alerts on the iDrac6 Express on an R610, but when i run the test it just says "Sending Failed".
