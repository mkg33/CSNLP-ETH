I have a similar setup, except that instead of two vlans on the same switch, I have two switches connected together using OSPF.
If 20.20.20.2 is reachable, it won't matter how many hops it is away.
Basically where you configure the dhcp relay (IP helper) on your VLAN interface, the switch will forward the DHCP request to the IP helper you have provided.
One at each switch, or just one on the switch without the dhcp server?
It won't work if the DHCP server can't reach the client that is requesting an IP address from the DHCP server and sometimes people forget that you need a route both directions.
This will become unicast traffic and get routed to the DHCP server which should be the IP address you have set in set forwarding-options helpers bootp server 20.20.20.2.
The configuration only needs to be set on the switch/router that is being used as the gateway.
In my code I am using the same setup, but I'm wondering, how many relays will I need.
Set DHCP relay configuration for each vlan that does not reside on the same subnet (even across internet) as the DHCP server.
You do not need to set the configuration on edge switches or any switches that come after your gateway.
