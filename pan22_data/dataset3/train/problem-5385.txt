So that you know for next time, the type of backup you're talking about is generally referred to as an incremental or differential backup (depending on vendor and/or country).
Consequently, the file is not backed up in an incremental backup.
With conventional incremental backup, the criterion for determining whether a  file has changed since a previous backup is the fileâ€™s modification time, however, there are cases where this criterion is not effective.
This mechanism includes any changes that any file has sustained during any given day.
To get a backup of only files altered during the day, you'd need to create a custom backup job linked to a query that selects files based on date modified, and that's a very big headache.
With enhanced incremental backup, Data Protector introduced its own mechanism to reliably
Data Protector stores all its information, including backup and restore data in a database, which I believe is in a proprietary format.
It's not possible to perform an incremental backup without a full backup.
It can be done, it's generally more effort than it's worth, and it's probably a much better idea just to a[nother] full back up of the server.
A full backup works as a reference to compare what has changed and what hasn't.
No, Data Protector cannot get a list of files to backup from a .txt file, or a .csv, tab delimited, or similar.
For example, if a file has been renamed, moved to a new location, or if some of its attributes have changed, its modification time does not change.
detect whether a file has been changed and theref ore should be put into the incremental backup.
Dataprotector uses a concept called enhanced incremental, and uses it to do a backup schema called incremental forever.
