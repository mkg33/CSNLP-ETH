If not your receive connector, did you check your destination addresses for "Sender Restrictions"
If you are on the SBS version your check should include all those pre-defined receive connectors, even the one named "SBS fax".
The receive connector is set up correctly, with anonymous users checked, but still, I can receive mail from some servers (like gmail and some hosts I have access to) both plaintext and TLS, but from some other hosts, that are perfectly legit and support TLS and plaintext too, I get the error in $subject.

Be aware that connecting from different IPs could land you in different receive connectors.
The only thing that changed recently was a DST switchover yesterday, but the host is set to UTC-7 and seems to be bang on
The logs show the same things I can see if I try to send email manually via telnet.
I have a strange issue on an Exchange 2010 Version: 14.03.0158.001 (latest to date).
Check the IP address ranges defined on the network tab of each receive connector (Exchange mangement console > server configuration > hub transport > receive connectors): The failing host / IP address ("[1.2.3.4] " in your example) might be served by a receive connector that is not configured to allow anonymous access.
