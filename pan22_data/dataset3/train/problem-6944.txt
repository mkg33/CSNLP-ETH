If all the clients are Windows, I'd certainly recommend installing some kind of antivirus software on the clients, since they're the most vulnerable.
I've not used it myself but I have heard that fprot does a good job.
There are exceptions where I would recommend an anti-virus on a linux server though.
I'm a fan of AVG Free for my Windows antivirus needs, and they had a linux client last time I checked.
Not really for the safety of the server, but for the safety of your end-users getting their stuff off of the server.
I use ClamAV on my (samba) fileserver and (squid) proxy servers.
Examples would be a mail server (you should scan attachments on your end, and incoming mail) or a file server with outside access (prevent your server hosts contaminated files).
I also think Anti-virus is not really required on a Linux server, although it is best practice to have it, so you can say you do everything possible to keep things clean.
It's very easy to install and use and does a good job.
I used it for a bit since I use my server as a file server for my linux and windows clients.
