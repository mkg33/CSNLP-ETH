If you REALLY want to circumvent it, and you have local Admin access, then you need to capture the registry activity during a GP update to determine the registry path(s) for the GP you wish to stop (the Screen Saver Idle Time, for example).
For related info see here ("Circumventing Group Policy Settings").
Basically, I'm hoping I can right-click it and Run As Administrator in order to get around the fact that a very poorly designed security policy for my PC prevents me from changing the idle time for when the screensaver starts up (I want to change it from 15m idle to 1m idle, for increased security).
First thing: Ask your superiors to adjust that for you.
If I could perhaps locate the .exe and run it elevated, perhaps I'd be able to make the changes I desire.
To be clear, I am a computer administrator, but there are different levels of administration; apparently "screensaver idle settings" are beyond my pay grade... And the dialog as launched from the Control Panel seems to presume I am a regular user.
Once you have that, then you should be able to go into RegEdit and remove/deny access to that key (or it's parent) for everyone but you, which should disallow the server from updating it.
I figure there's an .exe file somewhere in C:\Windows or C:\Windows\System32 but I'm unable to locate it.
Note that if you run something as administrator under UAC, you may be setting another user's screen saver setting.
Second thing: If it's being applied by group policy, then even if you manage to change it (say by directly editing the registry; I believe it's HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Control Panel\Desktop\ScreenSaveTimeOut), it will be reset back to the Group Policy Object setting the next time the GP is updated (usually once an hour).
Otherwise you may be asking for trouble trying to circumvent established company security policies (for better or worse).
It's not an exe but a cpl, try running this from an elevated command prompt:
