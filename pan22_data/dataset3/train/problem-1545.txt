Finally, to resolve the conflicts, and propagate the merge, from inside unioned/dir2:
Finally, a git annex list shows where these files are located after the sync: the unioned/ directory has copies of all files, chosen from the different servers as above.
This creates the directories, with binary files containing random data.
So that it could be possible to quickly check differences between the "unioned" fs
For now, git annex list shows where the files are located and/or sourced from:
Do you know if there is a unioned fs for GNU/Linux that shows also "shadowed" files with slightly different names?
git-annex also has a direct mode which operates directly on the filesystem without the use of symlinks.
Where *.variant-* link back to the different files in the different repositories.
Both proposals involve heavy I/O because they create e new filesystem instead of mapping the existent ones into a virtual filesystem.
An alternative in longer form is git annex whereis.
The overall walkthrough of git annex is located here: http://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/
Also, unioned still contains no data until we conduct a git annex get.
Setting this up for use on remote computers is a matter of setup up remotes over ssh using standard git, however it's behaviour is described here: http://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/using_ssh_remotes/
The answer to the original question seems to be "not at the moment".
It seems that UnionFS and Aufs do not offer this option
