I was able to solve this problem using a configuration option specific to the game in question (which I stumbled upon quite by accident with no small amount of luck).
Where x.x.x.x is the dotted-decimal representation of the IPv4 address of the interface you wish the game process to use.
I could bridge the server's virtual adapter to better handle broadcast frames).
Whether it will work or not seems completely random, but installing a service is still easier than editing a config file every time you switch networks ;)

It's also worth noting that I switched over to using OpenVPN instead of pptpd since it provided better link-layer support (i.e.
Something is truly screwed up in the way BFME handles networking, and sadly, the developer no longer exists and it's not open source, so we'll never know...
This allowed me to specify directly which interface the game should use.
