If you can, grab Debian and install with no packages selected, then add what you need.
something much much smaller suitable for pxe booting?
I'm in the process of building a minimal linux boot image based on Ubuntu.

Start out by using Ubuntu Server install and installing no packages; that will be pretty slim.
Let the initrd mount your remote filesystem and go from there.
Well, ideally you shouldn't be removing anything manually.
You can do an Ubuntu JeOS VMbuilder installation from Ubuntu Server CD boot menu.
If you are dead-set on Ubuntu, then ask for further info on Ask Ubuntu.
What general approach can I take to reduce this 3GB+ linux installation down to
For PXE boot though, you're better off compiling your own kernel and using busybox for most commands.
The installation requires about 300-400 MB of disk.
I started by using debootstrap and then installing the things I absolutely needed.
For example, there seems to be a lot of stuff in /usr/share
What things does debootstrap install that I can look at removing?
You should be able to PXE boot pretty quickly just from the kernel + initrd image.
You'll only pass network traffic for files that are actually read in use, so even if you have a 100 gig install, if the boot only touches 10 MB of files, you'll only move 10 MB of traffic.
