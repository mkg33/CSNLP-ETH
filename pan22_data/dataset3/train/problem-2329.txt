If we cmd > ipconfig /flushDNS, everything works perfect back to normal.
Everything works properly for a while, but unexpectedly we lose the ability to type in 'production' - and get a DNS resolver error.
I've inherited a DNS server setup and I'm trying to configure our local intranet properly.
(nslookup always finds the correct server, then it works fine again)
Why would each of the clients be losing the reference and then not allowing us to connect for a period of time?
Site 2: http:// production (ipaddress:8080) - host header value of 'production' in IIS and DNS A Record set up points to the correct server.
Forgive me if this is simple, but I'm missing something in our configuration.
Is there any way to create a "static" reference without changing the HOSTS file on each PC (not practical).
You also might look at setting your search domain on clients, which I believe will automatically append your domain name to your server name in order to create a FQDN which your DNS server might resolve more easily.
We're hosting trying to host 2 separate intranet sites on 1 IIS 6 Server (Server 2003).
