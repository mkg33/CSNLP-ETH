I've found that by switching the docketNAT from internal to external solved the problem.
Has anyone experienced this issue and know how to fix it?
Another temporary solution is just to configure the DockerNAT virtual switch to private though this will last until your next reboot.
Whenever I try to enable the Wifi Adapter it keeps disabling itself immediately, the only way to get my internet back is by deactivating the DockerNAT HyperV Adapter.
However I am seeing an issue that everytime the new network adapter for Docker via Hyper-V is enabled (vEthernet DockerNAT) then my Wifi Adapter is disabled and therefore I can not access the internet.
Here is the source: https://forums.docker.com/t/wifi-adapter-disabled-when-hyper-v-network-adapter-enabled-native/18063/5
Goto Control Panel => Network and Sharing Center => Change Adapter Settings => Right click on vEthernet(DockerNAT) and Disable.
If one of them is disabled, re-enable and try again
This must surely work otherwise they wouldnt have released the Windows Native version publically?
I just received a brand new work laptop and immediately installed the native version of Docker for Windows.
Disable the vEthernet(DockerNAT) though this will last until your next reboot.
