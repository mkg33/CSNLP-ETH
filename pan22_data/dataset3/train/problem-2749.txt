I ran ifconfig and got the VMs IP (10.0.2.15) and no matter what ports I forwarded, I couldn't connect.
Even after forwarding ports, I could never connect to the VM.
When you forward a port from the host to the guest, you need to contact the forwarded port on the host.
When you tried port forwarding, it appears you set up port 8080 on the host to forward to 80 on the guest, then you tried to connect to 10.0.2.15:8080?
In other words, from the host, connect to 127.0.0.1:8080 and you should be forwarded to port 80 on the guest.
I was trying to connect by typing that IP with the port in a browser.
So, I'm using Host-only mode now and it works fine (but no internet it seems).
I'm under the impression that I should be able to use NAT (not "NAT network" which doesn't appear to let me even hit OK) to communicate with my VM from my host.
It still tries to access the guest by the guest's IP address, which isn't supported by NAT mode.
Virtualbox NAT mode doesn't permit the host and guest to communicate with each other without port forwarding.
I would start my guest's webserver (which was running and I could curl localhost successfully on the guest) and then type in 10.0.2.15:8080 in my host's browser to no avail.
