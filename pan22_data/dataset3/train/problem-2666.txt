What local domain names should be good now to use for a local dev server?
It appears that Google wants to use .dev only for internal puposes.
The question is: is this me and possibly my hosts/vhosts settings or the world's fault?
The DNS returns 127.0.53.53 which is a signal that this TLD is being registered by someone.
Chrome versions from M43 have a this new way of relaying the error message to the user.
You can either add the local address to your C:\\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts file or change the site's address in your web server config file.
ICANN has released new public gTLD-s, such as .dev.
I' m working with UniServerZ on Windows7 and Chrome explains the "ERR_ICANN_NAME_COLLISION" error roughly as "this website uses new top level domain name.
Today I got this error when trying to access local domains specified in apache httpd-vhosts.conf.
Lookup the IP address used by the interface by using ifconfig.
Under that assumption it seems to be safe to host a "fake" dev zone on your internal DNS server
Edit your hosts-file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts).
It happened for the 1st time with a .dev domain, so it seemed plausible that in light of recent news Goggle finally got it.
The pseudo domain name(s) you are using are being registered as a new top level domain.
Now, trying to google ERR_ICANN_NAME_COLLISION brings very few results and I have no network administrator to contact.
Contact your network administrator if it used to work".
Possibly using the full name like "localhost.dev.$yourdomain" could help you here depending on your setup.
