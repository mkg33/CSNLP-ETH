=sumproduct() can test multiple conditions for true/false, across a range of values (in this case, testing the conditions for each row), and then sum the results of another range when all the conditions are true for the row.
Here we are testing that E2:E5 contain the DD/MM in J2, that F2:F5 contain the Month Text in J1, and that G2:G5 contain the WorkDay text in I3.
I need to parse the raw data and add it to the calendar table.
If the year is 0000 I need to add the number to the "Week Extra" for the correct week.
One word of caution with this formula, your ranges that you are testing have to ALWAYS be the same length.
The best way is to convert the dates in your raw table to actual excel dates.
Formulas are in the screenshot below and a quick explanation follows.
You can't test E2:E5 for DD/MM and F2:F20 for the Month.
The formulas for doing this are in the screenshot below (because it's too verbose to type).
If all conditions are true, then it grabs and sums the value in C2:C5.
The first data row would add 2 to the Monday under "04/08".
To get these into your calendar table, you could do a couple of things.
A pivot table, from which you could use =getpivotdata() to extract values for each cell in the calendar is one method.
I prefer, instead, to use =sumproduct() since it has less overhead.
From the actual excel date you can extract the text for the day of the week, the text for the month, and the week starting date, which you can convert back to text to match your table.
