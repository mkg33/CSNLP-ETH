However, the solutions guide may be available for some of them online or especially at eBay with a suitable search.
One of the classics is Finite Mathematics with Business Applications.
These could be books or online resources or perhaps other things not yet considered.
However, one essential aspect is that the student needs access to materials by which the topics can be practiced, not just read about.
These books are both old and out of print, but readily available.
What are good resources by which a student can learn the necessary material to support a CS degree?
Another, more common and possibly lighter weight book is Introduction to Finite Mathematics
Resources with lots of exercises at different levels with a way to obtain feedback (answer key or other) would be essential.
In the use-case at hand, a HS or University course in finite math is not an option as the student is self studying.
They have lots of exercises but no solutions in the books themselves.
I think the latter one is available as a PDF online (but without answers).
A student studying Computer Science requires some knowledge of finite mathematics, including logic, probability, counting, etc.
John Kemeny et all have published a set of books on Finite Mathematics that are classics.
