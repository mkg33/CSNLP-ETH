While I've been able to figure out the odds of a player winning based on previous wins/losses, I have yet to find a formula which modifies those odds based on opponent.
Compounding this the players could be of different levels: if the players are within a few levels of each other, the odds should map closely to wins/losses.
However, as the levels diverge, the odds of the lower level player winning reduce.
I'm creating a fighting game where two opponents face off against each other in the ring.
The gap between players' Elo rankings can then be used to calculate the relative odds of each winning.
I want to calculate the odds that Player 1 will wins against player 2.
These are just estimates, my sense is that there is a math formula out there which will calculate that - can anyone out there point me to what this could be?
Sounds like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system might be a good starting point: it's a system which ranks players based on their win/loss record, weighted by their rank.
