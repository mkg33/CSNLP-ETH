Your maintenance mileage may vary -- this is obviously not a solution AutoDesk is going to support, and we can only offer you limited help with it as it's generally a Bad Thing to do...
You'll need to modify your proxy/DNS/firewall/something to send Google Analytics traffic to this internal page (make sure you document this hack), but it should work, until/unless Google changes what Analytics returns and AutoDesk changes what they expect to see.
Your vendor is a freakin' idiot who doesn't understand the concept of "graceful degradation".
figure out what their app is doing -- unblock Google Analytics for a few minutes (or test outside your firewall) to see what it's hitting and what GA responds with, then mock up a server that always returns something the app considers a "valid" response.
Please tell them I said so, and feel free to use more colorful metaphors (think Jersey truck stop).
Having said that, my suggestion is that you try to get Google Analytics unblocked -- it's by far the easiest solution, and probably no serious harm to your organization.
If you can't do that for Real Valid Policy Reasons ("It's SIPRNet you fool!")
