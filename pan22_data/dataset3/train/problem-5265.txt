Managed Power Distributions Units (rather than the UPS) often do support customised delays in enabling individual outlets after power is resumed.
To get the same functionality, you need to pick a specific host to always power on right away (maybe whichever system is allowed to boot at any time) and leave all the other servers in a powered off state (configured in bios to return to power off when AC is applied, and to honor the Wake On Lan magic packet to power on when told to do so).
calculating how much battery power the APC units had left and shutting down the servers with just enough time for them properly shut down instead of just powering off.
If you're interested in investing more in your infrastructure, this is definitely the route to go.
Typically that is to prevent circuit breakers from tripping when a cabinet full of systems powers up at the same time immediately after power is restored, but that can also be used to preserve the boot order of your system dependancies.
The software is...not user friendly but it's nothing difficult if you take some time to figure it out.
The only difference being we invested in sturdy rack mounted APC power units (for example APC SmartUPS 3000 ).
With the APC PowerChute network shutdown software (PowerChute Network Shutdown software) , I'm able to shut down and bring up servers in a specific order.
It sounds like the UPS units are low-cost and not capable of being configured for a specific output-on wait time after power is restored (some higher end units are).
Then, on the main host that does boot, run a script/utility to time the transmission of the WOL magic packet to each host.
Another handy feature of the software was setting the servers to shut down at the very last minute, i.e.
