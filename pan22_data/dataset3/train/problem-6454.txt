It only changes the from domain though, not the user.
Modern versions of cron do accept "MAILFROM=..." in the crontab format.
/etc/mailname contains the domain name part of the FROM address.
I had to change /etc/mail/sendmail.cf and /etc/mail/sendmail.mc, because /etc/mailname wasn't used.
For me, the easiest way to change the from address on a system, is to create a ~/.mailrc file with contents like this:
The phrase to look for is towards the end of the paragraph discussing MAILTO, and should be something like this:
Any of the mail commands that run as my user, now use these settings.
If /etc/mailname contains 'somecompany.com' then cron running for root would have sender as root@somecompany.com
Then to change the domain, there are different possibilities -- it could be that you need to change the hosts file entry (or, as on my machine, when I was configuring this -- an ubuntu box) -- change /etc/mailname -- to be the domain you want it to come from.
If it mentions MAILFROM, your version should support it.
it is mailed from the user@domain -- the user is the login name the cron is running under -- so you'd have to create a user 'me' -- and run the cron job as that user.
