If you take the time to understand the animated gif format, this is not possible.
Also, resizing will probably make a mess of most animated gifs.
I've been searching for days but have yet to find an application that can play scaled up animated gifs without getting choppy.
Either acquire the content in a sensible format, or do your best to convert it to one using ffmpeg then playback with VLC.
Notice that's width by height (see here for the various ways to specify geometry).
Any favorite stripped-down image viewers out there?
You can't realistically have an animated gif which is at a lower resoltion and "scale it" to 1080p and not expect it to be "choppy".
The window is by default borderless (you do have to be in an X GUI).
However, it won't warp a square gif into a rectangular one (maybe there is a way to force that, there are a lot of options).
You need to understand how frame transitions work.
You seem to be confusing what a gif file is with a proper video format.
Also, this is not a Raspberry Pi specific question.
Some of the tools in the ImageMagick suite (apt-get install imagemagick) will help.
The converted myimg2.gif should work properly with animate -resize.
