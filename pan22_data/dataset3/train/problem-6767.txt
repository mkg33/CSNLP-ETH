I used DNS, DHCP and TFTP to boot and install RHEL maybe 10 years ago.
By having a running system (even a minimal Linux) in RAM, it should be possible to install it on the hard disk, and build up a working system from here.
Modern computers support network booting using PXE, but I haven't found anything regarding booting via the internet.
066: to the DNS name of your internet server (server.domain.com)
So, is it possible to use PXE to load an image from the internet and boot it?
There were boot.kernel.org and boot.fedoraproject.org... but this is no longer so fashionate.
Configure the right DHCP options on your router and you shouldn't have any problems:
You just need a friendly environment which instructs your machine what to boot.
067: boot\x86\wdsnbp.com (for WDS as example, you will need to find the file to load)
Without such "friendly" network environment I am afraid it is not possible.
Let's assume the following situation: you have a computer with empty hard disk, and you don't have a CD, floppy, pen drive nearby to boot the computer from.
