I would use the Samsung and save the Apple 12 watt adapter for something that requires more than 2 amps (which is 10 watts).
But I would say that both your power supplies have plenty of margins and should suffice.
My RPi 2 consumes 650mA when all 4 cores are fully busy and clocked at 900MHz (so no overclocking) and with my wireless USB dongle powered.
I run all my Pis with an Apple 5W (1A) charger, although I use a powered hub for external HD (which won't work with the Pi and need more current).
So that's a bit more than 3W fully loaded with one USB device.
In fact the Pi uses less than 1A, depending on what peripherals you have attached.
The link you quoted states "Maximum total USB peripheral current draw 600mA/1.2A (switchable)".
This is the current the Pi could supply to external peripherals, not what the Pi needs.
I have Raspberry Pi 2 Model B and two USB power adaptors with specs:
It is stated that my Raspberry would need 1.8A 600mA/1.2A (switchable)
Its good to use minimum 5v/2A power source with RPi2, voltage should not drop below 4.65v, so make sure you use min 5v.Though current is higher it will simply draw your current forward, so no problem with higher current.
Both power adapters should work as they each can provide at least 1.2 Amps at 5 volts.
In general is not a good idea to use "chargers" as they often have poorly regulated voltage (which is OK for the purpose), and are designed to charge batteries.
You have to think of how many USB devices you will have and if you're going to use any of the GPIO pins.
If the Samsung claims to supply: 9V 1.67A I wouldn't let it near my Pi (or any 5V USB device).
