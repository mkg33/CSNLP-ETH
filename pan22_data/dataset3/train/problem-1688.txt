Our network has expanded and I need to have more hosts available.
Finally, I would like to know if I need to change the subnet mask on the hosts, the switches, or both.
Router LAN (192.168.0.1 /24) -> Switch (192.168.0.10 /24) -> Workstations (192.168.0.100 - 192.168.0.200 /24)
The simplest way to do this is to change the router's inside interface subnet (/24) to a supernet (/23).
This will give me 192.168.0.0-192.168.1.254 instead of just 192.168.0.0-192.168.0.254.
The reason I'm confused is 192.168.0.0 /24 and 192.168.1.0 /24 are both part of 192.168.0.0 /23 so in my mind there is not a need to change the subnet masks of hosts in those smaller networks but having made the subnet mask change only to the inside interface of the router I am not able to communicate with a host with the static IP address 192.168.1.40.
My question is do I need to adjust the subnet masks on hosts on either the 192.168.0.0 /24 network or 192.168.1.0 /24 network or should they continue to work having only changed the subnet mask on the inside interface of the router?
