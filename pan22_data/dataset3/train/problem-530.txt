and it might be the case that one of them would have to go.
I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt here and assuming that you have grounds to suspect that one of them might be engaged in some kind of fraud or other nasty activity.
This may not play nicely with your AV software (you do use AV software?)
If you're still determined to go down this route, you need to know that installing keylogging, screengrabbing, etc software on PCs is basically installing software that mimics (or exactly replicates!)
A good and honest company or employment lawyer (one who isn't just out to grab money) will be able to advise on legal means of obtaining the evidence you need.
You may be obliged by law to inform them that you're monitoring them, you may be obliged by law to inform them of what you're monitoring, you may be obliged by law to inform them of the reasons why you're monitoring them, and you may be obliged by law to hand over any data you collect to an employee who requests it.
if an employee claimed unfair dismissal) you would be in a whole heap of trouble if the evidence you used was obtained illegally.
If you're going to do this (and I would also advise against) the first thing I would recommend is that you check the employment, company, privacy and data protection laws of your country to ensure that it's not illegal.
Above all else, you need to stay on the right side of the law.
While we're on the legal side, you need to also be certain about laws relating to monitoring employees.
If not, I'd advise you to back away and forget that you ever thought of it right now.
Next you need to think hard about your reasons for doing this.
Secondly you need to check your employee's contracts and ensure that you're not breaking them.
After that you need to check what legal recourse you have.
