If you used autoindex instead, then nginx would generate a directory listing for that directory.
will look for index.php in that corresponding directory, when given a URL ending in /.
Instead, when the parameter ends with a  / the request is passed on to an index module, depending on whether you have specified the index, autoindex or random_index directives in your server or location blocks.
The $uri/ in try_files does not exactly add a / to the end of the URL and try it.
If you're passing nginx to a proxy, this does require a small work around to pass the correct URI to the backend e.g.
Without seeing the rest of your config file it is not easy to see the exact effect of this, but it has caused me issues in the past.
Nginx doesn't attempt to use the last parameter and check to see if it exists as a file or directory, instead it rewrites the request to match the last parameter, and then reprocesses the server block.
"is the try_files sentence not doing that already?"
You may be able to make a simple work around by doing:
