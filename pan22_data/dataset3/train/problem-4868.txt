Go control.alt.delete, open processes, find the helper and end task, then do a search for Wondershare and delete all remaining files.
The only problem is their solution was specific to that user's machine, and I can't download the fixlist.txt supplied by the admin in this thread to see what he did.
Under the heading Internet (Whitelisted), I found this line:
It seems like that's a security threat and I'm trying to patch it.
Finally it should be safe to delete the following directory, noting that this is the name of the directory on a 64-bit OS, and if you have a 32-bit OS, the (x86) piece will not be part of the path:
I then did a reboot and I no longer get the annoying Wondershare helper dialog boxes.
Then check task manager for a process called Wondershare Studio.
Even after I uninstalled it, there were still files in C:/Program Files (x86)/Common Files/Wondershare, C:/Program Files/Common Files/Wondershare, C:/ProgramData/Wondershare, and there was a .exe on my desktop.
If it's still there, I'd have ended it forcefully.
It did what I wanted but it seemed really sketchy and it made my laptop start working so hard that my fan kicked on without any user input, so I turned off the wifi and uninstalled it right away and now I'm paranoid that I'm a part of some botnet or someone's got my saved chrome passwords.
HKLM-x32...\Run: [DelaypluginInstall] => C:\ProgramData\Wondershare\AllMyTube\DelayPluginI.exe
(I have also run malwarebytes, and it detected and removed several threats.)
Only follow this procedure if you are experienced.
Under the heading Registry (Whitelisted), I found these lines:
I was making a dvd and I didn't know how to download videos from funnyordie.com, so I went out on a limb and tried Wondershare Allmytube.
It actually just deleted all those keys and values, and added nothing.
However, I did run the Farbar Recovery Scan Tool as this person did, and I found some references to Wondershare in the FRST.txt file.
I went into standard malware clean-up mode: Open regedit and search for wshelper.exe.
Keep pressing F3 to find the next match until you eventually find a match sitting inside a RUN key.
Delete any under wondershare then go back to the regular uninstaller and remove.
* Be careful not to delete anything else apart from the wshelper.exe value.
If you accidentally delete anything else you can cause damage to your computer.
So I made a mistake and ran a dubious executable program downloaded from the internet.
Even after you do the usual install/uninstall programmes route of uninstalling Wondershare, when you do a search for it there are still many files left on your system.
In my efforts to clean up what it has done I have resorted to the following.
I found someone with the same problem on this forum: http://www.smartestcomputing.us.com/topic/71056-wondershare-helper-compact/
You will find lots of matches but you can ignore most of them.
BHO-x32: Wondershare AllMyTube 4.2.0 -> {067DF9EC-26B7-40DC-8DB8-CD8BE85AE367} -> C:\ProgramData\Wondershare\AllMyTube\WSBrowserAppMgr.dll No File
If you try to delete them it will refuse because "it is open".
Note: I do not recommend using the above REG file on a 32-bit OS because 32-bit windows structures the registry differently without all the WOW6432Node bits.
I have not bothered to clean up all the other registry entries and hard drive folders because I am happy that it is all unhooked and not active.
You may find you have more than one "RUN" key (in my case my computer has a WOW6432 redirection subnode so I have two RUN keys) so keep looking for any RUN keys where wshelper.exe may be hiding.
Ignore the fact that the message says it "added" information to the registry.
Wondershare and now iSkysoft (I tried iSkysoft Video Editor) seem to exhibit some behaviors similar to malware in that a hidden piece of software is installed and set to run constantly in the background even after un-install.
I think this was running before I ran the REG file, but seemed to go away afterwards.
I uninstalled Wondershare from control panel but when I reboot a dialogue box appears every time saying that "wondershare helper compact" wants to modify the system.
The 'RUN' keys are important because this is how software hooks into the computer startup sequence.
Usually it's the Wondershare helper which stays open, which prevents you from deleting the files.
HKLM-x32...\Run: [Wondershare Helper Compact.exe] => C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Wondershare\Wondershare Helper Compact\WSHelper.exe
Once you have found the wshelper.exe value under a RUN key then delete it.
Also backup your registry by creating a restore point in control panel *
FF HKLM-x32...\Firefox\Extensions: [AllMyTube@Wondershare.com] - C:\ProgramData\Wondershare\AllMyTube\AllMyTube@Wondershare.com
How do I take all references to Wondershare off of whitelists?
