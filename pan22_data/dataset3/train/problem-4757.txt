This may be a stupid/obvious thing that you've already checked, but is your filesystem mounted with the noatime flag?
When accessing the first 4096KB area for the first time,
every I/O has rare chance of hitting page cahce, so
(Incidentally this is why performance-critical read-intensive filesystems are supposed to be mounted with noatime - the I/O for updating inodes constantly is substantial and can be a measurable performance hit).
I figured out what is going on, but I don't know what it is for.
Ext3 filesystem has some 4KB data in each 4096KB(8192 sectors) data.
(Ext4 has more efficient scheme for block addressing.)
then OS reads the 4KB just before the 4096KB area first and
And 4096KB area in only accessible by application programs.
I changed the filesystem to ext4 makes the issue disappear.
When accessing a large file (compared to the DRAM size) randomly,
(I tested in many machines with many kernel versions.
Or Is there any way I can clear the 4096KB area only ?
If you did not specify noatime then Linux needs to update the inode every time a file is accessed (to set the access time), which means it has to read the area of the disk containing the inode, and write it back out.
(Ext3 has a block which has block pointers in every 1024 blocks.)
