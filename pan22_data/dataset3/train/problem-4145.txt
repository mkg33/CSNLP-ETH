I say curiosity, because the server runs fine without it also !!
You may have a look into your rpm (or maybe yum, if you're using it) logs to determine currently installed packages.
It's not really a big deal, your system isn't hosed.
Its my pure curiosity to know of a method by which we can restore the database of the installed rpm's
If you've kept a backup, then you might be able to restore it.
Your only chance, if this system is important enough, is to reinstall only to db:
That said, if this system can suffer downtime, I'd suggest re-installing as the best way.
You said you already did this first step, but for future reference (and for anyone else that runs into this)
Edit:  I read wrong -- if you removed the entire /var/lib/rpm directory you are a bit hosed.
I've never tried to, but you can try to set up a new empty RPM database (copy from fresh install?)
Otherwise, you've wiped the only copy of the RPM database.
I did the steps mentioned like rpm --rebuild and ll that but it did not help
and reinstall all currently installed packages in the current installed versions.
Just run the above command(s) and you should be back in business.
You could use your /root/install.log and /var/log/yum.log to get a list of installed RPMs, or, if you have a similar system you could get the RPM list from there.
(The rpm --rebuilddb command rebuilds some files in that directory from others.)
Sometime ago I managed to erase the /var/lib/rpm folder which basically contains information about all the rpms in the System
Thanks in advance for reading this post and thinking of a solution
The problem posed is that I cannot query nor Upgrade using the yum
