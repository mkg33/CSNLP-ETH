If this is cable that has been run through the walls then you should terminate in an RJ-45 Jack on the wall, not just crimp an end on.
They're called keystone jacks and snap into a keystone wall plate with one, two, four...openings.
Once the cables get kinked near the wall opening, you end up having to rerun the entire length of cable.
Direct attaching the RJ-45 crimp to the horizontal cabling runs isn't good practice.
If you're already using a premade cable with male ends then perhaps the F-F option is easier for you.
If the patch cable gets damaged, then it too is easily replaced.
The first option requires a punchdown tool to punch your conductors into place and is more typical because we run cable from a spool and cut it to length.
The only place you see this in industry is inside IP CCTV camera enclosures where there is no room for a jack and a patch cable, but there is also no movement of the cable inside the housing and the cable isn't subjected to motion or wear and tear.
If the cable stays in the wall with a bit of slack and is punched down to a wall jack, only the jack is subjected to wear, and it can be easily replaced.
Actually, both two options will provide the connection.
You can then use a patch cable to get from the jack on the wall to the device you are connecting.
Cables that protrude from apertures in wall openings are going to get damaged.
Buy technically, the first option is preferable, since Cat 6 wall jack uses solid cable which ensures better signals.
