To deal with this MTA weirdness my solution is to install SSMTP.
SSMTP will fill the MTA requirement, and not cause APT to do confusing things to try and make sure you have a MTA installed.
So you can install SSMTP at the same time as every other MTA in the standard repo.
These requirements, alternatives, and conflicts make changing your installed MTA a bit tricky.
The SSMTP package, which is a light-weight no-daemon outgoing only MTA that will fulfill the MTA requirement, and doesn't conflict with other MTA.
The order of the alternatives is such that removing exim will result in an alternate version of exim being installed or another MTA.
Trying to purge exim, or any of the other MTAs will result in an alternative being installed.
Once it is installed, you can purge exim, or other MTAs, and change things around how you like.
On Debian having an MTA is required by a large number of packages.
Since simply purging the MTA is not easy, and if you really did try to purge your MTA, you would have to also install almost everything that could use an MTA.
