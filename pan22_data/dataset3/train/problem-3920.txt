With just one chain, you're not doing MIMO, you just doing traditional SISO (Single In, Single Out), so you're not much better off than 802.11a or 802.11g.
Maybe the 2x2 AP is buggy and sometimes tries to use 2x2 rates that the 1x1 device doesn't support, and ends up having to do increased retransmits or has increased packet loss.
802.11n introduced the concept of MIMO (Multiple Ins, Multiple Outs) to Wi-Fi networking.
You only want to limit yourself to a single radio chain if you're doing a long-distance outdoor link and trying to save money on antennas, or perhaps for certain troubleshooting situations.
I installed DD-WRT on my TP-Link WDR3600 and it says I have two physical radio interfaces.
The only time you'd want to disable a radio chain is if you were trying to do a long-distance outdoor link, and didn't have an antenna rig that could provide enough separation between your two radio/antenna chains.
For each of the eight 1-spatial-stream rates, there is a 2-spatial-stream rate that doubles it.
Short version: Using both radio chains is potentially twice as fast as just using one.
You always want both chains in operation for the fastest rates.
MIMO radios use multiple radio chains working in parallel to transmit twice as much data at a time as a single radio could do.
So SISO 802.11n with 40MHz channels can do 150Mbps, and 2x2:2 MIMO 802.11n with 40MHz channels can do 300Mbps.
If you didn't want to have to mount twice as many antennas on your antenna masts at each end of the link, and have them spaced far enough apart that they don't interfere with each other, then you might opt for a SISO link for cost/simplicity sake, even though it means only half the throughput (150 Mbps max PHY rate instead of 300).
However, both have the option to select the TX and RX antenna chains (either 1 or 1+2).
Of course, 802.11n also allows you to double your channel width to 40MHz.
If you have a 1x1 802.11n device that isn't working well with your 2x2 AP, you might want to limit your AP to 1x1 temporarily to see if the 1x1 device works better.
I found this IEEE article which defines what they are, but it doesn't explain how I'd use that information when configuring a device.
But if you turn on both radio chains so you're doing 2x2:2 MIMO, your max PHY rate (again, with 20MHz channels, for a fair comparison with A/G) doubles to 144.4Mbps.
Information on antenna chains has been difficult to find, (google seems to think I want to search for antenna gain).
A and G used 20MHz wide channels and got a maximum PHY rate of 54Mbps.
What is an antenna chain, what does 1 / 1+2 mean, and how would I be able to figure out the correct setting for my device?
Based on the options in the network mode dropdown menu, I assume that one is the 2.4Ghz radio and the other is the 5.0Ghz radio.
Doubling your channel width has the bonus of increased efficiency, so it actually slightly more than doubles your max PHY rate.
If you use those same 20MHz-wide channels with 802.11n and limit yourself to SISO (a single radio chain), your maximum PHY rate only goes up to 72.2Mbps.
This increase is only because 802.11n added a couple new higher-rate modulation schemes than A/G had.
The second radio chain doubles your set available rates.
I suppose one other reason to limit to a single radio chain would be temporary, for debugging things like interoperability problems.
