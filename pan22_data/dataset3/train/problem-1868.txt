For some columns I am able to change the date format but not for others.
The dates should be displayed in the appropriate format for each language & culture.
I am working on a global financial app that uses Excel for the UI.
Use the optional Local:=True when opening the file programmatically.
This ensures that any number stored as a serial date will be formatted per the user's system locale.
=ISNUMBER(A1) - FALSE indicates those dates are formatted as text.
Now format dates using one of the * formats so that they change according to regional settings as Marc B says
If you can't change the format for some dates that may mean those dates are formatted as text.
Select a single column > Data > Text to columns > Next > Next > under "column data format" choose "Date" and from the dropdown choose the appropriate format based on the source, e.g.
If that's the case you can convert a whole column to true dates by using Text to Columns functionality.
if dates look like 2012-12-25 then that's YMD > OK > ESC
