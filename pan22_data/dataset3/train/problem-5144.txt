Add that XML to your collector subscription, or create a new subscription.
Applications and Services Logs/Microsoft/Windows/Windows Defender/Operational,
Copy the XML from event viewer from another computer that has the event log.
like described in this technet post: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_start/access-scan-logs/1066927e-35c8-4e66-ae3b-ca542776312c
Or should I create a PS script which moves the desired logs to another location like the Security log so my 2012R2 server can collect the events?
You can ignore that error because there is no Windows Defender on Server 2012 R2.
Export Custom View and copy the XML file to Server 2012 R2.
Maybe someone who knows how I can collect these logs?
I have successfully setup a Server 2012 R2 as the Event Collector Server for Windows Defender.
Windows Defender event should forward to the Server 2012 R2.
I'm trying to set up Windows Event Forwarding on a Windows 2012 R2 collector server.
When I look in the Application and Services log, I can't find the Windows Defender application on the collector server (because I think the feature is not installed so it can't be listed here).
I was looking to collect events from Windows Defender, which comes by default on Windows 7 and 8 clients.
I know that Windows Defender is not supported by Microsoft on 2012 R2.
On Windows 10/8.1 workstation, create a custom event view and select Windows Defender/Operation.
I just want to collect the events with a subscription from the supported clients.
Import XML file to Custom Views on Server 2012 R2.
Click on the down arrow on on the Select Events... and select Copy from existing Custom View and select the Source workstations.
