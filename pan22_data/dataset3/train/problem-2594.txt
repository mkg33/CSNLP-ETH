which might be more applicable to your problem at hand.
This is my personal opinion, the algorithms which you shouldn't miss out on are:
As others have pointed out, http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/ is a good book and it has videos to go with it.
4) Other methods of dimensionality reduction like LDA
3) Common techniques of dimensionality reduction like PCA
I have been in the Analytics area for about 11 years and a Data Scientist for 2.5 years and I'm speaking from experience.
On the other hand, you should definitely be aware of other things out there (more recent algorithms like deep learning, SVM, XGboost etc.)
11) Box Jenkins methods in time-series forecasting
I think Dr. Andrew Ng's course goes into a quite a few details of some algorithms and it's a good start.
12) Information theory: information gain, mutual gain etc.
6) Optimization methods: gradient based search methods, linear programming and discrete optimization
Well, I would say knowing the intricacies of 1 or 2 algorithms in detail( like the inner workings of their parameters) is definitely better than knowing how to run a bunch of them.
