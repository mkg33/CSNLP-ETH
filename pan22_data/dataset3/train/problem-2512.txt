Outlook 2003 or 2007, go to Tools -> Options -> Calendar Options (button) -> Free/Busy Options (button), you should now see the "Publish [x] months of of Calendar free/busy information on the server".
This is normally an Outlook setting, rather than Exchange, it's to do with how much free/busy information each user publishes to the server.
It also looks like if there are no scheduled meetings "nearby" that Outlook also shows "No Information".
Anyway, I scheduled a weekly meeting at 4AM on Sundays and that seems to have resolved that problem as well.
In both Outlook 2003 and 2007 the default is 2 months.
When you're deploying Office (or creating a corporate install package) this is one of the settings you cans set in the Office custom install wizard/customization tool (2003 CIW, 2007 OCT).
You don't mention which version of Outlook you're using, so I'll take a couple of guesses.
I guess Outlook and/or Exchange don't really publish "Free/Busy" information, but just "Busy" information, so that there's no difference between "Free for a long time" and "No Information".
Publishing Free\Busy data is a function of Outlook, not Exchange.
