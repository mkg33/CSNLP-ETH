Taking the server off-line, and yanking out the files with a live CD.
I have a problem with some profile files that refuse to be deleted.
Are you trying to delete them directly from Documents and Settings?
When selecting the profile if the delete button is grayed out it means that the profile hasn't been unloaded completely.
You should be deleting them from the User Profiles settings of the system properties.
Can anyone recommend an app or utility to help me out here?
(which would be my normal recourse) is out the question as this baby runs 24/7 serving about 50 people at any one time.
You should install the User Profile Hive Cleanup Service on the server as well.

I need to nuke these files so that one particular user can actually log on to this terminal server.
(yes I know, we should have a redundant terminal server, but try explaining that to management when they are already so happy with the existing one!
