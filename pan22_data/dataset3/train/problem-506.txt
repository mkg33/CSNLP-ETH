If you want to fix it without reinstalling, then you're in for some hardship.
I have installed a fresh version of Windows 10 while the boot mode was legacy mode in the BIOS.
This will let Windows recreate the boot partitions it needs for EFI (which are quite different from what it uses for legacy style booting).
Then, backup your data, cause if any of the next bit goes wrong you may not get another chance.
Paragon Hard Disk Manager has worked well for me for years.
The simplest way would be to re-run the Windows installation (making sure to repartition your disks along the way) now that UEFI mode is enabled.
The Windows 7-10 installers all default to GPT partition schemes and EFI boot loaders when the install cd is booted using (U)EFI.
When I change it to UEFI Windows does not boot anymore.
GParted is passable, but can be quirky... and when editing your partitions quirky is not a good thing.
First, you will need to lay hands on a solid partition editing utility.
You'll need to convert your hard drive to a GPT partition scheme, delete all but your C: partition (specifically, delete the windows system partitions it created during installation), resize you windows partition to be a bit smaller but still be at the very end of the disk (making more room at the beginning), and then switch to the windows install CD and run startup repair.
