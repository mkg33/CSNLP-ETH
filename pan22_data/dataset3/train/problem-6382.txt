Should I rate-limit any of these types of ICMP packets?
The sad reality is that many admins fear what they do not understand, and so they cast ICMP out of their network universe, shunning it at the edge firewall level and preventing it from taking its right and proper place for the benefit of their network.
Exercise your innate paranoia in dreaming up nightmare scenarios :-)
The above represents the opinions of one sysadmin, who for his part is FREAKIN' TIRED OF HAVING TO TROUBLESHOOT NETWORKS WHERE ALL ICMP TRAFFIC IS DROPPED -- It's annoying, frustrating, and makes it take longer to find and fix problems.
How should I layout an iptables ruleset to handle each type of ICMP packet?
This may be the only legit exception to the "leave it the hell alone" philosophy -- rate- or bandwidth-limiting ICMP messages can be useful in helping you evade illegitimate uses of the ICMP messages.
Mucking about with ICMP traffic prevents the appropriate uses of ICMP messages (traffic management and troubleshooting) - it will be more frustrating than helpful.
FreeBSD ships with ICMP Bandwidth / Rate Limiting by default, and I assume Linux has similar functionality.
It sounds like you are falling victim to the "ICMP IS EVIL" mantra.
The names of the various ICMP messages pretty much detail what they are capable of doing.
Absent a good reason to mess with ICMP traffic, leave it the hell alone!
Rate/Bandwidth limiting is far preferable to a blanket firewall rule dropping ICMP traffic: It still allows ICMP to serve its purpose on the network, and also partially mitigates attempts to abuse your server.
Which types of ICMP messages can be harmful, and why?
