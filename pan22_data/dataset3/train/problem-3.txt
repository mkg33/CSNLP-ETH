And updates should not need to touch /home/ anyway.
I am a professional programmer, using Fedora 10 (and a host of other packages individually installed).
This will prompt you for which fedora version to upgrade to.
Would you feed it the full list of installed packages instead you might pull in a lot of dependencies that might not be needed anymore.
As for updating there is a pretty good guide in the Fedora wiki.
Mount root on a seperate partition to ~/, then you just have to install the new version into your / partition, keeping all your apps/data as they were in the 1st place... That's what I always do anyway...
You could also just use Debian, then you don't need to reinstall, you can just update :-).
Seriously: Fedora has a nice package manager with dependency tracking.
If instead you just need to repeatedly install a bunch of the same software on different machines, you can just note the list of packages in a textfile once and then feed that to yum when you set up a machine:
After you choose one it just download all needed packages and then install the upgrade.
Install the preupgrade package and then run preupgrade os root.
Every year or so, I go through the ritual dance, usually with a second computer and a KVM switch as I don't have office space for two monitors, to build the next version of Fedora and install all my favorite apps.
Also, I keep /home on a separate raid-ed drive set so I can also fall prey to 'old-config-file-itis'.
At least a nice way to keep track of what I need to 'add on' so that I don't have to manually install my app collection?
The procedure works reasonably well when you go in small version steps.
