In the "Cells" group, click on the "Format" icon -> a drop down menu will appear select "AutoFit Cell Width".
But to me, the trick was to select all the rows that need to be taken into account.
So yeah, in a nutshell, to visualize a CSV file generated automatically:
by the way, if you have used Word for awhile, you will recognize the drop down menu.
I have found that some of the cells need to be widened to allow the data to fit.
Note that it might be counter intuitive but the first row is not enough to let Excel figure out it must resize based on all the content in each column.
As Dunc answer didn't work for me and other answers are incomplete:
How do I automatically adjust the height of the cells to fit the content?
In the margin, where the columns are named, double-click the border of the columns that needs to be widened, same place where you would click and drag to manually resize.
In the "Cells" group, click on the "Format" icon -> a drop down menu will appear select "AutoFit Row Height".
