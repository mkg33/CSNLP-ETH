Just discovered that the latest update to Kindle for iPhone has introduced the ability to add files to Kindle for iPhone via "File Sharing in iTunes".
After i downloaded Kindle for IPhone, i went into iTunes on my PC, select 'File' -> 'Add file to library' -> select Kindle from the PC desktop.
If you've already added your books to Kindle for pc, the default storage directory for your kindle books is: Libraries/Documents/My Kindle Content
Click there, find your books in your Documents and from there you can import them to your iPhone - hope this helps.
I haven't tested if using this mechanism will also keep the books synced between the iPhone and PC, but at least I now have a way to get the books on to the device.
A few minutes later, my books from the Kindle for PC showed up in the ARCHIVE list at the the kindle for iPhone.
Hey I am not sure if you are still struggling to place your PC books to your iPhone, but if you go into iTunes and click on the kindle app and you will notice an "Add Documents" to the right.
Unfortunately, "kindle for iPhone" doesn't support books not brought from Amazon.
All the books i had bought for my Kindle for PC were from Amazon though.
You can manually add books from Kindle for PC to your Kindle for Iphone / Ipad / Ipod app.
I went into that list and downloaded them into my main kindle list.
