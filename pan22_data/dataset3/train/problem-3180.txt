I ended up having LogMeIn installed by a local tech and when I logged in with my account I found a dialog waiting for me to click on that said 'Windows Service Pack 1 installed Successfully' or something to that effect.
Looks like installing SP1 (via Windows Update or via the standalone installer) effectively disables Remote Desktop until someone actually clicks "OK" on that "SP1 installed succesfully" window.
Try to change server authentication settings in RDP client:
From the Azure management portal, the Boot Diagnostics panel shows a picture of the current screen, and it was showing this:
After installing all of the updates on the fresh and clean instance of WS2012R2, I did get login and password prompt while trying to RDP, but it immediately disappeared after hitting Enter.

I had a similar thing as well with regards to Windows Updates.
The issue is still happening on WS2012R2 machines.
One of the updates seemed to disable RDP and VNC Services but local login was fine.
