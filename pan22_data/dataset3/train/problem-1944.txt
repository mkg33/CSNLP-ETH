As far as cooling goes, a full chassis will use denser power-per-rack-unit, and will require correspondingly more cooling.
Therefore, they tend to (all else equal) make more noise than rackmount servers (other than 1U boxen, which also have tiny fans).
Blade servers are usually pretty silent - it's the fans in the enclosures that are noisy.
I have some HP C3000 chassis, and when their fans are spooled up you can hear them through a door and down two flights of stairs.
I brought my shooting earmuffs to work for when I need to be in there for any length of time.
Although often more efficient in terms of overall power consumption, the act of pulling and pushing air through passive modular components with large front and rear facing blowers is always likely to create more noise.
A single blade in an enclosure will be noisier than a single pizza-box server but a full blade enclosure should be quieter than the same number of pizza-box servers added up.
Most blades have smaller fans running at higher RPMs, to move the required amount of air, than a typical 2U+ rackmount server.
When the fans are throttled back, they are no noiser than any other relatively-powered pile of computers.
That said, HP has seriously re-engineered their blade racks, so this may no longer be true.
Blades shouldn't need any external cooling equipment.
When we put in the HP Bladeserver rack back in 2005 the noise level in the datacenter increased markedly.
What's more, the fans on that particular rack system had a particular whine harmonic that really drove me nuts.
