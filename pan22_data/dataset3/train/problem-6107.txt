When you apply this formula to a date field it will show the serial number of the date as text.
To get around this, use this formula instead of the one above for date fields:
This will covert all formulas into the value they represent instead of a formula and then covert the values that are number into text.
Then you can Paste Special>Values bock over the originals.
In Page 1 of the wizard, choose the appropriate type (this will probably be Delimited).
Copy/Paste that for the full width and length of your original sheet.
In Page 3, click Text under Column data format to indicate that this column is text.
You probably want to copy into a new spreadsheet so you don't lose your formulas.
You can select all the fields, right click and copy, then right click and paste special/values.
Right click on the selected cells and click Format Cells
In Page 2, remove any column dividers that may have shown up to keep the data in one column.
That should make everything have your little green patch.
And save all these changes in the same excel document?
highlight the numbers and use the Data > Text to Columns command.
Given an existing Excel 2003 document with cells of any type (integers, text, decimal, etc), how do I convert the contents of every cell to text?
Then select all the fields and do as Mark Robinson suggested: click Format Cells and chose text.
