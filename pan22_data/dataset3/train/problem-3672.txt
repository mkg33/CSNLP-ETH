I think this may be a rootkit, because I am admin, and still can't do anything.
You should now be able to fully browse, modify, and delete that folder and its contents.
It could be malicious, but it is unlikely and I highly doubt it is a rootkit.
Not sure if it is just locked or you do not have access so giving answers for both scenarios:
If however it isn't, and you are using XP Pro, go to Tools > Folder Options and disable Use Simple File Sharing, then right click the folder and go to the security tab.
Remember to carefully delete unknown files/ folders :)
If you are using XP Home, go in to Safe Mode to do it.
You should be able to add your account and take full control over the folder.
This is most likely just a temporary folder by a Windows update or a setup which is currently running in the background.
is there any way to delete or change the permissions on the file so I can see what's in it?
there is a dir called C:\dcfa827bc56b26f4dc922bb28e on my hard disk that is protected or something and I can't view any files in the subdirs Program Files and Setup.
Download Microsoft / Sysinternals Process Explorer, and click the find icon and copy and paste the directory name in to it, it should allow you to see what process is holding on to it, and you can then kill it, or just let it continue to do its thing.
To delete blocked by system process files/ folders I recomend Unlocker (http://download.cnet.com/Unlocker/3000-2248_4-10493998.html)
