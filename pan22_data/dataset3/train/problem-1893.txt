My abstract class has reference to every class that extends it.
How can I change the execution order of a MonoBehaviour?
If you're running this script every frame, you could consider using Update and LateUpdate across different scripts.
I have a script that I want to run before any other script.
I could do that using the Script Execution Order Settings option from within Unity, but I want to do this programmatically.
You can set the order via scripts using the MonoImporter class, specifically, the method SetExecutionOrder:
Depending on what you're looking for, you might do the "early" calculation at the end of a LateUpdate call as described here.
An example of what I am looking for would be along the lines of:
However, I haven't seen this in the documentation post 5.0, so it may be depreciated if you're using the latest version.
Changing the execution order of an abstract class is not an option in the Script Execution Order Settings.
The reason I want to do this programmatically is because the script has an abstract class, and I want to avoid requiring the user to change the execution order every time they extend the class.
