Wireless users, connected via FortiAP and coming into the Fortinet on a separate "wireless" interface, have a completely separate subnet and are not allowed any LAN access; Internet only.
When they attempt to connect to the website host address, it fails.
Internal users are using internal DNS, which resolves the same hostname to a private IP address, providing direct access to the website, and this works normally.
I'm using a Fortinet 311B firewall and having an issue understanding why this traffic is being blocked.
I've checked the logs and I'm not seeing any of my interesting traffic show up.
Since they are Internet only, they are using external DNS and resolving the outside IP address.
I've tried creating ACL entries to allow traffic from the wireless interface to the External interface, and even a "NAT 0" rule for this traffic, but I'm wondering if there is some other security feature at work here, as I know firewalls don't necessarily like this sort of "hairpin" traffic.
This outside IP address of the web server is a virtual IP on the Fortinet attached to the External interface, with a 1-to-1 NAT to the internal web server.
External users (via the Internet) can access this website with no problem.
There is an access rule and matching NAT statement for an external IP address pointing to an internal web server.
