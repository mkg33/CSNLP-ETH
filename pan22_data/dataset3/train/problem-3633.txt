you could try & shorten the path it has to work with... in a shell i.e.
Hope this helps anyone who came here from google like I did.
This extracts overly-long-file-name from archive.rar, into a file named shorter-name.
You can work around this problem by printing the problematic file to stdout and redirecting it to a file:
The usual filesystem limitation of 255 chars applies to unique file or directory names, not their entire path.
from there... you should be able to manipulate your files however you need... and/or put them where they should go.
The problem is that the RAR file format allows the archive to contain files which name can exceed 255 chars.
(make sure you sudo su - in ubuntu or you won't have sufficient privileges to write to the root dir.)
I then right click on the file in Clementine and click "show in file browser".
I had this problem with mp3s from Bandcamp - their files have the artist and the album title and the song title in the filename, so sometimes they get long!
Just remember to clean-up your / by removing the temporary directory.
instead of trying to extract files to some directory like /long/directory/name/some/path/where/fish/live/ ... you should be able to extract them to a short dir like /a
My workaround is to the use Ark's "preview" option.
I then stop the song playing, then quickly rename it in the temp directory and cut and paste it to where I want it.
If you are too slow, then the file disappears from the temp directory and you have to start again.
Once I have selected the offending file, and selected Preview, it then starts playing in my music player (I use Clementine).
This then opens up a file browser window showing the temp directory that the previewed file is being kept in (if you use a different music player without this option, guess you will just have to find the directory manually).
As a non-techy, I did not understand what "printing the problematic file to stdout" means, but this workaround works for me!
