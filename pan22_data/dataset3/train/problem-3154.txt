The VMWare is being stopped completely or the Unbuntu server is stopped and shutdown?
It sounds like either something is flooding the network or there is a conflicting address between the firewall and the vmware box.
My guess would be the VMWare server us flooding the network for some reason.
I had something similiar at one point where about once every 2 weeks or so one of my windows servers would do the same thing you have.
Rebooting was my fix though since I was replacing the server soon it wasn't worth troubleshooting.
Is your ipcops external interface comeing out also on the vmware lan interfac?
You need to isolate which of those 3 things is causing it.
It sounds like it's probably time to fire up Wireshark and see what's happening.
A VMware ESX server was taking down some Cisco switch, those switch just put the fastethernet in disable (hardware error), this stop happening when the vmware box was removed from the network.
Another possibility might be some sort of bridging on the vmware box causing ethernet problems.
When you say unplug the VMWare is it the physical machine being unplugged?
i once had similar problem when i had more than one interface comeing from my vmware host to a switch with trunks.
