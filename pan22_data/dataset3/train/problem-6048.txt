thx to Josh you guys,other solutions didn't work out for me except for this one ...papa bless Josh Rohl wherever you are
I'm using a Microsoft account for the login of my Windows 10 PC.
I would like to remove this strange account and again be able to boot without login prompt.
One is my Microsoft account and the active account it tries to prompt the login for looks like a local account (that account didn't exist before).
Now I changed the computer name of my Windows 10 PC.
Manually changing the DefaultDomainName to the same as my computer name solved the problem.
When I setup my PC I set it up the way that I didn't need to enter a password on boot up (can't remember how I did that).
Changing the computer name in the system settings didn't update the DefaultDomainName in the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon.
restart computer and choose the "forgot your password" option under your Microsoft account login (not the pseudo login with no picture)
Not sure if this is a Windows 10 bug or expected behavior?
Hopefully this helps people out with a somewhat simple solution (even if it's a bit annoying).
Since the name change my PC boots up and then tells me that the username or password was wrong.
