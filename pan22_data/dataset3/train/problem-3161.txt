I know it's not illegal, but WHAT EXACTLY can jeefang chen gain from this?
I can't quite see how any of these might work... All ideas and clarification welcome
As other have noted, if your server exists in a shared services environment, then you may be sharing the IP address.
You are most likely using a shared server to host your domain.
It is most commonly used to validate incoming SMTP connections.
There are four requirements for a PTR record to be reliable for reverse DNS spoofing:
Multiple domains can exist on a single IP address.
However, automated mail sending services are often poorly configured.
Reverse DNS is useful for providing some measure of trust in the identity of a connecting server.
The domain may have previously been hosted on your IP address.
Verify the results from the authoritative DNS servers for the IP address.
This unknown domain does not belong to me but to a jeefang cheng in Fuzhou City China, who also owns 960 other domains.
If I do a reverse DNS lookup on my domain's public IP address, I see an unknown domain in the list of websites that use this IP address.
You should direct your question to the owner of that IP address.
Some resolver configurations may result in reverse look values being returned from /etc/hosts or other local databases.
Otherwise, your IP address provider may not have cleaned up their PTR database.
