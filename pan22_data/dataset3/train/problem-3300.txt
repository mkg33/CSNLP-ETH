e:\hyper-V Replica (this is the directory I had setup to receive replication)
I had to do something similar in my Hyper-V Replica directory for Replication to work again.
(I didn't bother to check if that is all the same for all directories, maybe it is and you could just set it up with a few commands one directory level above)
The problems were around two directories and their subdirectories:
This made me find out which files vmms.exe was actually having trouble accessing.
Perhaps try creating a new folder and giving the Everyone group full access on it, and see if you can create a VM in there.
Have you tried creating the machine somewhere other than under the C:\Users folder?
I had to do it on both Servers, Primary and Replica, to find on which one the error was actually happening.
A lot of permissions that were present on the working server had mysteriously gone missing on the broken server.
Something totally screwed up folder permissions on my Hyper-V Server and I started getting these same 0x80070005 Access Denied errors, when creating VM's, starting or resuming Replication, etc.
Does the host server have any other roles installed?
I had a different Hyper-V server that was working fine, and I used it to compare the permission settings on that server and discover what was missing.
I don't recommend you leave the permissions set like that, but this would confirm that it's a filesystem permission issue.
My troubleshooting method was to use SysInternals ProcMon to catch all vmms.exe activity during an operation that was giving this error.
c:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Hyper-V (this is a configuration directory that exists on all Hyper-V 2012 servers)
Ok, I had a similar problem, but not exactly the same, so I'll leave my acquired knowledge here for future reference:
With the correct settings I made up this batch file to run on the broken server:
