The problem i'm having is that we end up with file system corruption on these drives.
This may also impact performance, but I'd give it a try and see how it works out (since you're mainly doing sequential writes anyway).
Currently we have 2 SATA hard drives housed in removable enclosures (NTFS partitions).
Disabling Write Caching on the drive(s) may fix the corruption problem.
Running chkdsk seems to correct the problem, but i'd like to avoid any corruption in the first place.
to re-initialize the drive after it's physically swapped out, to ensure that Windows is aware of the current drive.
The error states that "the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable".
My main question is how can I achieve my goal of having a hot-swappable drive backup solution without corruption (what setup worked for you i.e.
The files that are copied are large virtual machine files ranging from 20-100 gigs in size.
Open Device Manager, find the drive, pull up it's properties, Policy tab, uncheck Write caching.
Also is there a way to determine what is causing this corruption?
Each week the drive is swapped out with the other one after the backup job has completed.
