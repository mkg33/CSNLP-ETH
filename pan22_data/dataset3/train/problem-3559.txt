Part of what you're seeing is the actual width of the space characters you enter, and part is the justification process Word uses, especially if you select full justification (flush left and right).
Word may also treat spaces of different widths differently when it allocates extra spacing for justification, so you could try doubling a narrower space character.
If you require full justification, experiment with the space characters you use.
The most commonly used of the other space characters can be inserted as a symbol:
They prevent adjacent words at the end of a line from being split between lines, but they might also be treated as "fixed" spaces that Word doesn't adjust for justification.
That should pretty much stick to the spacing you enter, but will produce a "ragged" right text margin.

There are actually lots of different standard-sized spaces.
A hard space can be entered directly using Ctrl+Shift+Space.
But, for example, hard spaces (non-breaking spaces) may work.

You may be able to solve the problem by switching to left-justified.
With full justification, Word fills in most the the extra space it needs between words.
I don't have ready access to Word at the moment, so I can't test specific characters and combinations.
