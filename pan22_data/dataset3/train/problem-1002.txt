Here, the question is about how Linux selects the outbound interface for a particular packet.
You're not supposed to have the same network configured on multiple interfaces, there's no point in it.
I don't have exact information about that, but my educated guess is that it depends on the order the interfaces are configured on the system.
There is no routing involved here, because the source and destination are in the same IP network.
However, as Henrik mentioned above, there isn't any good reason to configure two interfaces with two IP addresses on the same network.
Routing happens on intermediate nodes during the packet's journey from one IP network to another IP network.
If the two interfaces are now connected to the same thing, it's just wrong (things on one either side will think they're in a net with things on the other side, but not be able to reach them), if they are, that thing will probably just use one of the interfaces anyway.
(If you tried doing this to get redundancy look at bonding - that's what linux calls it, others call it other things).
I actually don't know if the kernel looks at the metric value or just uses whatever it found first, but it doesn't really matter.
