I have a dual-boot system with Linux, so I just booted into Linux, navigated to the file and deleted it.
Having tried all of these suggestions and more, I still couldn't delete the offending files.
Type dir /x to obtain the 8.3 formatted filenames.
There are a number of ways to tackle this issue, but the most simple way is with the DEL command, as mentioned above.
Then to delete it just issue the following command, issuing the same /A parameter:
Of course that deletes all files in that dir, so if you want other files to remain you should move them out or back them up first.
I had an image that has no extension by the name cropped_image_new1597487825.
What finally did it was to use the following syntax (in an elevated command prompt):
This should bypass the issue you're having with the del command and windows explorer.
That will list all files in that directory regardless of attribute.
In order to see them in CMD prompt using DIR, navigate to the folder in question and issue the following command:
It's important to note, however, that DEL by itself will not work as the files in this case tend to get flagged with the System attribute thus you must issue a special parameter to have them show up.
If the file is flagged as read-only then you'll need to add a bit to that code, let me know.
Just save that text as whatever.vbs and double click it.
