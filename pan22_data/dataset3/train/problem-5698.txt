I'm developing a mediator for an MVVM application.
This is my first implementation of the mediator pattern ever.
The mediator communicates messages and triggers callbacks between ViewModels.
At this stage I still don't know how high so I preferred to use a hashet instead of a list to avoid it being a bottleneck later on.
This list of messages could get a lot longer than that as I continue development.
The number of callbacks per message will potentially be between 0 and 10, but it could potentially go a lot higher than that.
These callbacks can take no parameters or a single object parameter of any given type :
The mediator is a singleton that can register multiple callbacks for each message and triggers them when the message is emitted.
This application lets employees file tickets with IT support to ask for help.
The AddableHashSet is a hashset with the + and - operators overloaded to simplify the syntax in the Mediator: using += and -= follows the event += eventhandler() pattern.
The callbacks are stored in a MultiDictionary: a regular dictionary where each entry can store a hashset :
