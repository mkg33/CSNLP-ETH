They want to have to explicitly call those privileges.
This allows me to manage the users in a group by just adding and deleting them from the group but gives them separate roles that they have to explicitly set if they want to insert, delete, etc.
They would essentially be a part of two roles, their limited role that they are granted and inherit from and the privileged role they have to set The business and users don't want their elevated privileges to be inherited to their main role.
What I have are users that inherit from their normal "data_analyst" group.
But I have a few users that will have elevated privileges.
I'm a little new with postgres but have a decent understanding of roles.
My initial thought was to create a new group for the elevated users and when they need their elevated privileges they would run SET ROLE elevated_role.
If the user has been granted inherit they wouldn't need to SET their role because they would already have inherited it.
This group is used to manage all data analyst users with basic permissions.
But this is problem based on my understanding of roles.
