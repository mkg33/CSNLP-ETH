When its done, you can then round the value it found to suit your needs.
This solution assumes you are looking at equal payments from a certain point onward.
The process will change the value of C3 over and over again until it get a value in E3 equal to your target value when possible.
In C3 place your anticipated amount of regular future deposits.
In E3 we will place a formula that will calculate the IRR based on the number of entries you pick.
In your example that would be .25 DO NOT ENTER 25.
Populate column A with value you know and then after the last value you know point it at C3 and make it an absolute reference as follows:
Then set the By Changing Cell value to your regular deposit amount in C3.
In D3 place the number of the deposit you want to evaluate to.
Copy $A$4 down as far as you deem necessary to cover your maximum number of future deposits for your scenario.
Use the built in Excel formula for IRR as follows:
Now switch your ribbon to the DATA ribbon and look for the What if Analysis pull down in the DATA TOOLS section:
Set the Set Cell value to E3 where the formula to calculate the IRR is located.
