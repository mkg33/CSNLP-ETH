Not useful advice, except that I installed v4.04 on Windows 7 x64 yesterday and it works fine, so it's not fundamentally incompatible.
Every upgrade went smoothly, until I tried to upgrade to 4.04 (I can't remember what version I had on the machine previously).
Well, I waited over an hour and it still hasn't finished.
Does anyone have advice on how to "clean" my system so that I can get VirtualBox running again?
Cancelling doesn't do anything, so I had to kill the process to get out of the installation.
I was running all previous versions of VirtualBox on my Win7 x64 system without any problems.
At the moment, it is just stuck on the step after it disables network drivers and says it "could take several minutes".
Do you have anything else in the way of low level networking programs installed - a VPN client, or Wireshark/packet capture, etc.
The network message could be a red herring, have you tried installing VirtualBox into a different directory, in case it's not liking upgrading something?
