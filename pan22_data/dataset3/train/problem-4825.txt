Now is there a way I can correlate the wait types with my actual queries.
I have a query to find the wait types in which my system is suffering from.
The output contains a row for each wait type, along with the number of tasks that waited, and the amount of time they waited.
You could either use Adam Mechanics sp_whoisactive or the below script and periodically insert the results into a table for later analysis.
Query is taken from Paul Randal's blog Wait statistics, or please tell me where it hurts
If you use SQL Server 2016+, you can use a new dynamic management view, or DMV, to see wait stats by session, for currently connected sessions:
After some research I found we can configure extended events to capture the query with wait types.
Brent Ozar has a good post on how to do this is you decide you use sp_whoisactive
Is there any other alternative through any DMV's can we get wait types along with queries.
Replace <session_id> with the SPID you're interested in.
For you info dm_os_waiting_tasks are what is currently happening on your sql server, dm_os_wait_stats are what has happened in the past/or since you restarted sql or it's services.
