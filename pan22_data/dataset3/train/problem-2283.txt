Browser caching is usually a lot of small files, right.
Even if it's been changed to 1%, that's still 5GB of data...
After that, I would suggest Seek speed, and then transfer speed.
That means lots of file seeks, and that means that seek time will be the limit.
For example, in most of the computers today that are being sold, Internet Explorer is still set to use 5% or 10% of your hard drive...  For a system with a 500 GB hard drive that's 25 GB (@ 5%), which means that IE will spend more time going through the cache, than it would have if you just re-downloaded the page.
Now, Firefox & I assume Chrome may have better standard defaults, but generally on any high speed connection, I change the cache size to be at most 10-20 MB (Often I use 5 MB).
The Response time is how fast it can read/write from the Volume  while the Transfer rate is how fast it can send contiguous files.
I would not suggest anything higher than 50 MB, and even then I would seriously question the choice of going that high...
