That should get the raid controller to work in the livecd.
Based on the comments at the end of the firmware section of the install guide, you need to install a package of the firmware in order to keep the version up-to-date, if you don't then you're responsible for keeping a version of the firmware that matches the kernel version.
(You have 10 seconds from when the driver loads to do this, or else the driver fails to load.)
From there, you'll have to mount your drives and recreate your kernel's initrd/initramfs.
Getting to where you need to get to fix this is going to be tough.
This page has instructions on doing this for Squeeze's netinstall CD image, theoretically the process should be the same for an installed system.
If you can't get it to load the firmware automatically, you'll need to do it by hand according to the instructions at the bottom of this page, which would involve probably something like
If the livecd has the adaptec driver you need, if you can keep it from loading the driver until after you mount the USB stick and copy the file to /lib/firmware/ a reasonably good livecd should be able to load the firmware automatically.
