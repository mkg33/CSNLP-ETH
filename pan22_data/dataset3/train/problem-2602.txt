but that more general version is also more indecipherable :-) (and might have its own share of bugs; if floats are not needed, use the earlier version).
You could use Bash brace expansion in a clever way to generate zero-padded filenames, but it will soon become complex.
This prename command will do zero padding to three digits (change the {3} to another number to change the zero padding.
The rename expression works by first padding all numbers with n-1 zeros, then removing as many zeroes as is needed to have n digits left in all numbers.
Make sure there are >{n-1} zeros after the second slash in the first expression):
file_name-12.7-112.97.kmz), but can be easily done with
the prename script, which is available in at least Debian based distributions after installation of Perl.
Easier is to batch rename after you have downloaded the files, using e.g.
(prename is actually linked as rename on most systems.)
Run as prename -nthe first time to be able to visually inspect the renames without doing any changes.
