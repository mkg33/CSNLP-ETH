You can obviously use this when moving up / down and left too.
but you just need to redraw one tile here (or one tile-column) so the new bitmap looks like this:
Just continue to move the big bitmap and instead of brawing All new tiles, you draw the new tiles to the Left of the bitmap and draw the bitmap a second time to the right of the first draw:
The 'old' way (when you really didn't have much processor speed and no GPU) was to use what was called a 'scroller', take your second example and instead of redrawing everything when you have moved one tile (say the game is a Mario clone moving to the right which means you move the bitmap to the left):
What you proposes, so that we can continue moving another tile) is to redraw the whole bitmap like this: 23456
Now we move 1 whole tile to the right, which means the big bitmap moves to the left (well, you can move it pixel by pixel but here you have moved one whole tile):
Keep in mind that there is a maximum size for Bitmaps, depending on which Flash player you're targeting, but that size is at least 2048 pixels in every direction.
Depending on the speed/memory tradeoff you want to make, you can make the background Bitmap wider to make your redraws less frequent.
Rendering dozens of DisplayObjects every frame is going to be slower than occasionally re-blitting to a Bitmap.
