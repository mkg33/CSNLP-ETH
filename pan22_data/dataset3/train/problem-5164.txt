If a program opens the file for writing right away (even though it should only read at that point), it needs more permissions than a program that only reads.
Without this, they are clustered in their directory and have only access to the home directories.
I created an NTFS partition to share my data between my two OS : Kubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10.
With all these configs, I have read/write access to the partition with the user totok (uid 1000), but when I want to open a file with a software, i've got an Access Denied error.
Then there is the need to create a lockfile or a temporary file (in the application's native format).
Wierdest thing : it happens with some softwares, but not all (eg : happens with Gimp, installed with snapd, but not with VSCode or Kate)

You may lack permission to write to some locations.
I will continue to use snap for programs that didn't need to access data partition / that can be installed with --classic option (eg.
So, I figured out that the programs that didn't have the permissions were snap programs installed without the --classic parameter.
The only workaround I found was to remove these applications and install them manually with apt / with the *.deb packages.
