The installation does technically finish, and the client components are installed, but I cant see the new SQL server instance services in administrative tools and I cannot connect to my new instance.
The problem was that the existing SQL2005 installation had the SQL server browser service installed with the incorrect user given (the service was disabled, but I was using the default SQL2005 instance, so I didn't notice).
Install SQL 2008, and attach or restore your SQL '05 databases to the new instance.
I've already tried uninstalling and re-installing SQL Server 2008 with no joy - does anyone have any ideas on how to fix with (preferably without removing SQL server 2005)
Like squillman said, you're probably fighting with the named instance problem of having two SQL servers trying to run.
If this is true then you'll have to do one of the following
I'm trying to install SQL Server 2008 on an XP machine alongside SQL Server 2005, however during the instalaltion process the user that the SQL server browser is to be installed under is listed as "Domain\Machinename" - I'm unable to change that "user" and the installation fails with the message "invalid user "Domain\Machinename"".
It kinda sounds like you're trying to install SQL 2008 as the default instance when the default instance already belongs to your SQL 2005 install (there can be only one default instance).
The SQL 2008 installation was apparently taking the existing service details as paramters for installing the new service - fixing up the existing installed SQL server browser serivce meant that I could install correctly.
