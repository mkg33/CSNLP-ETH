On that basis I am not suggestion that strategy to you.)
How do I troubleshoot this sort of thing on Windows?
Some rudimentary cmd.exe usage knowledge is necessary, but it's something you really should know how to do and worth the time.
Not knowing anything about what the batch file does, and just treating this as a general batch file troubleshooting question, it would be a good first step to run the batch file from a command prompt (as opposed to just clicking on the file in Windows Explorer) so that you can see the output.
I've changed all files in the folders being accessed to non-read only and gave full permissions to Administrator.
I'm running a Pentaho Kettle Kitchen batch scripts on Windows Server 2008.
That will work in many cases, however I make use of the goto :EOF functionality in a lot of my batch files such that the pause would never happen.
When I launch the batch file, the Windows Command prompt pops up and then disappears.
I don't know anything about "Pentaho Kettle Kitchen", but I suspect you've got a situation where the batch file needs to be "Run As Administrator" in order to give the programs being executed a real Administrator user token.
(Somebody might suggest editing the batch file, adding a pause statement at the end, and just double-clicking it in Windows Explorer.
