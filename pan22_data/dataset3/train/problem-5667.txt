Another alternative would be to use ssmtp (a small send-only mail "server").
Check instructions online for relaying to other mail providers.
Postfix, exim, and sendmail are my preferences (in that order.)
If it's gmail, for example, you'll have to make sure your domain you send as (/etc/mailname in postfix) matches the IP you send from.
Note that some mail servers are a bit picky about who they accept mail from.
If it's your local mail server, the restrictions are often done by network so you might not have a problem.
So it will forward the root email to the ISPs SMTP server and not go direct.
I made the below script to setup Ubuntu for smarthost email forwarding with username and password.
You also have to figure out if you can get out, or if your ISP does port 25 blocking.
A complete howto is given in the official Ubuntu documentation.
Check out DynDNS or other similar services if you need to get a domain which matches your IP (if you don't already have one.)
You can then do one of the following (as root) to get mail sent to root@localhost sent to your external email address:
You'll need a mail server installed on your node, yes.
