People don't really care or are unaware of software license at all, not to mention EULA.
I would say because you are using someone elses product.
If you can't read Dutch, then Google Translate might still make it readable.
In such case, a team from the law enforcement body will raid an office and... you can imagine.
If you understand the Dutch language then De (on)geldighed van EULAâ€™s (gastpost) will try to explain it from an European view.
In theory, the EULA is enforceable in most countries (although I would really only know about Australia) as it is a contract that you have agreed to.

In the software world (market), I think we pretty much live on a honest system.
You agree to not use the product for other purposes, diassembly, use code, copy ideas/pictures/exact layout etc.
Legalities dealing with different countries aside...
However, when it comes down to it, if a EULA is challenged or a person is sued or charged for breaking a EULA, it always comes down to the courts to decided whether or not what the person did was illegal or not.
I think this is a case for most US EULAs used in EU.
For some developed countries, people pay more attention and respect to properly licensed software, but still, we have an attitude of "I pay for the software so I am fine with it."
Just to be on the safe side, I would recommend you follow them.
Nobody is actually reading the content of an EULA.
US legal system has some resemblence to UK legal system, but EU legal system is in fact a mix of few totally different ideas how law should look like, and is quite different from US.
For some parts of the world, piracy is as high as 90% or above.
