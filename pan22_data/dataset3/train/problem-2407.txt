If you delete all admin user accounts, you will be stuck.
Here's a naming convention I like for two accounts: usernameAdmin for admin privileges, username for limited account.
I second the above: you must have one user account with admin privileges/in the admin group.
Once the install is done, setup your "limited accounts."
Should I create an admin account and then delete it after the install, or is there someway I can create limited user during the install?
During the Windows 7 install what is the best way to go about setting up a computer for use with limited user accounts?
I'm not sure if you will be able to delete your admin account, as you will need admin rights to do so.
Essentially, when it prompts me to create a user (see below) what should I do in order to set Windows up for limited user accounts?
There is also the system Administrator account but it is not active by default (usually.)
What ever you type on that screen will be a user with Admin rights (assuming this is a home PC with no group policy or anything else in the mix.)
