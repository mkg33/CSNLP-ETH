You could use a ServerAlias in your existing VirtualHost blocks, or, you could do this to do a 301 Redirect for SEO.
after messing around a while I decided to ask here:
Then when someone tries to go to 'domain1.de' it will hit the first virtualhost, which will redirect them automatically to 'www.
Has any one any idee why the second domain only works with the added "www"?
www.domain.com and domain.com can theoretically be entirely different websites.
This way, if you go to 'domain1.de' it will see that it doesn't start with 'www' and redirect to 'www.domain1.de'.
If you want to apply this to every site you host, you can do like this:
If you go to 'domain.de' it will see that it doesn't start with 'www' and redirect to 'www.domain.de'.
For 'domain2.de', it will redirect to 'www.domain2.de'.
My apache configuration file looks something like this:
Every time you add a new site, you will automatically get this feature, which can be really handy if you're adding/maintaining a lot of websites.
I have a vhost and want to use 2 domains on this server.
You need to add ServerAlias domain2.de to www.domain2.de for the shorter version to work as well (you should add ServerAlias for www.domain1.de too).
redirect all domain.de to www.domain.de) you can use something like mod_rewrite:
Use ServerAlias to associate more than 1 domain to a virtual host
If you don't want www.domain1.de to be served as default add another VirtualHost at the begining serving some simple HTML file.
On the configuration page for the domains of my vhost both domains assigned to the server ip.
domain1.de works because www.domain1.de is the first VirtualHost and is served as default.
