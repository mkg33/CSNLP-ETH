If yes, then can anyone have any idea, why my listener is not reponding, while it responds correctly on TCP connection from a browser?
It will certainly be helpful for you to include -XX in your tcpdump command line.
Your device (I assume it's the 192.168.1.2) sends packets of length larger than 0 and your server acknowledges the receipt via 0-byte ACK packets.
EDIT: What bothers me the most here, is that every connection from my localizer is marked by tcpdump with length 0 (while response back always has some length).
Since I have only SSH access to that server, I opened up two sessions and run tcpdump (with proper parameters) in one of them and my own listener (written in PHP) in second one.
When I connect with that IP and port from any of my browsers, I clearly see traffic captured by both tcpdump and my own listener.
But I noticed, that browser connections are also marked with length 0, so maybe this isn't a real problem.
I'm a newbie in networking and TCP, so maybe I mistakenly assumed, that this is TCP connection.
I have a device (GPS localizer) that is sending TCP (I think so) packets to my server on given IP address and through given port.
Can someone, with more experience confirm that, by looking at what tcpdump has captured:
However, when I force my localizer to send data to that IP/port, only tcpdump responds, showing, that he has captured something, while my own listener's output remains empty.
What should my listener listen to, to capture this kind of traffic?
