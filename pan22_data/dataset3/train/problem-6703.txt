When you add the parameter -RestrictToSingleComputer it's not required anymore.
However, there is such a dearth of information on this topic I thought it worth posting what I do know
I have been pointing DNSHostName to one of my DCs and it seems to be working so far.
You can check that both types closely match in they attribute sets.
I ran a test on a member server and was prompted for the -DNSHostName  I ran the same test from a DC and did not receive the prompt.

Therefore they inherit this property from them, and since it's required for the machine type, it's also required for gMSA.
My experience seems to indicate that it's looking for a DC.
Of course you should read about that option before using it.
I don't think it matters which DC you use, those gMSA's seem to replicate immediately anyway.
They are some subset, or maybe derivative of the machine type accounts.
The trainer of a 70-411 course I took used the FQDN of a domain controller as the value for the DNSHostName parameter when he demonstrated the New-ADServiceAccount cmdlet.
Also in all of the TechNet documentation they just give a simple unique value for this attribute, gmsa-name.contoso.com, just like a machine account is having it.
I'd really rather there were some concrete documentation on this.
The DNSHostName is the fully qualified domain name of your Service Account Name.
After working for a while with these accounts, I think I found out the reason:
Not sure why they just didn't autogenerate it, and spare us the wondering and the typing.
The applicable TechNet command reference is just tautological nonsense for the DNSHostName parameter.
As I understand it, DNSHostName just tells the cmdlet which domain controller on which to create the account.
