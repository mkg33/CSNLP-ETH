Perhaps the most straightforward approach would be to install DebugDiag 1.2, and enable the LeakTrack functionality.

This feature should be used when a process on the system continues to grow in memory until the system becomes unstable, or the process stops functioning correctly.
Allocations generally fall into 3 groups:  caching, short term allocations that will be freed later, and memory leaks.
Is there a tool which I can use to track only that particular process?
A dump is then generated, and the dump is analyzed to determine what allocations are not being freed and most likely causing the memory leak.
All three allocation methods have very distinct allocation patterns when measured over time.
You may use the Rules tab to create a trigger to collect the information:
"The memory leak monitoring feature is designed to track memory allocations for a process.
I'm trying to trace a memory leakage on my Windows Server 2008.
The debug tool will inject a DLL into the specified process and monitor memory allocations over time.
After launching DebugDiag, select the Processes tab, right-click the desired w3wp.exe process, and select "Monitor for leaks".
There are different schedule tasks run by the web app which I suspect the leakage is happening so I want to know at which particular time of the day when the mem usage hikes.
After the user dump files have been generated, you can then use the Advanced Analysis tab, and run the Memory Pressure Analyzer, which will inspect the dump files and generate a report.
The leak tracking feature calculates a leak probability using a formula that is based on these allocation patterns as measured over a specific time period. "
