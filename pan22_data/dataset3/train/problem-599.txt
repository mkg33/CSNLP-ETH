For backbone routers, the only way reverse path filtering could be implemented is to allow incoming packets when the peer announces a working route (regardless of whether it would be our preference).
That would be a prohibitively long lookup, easily circumvented and breaks the use case where I deliberately buy transit but do not announce my prefix down that link.
There is no easy formula for that, because for every rule that works for almost all cases, there is also a use case that makes business sense that would break then.
It gets more complicated as soon as I start using multiple edge routers for redundancy.
Source address filtering is nontrivial in the real world, because Internet routing is asymmetric, so in principle we need an educated guess whether a packet from this source is likely to appear on this incoming interface.
Reverse path filtering works great on edge routers, where there is a clear definition of "inside" and "outside" -- you do not allow outsiders to use "inside" addresses and vice versa.
