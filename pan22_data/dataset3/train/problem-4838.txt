For Googlers looking to specifically run a LaunchAgent with root privileges intead of a LaunchDaemon, it can be done by:
You can not use setuid to change the user running the script on daemons.
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.samplelaunchdscript.plist)
Launch Agents (/Library/LaunchAgents/ or ~/Library/LaunchAgents/) are run when a user is logged in as that user.
I have the following launchctl command as a .plist file.
Because you will want to add it in /Library/LaunchDaemons you will want to make sure you load it into launchd with administrator privileges (eg.
launchd runs Daemons (/Library/LaunchDaemons or /System/Library/LaunchDaemons) as root, and will run them regardless of whether users are logged in or not.
It's loaded and set to run once a day but, it needs to run as root and I'm not sure how to verify this.
I'm sure launchd has a better way of specifying the directory where it's supposed to run the command.
Also, this cron job basically CDs into a directory and runs a command.
How do I know it's run as root and is there a better way to write this?
