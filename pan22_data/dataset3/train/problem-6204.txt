File owners normally have some implicit additional rights, maybe the file owner can change the ACL?
If there is no user, then you might have success setting back the computer to a restore point or connecting the hard drive to another computer and change the access rights there.
You dismissed that warning, now you got a problem.
When you changed the file access rights in Explorer, Explorer gave you a warning stating exactly that.
If there is an account that is not in the Administrators group and is allowed to change file access on that file, then that user can remove the deny ACE.
So if you added deny Access for Administrators and you are a member of the Administrators Group, then that deny entry overrides the allow entry for your user.
In an ACL (Access control list) you can give allow ACEs (Access control entry) and deny ACEs.
Open folder properties->security->advanced->owner->edit
select a owner(your username or adminstrator group),check "replace owner on sub container and objects" and click apply...
