If it is not valid (404, 500, or 502 error.. maybe others) then drop to a catch-all page.
debug may or may not be a valid hostname in the example.com domain.
Requests for http example.com/test1 are fed to test1.example.com/test1.
I would rather the solution be contained within nginx config and not rely on maintaining a database of current example.com hostnames if at all possible.
Requests for http example.com/test2 are fed to test2.example.com/test2.
Data in uri path after first slash and before the second (if it exists) is what I need to key on.
This is my first attempt but doesn't work (too many redirects error and images/includes looked for in local file system instead of remote though the basic index.html is found/loaded).
Does anyone know what I may be missing or know of alternatives that will help me reach my goal?
I have a domain, call it example.com, with paths /test1 and /test2.
This nginx config has worked fine for my requirements to this point.
I now need to alter the config if possible so that requests make it to the appropriate backend without being individually added to the nginx config.
If it is valid then direct the request to debug.example.com/debug/index.html.
Using sub domains instead of path is a long term option but not feasible at this time due to other constraints.
