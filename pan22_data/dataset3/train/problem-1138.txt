Stable not leaking application will not go out of that boundaries.
Not to forget mail sending, I'm doing JVM monitoring by Zabbix in conjunction with SNMP on cluster running nationwide backend cluster of Post Office.
Zabbix support SNMP agent monitoring and SNMP traps too.
If you are in cloud with your Windows machine, you can use one of SaaS monitoring services.
In fact it is "enterprise solution of monitoring" by tools like HP OpenView.
When SNMP enabled, you can check returned gauges by running:
To get readable anwers not just SNMP OIDs, download JVM-MANAGEMENT-MIB.mib.
ACL file template is at JRE_HOME/lib/management/snmp.acl.template.
Since version 2.0 there is JMX monitoring possible, but for secure environments it could be complicated, cause JMX-RMI setup some ports random.
Zabbix can send you email or Jabber IM message in case of some trigger fired.
Back to monitoring, it is possible to turn on JVM internal SNMP agent and then monitor memory usage of heaps and PermGen and through private SNMP community you can setup thresholds when exceeded JVM will send SNMP traps.
I ran month test of services in cloud, when monitored JVM was somewhere in USA and Zabbix server in Ireland... it worked well even for such distances/delays.
It is easy to setup and really helpful for development/test phases, cause can do things like thread dumps, slow SQL queries a.s.o.
In general SNMP is enough for JVM run time monitoring and JMX can more help on development/test machines cause it can monitor application nuances.
In fact JVM memory boundaries are controlled by startup parameters like -Xmx2048m -Xms256m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m (it's example).
It expect you already put JVM-MANAGEMENT-MIB.mib to default Net-SNMP MIB directory (Unix or CygWin commandline).
