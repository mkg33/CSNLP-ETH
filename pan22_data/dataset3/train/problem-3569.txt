I would prefer bare-metal hypervisors to keep the overhead as low as possible.
If you can put up with installing and maintaining your own OS on the bare metal, you might also look into VMware Server, which is also Free-as-in-Beer and would probably be more compatible with your ESXi infrastructure.
I have a Dell Dimension 4700 helping hold the floor down in the corner of my office and thought it would be useful to install a hypervisor and then use the box for something.
Sure it will not be supported, but there are lots of platform where ESXi isn't supported but runs very nicely.
Seems to be used quite heavily in the ISP and hosting market, appears to have proved it's worth.
On Dell's product page, I can see it has mainly Intel on-board stuff: chipset, SATA controller and network adapter; all of them work perfectly in ESXi, so you shoudln't have any problem installing and running it.
I have always been a huge fan of VMWare products, and most recently ESXi however, the hardware support is a bit of a pain.
It will run Linux VMs without hardware assist (e.g., Intel's VT) but in order to do Windows (or any other VM-unaware OSes), you'll need it, so YMMV.
It is a bare-metal hypervisor and is free (as in beer).
