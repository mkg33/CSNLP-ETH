A host knows if the destination address is on a different network (the same way that you do, by masking the host and destination addresses with the host mask).
IPv6 won't help you - it will suffer from the same conditions that stopped IPv4 working, unless the network matches one of the changes above.
For a host on one network to reach a host on a different network requires a router to route the packets between networks.
If it does not, it drops the packet, otherwise, it forwards the packet out the interface toward the destination.
A router will look at the destination layer-3 address, and it will look in its routing table to see if it has a path to the destination network.
IP (or more precisely, ICMP, the protocol used by ping) and Ethernet are two completely different protocols on completely different layers of the networking stack.
They can talk to each via Ethernet (because they are in the same broadcast domain), for example using the ARP protocol, but they can not talk to each other via IP (because they are in separate subnets), for example using the ICMP protocol.
If the destination is on the same network, then it will send the layer-3 packet in a layer-2 frame directly to the destination, otherwise it will send the layer-3 packet in a layer-2 frame directly to its router.
