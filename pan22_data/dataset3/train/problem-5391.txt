For a simple task like setting a single cap on traffic, I'd just write a tc script using the LARTC howto though.
If you set the throttle at 14Mb/s, you shouldn't have any problems.
Many routers have the ability to throttle bandwidth to within a Mb/s or so (lots are within a few kb/s, but I like to be cautious) of accuracy.
The actual configuration of your router depends a great deal on what router you're using.
If you're using linux, check out the Linux Advanced Routing and Traffic Control HOWTO for an introduction on how to use tc and other tools to perform traffic shaping and qos on your link.
I've not used either of those, and wondershaper appears to be very poorly maintained, but you might get some use out of them.
As for keeping the pipe filled...well...that part is up to you!
And finally, if you want to monitor your link usage to keep a visual and historical record of your utilisation (and your 95th percentile mark), use a tool like cacti or munin to visualise it.
There are management systems for tc which abstract away some of the pain, such as MasterShaper and WonderShaper.
Or you can use a bundled firewall/management system like pfsense, m0n0wall, etc.
