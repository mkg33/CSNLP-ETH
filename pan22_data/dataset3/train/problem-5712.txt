This server is Server2012 Datacenter and is fully patched.
I am fully patched but thought I would try to install the "equivalent" of the patch listed for 2012R2 (which is KB4075212).
I found out what version I have with regedit and I am on 4.7.1.
Next, I tried to uninstall .net 4.7, however, they aren’t "programs".
I seem to have run into this bug while attempting to create a DFS replication group: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4049095/value-does-not-fall-within-the-expected-range-error-when-you-change
I assume these are deployed through windows update but none of the KBxxxxxxx show up in the "installed updates" tab of Windows Update: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed
(like I said, I believe the fix they are referring to is installed so I think their fix doesn’t work).
So, I tried installing KB4075213, however, I receive a "the update is not applicable to your computer"
So on to the workarounds, I tried to use the DFS commands to create a replication group, however, none of the commands are recognized.
Can .net 4.7.2 and 4.7.1 be removed from command line/Powershell?
I double checked, and yes, the DFS management tools are installed.
As it’s a production file server, it will be hard for me to schedule reboots during the week, so keep that in mind
Or has anyone been able to get it to work with the "fix" installed?
