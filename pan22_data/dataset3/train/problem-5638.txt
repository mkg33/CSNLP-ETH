It actually changes title, if you haven't been there in a while it will say something like Perform Security Checkup or just simply We keep your account protected
Scroll down to Chrome sync and then click on Stop sync and delete data from Google.
Very easy, you must go to Security settings, then you just change your password and this will log all computers out of anything to do with your Google chrome account and it also stops that computer logging back in if the password was saved on that computer, until you get back to that computer station again.
After access is revoked, you can turn off 2 step verification.
Beside to it you can find "Stop sync and delete data from google"
Do notice that going to your devices from left hand menu does not offer this option!
Under Sign in and security, scroll down and select "2 step verification"
The best way to log out of all devices without having to change your password is to temporarily turn on 2-step verification.
* please notice that google changes things often, this works as of July 2019, but there is no guarantee it will work at later date
This will give you the ability to "revoke access" from all devices.
Just found a way*, since I have to RMA a laptop but can't boot to clean HDD.
By doing this you can log out of the Google Chrome.
From this menu if you expand devices you will have for each a small vertical three dots menu with option to logout that particular device.
But this will affect the Sync between your setting.
Note, that this would log you out of all your Chrome browsers in all PCs, and you may loose your syncing data.
From there, on this main dashboard, there are few big cards, in my case there are 4, one of them says something along the lines of Security Checkup
Basically make sure to click that big card, not in the left hand menu, you will be greeted with following menu
At the last step you will have the option to "revoke access" from all devices.
