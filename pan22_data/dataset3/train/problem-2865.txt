I can access and control it fine with the Server Manager.
When I click 'Ok' however, I get an error saying 'This computer is not configured to allow delegation of user credentials'.
Is the Hyper-V server along with Management host joined to the domain?
I have followed various instructions about WinRM and CredSSP however I still have the following issue.
Where steps with enabling and configuring WinRM described.
I put in the ip address and set the username and password for the hyper-v server.
I launch the hyper-v manager and click 'Connect to server'.
If I click no I get another error saying 'Could not connect to the Virtual Machine Management' and 'A computer policy does not allow the delegations of the user credentials to the target computer'.
If I click 'Yes' to suposedly allow it to delegate the credentials, the message pops up again.
Im trying to setup a Windows Server Hyper-V 2012 r2 server which I've installed, but am having issues connecting to it throught the Hyper-V manager on Windows 10.
2) configure local group policies as described in link above
