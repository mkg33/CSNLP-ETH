How to restrict the use of certain cryptographic algorithms and protocols in Schannel.dll ==>
Are there any steps which I am missing or is there something else that needs to be checked before disabling TLS.
.NET Framework Version --> 3.5 and 4.5 are installed
We have ADFS and WAP environment for publishing internal Urls on which we want to disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 as the browsers will stop accepting TLS1.0 from next year July.
This is at a lower layer than ADFS so nothing to do ADFS wise.
Managing SSL/TLS Protocols and Cipher Suites for AD FS ==>
As per my understanding and reading the articles/blogs from microsoft/other sites, we need to add registry entries to disable tls 1.0 and 1.1.
It allows you to change many protocols and ciphers easily with just a few clicks, including TLS.
Let me know if any additional details are required.
WAP version --> WAP is a role service of the Remote Access server role in Windows Server 2012 R2
The easiest way to do so is to use the free IISCrypto tool.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/manage-ssl-protocols-in-ad-fs
Just remember to restart after you use it so that the registry changes take effect.
Just FYI: I find https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ useful which shows the current settings.
ADFS Version --> 3.0 (version 6.3 since its an OS component)

Note: I have a very limited knowledge of Windows and am not a Windows Admin.
Also download "IIS Crypto" and have a look at that.
