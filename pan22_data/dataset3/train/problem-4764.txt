Presumably we could then fire up a local version of MediaWiki to read the contents.
It'd be nice to have all changes to the MediaWiki automatically submitted to our Mercurial source-code repository, so it too would be automatically replicated to all the developer's machines.
If our Virtual Private Server goes off-line, I need to be able to replace it within a few days.
I need a way to back up the instructions in the MediaWiki in a way that I can read them when the server is down.
I haven't been able to find such a solution done before.
We've dutifully recorded all of the steps required to rebuild the server to the same configuration in a MediaWiki that is stored on... oh dear... the Virtual Private Server.
(Writing might cause conflicts, but we could live without that.)
Is my Google Fu failing me, or is there a good reason why this is a bad approach?
The Python code is safely in Mercurial, effectively backed up in several locations.
That's no problem because the data and logs are disposable.
