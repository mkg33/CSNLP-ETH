How can I mount a hard drive as read-only on Windows XP?
I use this trick to provide an absolute guarantee that my file backup program won't inadvertently stomp on the data that its meant to be backing up.
I've got this bookmarked from a while back, but I've never tried it:
I wanted to be sure that the transplanted drive would not be altered by the recipient computer, so I searched like hell but was unable to find a way to mount the transplanted drive as read-only.
Now, do all of your access through the UNC file share, e.g.
There's a linux live distro called PING that you can use to boot a machine, and it gives you the facility to copy partitions between hard drives (and it's free & pretty easy to use)
Under the (unfortunate) circumstances, both the donor and the recipient were Windows XP SP3 machines.
The 4th post (by Edwin) has the solution I am talking about.
As Evan says there's no easy way of doing this other than to clone the drive.
You can use WriteProt, a little command line tool that enables you to write protect a filesystem on Windows.
There is a way to access the drive in a mode that is effectively read only.
I recently had reason to move a hard drive from a computer that blew up to another computer for the purpose of recovering data.
