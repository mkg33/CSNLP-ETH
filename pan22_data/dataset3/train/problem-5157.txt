I'm trying to create a loading screen to pop up between levels in Unreal Engine 4.
I've also found some "hacks" that are pretty much display an icon on the main menu while waiting for the "Open Level" blueprint function ends up loading the level, yet I'm skeptical if this technique will work when the level to load is quite big and complex.
However, the only information I have found on the internet is related to level streaming which is definitely not what I want.
I want to have a traditional loading screen such as the loading screen in Skyrim, where the player presses play and text alongside a small model pops up until the game is finished loading.
The game I'm working on has very big levels with different gamemodes in each of them, which level streaming can't handle.
You can use a MoviePlayer, despite the name it can also draw widgets, UMG/Slate widgets.
It requires some little C++ knowledge to achieve it.
Also I've found some obsolete plugins to do this which no longer works on the latest UE versions.
