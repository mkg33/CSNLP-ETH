In the past however, this lead to some unnecessary downtimes, because of reboots wich were caused by Windows-Updates.
I now want to reinstall the system to have a fully virtualized System where both Windows and Ubuntu are virualized.
If the host doesn't support software RAID, you can use software raid from the guest OS.
You have a couple of choices to do this: ZFS, LVM (or any device mapper based solution), md, btrfs.
(i don't think it does matter if the RAID runs within the Windows-VM or on the Host System?)
I tried XenServer and VMWares ESXi, but ESXi does not detect my NIC and XenServer is neither capable of RAID1 Setups nor HDD-Disk pathtrough.
Note: The Ubuntu-VM does need a Serial-Device from the USB-Hub.
Another solution would be to use Linux+KVM as host/hypervisor and create the software RAID from Linux.
However the Windows (used as Fileserver) should have a RAID1-Setup for the famalys data.
I got a little homeserver which runs a Windows as FileServer and hosts a Ubuntu-VM for little monitoring tasks and other stuff that are not available in Windows.
