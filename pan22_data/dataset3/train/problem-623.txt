Although this may sound strange, you actually don't have a problem with open ports (but with Apache config).
If you want to test this on your local network go download nmap If you want to see weather the port is accessible to the outside world go run a scan at
That "Forbidden" message comes from your Apache server; it means that your webserver is accessible from the Internet.
IIRC, Apache is initially set up to only allow requests from the local computer.
They have a Windows version: http://nmap.org/dist/nmap-5.21-setup.exe
If you are just spot checking your ports from the outside.
It will attempt to connect to your IP address, on the specific port, and let you know if it is open or closed to the outside world.
Sounds like the Windows 7 firewall is cutting you off.
See the access module documentation for more info.
Somewhere in your Apache config, there's probably a section like this (the actual directory may be different):
You need to configure Apache to allow serving to all hosts - otherwise they'll get the "Forbidden" page.
It's not enough if you see your port 80 open from localhost - maybe something standing in the way if you try it from elsewhere, that's why I recommend nmap
If you want to allow any computer to see your pages, you need to change the Deny from all to Allow from all.
