Normally, I would not care about this, however: I have been developing a server application with a client GUI.
I have a server running a largely default install of CentOS 6.4.
Today, I left them alone for under two hours and when I returned they had crashed.
I think this is more of a ServerFault question than a StackOverflow question because of the similar behavior I have seen in my ssh connections.
When I returned I clicked the "reconnect" button on the client without restarting either application and they are working correctly again with no issues - so it's not like one of the applications ran out of resources or equivalent.
It is behind a VPN and a firewall, neither of which are managed by me - they are managed by the hosting company.
When I leave an ssh client open for a long time without touching it (in cygwin from my desktop), eventually it freezes (Ctrl+C doesn't even work) and then after a much longer amount of time, it recovers but the ssh connection disconnects with a Connection Reset by Peer error.
The two applications do have a heartbeat between them.
What could be causing this network timeout, and what can I do about it?
