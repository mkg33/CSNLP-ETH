Then, you may construct a recursive function to extract connected items, given with a description:
which you could then store in an enum, a #define or what have you and use the simple
There may be many lists of such kind, from whose you can choose ones that have length of 4 or more.
If this is not a matrix of Off and On values then let me know and I will try and update my answer.
If you have a matrix of size 4x4 with items, you need to have additional matrix of the same size with boolean flags stating that given item with (x,y) coordinates was traversed or not.
Using a particular order of scanning elements from items matrix (eg.
You can use a slightly modified version of a depth first search algorithm to extract connected shapes of items with same color.
Since they are also integers you could use a switch statement if you wanted as well (assuming the patterns are exclusive of each other).
from left to right and from top to bottom) call this function on every non-traversed item and in return, you'll be given an list of items connected to the starting one.
If its all stuffed into a single int for example and represented with bits then you could just check masks like so
