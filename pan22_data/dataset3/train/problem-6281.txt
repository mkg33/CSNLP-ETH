I only use the EBS images from Alestic for servers now, because I like to be able to stop them (not terminate), when I'm not using them, and have them come back as working when I hit start again.
So, it sounds like you're doing most things by the book.
EBS is a persistent data-store, and not liable to go away when you turn the server off.
There's a nice review of EBS vs S3 backed instances here, that should help explain the difference, and pros/cons in terms of data persistence.
EBS instances create an EBS Volume in your account, and that becomes mounted as part of the server instance.
S3 images are downloaded every time the server is booted, and go away when you stop it.
By doing it this way, we were able to reboot and stop/start the instance as required, without losing any data.
It breaks down like this.. there are two types of AMI images, EBS and S3.
The "instances are not saved when shutdown" seems like a bit of a misnomer however.
(There's some performance increase to be had by having /var/log on a separate partition/drive).
In the past, I had an Extra Large instance, running in EBS for $work.
