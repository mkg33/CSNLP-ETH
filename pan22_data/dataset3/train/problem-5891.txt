If instead you are using a different OS to format the USB stick, the above-referenced Web page has instructions on how to do it without using Unetbootin, both in Windows and in Mac OS.
So, if you are using another Linux system to format your USB stick, I suggest you use the following command:
where this time you must use the number after sdX.
Also, notice that it is sdX, not sdX1 or whatever: it is the physical name, not the partition, that must be used.
Thus, when the machine code inside the MBR tries to locate the second-stage bootloader (GRUB) it will come up empty handed because the partition on which GRUB was located is no longer.
Have you activated booting from the USB stick, again in the BIOS?
If your OS automatically mounts it, then unmount it (without removing it, of course) by means of
A few checks: did you turn SecureBoot off, in the BIOS?
By deleting the Mint partition, you have basically deleted grub.
The failure of Unetbootin is, at least AFAIK, unrelated.
Alternatively, it is known that Unetbootin fails, occasionally.
You must determine the drive letter appropriate to it, generally you cando this with
The dd command will wipe the contents of sdX, so please make sure you are writing to the right device.
