Because you're storing the password--ew--use an unprivileged account rather than an admin and give that account a strong password, the least possible privileges for the task, etc.
I am with @Katherine about not storing the credentials in the script.
are you specifying the account used in the scheduled task?
If you specify them in the task, you can tell it to use a privileged account.
I would post this as a comment/reply but I don't have enough rep to do that.
After confirming that task scheduler was indeed using the account expected but still failing I have arrived at a solution using a pass through authentication approach.
When I was doing something similar, I was unable to get it to work without first mapping the drive.
When I've done scheduled tasks with robocopy, I put the entire robocopy command in a .bat file, and then use that for the scheduled task.
That way you aren't storing it in an easily access space and you can run with a different account for the script on login...
In other words, I'm NOT scheduling robocopy.exe and specifying runtime parameters - I'm just scheduling the .bat file.
Robocopy runs successfully when the task is run under this new user.
