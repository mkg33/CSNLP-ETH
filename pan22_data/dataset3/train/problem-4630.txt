In the SQL Server world (my alma mater, so to speak), we regularly apply service packs, and sometimes cumulative updates, but we only apply hotfixes when the issue that they are targeted towards affects us.
My question is, do most people go ahead and apply any update flagged as critical, or do they evaluate each update one-by-one to determine whether or not the issue that has been addressed is likely to affect them.
I then applied the "Critical Host Updates" baseline in VMWare update manager, and found that we're still short on 14 "critical updates".
immediately apply critical, roll up all others into monthly drops or suchlike), apply this rule to your 'test host', test and rollout the same rules into production after the test period (i.e.
We're lucky, we have 1:1 reference copies of our production platforms to test new code on - we apply new code, test it then if successful roll it into production.
What I suggest you do is to set aside a server for testing new code on, make it run non-essential VMs on, make up you own patch application rules (i.e.
a few days or a few weeks depending on your testing).
I just brought our ESX hosts up to 3.5 Update 5 (Yes, I know we're behind still).
Wondering what more experienced ESX admins typically do...
