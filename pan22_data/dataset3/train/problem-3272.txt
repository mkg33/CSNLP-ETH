I was looking for many solutions for this when using Docker machine (both locale and on machines set up by system administrator).
The solution is exporting LANG variable with C.UTF-8 locale like so:
The quick fix is to replace "sufficient" with "optional" next to pam_lsass module so it looks like:
You almost certainly have set the wrong character set in your PuTTY settings.
So check your PuTTY settings under Translation and ensure that you have UTF-8 set as the character set.
What worked for me was to set the 'Connection > Data > 'Terminal-type string' to 'putty' instead of 'xterm' - apparently Putty ignores the character sequence to switch into drawing mode: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/utf8-plus-vt100.html
Another reason somehow related to pam that may affect hosts with powerbroker/pbis/likewise authentication.
Also, if UTF-8 is not properly configured, you may run it as mc -ac.
Verify the character set on the remote system by running the command:
/etc/pam.d/common-session (or other file with similar entry - there might be few of them) is probably included by /etc/pam.d/sshd before pam_env is loaded so if the processing of pam modules is finished before it comes to pam_env, the /etc/default/locale is not loaded in the user environment and you have garbled characters.
was solving the problem (but not completely) and I was looking for complete solution.
In my case (Ubuntu 14.04) the issue was caused by missing
You may need to tweak the line drawing setting as well, but it is probably not likely.
In my Putty everything was fine (I had UTF-8), I was using also other SSH client and had exact same problem.
I had an issue with Debian's aptitude program even though I had UTF-8 as my characters set.
You can obviously add it into .bashrc to have it automatically set in your profile.

entry in /etc/ssh/sshd_config as /etc/pam.d/sshd pam configuration is responsible by default for loading /etc/default/locale into users environment.
After reading many suggestions, I finally found the one that solved my issue.
