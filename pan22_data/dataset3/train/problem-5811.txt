Ctrl + Alt + Break = Break out of remote desktop full screen
Well, I got an answer by trying out everything specified here.. To go to RDP from host machine ALT + TAB works and from RDP to host machine WINDOWS KEY + PGDN (page down) works...
If your keyboard doesn't have the Break key, you can use:
Once you break out of the Remote Desktop full-screen, you can use
If you want to retain control over your capslock key, replace "Capslock" by "^Capslock" in the second line.
This can be done with one keypress by using autohotkey.
This is a big productivity boost because you never take your hand off the keyboard to you mouse.
If you get really good, you'll never have to use the mouse again :)
On my system (using windows server 2012 R2), I use ctrl+alt+home to get to the remote desktop bar and then alt+tab to move around the windows on local machine.
Alt-Insert works in windowed mode, and is almost the same as Alt-Tab.
To get this to work, download autohotkey, save this script as a .ahk file and execute it on the home computer.
The script above will alt-tab to the host computer whenever you press caps lock.
FYI, the reason caps lock is used is because RDP really messes with autohotkey scripts and capslock is one of the few keystrokes that get sent to the home computer rather than the guest computer.
