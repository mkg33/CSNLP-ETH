Copy that down the column for all of the source data rows and as many others as you want to pre-populate.
The remaining column is Amount, which uses two VLOOKUPs for the numerator and denominator of your division.
Now you can copy the all of those cells down as you did for column I.
The Name and ID columns are similar, just VLOOKUPs in a different column, so the formulas in M2 and N2 are:
Here is a solution that uses just basic Excel functions.
This column calculates the relative row each new name will start in for the new table.
Your output table starts in column I with row 2 being the first data.
This and all of the other entries in the table will remain blank until needed.
Since your example has five rows of data, I'll base the solution formulas on that.
Say the source table pictured in your link starts in column A and the first row of data is row 2.
If the date column appears as a number, just change the cell format to the desired date format.
You can just copy the J2 formula and edit the VLOOKUP column (last parameter).
You can copy this down the column an arbitrarily large range to pre-populate the cells you might eventually use.
That will give you the output shown in your example.
In the output table, the Records column will always be 1, so cell K2 is:
