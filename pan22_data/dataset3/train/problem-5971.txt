At the very least you need the ssh software on that work machine, and in all likelihood you can get someone to install it for you since its necessary to access a great many third parties.
I think opening a logmein account, and installing the free version of the client on both your home and work computers would be the easiest.
Another option would be Windows Live Mesh - it has Remote Desktop built in.
You can forward RDP port using SSH: download Putty SSH client, connect it to a remote server, and setup a static tunnel :)
You need to set up a reverse tunnel with port forwarding out to your machine at home from work and then traverse it backwards to get into the machine via rdp.
The only thing you'll need is a *nix server to which you can connect with ssh.
This is also assuming you have admin rights on your work machine to be able to install software.
If not you may be out of luck unless you get particularly nefarious.
This can be done either from the server or from another host in the same network.
Look into plink/putty ssh and google for ssh reverse tunnel, which should put you in the right direction.
Edit: nevermind, didn't see that you couldn't install apps on your work machine.
