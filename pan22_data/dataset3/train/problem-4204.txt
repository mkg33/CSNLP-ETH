Using a common standard will go a long way to help the readability of your code.
This will help fleshed out individual part of the code and make it easier to read the code.
Apache have HttpStatus with SC_NOT_FOUND representing 404
You should use try-with-resources when you have the opportunity if you HTTP library implements AutoCloseable for their connections.
404 is a known return code for HTTP and normally every good library will provide you with a classes that will have the constant for return code.
Don't hesitate to refine your code into smaller methods.
This would have been a perfect candidate to be a method createJsonObject which return the created object.
You could have use a loop here too since you're repeating the same line 5 times (maybe more or less later if your format change)
I think that HttpGet do implement the interface so it would be easier to not let connections leaked.
Your code is in a weird format, I don't know if you had a hard time with the format in the question or if your code is like this, but note that you're not following a standard that I know.
