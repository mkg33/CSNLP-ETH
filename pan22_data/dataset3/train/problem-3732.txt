And keep in mind that very little of what is "used" is permanently allocated to its present use; in particular, long-idle processes can have their memory repurposed for other needs.
In short there is nothing unusual showing in what you've posted or described.
Crashing in graphics-intensive programs like games is usually caused by problems in your power supply, video card, cooling, etc.
Windows can handle running out of memory gracefully.
1 GB "used" after bootup is not at all unusual on a 4 GB machine.
I don't see how you can write "The total of the normal processes was barely equal to one or two Megabytes" when the very first process you list is using over 120 MB (120,000 x 1024).
Driver problems can do it too, of course, but even video card drivers are a lot more stable than they used to be.
Also, the "Memory (Private working set)" column is only part of the total memory used by Windows + the processes.
You have a different problem, probably driver- or hardware-related, that causes Windows to crash with bluescreen.
4 GB is a lot of RAM and using 1 GB after reboot is pretty normal.
Use programs like BlueScreenView to analyze crash dump files, it will help you guess probable cause of this issue.
