Something similar to that, set it up to run everyday in crontab.
I'd certainly recommend full backups over incremental backups - it just saves so much pain!
When size of differential backup grows to fill a full tape take another full backup and start the cycle over.
What would be the best solution to backup this server with the least effort ?
I have a server with 8TB data, and a tape with high numbered 400GB tape cartridges.
Will make a weekly full backup and daily incrementals.
Have look in this link has every small details for tap backup
I think after one full backup, I can make many increments on one 400GB tape.
In your case it will be one full backup about once a year.
But how can I make the full backup across the tapes (with manual tape change), and how can I restore one file from the full backup and the increments ?
Is there any easy way to do that like disk based tar backup ?
I would suggest to do full initial backup that spans multiple tapes and then do differential backups over 5-7 tapes on daily basis.

While you can do it with tar (at least the you can with the Gnu version of tar), I'd recommend using something a bit more robust - I like afio (unlike tar where you put files in an archive then compress the archive, afio compresses the file first then adds it the archive - a much more robust solution - and it will use any program you have available for compression!).
