I can add mskinner to the local Remote Desktop Users group, however once I click Apply(or I click OK then come back in to the list) the list is empty again.
I am on the step Step 2 sub-section: "To add Morgan Skinner to the Remote Desktop Users group".
After the clone I turned one in to the domain controller (CONTOSO-DC) and one in to a domain member (RDSH-SRV).
Could the fact that they are based on the same base snapshot image cause this, or am I making some other kind of mistake?
RDSH-SRV's window remotely viewed through CONTOSO-DC
They are running inside VMWare Workstaion 8 on a lan segment (with each getting a new MAC address).
Interestingly if I go to the domain controller, and manage RDSH-SRV remotely from there I do see the listing (SID only, no username)
I am following Microsoft's "Installing Remote Desktop Session Host Step-by-Step Guide".
After restarting RDSH-SRV still has a empty Remote Desktop Users group.
Both machines are clones of a base Win2k8R2 (180 day eval version) VMware Image Snapshot.
