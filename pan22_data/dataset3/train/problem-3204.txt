So all you need to modify is w/2 in this expression.
The position must be given as the coordinates of the top left corner of the image.
This filter graph moves second picture from left to right until it reaches half of the screen (w/2).
Here is an example with the image stopping at the center:
I need it to stop at certain point, like a left to right transition.
The image will slide from right to left without stopping:
Therefore, at frame 0, the image will initially be placed at 1920 - 0 = 1920 pixels from the left, so the image will slide in from the right as n increases.
I have used the below command to make a left to right transition of overlay image over a video.
The position of the overlay at any given time is specified as an option of the overlay filter.
The overlay image is moving from left to right continuously.
The X/Y coordinate pair in the first above example is W-n and (H-h)/2, where:
Here is an example with an image saved as image.png (size: 1920â¨‰1080, duration of the clip: 15 seconds):
