as an administrator of lots of dell hardware, i know how annoying the dell openmanage tools are...
(have not verified if this is the correct version, should be the same for all adaptors tho': http://www.lsi.com/storage_home/products_home/internal_raid/megaraid_sas/megaraid_sas_8480e/#Miscellaneous )
(fail randomly sometimes, are extremly bloated, ...)
Or any tool which monitors the hdd disks failure in RAID or power supply failure on Dell PE servers.
If that's the case, please check the Dell OpenManage Wiki at:
Be careful if you use OMSA with an non-Dell external enclosure; OMSA will indeed report and display the status of the physical drives but in my experience it will not alert on hardware issues with the enclosure itself... it only seems to do that for Dell-branded JBOD's.

(which is still closed source, but at least less annoying, or annoying in different ways ;) )
luckily, for example, dell's "PERC" raid controllers used in poweredge servers are just rebranded lsi megaraid adapters, and you can use lsi's megacli in place of openmanage:
Is there any open source Dell H/w base RAID monitoring tool?
