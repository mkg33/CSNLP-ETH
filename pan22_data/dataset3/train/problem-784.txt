I know other devices have this feature, that's just the one I use and know, and tends to be a pretty good bargain.
It's hard to say just from looking at the specs of that router, and the little bit of Googling doesn't reveal much.
I use it as a repeater with my main router to provide stronger signal on another level of our house and it also lets you plug wired devices in.
You didn't ask this, but as far as other devices that will allow you to do this, I personally own the Asus RT-N12/B which has an awesome switch on the back to let you change modes between router, repeater, and access point.
I would need to look in the firmware's web interface to be positive, but my guess is, no.
It sounds like you're looking for a "wireless client mode" feature that will let your router connect to the other wireless network as though it's just a plain wireless adapter.
A lot of routers don't include this feature in their stock firmware, which is a shame.
All you do to set it up is put in the SSID and PSK of the main wireless network.
It offers no client bridge mode, and it's incompatible with DD-WRT, so you're not going to get the feature by changing your firmware.
