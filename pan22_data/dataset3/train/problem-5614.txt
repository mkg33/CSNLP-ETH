I know that the output can't be negative and I never have negative output values in my training set, though I could have 0's in it (for example, I predict 'amount of cars on the road' - it can't be negative but can be 0).
But when I try to run my regression algorithm against new data I sometimes get a negative output.
I am trying to solve various regression tasks and I try various algorithms for them.
Obviously, I can't accept negative output since it is not a valid value.
For example, multivariate linear regression or an SVR.
Rather often I face a problem that I am able to train relatively good algorithm (maybe fit a good regression line to my data) and I have relatively small average squared error on training set.
In the case of linear regression, there is no restriction on your outputs.
Often this is fine when predictions need to be non-negative so long as they are far enough away from zero.
The Poisson distribution is parameterized by a single value $\lambda$, which describes both the expected value and the variance of the distribution.
The question is - what is the proper way of working with such output?
This is known as Poisson regression and is helpful for modeling discrete non-negative counts such as the problem you described.
This results in an approach similar to the one described by Emre in that you are attempting to fit a linear model to the log of your observations.
If your data is non-negative and discrete (as in the case with number of cars on the road), you could model using a generalized linear model (GLM) with a log link function.
However, since many of your training examples are zero-valued, this isn't the case.
The problem is your model choice, as you seem to recognize.
