I've tried setting the hostname but it does not work.
If you run Samba on the Linux box, you should be able to access the Linux box from the Windows boxes, by using the Linux box's hostname.
I'm going to assume you're using DHCP, and that the clients are sending their hostname to the DHCP server, which is updating a local DNS server (try nslookup ${somehostname} to verify the server address).
Even a Linux NAS box can also be accessible by machine name.
Caveat:  your router is probably functioning as a DNS server, so you'd need to make some client configuration changes if you set up a local DNS server in order to have them look at it first.
I have a LAN setup with a bunch of windows and linux boxes.
windows hosts are accessable by name because they can be found by their netbios name http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS
However, I recently built a CentOS linux box and I want it to be accessible by machine name.
If it's a static IP, see the hosts file, dnsmasq, BIND, or some Windows-based DNS server.
Maybe, the AT&T box also has some local DNS features?
(There is a lot more to it than that, but that's the simplest solution)
All the windows machines can identify themselves by machine name over the network.
CentOS5 does not, AFAIK, send the hostname over DHCP by default.
