Your router however should give you a full list of (directly) connected wifi and Ethernet devices (depends on your router where), although it is technically possible to fool this as well (use a hostname you personally think is OK, or even spoof the address of a system that should be on the network).
To get a glimpse of all the things nmap can do, issue the command:
This is the most effective and secure way to do that.
where you will have to substitute 192.168.1.137 wi the IP address of the pc you want to explore.
See how many things nmap is capable of unearth for you!
Going to Network (from the left navigation pane on any explorer window, or the start menu), should show devices (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/view-network-computers-devices#1TC=windows-7 ).
However I have found that to be fairly unreliable (devices can choose to not be "discoverable").
will list all pcs on the subnet 192.168.1.0/24 (adapt this to your needs).
You should download and install a program called nmap.
So from a security standpoint I still wouldn't trust it.
