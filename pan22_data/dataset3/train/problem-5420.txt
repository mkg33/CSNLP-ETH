If you like, you can then install the shim or PreBootloader program, adjust the boot path, and re-enable Secure Boot.
See my page on the topic for details, which are far too extensive to include here.
You can then install any Linux distribution that supports EFI (assuming no hardware incompatibilities, serious bugs, etc.).
It's possible to disable Secure Boot on computers that bear a Windows 8 logo, although the details of how to do this are not standardized.
Now does it install normally or does it not support UEFI & SECURE BOOT fully yet?
I'm not aware of multiboot support for RHEL UEFI installation.
This does not represent the official stance of Red Hat.
Once you know what you're doing, this isn't very hard; but the learning curve is significant.
AFAIK RHEL 6 has basic support for UEFI (grub-efi, efibootmgr) with no support for Secure Boot.
This means you have to turn off Secure Boot on Windows 8 logo machines if you want to install CentOS 6.
Does Minimal Edition of CentOS 6.4 support UEFI & SECURE BOOT fully?
