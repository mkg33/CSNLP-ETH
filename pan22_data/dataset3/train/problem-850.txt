Even though in 64-bit versions there is no longer an ntvdm emulating DOS, cmd.exe hasn't really been updated to match.
Many DOS programs (like EDIT.COM) supported the mouse in text mode.
It's also why the "Mark" option lets you draw a box to capture text rather than operating on full lines like a terminal.
You have to consider how things were when Windows 95 was new.
Back then, you could run full-screen DOS apps in a Windows 95 command window - it wasn't NT's cmd.exe but command.com.
But if you want to do something to the actual text in the window, then you need to call up the context menu.
So mouse movements and click in the window need to be passed to the underlying DOS (or ntvdm under NT versions of Windows).
Now, on cmd.exe, you can right click the window to get to "Edit..."  It's been forever since I've used a 9x version of Windows but I do believe the way you were supposed to get to that "Edit..." menu was by right clicking the title bar and right clicking the screen didn't work.
