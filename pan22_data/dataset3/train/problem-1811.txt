I have an application where 30GB of data was roughly 16 million files.
If you're comfortable with VBScript it's not hard to write a script that searches for files.
Perhaps something like Google Desktop or similar might just have enough data.
It is however pretty customisable, might be worth a look.
This approach can be time consuming compared to using built in tools, but it allows great flexibility because you can tweak the script to use whatever criteria you want.
If you just want to identify the files, look at using the built in indexing service.
File count is more important then file size in this case.
When we migrated it to a new NAS it took three machines 18 hours just to handle the metadata ops.
We moved the other 850GB of data a few months later and a single machine was able to copy between the NAS' at ~1GB/min as the average file size was roughly a hundred times larger.
FindOnClick, from 2BrightSparks, is generally quite good for what you're after, but unfortunately doesn't appear to list Creator.
