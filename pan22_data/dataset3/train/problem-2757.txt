So in dd command , is skipping 1 block ( skip=1) is enough?.
checking 'man dd' you will find, that you can use 'skip=BLOCKS' to skip some bytes at the beginning of the input:
why dont you copy the data from filesystem to filesystem?
If you haven't played around with it, the default is 1 block (512 bytes).
I need to copy a SATA partition to external usb partition , both partitions are same in size but total disk size are different , i want to copy only the data and not concerned about boot sector and so don't want copy the SATA partition info in to USB disk.
but in general i dont think thats a good idea, if you 'just want the data' ... because you copy only part of the filesystem etc.
And is it necessary to use dd anyway; to copy only the data, why not use the copy command 'cp', rsync, a flie browser or any other way of copying data rather than the raw disk data?
I may be being an idiot here, but can't one just use dd on the partition rather than the disk, so use if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1 rather than if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb skip a bit.
