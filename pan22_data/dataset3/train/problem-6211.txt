When I press Ctrl-Alt-Delete I can only open the Task Manager for the local PC.
Take a look at Remote Process Manager http://admintoyssuite.com/l/remote-task-manager--view-and-kill-processes-and-applications-on-network-desktop-computers/
If Jonas may have been meaning he had a windowed remote desktop session, and he wondered what keyboard shortcut would open Task Manager on that remote, there is a shortcut for that (not mentioned yet in other answers here):
Is there some simple way to open the Task Manager on the remote PC while running Remote Desktop from one Windows XP machine to another?
I have a blog post with still more such shortcuts for a "windowed" remote desktop: Helpful keyboard shortcuts for working with "windowed" Remote Desktop: switching windows, more
Those are not wrong answers, but if Jonas (or other readers finding this post) wondered if there was such a keyboard shortcut for a windowed RDP session, hope this helps.
Remote Process Manager connects on-the-fly and do not show any question boxes to remote users..
Since he mentioned using ctrlaltdel, it seems most focused on showing how to do THAT against in the remote (windowed or not), or how to open task manager other ways in the remote.
In the remote desktop connection options for Local Resources you have the option of where to apply Windows key combinations (On the local computer, On the remote computer, or only in full screen mode).
You can set the Windows key combinations to go to the remote computer and use Ctrl-Shift-Esc to launch the Task Manager.
If you just needed to enumerate processes on remote PC, you do not need to establish RDP session.
I found this way more flexible than to disturb currently logged on user with RDP connection prompt.
