Went in and found a bunch of profiles that were no longer used on the server and removed them under system properties - Advanced - User Profiles and now the recycle bin is empty.
I had a recycle bin that was showing over 4GB of data but I was unable to clear it.
What is the proper way to clear the recycle bin for all users in Windows Server 2008 R2?
I ran TreeSize Free and saw I had 15gigs in the Recycle Bin, but I couldn't see it, probably because it was done by a long departed user.
Obviously don't delete any accounts that are still current or in use but as an administrator, you can do it this way.
I liked this solution because is easy to understand what it is doing and it does the job, but in order to work from any location you run the command from, you need to run change it like this (adding a \ after the "drive_letter:") and to be able to delete those folder from other users.. you need to add the "-force" at the end of the remove-item command.
removing -WhatIf if you want to do more than only testing the command
But in TreeSize Pro I could delete it, which put the data into the Recycle Bin that I could see.
Get-ChildItem "C:`$Recycle.bin\" -Force | Remove-Item -Recurse -force -WhatIf
So this will be the final command i would use instead:
Additionally as you are deleting all folders within C:\$Recycle.bin\ you do not need to include "-recurse" when getting the child items.
