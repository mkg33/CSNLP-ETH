Is there a way I can toggle this option when the toggle switch is disabled in the settings GUI of Windows 10?
The responsible policy setting is "Prevent users from replacing the Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu they see when they right-click the lower-left corner or press the Windows logo key+X" in the Windows Components | Edge UI category under the Administrative Templates branch of user configuration.
(The policy's unique ID is Microsoft.Policies.EdgeUI:ShowCommandPromptOnWinX.)
This option will be grayed out if disabled by Group Policy.
If it's not enabled in Group Policy, it must be in the Registry, specifically in this key:
Set it to 0 or delete it to restore the switch in Settings.
Changes may require a logoff/logon cycle to take effect.
Setting that policy to Enabled creates the behavior you've encountered; setting it to Disabled or leaving it Not Configured yields the normal behavior.
Ironically, I want powershell to be default but contrary to the greyed out option in the image, the command prompt is currently the default option.
