I have a VGA/DVI adapter for one monitor but if I hook up one to the gfx card and one to the mobo direct the BIOS tells me on startup to connect both to the card.
when using a GPU-less MB with a GPU-less serverprocessor).
When you would hook one monitor to each connector there could many problems arise as there would be the need of a solution to use both GPUs for different monitors but then: On which should the general computing be done (and not only the output)?
This would be difficult to set up - probably similar to SLI or other dual-GPU setups but now even with different GPU vendors and models.
The VGA connector on your MB is actually for an integrated GPU either on your MB or on the CPU - if you have none you should not  even be able to use this one alone (eg.
Solution: Either buy a HDMI-to-VGA adapter or program a firmware or a driver for your setup ;-)
It may be possible to connect one to the MB and one to the GPU - but this could raise some issues.
How can I do this and is it not possible to connect one to each?
A reasonable desktop of mine has an external gfx card with 1 DVI and 1 HDMI port.
