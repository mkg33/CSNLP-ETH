I then removed the computer from the domain, renamed it, and then added it back to the same domain.
"When an object is assigned a GUID, it keeps that value for life."
I'm trying to uniquely identify objects in an Active Directory domain.
I tested this by adding a computer to an AD domain and recording the GUID.

I am curious if anyone else can verify this as well.
The reason that I'm asking is that I'm referencing some AD objects from an application and need to come back weeks or months later and still get the object, but the application is unable to have any way to get notified of changes.
I just wonder: Can this change for any reason, or can I assume this will never change?
When an object is assigned a GUID, it keeps that value for life.
The values of other object properties can change, but the Object-GUID never changes.
THe GUID shouldn't change if you leave the computer as a member of the domain and rename it, But as stated removing it from the domain and adding it back in a new object.
The sAMAccountName or mail address can sadly change, and so can the objectSid.
