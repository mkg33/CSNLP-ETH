That free space will be made available for subsequent insert operations on the table (assuming you're doing conventional-path inserts) as well as update operations that cause the size of rows to increase.
If you want to actually shrink the size of the table segment (generally not a good idea if you're just going to insert more data into this table in the future), depending on the Oracle version, the type of tablespace, and whether you've enabled row movement you can probably shrink the segment
Be aware, however, that this may be a very costly operation that may involve physically moving most or all of the rows in the table.
It also walks through using the Enterprise Manager GUI and the various advisors to reclaim space either manually or automatically.
There is a chapter in the Database Administrator's Guide on reclaiming wasted space that discusses this and related issues in much more depth.
Deleting data isn't expected to change the size of the table segment.
It will create free space in blocks that are part of the table segment and it will probably create at least a few empty blocks.
