Or, even better, you could add them to a third group that you create specifically for this purpose.
Assuming your use FTP to update your content, you can set all the files to be owned by ftp:apache.
You can add the ftp user to the apache group, and vice-versa.
Most of your content should be owned by a user other than apache.
Im having issues as to which user should own my www directory - ftp or apache?
When set to the ftp user, the user can add, remoe and easily modify files but php file system actions generate permission denied errors (ofcourse because they require the user to be apache).
You just need to make sure that files added in the future belong to the 'mygroup' group and have the appropriate permissions for both apache and ftp to read/write them.
For files and directories the application needs to write to add group write access.
I had a similar problem with a php page a built that would copy a folder on the server with a different name.
Files should have permissions 644 or 640 and directories permissions 755 or 750.
If however, the www directory is chown to apache, the ftpuser wont be able to perform some actions like file modification and deletion.
I would suggest using SCP for SFTP instead of ftp.
