Now we have third user  c@abc.com who will be always outstation and can use external server only.
You might be able to use "relay_mail_from" and access map entries, but since I haven't actually tried this, I'll let someone else answer with more useful details.
I want to send emails to his external account  from any internal user.
For the delivery part of email destined for one of these users you can use the "virtusertable" feature.
Then in the /etc/mail/virtusertable file use something like this to deliver email for a@abc.com locally, and email for b@abc.com or @c@abc.com* to the remote, hosted server:
Internal means we create user on local linux box where sendmail is set.
But he can not send mail to outside domain and no mail can be sent to him as there is no account created on external hosted server.
I don't want to create alias and send his mails to gmail or yahoo's account.
b@abc.com can send mails to internal as well as all other domains through sendmail's smart_host  feature, which uses hosted server's smtp.
To redirect the email of only some users to an external address, e.g.
for your sample users you could add this to your sendmail.mc file:
Rebuild the virtusertable.db map by running makemap(1), and Sendmail should be able to handle the delivery part of email ok:
a@abc.com can send mails to any internal user created on Linux box where sendmail is installed.
Its bit difficult to explain but very simple problem.
Controlling which local user is allowed to send email is slightly more involved.
External means we create user on local and hosted server.
b@abc.com can get all external emails internally through Fetchmail on linux box.
We have internal sendmail server and hosted server.
So I can not create account on local linux box  for c@abc.com  because his mail will get delivered locally only.
