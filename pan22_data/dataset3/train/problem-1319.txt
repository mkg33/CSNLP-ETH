Internet Explorer 6 would be supported by Microsoft until the end of support (End of extended support) for Windows XP on April 8, 2014.
Internet Explorer 7 would be supported by Microsoft until the end of support (End of extended support) of Windows Vista on April 11, 2017.
Basically, this means that the versions of Internet Explorer that shipped for a specific OS or service pack will be supported with the support lifecycle of the OS or service pack.
From this site: http://blogs.technet.com/b/stephanus/archive/2013/05/08/ie-internet-explorer-lifecycle-oder-bis-wann-wird-welcher-ie-supportet.aspx
Internet Explorer is considered as a component of the operating system (OS) for which it was released.
However, if Microsoft decides Internet Explorer 9 to be default browser in future release of Windows 7 then Internet explorer 8 might retire before expected date, 7 January 14, 2020.
Internet Explorer 8 would be supported by Microsoft until the end of support (End of extended support) for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020.
But I can never find a quick and straightforward answer to this question.

Support for older versions of IE will not end unless Microsoft ships a replacement version of IE in a future OS service pack.
Which leads me to http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?c2=14019 which suggests the answer is: 13-Jan-2015 for Mainstream Support and 13-Jan-2020 for Extended Support.
I've seen comments on the internets saying MS is ending support in Jan-2015, but this suggests that corporates may well be on IE8 for another 5 years, right?
The support timelines for IE are inherited from the OS and its associated service packs.
