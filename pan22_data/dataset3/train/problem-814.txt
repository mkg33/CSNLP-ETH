I use DVDStyler, a free program available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
Two frequently used (and not free, but regularly updated) apps for this purpose are Slysoft’s AnyDVD and DVDFab’s HD-Decryptor.
DVD Shrink can do this if you use the "Re-author" mode.
There’s some guides available on using DVD Shrink to accomplish all kinds of basic through advanced things; particularly check out the guides on re-authoring.
There are also many commercial packages available.
However, you should be aware that because it is fairly old and no longer update or supported, it will have trouble with some discs (eg ones with structural copy protection, multi-angle titles, “photo-slideshow” titles, etc.)
In general you will want to use Shrink for general purpose use, but sometimes you’ll also need to rip the disc to the hard-drive first, then open the ripped files in Shrink.
You need to use DVD authoring software, which will allow you to remove the menus, only burn the portions you want, and even burn multiple titles to the same disc if you have room.
You'll get a .ISO file that you can then burn to your 4 GB or 8 GB writable DVD.
As user55325 said, DVDShrink (in reauthor mode) is great; it’s my favorite and first choice.
It includes a customizable menu system which allows you to select which frame in the video to use for the preview image (the default it picks is usually pretty go though anyway), and it's really good at mixing various audio and video formats together.
As far as extraction is concerned, I'm not sure what to recommend (hopefully someone else can help you with that part of the answer), but there's an excellent free/open-source program called DVD Flick that I've used a few times to create a DVD that's playable in regular DVD players:
From there you can add the titles you want, as well as removing unnecessary audio tracks.
No need to rip it first - just go to "open disc", then click on "Re-author".
