Network Discovery and folder sharing are same as Windows Client OS.
That means, each system should add its own local user account(password).
So I dont want AD, but for some reason, nothing works smoothly between the Windows 10 machines and the 2016 servers.
Windows Server is supported to be configured in Workgroup, without Active Directory installed/configured.
You can create same user account name(password) on each OS, however, these accounts are different as they are locally and have their own user profiles.
I am in the process of creating a small test lab cluster, and having been here before, do not want to have to seek certification just get through the default ruleset of the Windows AD.
If OS is configured in Workgroup, then, only local user account/password can be added to the system.
For network discovery on server, please reference “You cannot turn on Network Discovery in Network and Sharing Center in Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows Server 2012” and check for necessary requirements:

From my point of view, if you configure Active Directory and use AD user accounts, it may meet the requirements you had mentioned for account and password.
I would like instead to create a simple HomeGroup, something that will allow PC discovery, responsive navigation to shares etc.
