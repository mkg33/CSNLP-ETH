I've used MemTest, which runs under Windows, but I've never quite had faith in it; partly for the reasons other people have mentioned, but also partly because I've never seen used in anger (i.e.
I'm recently getting blue screen of death on my Windows XP machine.
The program should run just like normal without requiring me to restart the machine.
Is there any program that I can use the test whether my RAM is good or not, on Windows XP?
I am looking at program that does not require me to boot from external device such as floppy disk or CD ROM.
When I return the RAM under an RMA, I'll get charged an admin fee if the RAM isn't found to be really faulty - so it's important to make sure I get my facts right - hence the more laborious route of multiple, overnight memtest86+ runs...
I suspect that the culprit is the RAM I've just installed.
Yes, it requires you to boot from external device (they have pre-built CDs) but I think that there is no other proper way to test RAM otherwise--Windows XP won't give full access to the RAM for the testing programme.
As it happens, the RAM appeared faulty, so each night, I ran another test with various combinations of sticks and various BIOS settings to confirm the extent of the problem.
I know you might find it inconvenient, but with 4GB+ in many machines these days, and given that you need to run through several passes to be thorough, checking the RAM properly is an overnight job.
Like many others, I rely mainly on MemTest86+ (boot from CD).
on RAM that actually turned out to be faulty) - so I cant vouch for it's effectiveness.
Having just upgraded to an i7 mobo, CPU and DDR3 RAM, the first thing I did was test the RAM on the first night.
