You're not going to be able to install a system-wide package like the ones it's asking for without being root.
I have user access to a Ubuntu instance and I'd like to use CTags.
Expand it, open a terminal and go to the directory where you expanded it, then do this:
If you are the one who installed this Ubuntu machine, then you are the user with uid 1000 meaning that you can run commands requiring root via the sudo command, e.g.
You can always install it localy, say under your home directory.
You might want to add that last line into your .bashrc or .bash_profile file as well for that matter.
This and all the instructions online indicate that I need to be root.
Certainly, just install it in your home directory from source.
You should be able to do it yourself if you compile and install your own copy of the editor.
Now, edit your PATH with this (assuming bash, which is probably what you are using if you don't know how to do this without help):
Go to http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ and download the latest version.
After that add the directory where ctags resides to yout shell PATH environment variable.
