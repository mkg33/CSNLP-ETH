I asked this question on the Hardware Recommendations forum, which I have been informed was the wrong place.
So this seems to be a time / warm-up related issue ... maybe.
My PC decided to auto upgrade to Windows 10 overnight, without permission.
This ONLY happens after it has been sleeping for a reasonable time or the monitor has auto switched off.
It does NOT happen when manually switching off the monitor and then back on shortly afterwards.
The other monitor, connected via standard VGA is fine.
However, if the monitor is switched off overnight it does have the same problem.
I have been struggling with this issue for 3 months +.
Since then I have had problems with one of my 2 monitors flickering.
I then need to turn the monitor off and on again and it will start flickering again as previously stated.
Occasionally, the monitor comes on flickering AND dim when woken and, in these circumstances, it will flicker as before for 40-50 secs and then go blank.
After either of these start up scenarios the monitor works perfectly, until it sleeps again!
Before you all ask, YES I have trawled the internet and tried many solutions, most related to Error Reporting services which I have disabled.
Anyway, the monitor flickers (strobes) initially rapidly then decreasing over a period of approx.
The monitor is connected using an HDMI to DVI cable.
