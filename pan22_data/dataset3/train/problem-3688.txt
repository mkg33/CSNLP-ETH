You must have cool air in the case to cool the CPU.
Your CPU shouldn't go above 50 C.  My case runs at about 40-45 C ambient.
When it gets too high, it's time to clean the dust out of the heat sink.
What's an optimal temperature for inside a typical case?
), so it's a baseline -- the only thing the case can do is have good or bad airflow and amplify this effect.
The Core 2 and Core i7 lines of CPUs have a max safe temperature of 100C.
If you're running at 60C while doing normal activities, you have nothing to worry about.
Both are in Fahrenheit, and when the thermometer on the wall says 75, the case gadget says 95.
Most CPUs should run at 50 C or less during full load.
The ambient temp will obviously affect overall temps of the components inside (must suck to live in the tropics!
If the temperatures get a lot higher with the cover removed, then the case has bad airflow and that's something you definitely want to try to fix.
What I determined was, that there is a 20 degree rise in temperature.
And that temperature rise number goes back down to 20.
Heck, maybe put it next to your A/C vent (if you have central air).
You should look into adding more fans to your case or just taking off the side of the case.
One thing I like to do is run the case with the cover removed, and see how much better or worse the overall temperatures get.
My case has a "temperature gauge" on it--I found that they have a thermocouple stuck into the CPU heatsink.
If your case is too hot, then the air inside will be too hot to dissipate the heat.
