Would it be best to configure the accepted IP addresses in IIS, Windows Firewall, or another alternative?
You should probably set this up in the firewall, and not rely on IIS to filter by IP Addresses.
There may be implications relating to performance, configuration, and possibly more depending on which process is responsible for handling this on the box.
Another option would be an access list on a switch or router depending on where these source IP's are located.
Given the configuration of our environment, the easiest way for me to accomplish this is through some form of IP whitelisting on the web servers themselves.
My preference is always to do this sort of thing on a bit of network equipment (Switch, Router, hardware firewall) I have know it in the past where someone used Windows firewall to apply a similar restriction only for it to become useless when at a later date another technician disabled Windows firewall on all server by GPO.
I'm deploying an ASP.NET application in beta and would like to limit HTTP access to a few select IPs.
