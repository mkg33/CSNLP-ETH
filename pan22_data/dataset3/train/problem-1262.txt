Deleting a VMDK file is a bit like removing physical hard drives from a server and throwing them away.
You had to redeploy the virtual machine and restore from backup.
As stated above, you can not recover the delete files - they are gone.
At this point, you can restore your backupped data on the now-running machine.
However, as it appears you deleted the snapshot deltas only, if the base disk (represented by the IBSng_server.vmdk and IBSng_server-flat.vmdk) is intact, you can reboot the machine attaching the original IBSng_server.vmdk file.
Your best bet is to consult your backup/disaster recovery plan and begin a restore from backup immediately.
This should be sufficient to restart the machine, but with stale data obviously.
With this approach you can reduce the time your machine is offline by skipping OS reinstallation.
When server was down, we accidently removed some of the *.vmdk files, shown below:
We had a virtual-disk and its snapshots at the following path on a server.
We tried the trial version of DiskInternals VMFS Recovery software, but looks like the software is good at recovering the contents inside the vitual disk, not recovering the *.vmdk files themselves.
Fortunately, this kind of thing is exactly what backups are for!
