I would first style them exactly the same, and then if necessary just add extra styles to differentiate them - perhaps change the colour of the borders or the background of the headers.
If you define the first font-size absolutely (body: 12px) and then define all others relatively (h3: 110%), when you update the body's font-size the others adjust automatically.
