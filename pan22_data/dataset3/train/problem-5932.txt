Assuming that I'm not somehow totally misled in the above -- why is the result so often stated with zig-zag products?
Currently the only proof of their expansion properties I could find was in terms of zig-zag products, but I don't expect it to be too difficult to deal with them directly.
This means taking a $(D^{48}, D, 1/2)$ graph to start with instead of $(D^{16}, D, 1/2)$, but these also exist by the same construction they used (just plugging in different numbers).
This means that the proof for $L=SL$ should be able to accomplished with only the replacement product, instead of the zig-zag product.
Maybe my question really should be -- why are zig-zag products preferred over replacement products?
(This is a bit of follow-up to https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/posts/comments/93266 but is a distinct enough question I though it should be on its own.)
The replacement product is a few senses, simpler to understand: steps on it naturally correspond to a step in either $G$ or $H$.
In "Entropy Waves, The Zig-Zag Graph Product, and New Constant-Degree Expanders", Reingold at all actually mention that replacement products aren't much worse than zig-zag products: the cube of the replacement product contains all of the edges of the zig-zag product, so has at least as good connectivity.
In Omer Reingold's logspace USTCON algorithm, he uses zig-zag products; the zig-zag product is attractive in that if $H$ is a good expander, then $G{\,\,\,\mathbin{{
Replacement products seem more natural, and clearly fulfill the same requirements.
In terms of the loosest bound: instead of taking the 8th power of the graph, the 24th power is taken; and then the replacement product is used instead.
Then $G$ can be powered, to make it a much better expander; and balancing these two operations allows him to turn $G$ into a larger, good expander.
