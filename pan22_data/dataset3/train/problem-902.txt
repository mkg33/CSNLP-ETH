I've been working on a test project (as possibly easy to tell from my previous posts) with OpenVZ,
You may wish to look at a cloud computing/VPS provider which provides a redundant platform, by default if a hardware node fails your machine would fail over to another physical node, and take the IP address with it.
Could someone recommend a service provider that may/will allow this?
Can anyone recommend an ISP in the UK that allows for dynamic shifting of IP's across servers?
However we've recently noticed/found out that IP's are only accessible to the host they are assigned to... which obviously isn't going to suffice a service which we wish to deploy whereby if a hardware node fails we migrate all VM's over to a secondary HN.
We are ready to go with this project and have successfully been able to get everything up and running,
As a note, you'll probably find that if you use arping, you can migrate the IP address between machines by informing the border router that the IP address has a new mac address as it's on a new piece of hardware.
