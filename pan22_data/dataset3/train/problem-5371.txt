If it's about which is better for employment, you would want to look at open positions and salary stats.
I do not expect you to get reliable information from individual vendor sites or from the opinions of folks here on ServerFault (as well-meaning as they may be).
If you hold this information highly valuable, and want to rely on authenticity and currency, I suggest you hit up a research firm that specializes in it, subscribe to their newsletter, offer sacrifices to their pagan deities, etc.
I am wondering if anyone can point me to research or a link to statistics regarding popularity of database deployment.
This is a nice diagram that should answer your question, from MySQL.
Obviously, MySQL, Oracle, SQLServer are some of the major players but I am looking for actual data on market share.
Microsoft frequently advertises that SQL Server database engine has been downloaded and installed more than anything else.
Is it the number of companies that use it, the number of processors it's installed on, the licensing revenue, the database size, the number of operations performed, etc.
People pay research firms like Gartner gobs and gobs and gobs of money for this data.
Any data or site with chart/graphs etc would be good with preference for change in market share over time.
