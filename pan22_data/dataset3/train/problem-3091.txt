But that fails when RequestedPrivateIP is false with
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/pseudo-parameter-reference.html
Some of those however require a specific PrivateIpAddress and I'm struggling to figure out how to incorporate that to the template.
One of them will have your condition RequestedPrivateIP while the other one should have the same condition but negated, e.g.
Since it seems like the PrivateIpAddress property does not support an empty string as it value, I would suggest creating two separate resources of your AWS::EC2::Instance.
For now I've got a template parameter PrivateIP and a creating a Condition RequestedPrivateIP.
Any idea how to optionally assign a static Private IP and if not specified leave it to AWS to set a dynamic one?
the AWS::NoValue is there to give you the else option for your if statement.
However I can't figure out how to incorporate it to the AWS::EC2::Instance resource specification.
We've got an AWS CloudFormation template for creating some EC2 instances.
