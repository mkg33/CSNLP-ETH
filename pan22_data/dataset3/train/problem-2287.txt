Of course if you're making your own cluster any address will do, for most intents and purposes.
Your front end node should give all other nodes their IP address's to complete the connection.
Here I went to the wired connection and changed the IPv4 IP address and Subnet to 1.1.1.x and 255.255.255.0, respectively.
From here I wrote some "Hello World" OpenMPI programs and ran them.
I found this is because it was trying to do things with the IPv6 address information.
I have never used Rocks Cluster before so I could be wrong on the IP addressing.
x here is a counter which is incremented for each node in the cluster, so I have address 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2, etc.
I connected all nodes to this switch, via ethernet of course, and went to the WiFi settings, which is the network settings window in Fedora.
I used Fedora 20 and an unmanaged 5-port ethernet switch.
You connect the front end nodes first NIC to the switch and connect the compute nodes to the switch also.
this switch must have VLANs created if you will also have other devices on the switch.
However, I was having trouble connecting to this private network.
So i turned this off and the computer connected right away.
all you need is a switch to connect all the nodes in the cluster together.
This required a machine/host file and credential-free SSH connections, but these are issues for other threads.
If, for example, you have 3 nodes; a front end and 2 compute nodes.
I decided to steer clear of Rocks after learning that setting up this private network is fairly easy, especially in Linux.
