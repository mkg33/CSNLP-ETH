This is by IEEE standard of course, mileage on specific transceivers may vary - the higher the budget the longer the reach.
if you are using a power source and power meter, it is depend on fiber core diameter and type of laser you are using.
Substract .1 dB per (good) splice and .1 to .2 dB per connection.
I'm having some trouble finding a definite answer.
Expected loss: For deployed fiber, OS1 has a maximal attenuation of 1 dB/km (ISO/IEC 11801) and OS2 .4 dB/km (ISO/IEC 24702).
So far I've figured out anything under 1db loss works.
Power budgets: 1000BASE-LX10 has a budget of 10 dB (6 dB insertion loss + 4 dB link channel loss - clause 58.5) while 10GBASE-LR has a budget of 9.4 dB (6.2 dB insertion loss + 3.2 dB link channel loss - clause 52.6.3).
example for 1310 Î» and 9 micron single mode, for each kilometer you have 0.4 db loss and for each connector 1 db and for each fusion 0.5 db.
I use a light loss tester to test our fiber (we dont have an otdr) and am unsure as to the acceptable light loss for 1310 SMF.
