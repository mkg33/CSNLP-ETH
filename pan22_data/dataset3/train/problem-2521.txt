Yes, yes, I know disk space is cheap but sometimes, you have older machines that just need more space and it's easier to free up space than to have to go through the pain of migrating to a new disk.
If you have Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 that has had SP1 installed on it, run this command and it'll free up anywhere from 2-4GB.
Move the spool folder to another drive if there is heavy printer use.
I end up deleting stuff like the $NTServicePackUninstall$ folder from c:\windows\system32 which frees up a few hundred meg.
I would like your suggestions as to freeing up space on a Windows machine.
I use TreeSize Pro because it has a handy "File Ages" bar chart where you can quickly see if any files in a folder are over 6 months old for example.
Also a server can end up with a lot of admin profiles on it, these can go too (of course they might come back again).
I just sort the folders in Directory Opus by size and hunt around the top contestants, deleting useless stuff when I find it (like old temp files in windir and appdata, application or installer data for things no longer used like the sql bootstrapper files)... but sure, that's the hardcore way I guess ^^
Using Windirstat you see where the wasted space is.
