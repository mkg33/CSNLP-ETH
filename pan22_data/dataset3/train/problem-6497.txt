Linux on the other hand has practically no support for most hardware.
I have win7 on the same laptop and its battery life is at least 2.5x times better than Debian.
But I am unable to get proper 1.5h juice under Debian
These will most likely not be in the repositories.
This of course means less efficiency on the hardware, resulting in poor battery performance.
The main and most significant cause being the drivers.
I love Debian Gnu Linux, everything is great except that the battery life.
My recommendations are to look for OEM drivers for Linux and install those.
I've had to (until recently) use one or the other because the OEM manufactures only supported Windows.
I have Sonny S series laptop(Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2430M CPU @ 2.40GHz)  with Debian testing on it with 3.10-3-amd64.
Within the past 6 months I was able to get drivers for Linux, but the turnout was a year and a half.
OEM drivers are very commonly protected under some licence, and the source code is often proprietary.
What are are the recommendations to match the Win battery performance?
It has two graphic cards, one for battery life, and the other being for performance.
Therefore, many of the Linux drivers are just reversed engineered from the OEM Windows drives and ported to Linux.
You will almost never get the same performance in battery life on Linux compared to Windows.
In summary, Windows has many more developers that are paid to write Windows drivers.
Many drivers cannot be used on Linux because of design or because of the GNU licence.
Still this battery life is so bad that I avoid taking my laptop outside unless I am willing to use win7 on it.
Under Windows this laptop survives over 4 hours no problem.
