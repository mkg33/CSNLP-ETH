When searching for this problem I see a reference to a "ip-mac-binding disable" command on WLC setups, but can't find if that maps to a setting on a single AP.
I had the same problem and found a solution: enable DHCP relay agent on the AP and it works.
Try adding "[no] dot11 qos mode wmm" to the AP config.
If so, the DHCP Discover is reaching the switch, and the broadcast Offer is being sent back, but dropped by the AP.
Replace x.x.x.x with the IP address from your DHCP server (typically the Internet router located on the same network / broadcast domain.
I had a similar issue at work and my solution was to configure the VM to use NAT instead of bridged mode.
However on my laptop I have VMware running, and a guest with NIC set to bridged mode is unable to DHCP, however IPv6 works fine.
I recently replaced wireless at a site from the internal AP on an 877-WM with a (standalone) 1262 running 15.2(2)JB.
The host machine will receive the actual IP address and then when the VM is spun up it tries to request a separate IP but the source MAC is the same.
Although it seems unrelated, this behavior can be caused when the the AP and client don't support the the same WMM QOS parameters.
If you check the "sh ip dhcp bindings" table on the switch is a lease shown for the VMs MAC address?
I've configured the AP pretty much the same as I always do for Cisco AP's for single SSID operation (single bridge domain, BVI1 also management), and things seem to work.
