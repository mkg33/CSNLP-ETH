As client application makes repeated requests the number of TIME_WAIT connections on server grows and settles on ~150 sockets being in TIME_WAIT constantly.
There's a single client application that makes frequent TCP (HTTP) connections to the server.
It is also difficult to change client app in order to pick source port manually as I am using a 3rd party library to make HTTP requests.
Connection lasts for the duration of one request and then server closes the connection so socket on the server ends up in TIME_WAIT state for few minutes.
Increasing ephemeral port range would only slightly decrease probability of collision.
I have no control on the server so reducing TIME_WAIT delay or changing behavior is not an option.
Is there a way to change ephemeral port selection strategy on a client (Linux) to avoid such collisions?
Occasionally new connection from client chooses a recently used ephemeral source port that is in TIME_WAIT state on the server and connection fails.
Exact scenario is also described in RFC6056 section 2.3
With 32k ephemeral port range and 150 sockets in TIME_WAIT there's >10% chance of this happening.
