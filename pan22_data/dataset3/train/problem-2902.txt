I've noticed that most tape drive vendors provide two options: full-height or half-height.
The main difference between the two now is maximum speed.
If you're just backing up a tape or two every day, either drive will probably be swapped out and upsized before it fails; if you're using it all day every day, go for a full height.
I guess both these features are not so important as the tape speed max is only about 120 MB/sec there is not need of FC connection.
The half-height drives are physically smaller and less expensive, yet seem to have identical specifications compared to their full-height peers.
I run a tape duping company and in my experience, the full height drives are more robust, and more likely to 'go the distance' if you're operating them all day.
Check the vendor's published specs to be completely sure.
Oracle SUN tape full-height supports automation environment and 8 gb/sec FC connection while half-height doesn't support these features.
Except maybe ESCON, but if you're using that, you have bigger problems (and budgets).
If they were really identical in operation, I'm sure that nobody would purchase the more expensive full-height drives, and they would stop being produced.
I haven't had a chance to compare HH and FH LTO5 and 6 drives, but certainly if you disassembled earlier generations of LTO (and before that, DLT) and compared the drive mechanisms, the FH parts were stamped from thicker metal and had been finished to a higher standard.

The tapes are the same and interchangeable, but a half height goes maybe 70% the speed as a full height.
Half height used to have limited connection options, however now support almost everything full heights do.
