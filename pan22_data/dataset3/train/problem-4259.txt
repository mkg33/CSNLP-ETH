If they're the same, consider modifying either the SYSTEM %path% or the %path% of the user running the service, so that the directory you want it to search is first.
You'll need a decent amount of C++ programming background (and a working build environment) to get through that.
This would require you to build an injector application, plus the DLL to inject.
You say that it "starts at system32, tries a few more locations, and eventually its own directory", so this seems more likely to me.
Simple file open operations are not particularly expensive, especially if it's a local path and the file doesn't actually exist.
Some tutorials exist; probably the two best ones I've found are:
However, this assumes that the service is looking at the current directory.
I believe Fred is right, though -- you're unlikely to see any significant performance benefit by doing any of this, unless it's happening very frequently.
Compare the directories you see in procmon with your %path%.
You could use DLL injection to call SetCurrentDirectory after the process has already launched.
