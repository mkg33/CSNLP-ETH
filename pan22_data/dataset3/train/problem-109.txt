If you intend to support 3D in a VM then you will need to test pretty much all of the VM packages out there, and that could be a nightmare.
VMWare, VirtualBox, Parallel and so on, each with several versions and their own quirky emulated graphics cards...  You may even end up with people trying to run it on Qemu if you're not careful.
Yes most of the 3D calls get passed through to the host driver but there is a layer between your application and the graphics card that may not be feature-complete.
I would have to say that personally I would warn the customer that such a configuration is unintended, unsupported, and above all not necessarily reliable for what they are trying to do.
Typically the feature set supported will be enough to run the most simple (and/or common) 3D tasks such as Aero on Windows or older simple 3D games but there may well be a lot of features that are either half-complete or have nothing more than stubs where features should be.
3D support within virtual machines is improving all the time, but by no means are the emulated graphics cards as good as real ones.
