We have to take all of the updates/patches/software we need for that visit on CD / USB Stick.
On the second point, considering that the server was already compromised in some fashion, whether or not Internet access is available is a moot point.
The longer answer that the security risk is so minimal that it outweighs the cost (in terms of time) to manage those servers.
We do a lot of maintenance on customers servers that have no access to the internet.
Obviously, this may all depend on specific circumstances (like meeting certain customer or regulatory requirements).
The first point it mitigated by restricting Internet access to known sites, and ideally not allowing web browsing at all.

If it is only an HTTP connection to Oracle website, why don't you make them use web-proxies?
(Allowing 3rd parties to bring in USB sticks/CDs is a security risk in it's own)
The question is - Is there a risk in allowing production servers to have HTTP/S connections outbound to the Internet.
