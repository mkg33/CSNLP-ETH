I can't promise it will be seamless, but you should be able to get something out of it.
I have seen plenty of questions about doing it the other way around, but my problem is this:
Have you tried system Properties | Advanced | User Profiles | Copy To?
The system I'm working on is Windows XP,I'm logging in locally through an administrative account, and have no possibility of scavenging data from the server, I have to play locally.
I have an Active Directory account that can't log in anymore, because the DC is down (and not going back up soon, and not with the old accounts, which got corrupted).
If you want to "do things right", you should set appropriate permissions on both the profile files and the lost user's own Registry (which is stored in the profile's NTUSER.DAT and needs to be opened by loading it into REGEDIT and re-ACLed appropriately).
There are user settings that I want to scavenge on the hard drive.
The key here is making NewUser a local administrator, so you're not going to run into any permission issue.
I would first try it with an account that I didn't mind if things went screwy on.
User settings like Outlook configuration, installed programs, and so on and so forth.
What should I do to achieve a "working copy" of the old account?
