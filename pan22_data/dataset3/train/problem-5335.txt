Firstly, search for baseapplicabilityrules.xsd file on C:\ directory and it will find a folder location for you then copy all items in this folder into Program Files\Update Files\Schema, if schema folder doesn't exist, you can create it manually.
I then noticed in the original post that copying from the "old server" didn't work because the OS version mismatch.
My schema, tools and API folder were missing from C:\Program Files\Update Services.
I compared 2008 R2 to 2012 R2 and 2016 and confirmed as expected most files are different for OS version.
