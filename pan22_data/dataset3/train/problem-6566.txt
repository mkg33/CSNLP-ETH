It happens automatically as soon as any changes are detected on any member and only sends the changed bits of files over the network.
You'll find Robocopy is built into Vista and later operating systems.
It's designed for exactly the situation you describe.
I've just set up file synchronization between a Windows 2000 Server and a Windows 2003 Server using cwrsync, a windows compile of rsync.
Don't let the seemingly complication documentation scare you.
Supports n-way synchronisation, continuous synchronisation, optionally moves deleted files into a separate folder, works with USB devices etc etc etc.
Robocopy (Robust File Copy) can handle some basic synchronization using the /MIR flag.
Assuming you're running R2 of Windows 2003 Server or newer, you've got DFS Replication right out of the box.
It was easy to setup and seems to work welll but I am seeing a problem with speed, the client does not seem to be able to top 130 Kb/s despite the network being capable of delivering 1 Mb/s over FTP.
Anyone else experienced this and found a solution?
It's pretty simple to get setup assuming you've already got an Active Directory.
All files in a particular folder are automatically synchronized between each member in the replication group.
