Now, I can connect directly to https://owa.company.com/owa just fine and it shows it is using the new certificate, however if I go to http://owa.company.com then I get a 403 http error.
Then today I created a new ssl certificate and replaced the old one on this Exchange server.

Everything else I've found with googling either has no solution or just gives instructions for enabling the redirect setting.
Check the info under "For a Configuration in Which SSL is Required on the Default Web Site":
Exchange likes to set "SSL Required" on the IIS Web Site, which will cause this error for HTTP.
It does work if I go to https://owa.company.com, then it will still redirect to the /owa site, but if I use plain http, then I get the errror.
I've tried unchecking the redirect setting, restarting IIS and re-enabling the redirect setting, which did no good.
Again: this was working fine until I renewed the ssl certificate.
Redirect has been working fine to when users connect to http://owa.company.com they get redirected to a log in page at https://owa.company.com/owa.
