If you are running into the lag when doing ANYTHING from the SAS volume... perhaps the firmware of your raid controller is b0rked... or you're using the wrong drivers... (or in some cases... a REALLY cheap SAS controller).
This should effectively lower the impact on the server.
I would first try to fix the problem rather than simply work around it.
The USB stack shouldn't affect system performance that drastically.
It can also be the result of some anti-virus program (or multiple programs overlapping) causing the machine to work 4x as hard as necessary.
Even having your volume fragmented all over the place can cause the symptoms you're talking about.
Why put lots of individual files into one big one then try to split it up again?
With windows, unfortunately, your options are a bit more limited.
In all honesty however, If you're running into a noticeable slow-down when doing a single-threaded copy of a single file...
More will just make your machine work harder for no reason.)
If you're talking about copying from SAS -> USB (or vise-versa) and the lag is happening...
You could simply try setting up a FTP server (don't use the IIS one) and set a max bandwidth.
Use differential or transactional backup instead of full backup.
 - This will cut down on the amount of data you will need to transfer.
