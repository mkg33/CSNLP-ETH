If you plan to use ZFS please make sure you have a lot of RAM.
So a good rule of thumb is to spend at least 1GB RAM per TB HDD.
I'm planning to use glusterfs and consumer grade 4TB hard-drives.
I my opinion you should think about smaller RAIDz2 Pools connected to one big RAIDz2 or RAIDz3.
Will a zfs pool on 1 harddrive give me extra protection against for example bit rot?
I need to create a private cloud and I'm searching for the best setup.
If a hard drive fails which setup will recover the quickest?
With setup 1 and 3 I can loose 2 systems and still be up and running with setup 2 I can only loose 1 system.
A ZFS on a single Harddrive won't give you any protection against "bit rot".
In my opinion setup 1 and 3 because there only the contents of 1 hard-drive needs to be copied over the network.
When I use ZFS I can enable compression which will give me some extra storage.
I've got 5 x 2TB HDDs in a RAIDz1 and it uses about 10Gigs of RAM.
The system is going to be used as backup setup which will receive data 24/7 over SFTP and rsync.
Instead of setup 2 were the hard-drive needs te be reconstructed by reading the parity of all the other harddrives in the system.
