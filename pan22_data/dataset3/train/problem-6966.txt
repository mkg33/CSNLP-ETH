neither are required you can do this with a mount command:
You want the client if you are trying to access existing drives on the network from this computer.
If the Windows network is domain based (eg Active Directory), you might want to run the winbind daemon (which usually depends on the other Samba daemons) and properly connect the Linux computer to the domain so it can use the networks shared credentials etc.
Do I need to run the samba server or should the samba client be sufficient?
You want the samba client (smbmount) or CIFS (a client-only driver) which is also maintained by the samba team.
If you just want to very occasionally mount the odd Windows file share, then you only need the client components (eg smbfs).
I'm trying to connect a linux computer to an existing Windows network.
It depends on what you mean by "connect", and what type of Windows network you are talking about.
Most versions of Linux will have both, although samba may not be installed by both.
You want the server if you are trying to share drives on this computer with the network.
