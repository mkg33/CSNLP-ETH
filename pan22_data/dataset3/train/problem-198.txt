More often than not there's something scheduled within a few hours of getting back, and it'd be silly to miss it because I was strictly working though the inbox from one end or the other (ok YMMV depending on what sort of meetings you get invited to... some people might be glad of any excuse to miss some :^)
my boss, contacts in other departments, important people) so that I can easily see emails that require me to follow up on.
I experience this dilemma when returning from vacation as well.
What's the most effective way to deal with the pile of email?
Most people in IT are used to the pile of email which awaits them after returning from a few weeks off.
Also, if you regularly get emails that are flagged as urgent, I usually create a Search Folder  (Outlook) that will show me all e-mails flagged as urgent.
That way, if an issue or outage occurs, you can first see the notification, then the resolution to the notification.
Frist thing I do after a couple of weeks out of the office is scan my Outlook inbox for meeting requests.
What I did when I returned is to triage all the message by tagging them with a level of importance (1-5) immediately.
Is it better to read the most recent emails first, or the oldest emails first?
Something that I also do before I go on vacation is to set filters that move all notifications about outages/issues to their own folder.
It is generally better to read them from oldest to first.
Then I started looking at the hundreds of messages in #1.
