It seems, from the documentation about BCP - Specify Field and Row Terminators (SQL Server), that non-printable characters are not supported:
This way it also works for huge files, since they don't have to be entirely loaded into memory before doing the replacements.
Additionally, it uses AppendAllLines to turn this into a streaming operation.
-ReadCount 1000 speeds up the process drastically.
As an option, you could use POWERSHELL to read in the source file and search\replace the 0x1C characters with some other character like a tilda (~) and output to a different file.
Below you can find an example PowerShell script that can make this replacement on a file encoded in UTF8(with or without BOM header doesn't matter), and writes an output file encoded in UTF8 without a BOM header.
Make sure you save the script above in a file that is encoded with UTF8 with BOM header, otherwise PowerShell doesn't process the characters as UTF-8.
Since @ScottHodgin pointed out that non-printable characters are not supported, replacing them in the source file is the only alternative.
