at best, you'll only keep the less experienced users at bay anyway.
Best to deal with this problem via policy and policing/auditing...
I can think of 2 ways of doing this, one dirty, and one good.
I want to ensure that users of my system are incapable of chmodding files +x, and I do not want anything in /home/ or /var/ to be executable.
It would explicitly remove the exec flag from all files in those two directories, i.e.
Aren't you limiting the effectiveness of the computing platform by doing this?
So presumably you are trying to prevent a native executable from running?
... and presumably this was caused by a real problem vs you being paranoid.
This will prevent, at the filesystem level, the execution of files stored within those directories.
Create new partitions to house both var and home, this is considered best practice anyway.
don't forget to make sure /tmp /var/tmp and other user-writable dirs also are on the partitions mount with noexec flag.
The better way is to do it at the filesystem level.
Write a shell script that runs very regularly as a cronjob, say every 5 or 10 minutes.
many scripts can be run by simply invoking the interpreter directly:
