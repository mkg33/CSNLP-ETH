The following command will show lines either removed from a or added to b:
It produces a sequence of editing commands for a tool like patch to use to change one file into another.
That's what diff does by default...  Maybe you need to add some flags to ignore whitespace?
Also what to do when lines are added, deleted and changed adjacent to each other.
This slightly different command will show lines removed from a.txt:
Using your answer, here is what I came up with to get the list of things changed/added/deleted.
So it shows old lines with - followed immediately by the corresponding new line with +.
should ignore blank lines and different numbers of spaces.
No, diff doesn't actually show the differences between two files in the way one might think.
The example uses 2 versions of the /etc/passwd file and prints out the username for the relevant records.
To show additions and deletions without context, line numbers, +, -, <, > !
Thanks senarvi, your solution (not voted for) actually gave me EXACTLY what I wanted after looking for ages on a ton of pages.
