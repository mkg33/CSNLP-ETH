   Writer Instance Id: {02638a86-5f10-480f-a994-81b7a47132f3}
Backup started at '5/5/2011 12:34:07 AM' failed as Volume Shadow copy operation failed for backup volumes with following error code '2155348129'.
Currently running SQL 2005 at SP3 (which is updated to the latest version) ruling out possible updates to resolve the issue.

May need to create Batch files to disable culprit before backup and reenable after backup but this is a work around not the solution.
The other question of course is why has this happened.

You can install or repair the component on the local computer.
===> Ran Backup with SQL VSS writer serice stopped and full backup was successful - however if this service is stopped the backup does not contain SQL db backup.
The description for Event ID 24583 from source SQLWRITER cannot be found.
Typically if a VSS writer is showing as failed then you will need a reboot to clear the error, though you can try a VSS reset - see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940184 for details
Any assistance or possible solutions would be greatly appreciated.

In my experience the vast majority of VSS problems are caused by performance issues so things to check are:
Error message: BACKUP DATABASE is terminating abnormally.
Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted.
- Investigated applying certain updates and hotfixes but research showed that it would not resolve the isse.
