It doesn't provide properties to import an existing certificate to be used on my stack based on the below properties
Also note that, while you can import certificates in the ACM console, they actually seem to be associated with IAM, and do not appear in the ACM console (at least for me).
                        "SSLCertificateId": { "Ref": "CerttificationArn" }
Can you import an existing certificate using ACM to be used by your LoadBalancerListener via CloudFormation?
                        "LoadBalancerPort": "443",
                        "PolicyNames": [ "SSL-Policy" ],
            "Description": "ARN for the Certificate",
                        "InstanceProtocol": "HTTPS",
On ACM FAQ, it does not tell it can be done on cloudformation concerning the importing of SSL.
Short answer: No this documentation as an overview to available CloudFormation ressources.
You can import the cert into ACM at first, and then provide Certificate ARN as the Parameters of ELB in the CF template.
As for the cloudformation documentation concerning the ACM.
