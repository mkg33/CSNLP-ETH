Build the query text using Query Builder - it always creates correct code or produce error message if there are any logical problems.
(I still haven't figured out how to get INNER JOIN clauses working with Access' need to use parentheses for joins.)
What I want to do is extend the query to include Directions.DirectionsText by joining Readers.Direction to Directions ON Directions.Direction.
Or (if you want write query text "by hands" without using the master) rewrite the query to cartesian form (with comma-separated tables list and all joining conditions in WHERE clause) - it do not need the accuracy in parenthessis:
I have the following query, which gives me (in addition to other columns) the Direction ID only:
The order of either tables in FROM clause or conditions in WHERE clause does not matter in those form.
Directions is joined to Readers - so you must place it adjacent to this table enclosind this pair in additional parenthesis:
The columns in Directions are Direction (numeric) and DirectionText (String)
I'm having trouble with exactly where to place the join so that I don't keep getting errors in the FROM clause.
