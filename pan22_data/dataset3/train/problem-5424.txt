First though I would recommend scripting out the tables you want to put in the new database seperately rather than using a SELECT INTO.
You should be able to do a Tasks -> Export Data to the destination DB if you need the data, otherwise you could use the SSMS Generate Script feature to copy the tables over with only the Schema.
I have a set of instructions (and a short demo gif) here.
Do you want to copy all of the data inside of them to the new DB, or are you looking to have blank copies of the table in the new DB?
This does assume that the database is on the same server.
If you are looking for a quick one-off solution, you can try this.
If it's not you'll need to use something like BCP or SSIS.
From here you can either copy the output into a query window to run or put a cursor (or some other type of loop) and run each command one at a time.
This way you will get all of the indexes, triggers, etc scripted along with you.
Basically it will let you sort and/or filter so you can select the tables you want to copy and then right click and script the whole thing out.
In the source database, run this command (making the necessary changes for TrgDb for your target database and SrcDb for your source database.
The easiest way to handle that is going to be using the Object Explorer Details window in SSMS (Management Studio).
And if that sounds scary don't worry, it's really not.
Take the results and paste the commands into a new SSMS window that points to the target database.
Make sure to change RemoteDB and LocalDB to the appropriate names, and it's designed to be run on the source/local DB.
