Suppose we want to solve the $k$-dense-subgraph problem in a graph $H$; that is we want to find a subset of $k$ nodes $S$ that maximizes the number of edges in the induced graph $G[S]$.
The paper that @Austin Buchanan pointed to above on approximate Graph Isomorphism does not seem to correspond to the version asked.
I am assuming that the adjacency matrix has $0,1$ entries in which case the objective is measuring only the matched edges.
It appears that the problem asked is at least as hard the $k$-dense-subgraph problem which currently admits only a polynomial-approximation.
You can reduce this to your problem by setting $G$ to be a graph consisting of a clique on $k$-vertices and $n-k$ isolated vertices, and $G'$ is set to be $H$.
See http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2891 and http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1360 for more details and the current status in terms of algorithms and hardness.
The approximate Graph Isomorphism model measures both the matched an unmatched edges which makes it a bit easier from an approximation point of view.
