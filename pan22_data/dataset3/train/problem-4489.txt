Its a very simple program,  i use it daily and feel peace of mind.
you can check at sourceforge,  its named BrowseWell.
Recently I've made a program exactly for this aim.
You will notice that this causes a lot of trouble if you were using Noscript.
In this way browser  loses memory burdens of extensions as a bonus.
I appreciate that I have to explicitly allow those scripts/domains that are needed for a page and can easily keep other certain scripts/domains from ever firing.
It's also very nice that you can temporarily allow a domain so that you can see if it really is vital for the page/site to function.
While you may think that this will solve snooping and cross site request forgery, it will only cause more problems.
I just discovered a program called "Ghostery" that allows you to view/prevent third-party sites that track you, maybe it can help you out.
There's a ton of times where I go to a webpage and have to allow some third party webpage to load javascript (and other items) for the page to function or even render properly.
It utilizes host-rules parameter of chromium based browsers to launch  a whitelisted browser session where only your allowed domains and IPs can be contacted .
A lot of websites have a separate domain such as paypal.com I think has staticpaypal.com which is responsible for loading all of the static content like images, video, scripts, etc.
Additionally it runs browser in incognito mode as default and disables all extensions too.
