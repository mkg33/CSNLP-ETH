I got the mini displayport to VGA, where the mini displayport to the DVI was only $19.99.
I have it a regular usb plugged into the macbook connecting to the printer type usb port on the projector and its not working.
there are only a few ports on the macbook; 2 usb, one firewire/printer type usb (not sure if it is firewire or what it is exactly, but it definitely is the printer sized usb), ethernet, and thats about it.
after spending an hour and a half online trying to figure this fact out, and 2 hours going store to store before that asking if they have mac cable or accessories no one could tell me this simple fact.
If i got the mini displayport to VGA at apple it wouldve been $29.00...
This is why i hate macs, they claim to make everything easier, but it just a hassle when you live in a PC world and Steve Jobs makes new cords or connector every 2 years so he can make on obsolete and sell new crap to a bunch of naive consumers, just so he knows mac people will have to by the crap he is selling if they still want to use their computers.
I need help with connect a macbook to the hitachi cp-x400 projector.
maybe it's not firewire\usb, it mini displayport (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_DisplayPort), so you should find wire with such connector on one side & vga\composite on other - (for projector connection)
$24.99 at best buy, although there was one for $29.99.
then another 2 hours driving around to go to Best Buy because they're the only place that has this besides Apple.
