I want to know how people test if their network connection is secured.
But then again, you must be aware that if you use ssh but your password is "abc123" or reachable from any internet location, it's much more insecure than a telnet with a complex password or with restricted access.
Another exercise of this problem is by using telnet.
If you can't read what you just typed to the server then it is encrypted.
Also, I am not sure if this approach is even correct.
then I get the raw packets which I have no knowledge to interpret.
As a curiosity: Telnet+SRP is much more secure and safer than SSH ;)
If you are interested in the details, you should check the SSH Protocol definition itself.
I think to actually take the data and decrypted with the key is beyond what you would find here.
But I want to verify this, so I tried to use tcpdump.
And of course, don't pay much credit to those "security experts" saying that "Telnet is insecure".
Therefore, security must be considered as a whole.
When I connect to a host/service and I'm not sure about the security of the connection, I normally run a tcpdump/wireshark to see if the data is sent as cleartext.
If I have any doubt, I can always search some documentation, how authentication works, which security options are available, and so.
That's quite helpful with apps/processes/protocols where data MAY or MAY NOT be ciphered (telnet, mysql, ldap, xmpp, smtp, etc).
It's not only about the protocol/algorithm you use.
It your machine is really using SSH, it is secure.
