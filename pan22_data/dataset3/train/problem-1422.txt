The fact that the server is running in a virtual machine has no impact on that.

This is a restriction of the DNS spec, not something related to cloud or virtualization implementations.
You can still use Amazon's Elastic Load Balancer with a zone apex or naked domain like "example.com" as long as you host your DNS for that zone using Amazon's Route53 DNS service.
Web sites running on EC2 can be served through zone apex or naked domain like "example.com" with A records.
If you are using a service that requires a CNAME, like Amazon's Elastic Load Balancer, then you cannot point to it with a zone apex or naked domain like "example.com" as CNAMEs cannot be used with naked domains.
Amazon does tricks to make an A record map dynamically to the results of what the CNAME would have returned, complying with the DNS spec while providing the flexibility and power that ELB needs to provide.
You are violating the DNS spec in how you're trying to use it.
