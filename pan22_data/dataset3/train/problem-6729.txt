Our users keep getting the Autodiscover redirect warnings in Outlook, even when they select "Don't inform me about this website again", the message comes back in a few days.

Type the name of the HTTPS server to which AutoDiscover can connect without warning for the user, and then press ENTER.
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Outlook\AutoDiscover\RedirectServers
The Data column should remain empty for the string values that you create.
