It's always good to point out that in order to achieve the highest level of the Common Criteria, it is necessary to formally verify, design and test a system.
I would also include a brief description of existing security/safety standards, such as ITSEC/TCSEC and the Common Criteria.
There was a reading course at Carnegie Mellon a few years ago, Languages and Logics for Security, which tried to survey some of the literature in authentication, authorization, information flow, protocol calculi, protection, and trust management; the course web page has slides for the papers we discussed as well as a further list of references for each topic.
I am not sure of what you hide under the word "verification" so I give a try.
In this framework you have a pretty good way of modelling adversaries, of expressing properties and there exists easy to use verification tools (PRISM for instance).
Might be worth skimming through there for some papers.
I think that the Chapters 8 and 25 of the Nisan et al book on Algorithmic Game Theory could provide a good basis.
Maybe you can add something about quantitative verification of Markov Decision Processes and the use of probabilistic temporal logic (pLTL and PCTL).
Rob's answer reminded me of a similar Cornell reading group that Michael Clarkson organized for a few years: Cornell Security Discussion Group.
Information flow in particular might be something worth taking a look at relative to the topics you listed.
The curriculum for Anupam Datta's course Foundations of Security and Privacy is also relevant.
You could also take a look at the following graduate course on security protocols in Paris (the text is mostly in French):
A lecture on Provable Security could be interesting, in particular using Game Theory.
