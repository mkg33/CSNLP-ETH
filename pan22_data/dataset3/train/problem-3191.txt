There should be an "Intellipoint Uninstaller.app" there.
It appears as if that is the source of these daemons.
AFAICT, this program is a part of the IntelliType tools for OS X to enable extra functionality on certain keyboards.
(Note that it will ask you to reboot at the end of the process.)
I have neither a Microsoft Mouse nor a Microsoft Keyboard, nor any Microsoft software installed on my Mac.
If you are certain that you have never used a Microsoft keyboard, it could be possible that you have used another keyboard with similar hardware and they have used used the same program to enable said functionality.
You would probably be safe to uninstall the software/drivers if it is causing a problem.
Another possibility is that these have installed themselves as a part of other Microsoft software.
You can either dig around for the files that launch them yourself, or you can run this and see if it catches them for you:
Do you have a 'Microsoft Keyboard.app' in Applications?
It won't actually remove anything, just point it out.
Could the computer have had a Microsoft keyboard or mouse connected at any time in the past?
Inside your Applications folder, open the "Utilities" folder.
If so the drivers may have been installed when the Microsoft KB & M were being used, and not uninstalled when the KB & M were removed.
Run that and it should remove the Helper Apps/processes.
These also may be present in System Preferences > Users > [Your User] > Login Items
Why then do I have MicrosoftKeyboardHelper and MicrosoftMouseHelper running in my process list?
