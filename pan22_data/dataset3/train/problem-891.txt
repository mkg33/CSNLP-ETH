Wireless networking is a pretty complex topic, at least, seems that way to me.
It was quite impressive, but the quote totalled over $45000.
We were considering linking two buildings across the street from each other, and a VPN over public internet wouldn't cut it due to speed and latency.
The project was cancelled though, so I can't say exactly how it would perform.
I recommend giving serious thought to getting a consultant for this.
If you're looking for a high-throughput connection, that is very reliable, and you're willing to spend the money, consider a Bridgewave AR60.
The antenna type you're probably looking for are called yagi antennas; directional antennas to help focus your signal.
A few factors that come to mind in choosing the right wireless solution:
We decided on a Bridgewave AR60 connected with a Motorola PTP600 as a backup/failover link.
It can do 1 Gbps traffic across short links, and can be set up with redundant equipment.
Unless this is a really small shop, the cost of consultant will probably be worth the risk of a wrong decision when you are talking the price of good wireless networking equipment.
Make sure you have proper grounding or you're going to have a nice and expensive lightning rod.
