The one-wire software is installed and I am able to successfully read the temperature from the devices folder/file in /sys/bus/w1/devices.
The problem I am having occurs when using much longer wire (15ft) to connect all three (ground, data, and vcc) wires from the sensor to the pi.
I am a novice and looking for help trouble shooting the issue and clarification of any apparent misconceptions I have.
The sensors can handle about 820 ohm on the Datasheet, I use 500 Ohms only for testing Purposes.
With 4,7kOhm i got only about 50m or something which worried me and i never thought i can get this length.
With 1kOhm i got 190m so it would be also possible to get this far with 1KOhm or 820kOhm.
GROUND is connected to 2 wires from different twisted pairs, last wires from these twist pairs are used for DATA and power.
I have unshielded CAT5 cable about 40m and 7 sensors DS18B20.

I think the cable really doesn't matter that much.
My problem was ringing; I added an 80-ohm (a semi-randomly picked low value) resistor in series with the data line at both ends of the cable, which lowered the slew rate and fixed the problem for me.
The DS18B20 is no longer readable, there is no folder named with the serial number in the /sys/bus/w1/devices directory now.
Between GPIO4 and 3.3v there is a 2.2k pullup resistor and I have correct data from last 2 sensors on the wire while one sensor in the middle always shows 85000.
Below there is a grafh of this day and all days from start
I have 5V sensor voltage, 500 ohm pullup to 3.3V, Cat5e shielded cable.
You would still need to pull the data line up to 3V3 though.
For me it started to work when I changed pullup resistor from 4,7k tu 2.2k.
I thought I may be losing voltage due to the longer length of the wires but using a mutli-meter I am getting a 3.28V reading at the locations marked with the arrows in the next picture.
I have a raspberry pi connected to a DS18B20 temperature sensor shown in the diagram below.
Just solved this issue on my setup (DS18B20 worked on short cable, failed on 5M CAT3 cable, ESP8266 host).
