The most simple case is to define a service that checks the DNS server on the host:
Normal paramters include the host to test, limits for critical and warning limits.
So, if you want to check that serverfault.com resolves to 69.59.196.211, yo do this:
login the nagios server with putty (windows) or slogin in a unix shell.
execute the check_dns plugin with the --help switch.
You probably already have the command defined in your stock nagios config like so:
As you can see you can also especify which DNS server to query with the -s switch, warning and critical thresholds, etc.
Run the plugin with -h and it should give you documentation on how to use it.
Once you're satisfied with the check you run from the cli, you edit the nagios config file where you define the services (probably services.cfg) and apply the check to a given host(group).
Nagios is a pretty complicated tool, there's no really easy 'quick start'.
DNS test will likely include what you want to look up.
But that is much better documented in the fine manual you can even read from the web interface that got installed when you installed nagios.
Go to the /usr/local/nagios/libexec dir (assuming you have installed nagios from source, if you have used a package from your distribution, check the docs of your package):
