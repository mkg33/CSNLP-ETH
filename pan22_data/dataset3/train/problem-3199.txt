I can't tell what you want the formula in that cell to do, so cannot say what the answer is.
Since a single cell cannot be equal to a number of cells, the result will always be 0 (according to the formula).
The formula in the Reference Cell looks incorrect.
I think I'm somehow supposed to tell excel to read the cell as a value instead of a formula, but I don't know the correct formula.
You ask whether the value in the cell A14 is equal to the value in the array B11:B1079.
Reference Cell Formula: =IF(A14=$B$11:$B$1079,0,A14)
This can be tested by changing one of the values in A13:A22 in the Incomplete Report sheet to 0.
The vlookup then searches the first column in the range (given in the vlookup function) in Incomplete Report for the 0 figure and doesn't find it, resulting in the #N/A error.
I'm trying to use a vlookup where the reference cell is an IF formula:
It might help if you supply some data that exists in B11:B1079 and the A13:C22 array in `Incomplete Report'.
You need to correct the formula in D14 to something that will return a useful value to lookup.
Formula: =VLOOKUP(D14,'Incomplete Report'!A13:C22,3,FALSE)
