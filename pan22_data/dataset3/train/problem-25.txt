If you follow the FAQ link from JasonAzze, you will see there is a "map to guest" line which is also required, so you need both of these lines:
yesterday I upgraded my fedora box to the latest version, and with that, I also upgraded samba, now using samba 4.
Looking at the logs, there is a warning related to the security parameter
Reason: both share and server have been deprecated in Samba4.
Does that means that samba 4 has finally removed 'share' as an option, is there any alternative to it, so that I can configure shares without passwords.
I had the same problem as the OP, and I have tested that this solution works on Fedora 18
I used to access those share from any computer at home without user/password, but now there seems to be something wrong with the configuration.

I had to remember to do one other thing before I could get this to work... it was to make sure the permissions on my shared unix directory were read/write for the nobody user or the nogroup group.
