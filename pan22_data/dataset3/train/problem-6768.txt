If your server is not under high load, consider an IDS like Snort or Prelude.
(BSD has been doing transparent bridging longer than Linux, Linux may have caught up by now and work sufficiently.

Or do it with a transparent bridge using OpenBSD, netBSD or FreeBSD and port mirroring, a standard setup for packet analyzing.
In high traffic the MITM can lose packets or possibly change the data stream because of the overhead of decoding.
You could also try a monitor port on a managed switch but again you will lose packets.
High load throughput, either packets per second or bytes per second, is usually where you'll see differences.)
If you're not expecting udp traffic at all I might recommend just dropping it (except for your DNS servers, of course!
Three NICs, one connected to Internet, one connected to internal network, the third mirrored and connected to a packet analyzer and/or intrusion detection system.
If this is a production server use port mirroring and send packets to a dedicated IDS/packet analyzer machine rather than installing the IDS on the server itself.
Open up a traffic sniffer like tcpdump or wireshark as follows:
Use a "machine in the middle" with a packet analyzer like Wireshark.
I would also double check as Sameer said above to see if you are running any services that listen for UDP by running:
Either simple method, MITM or managed switch monitor port may be enough to determine the problem even without an exact packet capture.
