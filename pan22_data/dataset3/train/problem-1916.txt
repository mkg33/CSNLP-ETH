Ther are a lot of examples on stackoverflow and serverfault of vbs, c#, or other scripts to keep folders clear.
The real problem here is that the DMS product you are using isn't providing complete shell integration, so get them to fix it.
Not sure if that helps (filetypes, not locations) good luck!

It also places no restriction on the file type being added to the automatic Jump Lists of other applications in the case that other applications use this file type.
Method 1 (using your suggestion): Use a vbs that runs in the backround as part of a logon script (and stays resident) to monitor and delete unwanted items (shortcuts) from the \recent\ folder.
Method 2 (a tweak of the XP method): Use tweakUI's replacement took "Ultimate Windows Tweaker" with the general guidelines from about.com
This flag does not restrict members of this file type from being added to a custom Jump List.
Even fancier, you could have the program modify the recent doc entries, re-directing the user to the DMS interface for that document.
Prohibits the addition of members of this file type to the Recent Documents folder.
Additionally, in Windows 7 and later, prohibits the addition of members of this file type to the automatic Recent or Frequent category of an application's Jump List.
I achieved the opposite (making system files, like .chm .vhd .bat .dll) visible in recent items, ie via Windows Explorer, by modifying the EditFlags - check FileTypeAttributeFlags on MSDN (search google 'EditFlags msdn')
In the meantime, you could probably write a cleanup program, using shell APIs to monitor the recent docs, and then remove the "bad" entries.
A quick RegSearch reveals a few EditFlags entries formatted for the flag you want, like avastvpnfile (one my AV's files) @ HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\avastvpnfile
