Even if a customer calls from a Vonage phone (making it technically VOIP originated), it enters the PBX as a PSTN call and counts as such.
Where I've seen the term Non-IP traffic in the past generally refers to how providers will charge you for incoming calls from the PSTN.
Corporate PSTN accounts generally have a per-minute charge, but any calls inside your own PBX are free, because they never leave your system.
In a hosted VOIP environment, technically all calls are going out of your network to the providers network, so they use this terminology to distinguish between calls from your own system and calls from the PSTN.
Doing a google search on the phrase you're asking about seems to indicate that you can't send calls over this VoIP link if it originates on POTS.
I suspect they are referring to POTS-originated traffic.
Basically, hosted VOIP providers are trying to mimic the charge conditions you'd get with an in-house PBX.
Now why the provider you quoted would prohibit ALL calls originated on the PSTN (vs. just charging for them), I'm not really sure how that would work, unless they expect you to maintain a Key system or PBX or something locally and only use their hosted VOIP to route calls between locations.
If someone calls into your HQ office from a POTS line, and you then route it to one of your branch offices over your provider's VoIP link, you're in breach of your contract, and they're probably in breach of FCC regs, which is why they threaten with the big stick.
I'd add this as a comment but I don't have enough rep yet:
