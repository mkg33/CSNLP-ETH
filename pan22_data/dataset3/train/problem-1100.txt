But as windows 7 uses aero effects and some visual effects, you can try disabling those (remember that this makes your interface not much beautiful as it used to be)
Reinstalling Windows mostly fixes all those problems.
If it doesn't fix your problem, you can use some tuneup softwear like AVG pc Tuneup (I highly recommend it : )
If still you got this problem, you can try reinstalling windows 7 ( because your pc may not support windows 10 ).
All those may be due to accumilated cache, viruses running in background etc etc...
Software recommendations, however, are off-topic for Super User, so which repair tool you could ask about on our sister site, Software Recommendations
