Not what I figured the lambda expression query would look like.
Not too bad, still understandable to my SQL-centric brain.
Here's the LINQ query expression that I came up with, using LINQPad:
Is it possible to write a lambda expression that produces the same output as the original SQL and query expression, but not be needlessly complex?
Basically, just grabbing two fields from a table based on certain criteria (keys match, course ID matches criteria, parent node not equal -1).
I'm still learning the ropes of LINQ (and lambda expressions), but I can't help but feel that the resulting lambda expression here is too complex!
So, I used the lambda tool in LINQPad to see what my LINQ query expression would look like.
But, for grins, I wondered what this query expression would look like as a lambda expression.
I just feel like the lambda expression generated in LINQPad can be written better...
For the sake of knowledge, I wanted to convert a SQL query to a LINQ query expression.
So, I'm studying the output from LINQPad on how my query expression looks as a lambda expression, and I'm wondering if it can be written any better?
For the life of me, I could not figure out the syntax.
Perhaps 'complex' is subjective, since it may only appear complex to my SQL brain.
