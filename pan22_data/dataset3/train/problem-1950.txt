I have used Outlook 2013 until today, when I finally decided to stop using it until they decide to fix all its IMAP problems.
I have therefore reverted to using Thunderbird for now, but there is one thing that I still can't get right.
So, is there a way to force Thunderbird to send emails with a specific font size?
I don't know if you want 11px or 11pt but you can try.
I think that Outlook's default font and font size look perfect (Calibri 11pt), they look good on every email client.
Then i found an extension ExternalTemplateLoader where you can specify a html-file with your font-specifications.
Under Tools/ExternalTemplateLoader options you can specify when (and which) template you want loaded as default.
Unfortunately, Thunderbird only allows to choose between small, medium etc font sizes when sending emails, and it looks like the "medium" setting (which should mean that the font size is actually not set, and will depend on the settings on the person who receives the message), doesn't seem to work as intended, meaning that the receiver sees it with a bigger font size than their default.
My first thought was to use a signature but that a pain because of the extra line before the signature.
