I am on Windows 7 32-bit with 1 GB of RAM (yes, 1 GB)
Turns out that you need to force the page to the proper OS using the platform key in the query string.
When I opened Facebook earlier, I saw that I needed to update my Chrome browser because of security stuff.
Win XP 32 bit or above- advanced chrome 54.15.5320.0     Firefox ESR 52.3.0 , commode ice Drago 52.0.0.4, cyber fox 52.2.1, k-meleon 75.1, sea monkey 2.48,  or check Goanna-based NewMoon, Chromium.
Try running another browser that is still being supported.

browsers, and webkit based non chromium like Midori 0.5.1.1 or presto based Opera 12.18, QT based Double 1.56d, Otter Browser XP.
When I went to the Chrome page, the only Windows installer is a 64-bit one.
32 Bit Browsers are losing support more and more, so its very possible that product is no longer available.
The last Chrome Version for 32 Bit Windows is no longer safe to run.
The enterprise page has 32 bit MSI downloads for the latest version:
Chrome no longer supports 32 Bit operating systems - this is True not only for Windows, but also for OSX and Linux.
And for everyone freaking out bout you running 1GB of ram, its a 32 bit machine, its the same thing as running about 6GB of ram on a 64 bit machine.
Finally, and in all seriousness, take this as a warning, your hardware is getting SERIOUSLY outdated and its way passed time to upgrade to 64 bit hardware.
I know from the Mac side that Google is no longer supporting   32 bit chrome.
