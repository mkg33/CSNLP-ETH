Rightclick drag your My Computer icon on the desktop over to a blank space.Create a shortcut now unpin any Windows Explorer you have from your Taskbar,drag your My Computer shortcut to the Taskbar.Now, if you just click this, you go to Libraries..BUT,if instead you right-click it, you will see the My Computer shortcut select this and it goes to My Computer,and there are never any more "explorer.exe's" hanging around.
I have the same thing happen, but I know it's not a virus.
You haven't actually answered that question for anyone.
Not 100% sure for Win7, but I know in XP that if you set "run folders in separate processes", this will happen, so it is probably similar.
Are you sure you aren't having it open folders in their own process?
IF its not a sign of Virus then edit your shortcut, and take off any arguments to "explorer.exe".
Whatever made you think, given that there's a properties setting explicitly for it in the folder and search options of Explorer folders, that Windows Explorer doesn't use multiple processes?
Whenever I switch from Windows Aero to classic, or the other way around, I get extra explorer processes started.
