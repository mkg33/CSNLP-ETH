If you have access to Unix you can run diff <file1> <file2> or sdiff <file1> <file2>
If the files are not very big try - http://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/svn/trunk/demos/demo_diff.html
If you just want to know if a row is in both tables, use COUNTIF.
(Let me know if you want details on how to do this.)
I personally use WinMerge as it can diff directories.
If you are Windows you can use WinDiff or WinMerge - http://winmerge.org/ .
COUNTIF counts how many times criteria in table1 is found in range table2.
Just my two cents, as nobody mentioned it here so far you could try also Excel Compare by Formula Software (it's paid software but comes with a free trial period).
If the cells would be in the exact same location in each sheet, you can use a third sheet, then fill down and right with this formula:
For example, if your data is in B2 to H500 and the key is the first three columns, create your single-column key in cell A2 with =B2&"-"&C2"-"&D2 and copy it down to the other rows.
There are several formulas you can use in Excel depending on what you want to do.
VLOOKUP looks up the lookup_value table1 in table_array table2 and returns the value in column col_index_num.
The formulas all require a single-column key on both tables that they use to match rows.
You can covert it .csv and there are lots of options
Do this in both tables and now you have a key column to use.
to compare the changes, where "Sheet1" and "Sheet2" are your sheet names.
The main two formulas I would use in Excel are =COUNTIF(range, criteria) and =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, FALSE).
It's not free and it might be overkill for your needs, but Beyond Compare has done a great job of comparing Excel sheets for me.
If you don't want to add anything/or change the existing Excel tables, you can link to them in Access and run a basic query there.
Anyway the best solution, in my opinion, is maybe already stated on your question's comments: export to CSV and then use any diff-tool you like to compare, simple!
You can put your text into the two boxes and run a diff using a proven diff algorithm [Myer's diff]
If you want to see info from table 2 in table 1, use VLOOKUP.
If you have access to TortoiseSVN or TortoiseGit or Eclipse, you can diff those two files and the differences will be done on screen.
For eclipse drag those two files into the gui, select and choose diff
If you don't have a single-column key, then you need to create one.
If the result is greater than zero, then the row is in both tables.
