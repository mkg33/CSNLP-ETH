If Skype doesn’t close gracefully with this (I’ve seen it on some computers), I append ‘ /F’ to the end of the taskkill command to close it forcefully: taskkill.exe /IM skype.exe /T /F
You can just right click the icon in the notification area and click Quit.
/T closes all associated processes skype.exe opened
If you don't have Windows 7, or have chosen to have insecure UAC settings, then it still takes 2 clicks.
In case you get a dialog bog, note that there is a Do not ask me again checkbox.
/IM gracefully closes a process with the “image name” skype.exe
You can disable auto startup for skype to reduce load on system.
Open Run.. and input taskkill /f /im skype.exe or create a shortcut for it!
Currently skype only allows you to kill the task externally.
This is what I used: "C:\Program Files\Skype\Phone\Skype.exe" /shutdown
create a bat shortcut for taskkill /f skype.exe /T /t.
I created an extra shortcut pointing to the skype.exe application and I added the /Shutdown parameter, very easy to close skype using that icon.
You can now add a shortcut for this to taskbar or ad a macro for it.
