You can check the associated KB articles and they will tell you which files will be patched to which versions so you can go compare them to what you have currently (to manually determine if the hotfix needs to be applied).
:)  If they are, perhaps try flushing your Windows Update cache to get WU to re-detect which updates you need.
The installer would be the definitive authority here.
"KB2522890 does not apply, or is blocked by another condition on your computer."
I have already disabled my antivirus and Windows Defender.
Some hotfixes patch the same files as other hotfixes, causing other hotfixes to not apply anymore as their specific fixes were included in the one installed first.
It is possible that Microsoft Update is right that they do not apply, as I only installed VS 2010 C# and Web development.
I have uninstalled VS 2010 and many other apps that I don't use anymore, and reinstalled it after.
I'm now down to 3 updates, of which I am getting the error:
I'm pretty sure Windows Update isn't as accurate as the Installer itself.
If you're not experiencing the specific problems they address, you shouldn't be installing them as they are not considered fully stable by MS.
