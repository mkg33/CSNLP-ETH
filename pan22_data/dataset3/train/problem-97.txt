I have enabled all permissions, my disk is not full and I have the latest version of Java.
Judging by the error message, "Access is denied", I would say that it looks jEdit can't save because the user it's running as doesn't have write access in the target directory.
permission denied.I have the latest version of Jedit 4.3.2 as of 12/12/2010 and I'am running on Windows 7 home basic.
Is there a way to change the directory to something like C:\users\User1.jedit\backups without doing a saveas?
One workaround would definitely be to eiter run jEdit as an admin user, or grant yourself write access to C:\Program Files.
There are some possible problems coming to my mind:
It's believable that it would not have permissions to write to the latter.
However, I would investigate the settings to see if you can change the directory jEdit is using for this rather than changing your system's security settings.
I actually don't want backups for untitled documents to be saved in Program Files.
When trying to edit a python script in Inkscape "texttext.py" I get:  java.io.FileNotFoundException
This could be a bug in jEdit however; looking at both file paths, it looks like it wants to modify the Untitled-1 file in the C:\Program Files\jEdit directory; however, it may actually be trying to edit a file called jEdit#Untitled-1#save# in C:\Program Files.
