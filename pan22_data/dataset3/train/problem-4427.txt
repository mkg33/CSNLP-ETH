This means that if one disk is taking a bit longer for a particular write operation then the entire operation will take longer.
The speedloss is usually insignificant and what you gain from redundancy overcomes it :) Just don't forget real backups too...
And it turned out the the server system we bought had one onboard (ICH10R).
Grigory, RAID 1 can cause some minor performance degradation due the face that most controllers wont consider disk-writes done until both disks are done.
Make sure you invest wisely - not something that brings nothing, Paying pays off here.
Short answer is: You, as a human, won't notice any difference, if on the other hand you'r running a highend server with 1000+ users, then you might notice some minor differences...
My budget is $200 and I am looking at the Adaptec 1405 http://www.adaptec.com/en-US/products/Controllers/Hardware/sas/entry/ASC-1405/.
Recently we bought an intel's SR1690WBR and two HDDs WD1002FBYS.
So now I am asking the question being a system adminstrator at this specific moment :)
Specifically less than 10 persons all are developers and no system administrator.
To answer: Yes, it can, but it would be called either broken hardware or bad drivers.
I understand that we will have fault tolerance with the help of RAID 1 but can I possibly loose any performance in such a configuration?
I think so because I am not a system administrator, I just know more than basics.
So my question is: looking at the price of the RAID controller 1405 and at the price of the HDD doubts crept in me that installing this RAID could degrade our server's performance in some.
So I decided to buy a real hardware RAID controller.
