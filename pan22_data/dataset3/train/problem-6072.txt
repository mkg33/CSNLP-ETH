Following this method requires instance management/config to be fully automated (Chef, Puppet etc.)
I believe the best practice is to create a EC2 key pair per instance.
As suggested by @steenhulthin either create local user accounts per user or use some centralised Athentication and Authorisation.
However a key pair per instance may be difficult to manage, if this is the case find some logical way to group your instances and use a key pair per group.
The instance is inherently not accessible through conventional methods.
In addition you can also maintain a dedicated instance for remote management access (SSH or RDP), only open this up for public access (IP address wise) and restrict SSH and/or RDP on all other instances to the management station.
This is obviously more secure as you have no key to lose/compromised.
Overall how much more secure this makes the instance is up for debate and depends on how your automation is configured.
This is the one I don't have a good answer for at the moment.
Do you need to allow humans to remotely access the instances?
I think it's best to think of the EC2 generated key pair as the master key into the instance and it's optional.
If a key pair get's compromised exposure is limited to just that instance.
What's the best practices for managing your EC2 key pairs?
