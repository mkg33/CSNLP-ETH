The sooner you understand you have a problem the better chance of fixing it without loss.
He posted corrupt databases and various people posted their solutions to fixing them.
Check your IO substructure etc to make sure there isn't a problem there.
Also, and this is important too, if you have a corrupted database it's probably corrupt for a reason.
Not to mention having good, recoverable backups just in case.
And also check the other databases on that instance with CHECKDB to make sure you don't have additional problems.
One or more of them may work for you and let you salvage your database without data loss.
Regardless, if you have the time I would look over the answers given in Steve Stedman's Database Corruption Challenge.
These solutions range from the normal (as above) to some interesting and unusual solutions.
Realizing this situation is long over I'm still going to put in my 2 cents for anyone else finding themselves in a similar situation.
You should be running regular backups, testing them, and running regular CHECKDBs on all databases for situations exactly like this.
