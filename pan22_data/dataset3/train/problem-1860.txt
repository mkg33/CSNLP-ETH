The second problem was on that the files that did copy, I also don't seem to have permission.
I want to copy the entire profile as I have to get rid of the older PC quite soon, and would sort through the files at a later stage.
Which is understandable as they contain information for the different accounts, but I can't seem to take ownership, as I don't even have permission to view the security information.
The first is that the Administrator user does not seem to have access to a user profile.
I had to grant it permission, but there were some folders that I didn't even have permission to edit.
To do this, I setup a DeltaCopy server on my 2008 server, and placed DeltaCopy on the client.
I made sure DeltaCopy has write access to the folder on the server and everything.
I am trying to copy the complete user profile of an old XP pc to a new computer.
How can I resolve both of these issues and successfully transfer a complete user profile to another windows PC?
I also did this to ensure nothing in the profile would be in use.
I set the owner to be Administrator and set the permissions to apply to all child objects, yet it did not seem to help.
I start the XP computer in safe mode with networking to log on as administrator, and then start the DeltaCopy client to copy the user profile.
