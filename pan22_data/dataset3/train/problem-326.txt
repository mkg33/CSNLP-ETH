I was using fiddler to try to work out what URLs powershell was trying to request.
I'm struggling to update the help on a server-core box behind a proxy.
BTW if anyone from Microsoft is monitoring, please can you at least make the update-help -verbose option report the URLs it is trying to request as this made troubleshooting impossible.
We don't have an authenticating proxy but I had a similar problem with update-help.
It seems our gateway may be set up not to allow requests from powershell, but does allow requests from IE.
but it still doesn't work, server-core box bypass the proxy and frames get dropped by the firewall.
I have seen that it was possible to set winhttp proxy with netsh to solve the problem, but powershell update-help clearly don't use winhttp proxy, tested it on my desktop and it just use the proxy set-up in ie.
Problem : there is no ie in server core servers, so...
In our case running fiddler allowed the request from powershell to get through the gateway\proxy.
Not sure how, maybe fiddler changes the user-agent string or something, but might be worth a pop if your network is set up similarly.
