c) Linux/GRUB can boot BIOS way from MBR style disk.
Only rewriting boot manager/loader to UEFI would be enough (after MBR to GPT disk transformation) to boot the OS (Windows or Linux) - no need to reinstall (eventually creating additionally EFI System and MS Reserved partitions on disk if missing after transformation).
Now you can make combinations when dual-booting Windows and Linux.
b) Windows can boot only UEFI way from GPT style disk
If you want to install UEFI way - you boot installation media (DVD/USB) the UEFI way!
There are even disk tools which can transform an MBR styled disk to GPT styled disk keeping current partition contents (e.g.
a) Windows can boot only BIOS way from MBR style disk
(when booting BIOS way from GPT disk Linux/GRUB uses a special separate boot partition).
d) Linux/GRUB can boot either BIOS way or UEFI way from GPT disk
(using MBR record + partition boot record + boot manager on active partition).
Transforming GPT to MBR is not possible in general.
(Obviously this can be done only if UEFI firmware present on computer.)
If you have UEFI firmware it is best to install both Linux and Windows to a GPT disk (disk can be formated/styled to GPT using Linux tools or Windows tools) and boot both systems the UEFI way.
