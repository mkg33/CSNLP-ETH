Extra information: I was suspicious that there might have been a problem with the router assignment of ips in my network but the router is set to automatic dhcp mode.
It was working flawlessly before the videos were added to the upload queue.
By limiting the connection not only are my other devices able to connect to the internet again, but the upload speed of the videos on the PS4 has greatly improved to about what it should be (700-750kpbs on my connection.)
My internet package is only 15/1, so I set the limit for my ps4's mac address to 750kbps.
Whenever the PS4 is running, the uploads progress, albeit slowly (about 0.1 mbps) but I'm not able to play any games on PSN or access the internet.
I logged into my router under the QOS settings and set a limit on the upstream to 75% of my ISP's quoted speed.
From what I've seen with my connection, the PS4 simply bullies your connection past what it can handle.
It seems like the PS4's hogging was also causing some sort of overload effect making it so that even the PS4 was having connection issues.
I will update with whether or not it works correctly once the uploads are finished.
Be aware though, the PS4 hogs every last bit of that 750 kbps, so you might easily still hit problems if you are doing any heavy uploading on another device on your network at the same time.
So I'm having an issue that when my PS4 is up and running, I am unable to access the internet on any of the computers on my home network.
So while mdpc very thoroughly explained why the problem occurred, I thought id share what I had to do to fix it.
This problem just started occuring when I was experimenting with the share functionality and I have 3 videos in the upload queue.
