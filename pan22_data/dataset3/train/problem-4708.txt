If you are running 2008 R2 in he guest, then shrink your partition from within the guest, then compact.
Subsequently I followed these two step using Edit Virtual Hard Wizard on Windows 2012 Box.
Apart from performance issues, this VHD worked fine as guest when hosted on Windows Server 200 R2, Hyper-V.
3) On host use Symantec ghost to do a disk-to-disk copy from large to new.
2) Create a new blank VHD of the size I want the drive to be.
I have deleted most of the junk data from this VHD and now it contains only 20-25 GB.
Does Hyper-V does not provide proper support to handle large VHDs or VHDXs whose size are the range of 200GB.
I can only tell you what I do, though I can only think (hope) that there must be a better solution.
Having done some research, I came to know, this as a limitation of .VHD files.
Using Disk2VHD utility I converted my bare-metal OS into Hyper-V VHD  -
Having realized need to keeping only system files and application installations on VHD.
