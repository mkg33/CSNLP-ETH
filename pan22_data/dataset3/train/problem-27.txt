Make a server component that can live on a host inside the customer's corporate network.
The server would be responsible for connecting with your site and the CE devices would talk to this central server.
Without more detail about what the device needs to do, it's hard to say, past that.
This server will be a central administration host for the CE devices.
Just think about attack surface and the stupidest possible things users may do to violate my network.
Do the same thing that Microsoft did when they came out with WSUS.
You don't want to have any port connectable unless you explicitly need it to function(RDP, vnc, http, etc...).
If you can secure the device from remote exploits in common software (IIS, MSSQL, etc...) you can have your customers run any vulnerability scans they need on the device to ensure its not going to help propagate malware.
Controlling the services that can be connected to your hosts are key.
Given that these devices are at customer premises and need to "phone home" to your website, I'd:
do the CE devices have ports (USB, firewire) - do they NEED them?
