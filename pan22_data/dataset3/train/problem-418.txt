Another option is that the partition(s) exist on the disk and there is no letter assigned to it, in that case follow the instructions to get to the Disk Management tool, right click on the partition and choose Change letter / paths from the menu.
To check that you need to to right click on My computer > Manage > Disk Management
Don't forget to assign it a letter or a mount path.

Its possible that you don't have a partition created on the disk (did you delete all the partitions from the disks when installing Windows7?
You will need to download the latest driver for your SSD :
I've seen this happen on a few occasions after installation, and I have had to format the HDD using another OS.
Your best bet may be to load up a Linux live CD (Ubuntu, Fedora, whatever your flavor), and format the nonexisitng HDD to NTFS using Linux.
I had the same issue while trying to install windows on my ssd, then my samsung didn't show up !
Chose the disk that does not contain any partition and create a new one.
I have just installed windows 7 on my computer and on the install I was able to choose my two hard drives both my samsung and my ssd , I choosed my samsung and it installed without errors.
But now while im on my computer my ssd hard drive isn't showing up in my computer nor can I install or find it anywhere!
Please if you have any answers or have had a equal problem respond to this!
Please download, install, and let me know if this works.
