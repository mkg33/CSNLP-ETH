python -c "import datetime; datetime.datetime.now()" doesn't output anything, so there is nothing to be outputted to the file.
you might need to put the whole python path in e.g.
Make sure the command you run actually outputs something on the command-line.
The pythoncron1.log file is being created but has nothing in it and the file modified date has not bee updated since the file was created.
Just to clarify, do you have any print statements in your python script?
If in fact it isn't what Frenchie said, which it most likely is, it may be helpful to look at that users mail.
Cron mails output from cron jobs to the user account of that crontab.
Also, the /var/log/cron file may include helpful information.
You can use the mail command as that user to check for mail with helpful output.
(You may have guessed, I'm trying to do something a little more complicated than the example above but I've narrowed the problem down to python apparently failing to run when being invoked by cron).
That is why you often see STDOUT and STDERR piped to /dev/null, so they wont be mailed output they don't care about.
I was expecting to see a bunch of lines in the file, one for every minute that the cron job was is run.
