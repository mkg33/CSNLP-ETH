The problem is to install xsane without libsane dependencies.
After that I corrected the code by myself (I looked into the created "difference" file created by the patch command and looked for what I have to edit).
At the end I installed the deb package with dpkg -i, but there doesn't seem to be any executable in /usr/bin or anywhere else, argh.
I had to install the sane drivers with git due to my CanoScan 8800F to recognize the scanner.
Then I found a patch but the patch didn't work either (Hunk #1 failed at ...**).
First of all I downloaded the tar.gz sources (because there was no fitting version 0.996 as deb package).
All I want to do is installing xsane without the dependencies of libsane (because I already have them, but apt doesn't know it).
Secondly I tried to compile but I wasn't able to do a "make" because "SANE_CAP_ALWAYS_SETTABLE" wasn't defined in the code so it lead to a compile error.
Otherwise it would install libsane and overwrite the git compiled sane-drivers.
When I was finished I created a deb package with "checkinstall -D make".
