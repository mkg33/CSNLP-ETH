It's not quite correct to say "by default unison uses rsync to do it's transfer."
You can use findmnt to list the directories that are bind mounts, and then insert the line ignore = Path /path/to/bind/mount in your Unison profile for each bind mount.
Since, as you pointed out, Unison does not understand hard links, I think you're just out of luck there.
I suspect that, using Unison alone, the answer to your question is no.
Although if rsync can do it, then I imagine Unison could do it if someone were to write the feature.
You might be able to use an external program to cleverly ignore bind mounts though.
Unison uses the same underlying algorithm/protocol as rsync, but uses its own implementation; the actual rsync executable is not called, so you can't appeal to features of the rsync executable, and you're not going to be able to solve your problem this way.
In general it's difficult to tell Unison to sync or not sync files/directories with a property that can't be specified with some sort of pattern match on their name, like directories that are bind mounts or hard links in your case.
Also, since it looks like you're considering doing this manually with a script or something, you should be aware of inotify-tools.
