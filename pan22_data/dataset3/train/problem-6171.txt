That said, you may explore the Trackpad preferences pane in System Prefs.
settings -> accessibility -> on the left menu, scroll to mouse/trackpad -> trackpad options -> Enable dragging (without drag lock)
i know this is an old thread, but I may have found an answer for you folks.
The solution could be two-finger clicking, then holding one finger and dragging, but this would break the "Tap to click" option.
Again, its easier to accept the Mac convention and embrace the toolset provided on the platform, rather than trying to bend the conventions until they break by wanting it to behave like Windows.
Sometimes it helps to install the trackpad drivers from the OLDER bootcamp software version.
I have the same problem, and I believe that by definition it isn't possible.
With all that said, I think Apple decided to leave right-drag out of their Windows driver.
Find the boot-camp software for older macs (for instance, the "17' early 2011", can be found here: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1720?locale=en_US but the URL can change, in that case - google for "Boot Camp Download 17 early 2011") and install the trackpad drivers only.
It is in your best interest to leave the shackles of your old platform behind you and embrace the "new" way.
According to what Darth says, it sounds like he's doing a 3-finger drag.
Then you start dragging those two fingers - but your fingers aren't moving exactly in the same direction, therefore the trackpad doesn't know which one to follow.
If you keep looking for ways to get OS X to behave like Windows, and remain in your Windows Comfort Zone, you will never be happy with OS X, and/or you'll end up going back to Windows, effectively "wasting" your money as so many anti-Mac pundits claim.
You initiate a right-click by tapping with two fingers.
There are options in there for multi-finger drags, selects, etc.
