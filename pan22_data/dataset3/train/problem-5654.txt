I was looking at this one earlier today, again though, I don't really know much about them to know if it's any good.
If I could get something in the $50/60 range that would be great, I've seen a bunch but I don't know if they're good quality even if the specs seem okay.
You should be able to find something for $30 range or less really.
If spending a little more would be advisable that's alright too.
Here's the information about my current hardware: http://imgur.com/a/mcTdC#1
I'm not looking for anything fancy, just something that allows me to watch videos on my new screen how they're meant to be viewed.
will it need the audio component of the HDMI connector?)
It just seemed to have decent reviews: http://www.ebay.com/itm/DIAMOND-AMD-Radeon-HD-6670-PCIE-2GB-GDDR3-Video-Graphics-Card-/321070374078?pt=PCC_Video_TV_Cards&hash=item4ac1491cbe
This is the new screen: http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/UM.HT2AA.001
I'm getting a new monitor that has HDMI input and I'd like my computer to be able to get the most out of it.
In fact, what outputs does your GeForce 6500 have?
So I'm in the process of trying to choose a new graphics card.
Any graphics card that supports PCIE 1.0 will do the job.
