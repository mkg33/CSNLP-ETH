But even OSI might not be detailed enough for every purpose.
The layering models provide a structure to build the protocols on.
My question is does OSI model use the same TCP and IP protocols which are used by TCP/IP model, or does it have its own protocols for that specific functions?
The DoD model pretty much throws together everything above the transport layer (=application layer) and everything below the network layer (=link layer) which may be a practical approach when concentrating on the network layer but it lacks coverage above and below when doing more complex designs.
OSI is known for using hundreds of protocols to do its job.
The OSI model is a very detailed and strict model.
However, IEEE 802.3 defines up to four sublayers for the physical layer and up to three sublayers for the data link layer.
It was developed as a theoretical model (somewhat) in parallel to the growing TCP/IP or DoD model which largely came out of practice.
Both OSI and TCP/IP have Transport and Network(Internet) layers where TCP and IP protocols work respectively.
OSI is good way to structure a protocol concept as long as you don't stick to it literally.
For example, Ethernet generally covers OSI's physical layer and data link layer.
It is clear that TCP/IP model uses both TCP and IP protocols.
