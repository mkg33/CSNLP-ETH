The subversion 1.4.0 tar file includes spec files for building RPM's under RHEL3/4 as well.
If you really need and rpm for later package management ease, I would try getting this source rpm svn 1.4.0 sources for SuSE 10.2, install that, cd to /usr/src//SPECS then
The OpenSuse project provides a build service that can help you easily package RPM's for not only OpenSuse/SLES, but Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu and Mandriva.
The easiest method would be to find a source rpm for a similar distribution.
Creating an RPM from scratch is probably more work than you'll want to do and more involved than can be described here.
I believe there is a script called rpmbuild which will do most of the work for you.
You should then be able to rebuild on your distribution.
But, I agree with the previous answer, if there's no really overriding need for the RPM, just do the standard "configure && make && make install".
I personally would prefer to just get the source from http://subversion.tigris.org and do the usual "configure && make && make check && sudo make install" dance.
You should be able to use those for creating the RPM.
