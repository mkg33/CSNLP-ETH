I have a NAS serving as DLNA server, now sometimes, laid back as I as I am, I'd like playing a movie on my Linux Desktop and control it via DLNA App from my phone.
There are free alternatives but this one is more feature packed.
Mind: I'm not looking into installing a "media center" operating system, just the single program to be used once in a while.
Control VLC direct from your phone, Its much quicker
I tried the app with different TVs where it worked.
I tried VLC and other media players but none of them showed up as renderer in my phone.
Even though you mentioned that you don't want to install a media center operating system, you can simply install XBMC as a simple application (which is what I do at home) on your desktop.
If you use a Debian-based operating system, then you will find XBMC already and conveniently packaged on the repositories.
It features (among other things, like consuming things via NFS, or SMB from your NAS), a DLNA Renderer that is as simple to use as the other sources of media.
