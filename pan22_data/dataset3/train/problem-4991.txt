So you'll need to log into your ISP account via the ISP's main webpage and check to see if there is an option to unblock all/various ports.
If you are on a home network, chances are this is a violation of your ISP's terms of service.
You will have to work with them, or find an alternate ISP.
If you don't see the connection attempt then your ISP has changed something to block incoming traffic.
Perhaps, after a year, they finally realized you were doing it and blocked the port?
Generally, if an ISP is blocking ports, they give the user the option to unblock those ports .. but u generally need to opt in to unblock <-- their perspective is better safe than sorry.
the reason is that 99% of home (non-business) people don't need to have a mail server setup at home OR a web server ... while a number of evil trojan's/virus's actually end up using these ports to do their nefarious activities.
Since this is on your home network you are probably violating the terms of use by running a web site.
Off the top of my head, I would suspect that your ISP has started filtering out incoming traffic.
Since this is your home network why not just connection a computer running wireshark directly to the modem and have someone attempt an incoming connection.
Even more important .. is that in the olden days, some home computers actually had one or both services installed and activated by default .. so this became an easy point of intrusion for hackers, taking advantage or bugs in those services ... while their owner had no idea that those services were running on their own computers (which means it's not required .. yet still a security risk).
Perhaps they have started using some NAT because they don't want to get additional IP addresses.
