Personally I'd look at upgrading your disks to faster drives (like 15,000 RPM) and using RAID to stripe them, software or hardware RAID (not on mobo) or using the SSD route, as those can be blazing fast but burn your wallet as well.
Otherwise you could look at running a 64 bit OS and getting enough RAM to create a several-gig RAM disk to achieve what you're looking at doing.
You might be better off, depending on budget, at looked at installing an SSD drive to use for temp files/swap or look at getting a couple of hard disks and striping data read/writes.
This sounds a bit on the complicated side to achieve.
It might yield some funny numbers in performance if it did work.
Haven't heard of people doing it but this would be the approach I'd research first.
You're asking if you can create a ramdrive to cache some temp files and another partition of disk space for your big temp files and automatically mix and match between the two as necessary?
I suppose you could try using software RAID with two drives, one physical partition and one being entirely in memory, to create a JBOD (just a bunch of disks); you could be asking for issues with that though since the one disk isn't real.
