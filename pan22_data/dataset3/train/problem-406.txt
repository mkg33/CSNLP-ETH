It'll give you a 40 character number (in hexadecimal) that is nearly guaranteed to be unique from ANY other input.
You need to test your problem on the default Windows Explorer first.
Is he putting new files there via a manual file copy, or is he running any folder sync tools to keep the external drive up to date?
If so, yep you have an issue that needs addressed.
Using sha1sum (or similar,like MD5) is the way to go and is vastly better than going by dates because dates can maliciously be manipulated, but sha1sum will give you the same answer no matter the file system attributes.
In addition to the other suggestions, I would ask how your boss is copying the files to the external drive.
Process Monitor can indicate unwanted modifications to files.
Anyway, to try to debug this issue, when you modify the file, does the accessed date change?
First of all, if you are a 'programming shop', you should most definitely have version control.
Directory Opus has options that specifically cover this.
FIRST OFF: Get _for_free_ Perforce, the code management system.
You can trust it because, after all, this is it's intended purpose!
If the boss makes it your problem, then make it YOUR solution!
If not, it's a problem with 'Directory Opus 9', which honestly I've never heard of so I couldn't help there.
If he is using any additional tools (such as Sync Toy) to do this, that may be the reason for updated date/time stamps.
When combined with size in bytes, the odds of two files having the same hash value (sha1sum is a hash generating program) but containing different content "approaches zero."
A single bit change will change the number dramatically!
Sha1sum is how linux people (and other smart groups) verify distribution of media has not been tampered with.
On its menu: Settings > Preferences > File Operations > Copying Files > Preserve the timestamps of copied files.
