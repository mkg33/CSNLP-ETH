If you need specific features, I'd mention them in your question.
SQL Plus is a dinosaur but faily solid as a script executer but not really good for PL/SQL.
Other than that, we've been happy with it, and it has a nice DDL exporting feature and Diff tool.
The tool that comes with Oracle, Enterprise Manager, is a good approach but doesn't give you the same type of visual cueing.
It has just about everything in it including debugging and is a free add-on for visual studio.
One thing I really like about it is how it handle reference cursors.
I agree Oracle SQLDEveloper is pretty good and a great price.
They also have a freeware version, with some limitations.
For some reason it is the best tool I have found for testing my reference cursors.
Oracle Sql Developer has one really cool plugin from FourthElephant called Insider.
One really odd alternative for you developers reading this are the oracle tools for visual studio.
If your'e doing basic sysadmin queries, just use the standard Oracle SQL*Plus client that comes with a standard install.
If you are a developer that loves visual studio but is also trying to manage a test database this is a powerful tool.
