So most "official" clients don't offer an option like this.
The qbittorrent client has the option to download files in sequential order, at least the Linux version does.
Almost every bittorrent client has built-in prioritization of files.
I'd like to tell the BT client to download first pieces of the file first, so I can start watching it, like I could if I were downloading it over HTTP in one piece.
Do you know if there is a client that allows me to set up priorities inside the single file?
I don't think this is a solution for what you want, doing what you want would defeat the performance of bittorent.
The protocol relies on file pieces being evenly available.
For example, you're downloading an independent free movie, but you have a slow connection.
(Attempts to download the very beginning and very end of a file first.
If there isn't any, I'll probably have to hack the source code to make this possible.
Azureus v2.5.0.4 has an option in settings (Transfer section) to prioritize the first and last pieces of file(s).
It kind of defeats BitTorrent's design of distributing the rarest pieces first, but with tens/hundreds of seeders, it won't make a difference to me.
I think your best bet is to hack on one of the open source clients around.
Bittorrent protocol allows this, because my client is asking other clients for specific (although random) pieces.
It's also available for Windows and Mac though I haven't used those versions.
There is a (kinda hacked) Azureus/Vuze version around that does exactly this for exactly this purpose.
However, this approach will cripple the torrent-swarm if a lot of users would do it.
