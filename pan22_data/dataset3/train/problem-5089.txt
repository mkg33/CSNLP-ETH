If you want to do this, you need to use SLI, which requires:
Then I went into the nVidia control panel and put all my PhysX (3D rendering, etc.)
If your monitor accepts multiple inputs, I'd take advantage of that, rather than use the KVM.
Most KVMs I'm aware of seriously hurt video bandwidth (make the image fuzzier / less sharp), which would be kind of a waste w/r/t the fancy video cards.
You DO NOT need a KVM, the others are right, it will make your screen blurry and it's an overall bad idea.
I have a nVidia 560Ti and a Quadro 4600, obviously I can't run SLI, BUT, I set it up where my 560 is on PCIe 1 and the Quadro is on PCIe 2.
What you're doing by this is effectively purchasing two cars, a fast car and a slow car.
Thought I like the idea of using it for PhysX as said below, you would still rely on the 560 for graphics...
But why you would want to have multiple graphics cards connected to a single monitor via a KVM is beyond me, because you won't get any additional productivity.
Sure, SLI would be nice, but if the two graphics cards have a distinct enough purpose / function, I see no issues with using both, one at a time.
I think the limiting factor (and the reason I think this is a bad plan) is the use of a KVM.
It is possible but in practical terms only if the two video cards use the same video driver, that is, you cannot mix ATI/AMD video cards and Nvidia video cards in the same machine.
You can EITHER use the fast car, OR you can use the slow car, but you can't use them both at the same time to make one really fast car.
Seeing that a 560 ti is 5 Generations newer than a Quadro FX 580 (GeForce 9 series family) I would just upgrade to the 560 and dump the Quadro card, any optimizations to the BIOS / drivers on the Quadro 580 can be overcome by other advancements in the family.
