With a GPS ntp server you'll be getting a stratum 0 clock source.
in general you want to make sure your systems are in sync with each other.
It gives you a Stratum 0 NTP server, under your control.
At my old job we used GPS for timing a lot of different equipment.
The only time I've been involved in using a GPS ntp box (for a PKI system), we never actually used them.
So syncing all your servers against a pair of internal ntp boxes that sync against external lower stratum ntp servers is usually sufficient.
It's been around 10 years since I last had one of those (that I know of) in my network, but at that point, we didn't have a good antenna position and while it mostly saw a GPS signal, it did occasionally lose the signal, requiring a reset of the receiver equipment.
There are very few circumstances that require this level of accuracy.
You can then configure a few machines as Stratum 1 servers, syncing from your GPS-clocked server and have slightly less traffic needing to leave your network.
Using GPS practically eliminates network-factors in the accuracy.
We use them because of their "deadman's" feature (won't correct more than a few seconds so that if something goes wrong your whole infrastructure does not move 12 hours into the past) and security; NTP is totally insecure; spoofing, man-in-the-middle, etc.
With a better antenna placement, that would most probably not have occured.
each piece of equipment had their own GPS receiver, which allowed perfect sync where latency was not an issue.
I can say that I've seen GPS time sources used on multiplexers, and certain types of crypto ... it was used for NTP, just because it was already there.
We couldn't get permission to mount the antenna on the roof of the datacentre and get the cabling back to the ntp box.
The advantage for using a local GPS NTP server would be
