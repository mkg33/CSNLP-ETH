I am thinking about disk IDs, signatures or anything like this that the new OS might add to the disk ...
I know that the drives have some UIDs but I am not sure if those are changed if you move/mount the drive under a new system
-old RAID volume will have OS and GRUB but I will not use it to boot from it unless the new drive dies.
Next I wanted to test something and I added a new drive to the system which showed as sdd when all 4 disks where present
In such event I will simply change the BIOS settings and instruct the PC to boot from RAID
I know that Windows used to sign the disks but not sure how that works in Linux.
Since my tests were OK I would like to now bring back to life the old RAID volume and use it just for storage and eventually a backup if the new drive ever dies.
-if I mount the RAID in the new OS will that add any info the the RAID that will make it unusable if I ever need to go back to the old config?
Initially I had the system running with the OS and GRUB installed on the RAID volume (3 disks).
To avoid any problems I disconnected the power from the RAID drives and I installed Ubuntu on the new drive (now sda).
