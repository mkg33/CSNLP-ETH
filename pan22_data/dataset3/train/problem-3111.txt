There are different LCD technologies, and the cheapest don't have very good vertical viewing angles.
It's the same for me when doing it at my university's monitors and probably something you can't get away with when dealing with TN panels.
When you rotate the display, those vertical viewing angles become horizontal viewing angles.
I'm not aware of any LCD panels that are made with vertical subpixels.
You might be able to configure ClearType to lessen this problem.
However, when I do this, there is a significant drop in display quality.
One of the features it has is that it lets the user physically rotate the display 90 degrees so that the monitor is in portrait mode, which would be useful for looking at long documents.
It might be due to the TN panel in the monitor which leads to bad angles, so when you tilt it you get it horizontally instead of vertically which might be more unusual for your eyes then the bleeding and color-distortion you get when looking at it the normal way.
First, the arrangement of subpixels - Microsoft's ClearType is optimized for horizontal arrangement of subpixels.
