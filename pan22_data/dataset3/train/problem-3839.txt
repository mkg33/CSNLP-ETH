So for now it seems it is not the problem with privileges, or lack of password or anything like this, but no recognizing the user which was given at command line -- mysql appends @ at the end and this seems to be the problem (at least for my eye).
So finally I turned authentication off, connected to console and executed this:
Simply include the '-p' on the second command, and input the password when asked for it.
On a similar fashion, you can enable MySql DB access from some other hostname/IP address or any location by changing 'username'@'localhost' to: 'username'@'someFQDN', 'username'@'IP_address', 'username'@'%'.
Once you have created mysql root password, you should be able to access MySql using:
I tried resetting the password with mysql authentication, also I tried /usr/bin/mysql_upgrade -u root -p -- still the error while trying to launch mysql console as root.
Or easier yet, just use the mysql_secure_installation command, as it takes care of it plus some other useful stuff.
The reason you get the error message on the second mysqladmin command is because you don't authenticate with the server using the password you set in the first command.
Everything went fine and my password was recognized.
I re-executed the first one (for checking) -- error as above.
Where you will be prompted to enter MySql root password.
The question is: how to make MySQL recognize the given user?
indicates that you probably did not use -p option in mysql command.
For additional information I'd recommend: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/adding-users.html.
If you want to enable access from some other location (different from the localhost) you can grant privileges using SQL GRANT commands similar to this:
I just installed MySQL 5.5 and right after install I was asked to set root password by executing those two commands:
So I executed the first two commands again -- and error again.
