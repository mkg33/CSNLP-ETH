The contacts for the actual meeting have skype for business.
I've just tried to set up a video conference call using skype for mac.
So for example if a user is using SfB but a federation with SfC isn´t allowed then this user couldn´t perform VOIP or chats with SfC.
When it came to the real conference, I was not able to combine the different contacts into a single call.
Before the meeting, I skyped in a number of my skype contacts and had a 4-way video call with no problems.
The best way would be to check this kind of issue with the SfB administrator as your options on SfC are limited.
Keep noted that Skype for business (SfB) and Skype for Consumer (SfC) are two different products which only share the name.
Are there compatibility issues that mean skype users cannot conference call skype-for-business users?
I could call one contact, but then the "Add other contacts to this call" option was not available.
So a SfB administrator has a wide range of options to control what his users are able to perform.
For example he could enable or disable a federation with SfC.
