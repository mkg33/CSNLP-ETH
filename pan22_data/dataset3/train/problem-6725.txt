If you want to create a massive planet to be ultra realistic and have everything on it loaded at all times, I doubt there is any machine capable at running something like that with more than 1 frame a second.
Floating points become less accurate the bigger they become, so it's always a bad idea if they are too big.
These are just examples of how you can approach problems like these.
The right way to do it, is to create the "illusion" that everything is there.
Simple, while you approach the planet, for each unit that you travel, the planet moves half as much away from you, but becomes bigger 3 times as much (example numbers).
If you have to scale something to 1.400.000, then you are doing something wrong.
Sure, instead of a sprite (or model) being millions of units away and millions of times scaled so that it covers half of the sky, make the planet be only 200-300 units away, so that it's closer, and scale it only 100 times, because it's already bigger.
This would give the illusion that the planet is massive, and everyone knows planets are far away, so I doubt anyone will notice anything wrong with it.
This would make your player keep approaching the planet, and the planet will slowly get bigger, but it will look like you are just getting closer to it.
