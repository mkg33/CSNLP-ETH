This tool can take entire schemas including users and migrate them from  MS Sql to Oracle.
You can try dbForge Studio for SQL Server and Oracle for this purpose.

For that I need to get the data from dozens of tables as unicode CSV or TXT files, with fields separated by "|".
The bad thing is the default export master of MS SQL Server can export only single table at a time, and it takes a considerable time to configure export options for each table.
If you have access to SQL Management Studio (I believe even the free express version has the feature as well), you can right click on the data base and choose Tasks -> Export Data.
I have used it heaps of times and it is excellent.
There is a tool called Oracle Migration Workbench that you can get from Oracle that is designed for exactly what you want.
Do you know the way how to export ALL the tables into csv or txt from SQL server?
Start page, Menu "Database", then Export Data, next choose "CSV" in the wizard and other options for your database.
As your destination, select the 'Flat File' destination and you can tweak the format (Fixed width, csv, etc).
I started to export them manually but I got an attack of nerves at the 10th table.
I have to migrate from MS SQL Server and now creating a new ORACLE database with the data partially got from my old tables.
