File level encryption (EFS) does not work with SQL Server.
TDE is apparently not an option, but I don't know what else is available.
You've always got the option of doing full disk encryption with something like Truecrypt, but you'll have to look at how this affects your server performance.
More precisly, it works with abismall performance.
Other solutions include encrypting the data in the applicaiton or using the SQL Server cryptographic API (EncryptByKey).
But these all require you to design the application specifically for using the cryptographi API (ie.
Bu again, the most important decision to make is to clearly state the threat you're trying mitigate.
A solution like TDE will protect the media (the database files) including backups, and including workload spills in tempdb.
These are the only options that work out-of-the box for any application.
A disk encryption system, like BitLocker, will encrypt the entire disk in a very eficient fashion but it only protects against physical loss of the hardware or accidental loss of the harddrive.
The options and solutions vary vastly with the threat being mitigated.
