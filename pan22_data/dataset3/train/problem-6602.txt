You should be fine running them from the same folder, I've done that before without issues in IIS.
Both domains are hosted on the same server, which runs Windows Server 2003 and IIS6.
Seems like that can become a maintenance headache.
Might be a lot cleaner to divide it up between multiple sites.
However, I was wondering whether having two domains/sites sharing the same folder for an ASP.Net application might be causing this intermittent error.
Depending on your scnenario you might be in your situtation because you require wirting of files from one site, and reading from another.
I have two different domain names that resolve to the same ASP.Net site.
The sites are differentiated in IIS Manager using host headers.
I am occasionally experiencing an ASP.Net error that says "The state information is invalid for this page and might be corrupted."
Have your ASP.net Page show different content based on the URL.
I'm the site developer so I've addressed all the relevant code-related causes for this issue.
Should I make separate, duplicate folders for each of the domains?
In that case i find its best to have an uploads directory with Iuser permissions to write to and read from as a virtual directory.
I'm not sure if it's "bad practice" or not but it works.
if you must use the same folder for multiple sites, then the correct approach is:
However, both of the sites point to the same folder on the local drive for the site's page files.
