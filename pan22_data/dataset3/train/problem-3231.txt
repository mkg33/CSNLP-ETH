Furthermore, if someone where to  take the external while it was mounted, would the data be encrypted?
I have a Luks encrypted external hard drive that I have setup to auto-mount and auto-unmount after rsync.
Linux has a concept of block devices which can be either physical disks, partitions or virtual structures.
I have the system put the encrypted file to be mounted under
This means that if the LUKS key has been loaded into memory and LUKS has unlocked the drive it can be read in it's unencrypted state even if it's not mounted.
When you use Like, it takes a block device, adds an abstraction/control layer and presents another block device which is unencrypted.
Your question is difficult to answer as posted - it's worthwhile understanding the concepts which, once understood, will provide the knowledge you are after.
( This is useful and necessary, as it allows you to use your preferred filesystem type on it, or even LVS to provide multiple volumes and other functionality - because all LUKS is doing is taking a block device input and creating a block device output).
Further - and this is important - drivers can be used to create layers / abstractions of underlying devices - and this is key to how LUKS works.
Anyway, im not sure what you would call the state that it is in where it is under the /dev/mapper/ folder but, my question is, while it is in that folder and not yet mounted, is it un-encrypted?
This also means that if the USB drive is removed - even while in use - its still encrypted (and unusable without the key) as the key and translation is in memory on the PC, not the disk.
