This so-called convenience is claimed to provide the most security.
As TomTom said, yes security has changed a lot from what it was in IIS 6.0.
Below is part from the Web site link and from the help available in IIS 7.
Just wondering if everyone else leaves the permissions as they are?
I suggest y oureally read up on the permission handling in IIS 7 - it is TOTALLY different from the one you know.
Anyway, who doesn't want IIS_IUSRS permissions if the account is running as an Application Pool Identity.
So, it could be said no matter which account we use as a Application Pool Identity, this account will be given the IIS_IUSRS group permission at runtime dynamically and implicitly.
On my last server (Win2003) I only gave 'read' permissions to users on the wwwroot and then manually added the write / execute permissions on folders as needed.
I am setting up a web server and notice out the box it gives IIS_IUSRS read & execute (and as a result list folder contents) permissions on the wwwroot.
The article gives good in-depth on the User and Group level changes that has happened in IIS 7.0.
You can go through the article http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/140/understanding-the-built-in-user-and-group-accounts-in-iis-70/.
* One application pool fo revery website, runing under the user identity
I'm trying to make sure its secure as possible, and just wondering if its ok to leave that?
