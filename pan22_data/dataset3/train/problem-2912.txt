Items to a file and then compare it later to see if the object had increased.
However we did have some success on using get-mailbox statistics in the exchange management shell on 2007.
You don't mention what cersion of Exchange you're running but this is not possible with Exchange 2003 as far as I know.

I don't know why, probably because it is a kind of system message.
Had a look at something like this for conflicts I interest email boxes.
If you want details on how that could work, let me know here, otherwise I won't waste paragraphs explaining the idea and clunky setup.
Assuming you allow Activesync you could use OWA to setup text notifications, albeit per user.
Downside was mainly it never seemed like an elegant solution and for a high volume mail server it would be very unsuitable.
Weird setup but a few ideas come to mind (and yeah I know it's an old question):
But... it seems that it does not work with these kind of message.
Was never able to find a suitable transport rule that would work.
The rule works well with a regular email but when i try with a voicemail message the rule does not apply.
As I say clunky but if you only had a few mailboxes on the server it may suffice.
Don't have the exact script to hand but it would right the value for
The only other idea I came up with was clunky and would require at least allowing outbound mail to a single external pop3 account that would then interact with a public folder on Exchange.
