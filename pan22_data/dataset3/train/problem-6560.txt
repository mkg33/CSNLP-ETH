Disable Win+X Shortcut Keys on Windows 7 or Vista.
Pressing the Capslock and the Esc keys at the same time brings up a window that allows you to Exit the Narrator.
For example, if you want to disable Win + R, Win + D and Win + Home then the value of "DisabledHotKeys" should be "RD$".
In our case it's a 0D in hex or 13 in dec or "carriage return" symbol.
I realize win8 has good support for snapping windows around, but I like this shortcut to do it because that's what I'm used to and it has the nice side effect of preventing narrator from starting.
Win key shouldn't be specified here because it's implied.
You could use AutoHotkey to disable the Win + Enter key combination with the following script :
As you can see, it creates a registry field "DisabledHotKeys", with a value of a key we want to disable.
I have not tried it personally but here's what I found.
("$" symbol has an ascii-code equals to a keycode of Home button)
I installed a simple little script program that allows you to snap windows to the edges of screens or to other monitors.
Now you should be able to change the permissions of the file, this is where we remove all the permissions from your user and the user back to system, this way your user will not be able to start the Narrator.
With AutoHotkey you could also map this key combination to any other key combination or action.
I just set windowpad to run on startup so it's always active.
There is a way to disable shortcuts which start with Win in a windows registry.
You can also do more advanced window placement, but I find I just throw things back and forth to other monitors.
By default, I think - I've had this program running for a long while on windows, it takes over the same shortcut key.
If you wish to disable the  Win key itself, see this registry hack :
I installed it on my win8 machine and it seems to have done the trick and taken over the same shortcut used by narrator.
