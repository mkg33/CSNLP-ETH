The machine has only 160MB of memory (all I could find - 32MB onboard, + 2 x 64MB expansions), so it's paging like mad during normal use.
I'm wondering if there's a way to achieve something like Vista's ReadyBoost on this laptop to improve it's performance.
I have a reasonably recent PC(MCIA) Card for reading flash memory, and a 256MB Memory Stick Pro that suits, but this does't show up as a volume when I insert it.
I'm using a 3Com PC Card for networking, so I know the PCMCIA subsystem is up and running.
(I've spent several evenings with Professor Google trying to solve this, but to to avail).
XFCE has gotten bulkier and bulkier over time and isn't the best choice for ultra-lightweight systems anymore unfortunately.
A small USB Key I plugged in worked fine for transferring files, so I figure hotplug support is working too.
Not an answer to your question, as it has already been answered.
But try replacing xfce with something lighter like fluxbox.
I'm setting up an old Thinkpad 600e laptop using Xubuntu.
You can simply create and activate a swap partition on the flash drive, but keep in mind that if you do this, your computer will crash if the flash drive is unplugged.
