This is not likely to be related to the presence, or absence of the vmware tools, or bugs within the vmware tools.
They are probably not routing for the 10.x.x.x subnet or they have ACL's in place that are preventing it.
Your computers, both host and guest, are on a different subnet to the rest of the network.
It looks like a load of bull to me, if you refer to the documentation of vmware tools you will see that it says it solves issues as:
If you cannot see the rest of the network then there is a switch configuration issue (whether routing at the IP layer or configuration of the switches to prevent your computers talking to the rest of the network).
There is a difference between not showing the right speed and not working at all.
It is definitively a problem with 192.168.2.1 router.
The important thing to remember about virtualisation when solving problems like this is that nothing magical happens to your network, good or bad, just because someone took a network diagram and said "by the way, these hosts are now virtual".
