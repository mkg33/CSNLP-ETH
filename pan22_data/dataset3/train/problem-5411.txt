FWIW, I would consider programming on Xbox 360 in C#/XNA to be a very good substitute for "the real deal".
We want to chat about this little interesting thing you have done.
The wonderful thing about XNA is that it allows you to focus less on the technical issues of getting something on the screen, and more on making your game.
Depends what path you are going down, frankly most people don't expect specific platform skills in a junior.
If you do choose to go with the console option, a video is a nice demo instead.
But nothing beats looking at your live code running.
Read interesting white papers and try new stuff out.
KEY FACT: Your demo's should run on a wide range of machines, include a video recording as a back-up.
If you do something interesting that makes the programmers go OOOoo we will WANT to talk to you.
If your a technical programmer make a load of tech demos.
Do try and run your code on several machines to make sure you're allowing for different video cards etc.
These days that's mostly automatic, but some differences can still occur.
), that is relatively bug-free and runs at a decent frame rate -- especially in the limited environment that XNA affords -- will give you a lot of experience, a demo that you can demonstrate, and hopefully, a foot in the door.
It's the easiest demo for us to run as we have PCs with Windows already most likely.
