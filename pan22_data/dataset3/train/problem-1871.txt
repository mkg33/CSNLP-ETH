You can read a lot about this in detail, for example, here
Also, there is fragmentation happening at Layer 3(Network)..
It is segmentation (right name for this process), not fragmentation.
IP fragmentation is not based on TCP at all, it based on MTU of the interface and can be used for TCP/UDP/ICMP whatever.
I just curiously wanted to know about the question regarding L4, L3 Data Chunks, IP Fragmentation :
MSS is based on MTU right now just to avoid IP fragmentation.
TCP segmentation process is based on MSS (maximum segment size, that is based on the MTU (usually) and can be different for both sides of communication).
"If data chunking is happening or not, there will be a sequence number for each TCP segment" is not right sentence - if you see sequence number, it is segmentation process.
It begins anytime you start send data via TCP sessions, and it does not matter, either application use data portion more than MSS or not - you can see sequence and it is TCP segments.
According to Wikipedia, data chunk happens at L4: "Transmission Control Protocol accepts data from a data stream, divides it into chunks, and adds a TCP header creating a TCP segment"

Full IP packet is recreated based on the IP flags (more fragments, offset value).
