Some APs may have the ability to apply access lists on the same flat network, but typically to have one AP's segment protected from another, VLANs are the way to go.
Since your switch appears to be a managed switch, you should have some VLAN functionality.
You're in luck, because google says that your switch supports static routing as well.
That device will also need routes back to the switch for each VLAN's subnet, so it knows where to return packets.
Essentially what you want to do, is assign each AP connected switch port to a different VLAN, assign the switch an IP in each VLAN, configure the devices in each VLAN to use the switch's IP as their default gateway, and finally configure the switch's default gateway to be your internet firewall or router.
Once you do all that, it should just be a matter of applying some access rules on the switch to tell it what IPs can go to what destinations, and Bob's your uncle.
Now when you introduce VLANs, you're spitting your network up into segments, and in order to get from one segment to another you'll need to pass through a router.
