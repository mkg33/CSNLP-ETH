If I selected an entire row and tried to apply to paragraph, it did nothing.
My solution was to import styles from another document.
For me, if I clicked "apply to text" then it only changed the actual text background but still left white space everywhere else within the cell.
Also, I had to select each cell individually in order for this to work.
then you can change text background colour - then go borders and shading and chose cell - then you can chose same colour from there - took me two hours of googling and trial and error before I luckily hit the right options
I have found that when the No Color options do not work, I choose the Clear Formatting icon in the Font section (AB Eraser icon).
Highlight the text - right click - go to border and shading - apply to text - chose colour - if you don't highlight the text the text option won't come up.
It removes the color and the formatting, but the formatting is much easier to fix!
The style used by the table had been deleted, causing my problem.
So I had to go to "apply to paragraph" to get it to apply to the entire cell.
