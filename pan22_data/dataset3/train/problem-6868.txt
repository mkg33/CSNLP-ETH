This is probably a trivia question or a chance to educate me on something I know nothing about.
As far as I can tell these are factory molded/crimped.
I have one of those cables.. it's a normal, Cat5 cable, based on it's ratings ON the cover and when plugged into a "cable-wiring" tester, it shows all 8 pins wired as a normal Cat5 cable... 1-8... you can use it for anything..
Maybe it's a luxury but given how cheap most cables are these days I have a rule;
On one end is a white snag free hood and what looks like aluminum shielding.
Considering what VINA technologies does/makes, it could be a proprietary cable to connect hardware, sounds like a T1 cable.
If so just compare the order of the pairs in the ends, sounds like it could be a crossover cable but more than likely it's just an overly expensive cat 5 cable.

I have a VINA technologies cable here part # 730-202717-00
The shield really only needs to be earthed at one end, not both.
On the other end is a black snag free hood and what looks like a normal unshielded RJ-45.
Is this just a normal CAT 5 cable or is there something special about this cable I'd be curious to know before I toss it in the trash?
