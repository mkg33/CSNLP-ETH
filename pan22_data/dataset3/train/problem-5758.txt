Its a life, a lot of examples around, are you 100% guarantee your friend will be "your friend" for all entire life?
I do advise you to protect your info with something like that

Making a USB stick read only is done at the controller firmware level.
So As I understand, you want to provide your friend hole drive but your friend need part of them?
Nothing personal, But just want prevent wrong steps...
SELECT DISK 1 (It should be disk 1 if you have single hardisk attached to computer, disks naming starts from 0 but partition starts from 1)
From what I know, there is no USB hard drive which has the feature for read-only at the firmware/controller level.
Like Jason said above, Nexcopy has the ability to make read-only USB sticks, but not USB hard drives.
Or you want to provide disk  "with many important files" to your friend to get him/her access to hole 1.5 Tb content?
LIST DISK (To check which flash drive listed as disk in windows)
I'd advise you to make backup of your files, so that if something happens to data on your drive you'll always have a copy.
I think that you cannot ensure that your data will be only read, when you have to give disk to someone.
