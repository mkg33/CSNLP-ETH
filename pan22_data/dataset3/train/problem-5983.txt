I've never managed to get Java applets working with a 64-bit browser...
If you were installing from scratch, I'd recommend 64 bit for your workload, but if you've got a working solution in place, I don't think it's worth changing it.
The one area this is not necessarily true is for compiled commercial apps (doesn't sound like an issue for your workload).
Keep in mind there are a few closed-source plugins that don't play very nice with 64-bit.
As mentioned by others, 64bit OS allows for more RAM access than even 32bit with PAE enabled, although PAE enabled OS can general access a lot of RAM.
Even with 64bit Ubuntu, my system still can only access 3.2GB of RAM.
Because of the memory layout of 32bit systems some of that physical ram will shadowed by PCI devices and bios memory areas.
In my experience using a 32 and 64 bit variants of FreeBSD on the same hardware, I have seen a measurable (but not huge) benefit to running 64 bit.
The 64-bit flash plugin beta has been unstable in my experience, and nspluginwrapper with the 32-bit plugin has some interesting quirks (but is livable).
Unless you are in need of the full 4gig memory, you probably don't need to go through the pain of performing a full reinstall of your OS.
If you want your OS to be able to use more than 3.5Gb of that ram (possibly a bit less depending on what PCI hardware you have), then yes.
As mentioned by others, some applications work better on 32bit OS vs. 64bit OS.
What I have found, much to my dismay, is that the chipset/BIOS puts a limit on the maximum memory I can use.
Everything would need to be recompiled to receive the benefit.
64 bit has been around long enough that active projects don't have issues.
