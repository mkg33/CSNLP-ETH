A webserver that can do UPnP NAT traversal would work, the receiver would only needs a web browser.
All methods will require some kind of configuration or setup which are usually harder than registering an account.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Client-to-Client, You get you HexChat client, install it on both computers, you enter let's say Freenode and then create a channel for both to join, then right click on the other "contact/PC" and send file.
This will output the command line you should run on the receiving end.
Old tech that always works, apart from Hyperterminal for dial up direct connection, circa 1995-1998, DCC was the mainstream way to download music and movies.
But if you want encryption, you might as well use SCP/SSH.
This includes a secret key (which is such that you can also read it over the phone).
On Ubuntu you can install via apt-get (it is also available via Python pip):
The server does not necessarily have to relay the traffic (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching) and most of them don't as bandwidth is costly.
Wormhole establishes the connection automatically and encrypts the files to be transferred.
For example, Skype will try to use many NAT traversal methods to establish a direct connection before falling back to relaying traffic through their super nodes.
As a bonus encryption is easy with a web server, just use https.
Bit torrent sync does synchronize folders over the web.
The dirtiest way if you use *nix is to use netcat (nc) to cat the file to the remote host.
You have to realize that if either party is behind a NAT and you don't want to setup port forwarding, then it's impossible to make a direct connection without connecting to a third-party server first.
