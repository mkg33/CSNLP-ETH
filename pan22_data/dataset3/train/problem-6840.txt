Ok so here is the situation, we currently have a server and we are now migrating to AWS.
The alternative that you can use in AWS for multi-mounted storage is EFS.
Step 2: Depends on PHP Version sometimes php-fpm.sock name can be php5-fpm.sock.
It was due to S3Fuse + PHP script that will scan through the folder where S3Fuse is being mounted.
Step 1: Some Missing Configuration, Please add in your PHP_FPM File
Please make sure the socket name is same in nginx and php-fpm configuration.
We have somehow identical configuration and we already tried to run apache benchmark so the PHP-FPM pool is somehow optimize as far as I know.
I think it is recommended to use S3Fuse if you will only use it for reading files or for backing up files.
Or are there any way to trace which is the one who is causing the 502 bad gateway?
S3Fuse is so slow for scanning through the files, especially if you have so much files in the bucket.
But after we point the domain in the AWS DNS after an hour we are getting 502 bad gateway and is receiving this error:
Running in AWS using: CloudFront - ELB - NGINX - PHP
