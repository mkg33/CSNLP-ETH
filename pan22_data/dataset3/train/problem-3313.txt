I saw this with Vista and it turned out to be two possibilities
Ran two hotfixes which were listed as solutions Hotfix 435137 and Hotfix 437953 for Win 7 x32.
I had a similar issue with a Windows 7 logon to a SBS server.
One of these two steps resolved the issues for this computer.
Try disabling UAC, and rebooting (this is necessary for the UAC change) and see if it still takes 10 minutes.
We  temporarily disabled the policy or remove the logon scripts to check the result.
Windows 7 does not show status of login scripts when the UAC fails and so you have no idea what is going on...at least that's been our experience.
Is the policy “Run logon scripts synchronously” enabled.
Are you doing anything in your login scripts that violates UAC?
When I installed Windows 7 RC (a clean install), the problem went away so I assumed the problem was caused by 'baggage' from the upgraded Windows Vista installation.
Upgrades often come at the cost of a lot of 'baggage' and a clean install, though inconvenient, is always better in the long run, in my experience.
The other was related to logon scripts and policy.
Saw others with this issue that teh above did not help.
Updating to the newest vendor-provided one improved performance significantly
I saw a situation similar to this when I was running the Windows 7 beta against my SBS 2003 server.
Can you try a clean install and see if the problem persists?
Found online documents suggesting the issue was due to Windows Managment Instrumention log being scanned on startup.
Also set Network Location Awareness service to manual startup.
Anyway, I never discovered the root cause and it hasn't re-occurred since, I have several Windows 7 machines on that domain now and they are all just fine.
Very strange problem, the logon to the domain was taking 10-20 minutes.
This problem is often caused by the client not having the SBS Machine as its primary DNS server.
