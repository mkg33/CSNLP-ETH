Otherwise, you can clone the drive to another one of the same size and format the whole drive, then move Windows back.
Open a terminal and run these commands to add a PPA and install boot-repair:
Because you deleted the partitions, you also deleted the grub files configuration files (everything in /boot/grub).
I have not tried this on my own computer but it has worked well with others.
The optimal solution is to disable BitLocker completely, as you said.
After, open GParted and simply delete the partitions.
Again, the best (and least risky) solution is to disable BitLocker completely.
As a result, if you boot up your computer now, you will get to a grub-rescue screen.
Boot from your LiveCD or create a USB with Rufus or some other utility and boot from that.
However, there is a way to keep Bitlocker on your computer and keep Ubuntu.
Provided that you have files you want to keep, I would suggest you take a backup (I would do this of the /home folder because that is where all your user files are (you would need to reinstall all user-installed programs and dependencies); otherwise you can just take a full backup and reinstall GRUB; more info about this is in this question.
It will ask you to create a pastebin after and give you a file telling you about what happened.
This will create a new BCD for your Windows system and reinstall bootmgr to the MBR.
