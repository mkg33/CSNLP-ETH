It is very important to backup whatever data you have on this drive and shift to new drive.
When sectors finally start to go bad at an OS level the drive ends up expiring very quickly.
Hard drives tend to hang onto life by marking sectors bad, transparently, in the background.
Make sure, as you said, that there aren't any problems with the disk itself.
Is there any process or cron job that is set to automatically add or remove files from this tar file?
Do not fsck until you verify that the memory is safe.
It turned out to be the hard drive controller on the motherboard.
But failed reads should cause md5sum to quit and report input/output error.
To be on the safe side I suggest you run memtest86+ over night to make sure that it finds no memory errors.
The root cause is that somehow your RAM is getting corrupted.
Since data is different each time it is possible that md5sum is able to read less and less after each run.
Pull out drives, put in a known good system, and FSCK there while you fix this system.
However, in this case it definitely sounds like a dud hard drive.
It is probably a bad stick, but sometimes the devices like the video card can corrupt main memory.
