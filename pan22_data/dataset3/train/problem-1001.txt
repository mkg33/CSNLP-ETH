Seems simple enough, but the issue is that you need a way to have both hard drives plugged in at the same time so you can clone the data from one to the other.
Just buy "USB2.0 or 3.0" SATA 2.5 External case for hard disk.
Powered (own source via power adapter) SATA/USB adapters readily available, so the adapter/drive combination is not dependent on the USB 2.0 connection for power.
They recommend using a SATA/USB adapter, but I'm not sure that the new hard drive I purchased will be adequately powered by a USB 2.0 connection.
I don't know much about electrical engineering so I'm not sure if I'm correct.
Recently looked into these on Amazon, for example.
All 2.5 SATA hard disks operates at 5V so it will work fine.
My understanding is that USB 2.0 can only provide 500ma.
I plugged in via USB and installed the tool for cloning.
I am trying to upgrade the hard drive in an old work laptop (Acer Aspire running Windows 10), but I'm having trouble getting the data onto the new drive (7200 rpm SATA 6).
I'm following this article about how to clone a hard drive then boot from it.
I just need to move the data from one drive to the other.
