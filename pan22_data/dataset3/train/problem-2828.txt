I've tried clicking "Design Mode" in the Developer Ribbon, but that does not seem to give me any additional interfaces or options for setting the button's attributes.
Select the Design mode on , right click properties " Alphabetic" change the name on caption to your desired name.
I cannot figure out where in the interface to go to change the button's name.
(I can change the button's label text, I'm actually interested in renaming the button itself).
I've pasted a command button into a sheet and it came in with a default name of "Button 1".
A couple of years removed, but click on design node then click on your button, and you will get bars, right click and click properties, change the name in "caption" to the one you want it to be, click the "X", then click design mode again.
It may be that you're trying to name the button the same name as one of your procedures or a cell reference or possibly something else that already exists; otherwise, you should be able to right-click you button to select then change the name in the name box left of the formula bar.
I feel like such a dunce, but I cannot figure out how/where to do this.
