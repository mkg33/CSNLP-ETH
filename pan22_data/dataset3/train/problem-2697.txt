So, you basically have no choice if you are going to put stuff in a home directory of a user.
You would also find it suggested that it is therefore better not to have it in your home directory at all and instead place it where other web server stuff is, but not under the DocumentRoot of any virtual server or the main server.
Overall the best idea, especially if the box is also your own development machine, is to do a separate deploy of code into this separate area, making code files non writable and then running it all as some separate dedicated non privileged user.
When configuring the WSGIDaemonProcess directive, most tutorials (including the official documentation) suggest running the WSGI process as the user in whose home directory the code resides.
The reason that you find it said that user should be that of the home directory is because on many systems the home directory has permissions of 'drwx------' which means that only the user can read stuff in there.
Should I set up a service account whose only privilege is read-only access to the code in order to have better security?
I have some Django sites deployed using Apache2 and mod_wsgi.
By doing that, the directory restrictions aren't going to apply and Apache user could read it.
However, I wonder if it is really wise to run the wsgi daemon process as the same user (with its attendant privileges) which develops the code.
