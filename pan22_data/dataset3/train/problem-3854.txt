I guess really it boils down to what happens before that 150 response.
The FTP server being used is VSftpd 2.0.5 ( I believe this is the default server that was installed with CentOS ).
Here is an example of a send I just made ( to the network storage ), reported file transfer time is only 9 seconds, but the overall transfer took much longer than that.
I'm having trouble with an FTP server, the FTP server is running on CentOS.
When I try to transfer to the network storage there is long delay somewhere and even though files are transferred very quickly, the overall transaction takes a long time.
This only happens when doing an FTP GET or PUT into a network storage, if the file that I'm trying to FTP is being written or read from the local hard disk on the CentOS machine then it works lightning quick.
Are we looking at a server configuration issue here?
Prior to this, the server used to be on Windows ( FileZilla Server ), where we didn't have this issue and the FTP transfers were all very quick.
The network storage is mounted under centos using:
It's been outstanding for a long time and previous attempts to resolve this issue have failed.
The 150 response came at 13:48:22, and then the transfer appears to have been completed quickly (~9 seconds ), as reported by the 226 response @ 13:48:31.
There is exactly the same kind of delay using passive mode, between the STORE and the 150 response.
In the above example I initiated the ftp put command at 13:47:50, and the 200 response was instant.
Unfortunately the network side ( firewalls etc ) is not within my control, but I'm looking for advise on what I need to ask the network team to trouble shoot when we look at this issue.
When transferring lots of small files, this delay obviously adds up and makes the overall transfer take a large amount of time.
