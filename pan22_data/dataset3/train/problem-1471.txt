In fact, PDF documents are more or less based on PostScript.
In general, I shy away from printers that don't properly support open standards such as PostScript.
There are an abundance of possible drivers for it applicable to my system (Windows 7, 64 bit) including PCL5, PCL5e, PCL6 and UFR II.
I'm familiar with PCL, but not UFR II, although the ever-helpful Wikipedia told me it stands for "Ultra Fast Rendering".
UFR is a proprietary, non-standard rendering engine that is functionally similar to Postscript and PCL.
UFR II is the 2nd version of UFR... which stands for "Ultra Fast Renderer".
If you have a printer and driver that both are geared towards UFR II... use it.
Both PostScript and PCL are very fast and very well supported by the industry.
What (if anything) is the advantage of using the UFR II driver over one of the PCL variants?
PCL is more generic, common, and simple, but antiquated... UFR II is better designed, and faster, but not anywhere near as common.
UFR is risky given that Canon can make it obsolete at any time based on their whims.
In short... it's similar to PCL in concept... but alien in the actual instructions.
You have to ask Canon nicely if they want to help you out.
