If the audio came off as one big file, I am proficient enough to splice/slice it up myself into individual tracks, but can't seem to find any software that makes the task of getting audio from a DVD very simple.
However, I can easily rip the audio using mplayer (see other answer above) and open the file in Audacity for editing.
I'm pretty sure you can do this with Adobe Premiere.
Works fine on Windows but I couldn't get it to record on Ubuntu because of Ubuntu's weird audio set up.
It records from your sound card, so you just need to play your DVD on your computer then hit record in Audacity.
As I said, these are not encrypted/commercial DVDs.
I have some home movies and footage from a wedding, and I'd like to easily 'rip' or extract the audio to WAV/MP3/etc.
However you can get Handbrake for most platforms to rip the content from the DVD and then use ffmpeg (or a GUI front end for ffmpeg) to extract just the audio.
PGCDemux will directly de-multiplex the audio streams from un-encrypted video files, from which you can process them further
There an entry in the Handbrake FAQ which addresses this, but doesn't tell you much more than I wrote above.
Does not have to be free, but must be worth the money.
