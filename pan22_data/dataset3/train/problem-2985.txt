The virtual machine does not have the certificates the actual machine has which enable the MITM to work transparently.
Easiest way is to go to chrome://restart so that it reopens all your tabs.
I had to go to the Keychain app on a Mac and delete the expired/untrusted certificates so it would download new ones.
If you click the advanced link you are given the option to prodeed anyway.
If you've just installed an SSL cert on your website after getting this error, you may need to restart Chrome.
If you click on the words "Not secure, you are informed that you have chosen to disable warnings for this site, but you can re-enable them.
For me I had to upgrade my browser version to the latest and it worked.
Your computer may have an old certificate on it and ignore the current one.
My work place intercepts SSL connections, looks at their contents, and then passes the data to and from my machine and remote hosts - a kind of man-in-the-middle attack.
Subsequently, when you visit the same site, the warning won't be shown, but the address bar will show "Not secure".
Now I have a virtual machine running on my computer.
Chrome was just being dumb and not refreshing properly.
I was getting this error even though SSL Labs was telling me I had an A+ cert.
This is not uncommon in corporate or enterprise environments.
