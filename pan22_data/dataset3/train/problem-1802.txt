To increase security, you can use Private Browser Mode, which does disable some add-ons.
And, of course, if you are really worried, you can create a new profile as Ramhound suggests, and use Private browsing mode on it.
You should judge those by how much you trust the person who made them.
If you want, edit the shortcut to add the name of the profile at the end of the shortcut.
Fully reviewed add-ons from the official Mozilla Add-on Site have been tested for security leaks like this.
To do so, create another shortcut to firefox on you desktop, and edit is so that "-no remote -p" comes after the name.
"C:\Program Files\firefox.exe" -no-remote -p" Then open that version, and create a new profile, following the directions as given.
"C:\Program Files\firefox.exe" -no-profile -p "High Security")
Preliminarily reviewed add-ons are more dangerous.
The very basics have been checked by a computer, but it's possible some less secure code has snuck in.
Add-ons that are found only on other websites are the least secure, and probably should not be used at all unless they come from highly reputable sources.
While it is possible one has been missed, it is unlikely, especially for the most popular add-ons.
