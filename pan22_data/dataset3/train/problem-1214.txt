This would also help clearly delineate private and work usage of the internet.
I'm in general agreement with what alexm wrote but would tackle it slightly differently.
These machines could be locked for most of the day but only open from 11 am till 2 pm (for example).
Rather than build a system from scratch I suggest using one of the very easy to use firewall distros.
We solved it by putting the problem users all on the same subdomain and blocking that subdomain's access to Facebook, etc.
Most firewall distros have very good comunity support, so it's quite possible someone has already created an add-on to suit you.
I personally favour Smoothwall but there a number of others to choose from.
In addition to allowing you much more flexibility for filtering than you currently have you will also gain the benefits of having a decent gateway firewall.
Otherwise, while the settings you are after may not be available in the normal management console they're easily implemented via squid and cron.
You could also enable time-based restrictions depending on your firewall software.
Another alternative would be to block Facebook et al from people's work machines from 9-5 but set up an "Internet Cafe" in a communal area where they can have access to the internet for personal browsing at lunchtime.
As these machines are effectively "public" people would then have to learn to log off when they've finished.
With very little scripting you can have as much granularity and control as you desire.
If your firewall doesn't accept hostnames there will be some maintenance associated with changing DNS records but this seems like an acceptable solution compared to your current solution.
