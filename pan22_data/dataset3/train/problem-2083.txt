You could pragmatically create such a function by cursoring through a view based in sys.servers and other DMVs to put the function together through string concatenation, then replace the old version with the new using a call to EXEC.
You can't use an ad-hoc distributed query via OPENROWSET (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187569.aspx) either as OPENROWSET explicitly requires its inputs including the query text to be string literals not more general string values (so you can't use an expression or variable).
You still need to run the generation procedure every time the list of linked servers changes, but at least it would just be one procedure call (or script/statement run) and not a more manual code change.
It is not possible to do this dynamically via EXEC, as IIRC you can't do that in a function.
The only ways I can think of involve either having one function per remote database or the CASE/IF suggestion from Marian's comment.
Such a "code smell" would suggest a redesign is in order if you have such power!
