It may be easiest to write a bit of code that runs in the system tray and allows you to simply select the appropriate time zone and then updates your system clock accordingly.
Microsoft has a Time Zone tool that allows you to set and display multiple time zones.
I was annoyed with this after upgrading to Windows 8.1; I was hoping it would do something like the mac does.
If you're on a corporate network, this will have even more problems.
On a corporate network this will always be determined by the domain controller, which is generally in a static location geographically.
Feel free to download and use (instructions included).
So, I spent a couple hours creating my first powershell script to do it.
you will have to get a soft for this as don't know another way to get this to work in windows (as configuring NTP will not be affected with time zone changes) and you may try Atomic Clock Sync.
Unless the system has a built-in GPS chip by which it can get it's location and precise timezone, it will determine it's location by it's public IP and IP-geolocation.
Here's an updated modified powershell script from user### that linked to pastebin in his answer, that works.
I have not checked to see how easy it is to switch between favorites as your current zone, but it may be a step in the right direction.

If your system is not on a domain, relying on the public IP and geolocation will still be problematic if you're near a time zone boundary, as you never know if your IP is being handed out by a server across the line.
