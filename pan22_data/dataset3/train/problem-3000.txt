It can be complex to set up though; make sure you have MPI installed and configured properly to run in parallel.
IOR is the one I've had the most experience with, and it seems to give good results.
I've personally only used IOR and PIO-Bench from that list, but these are all relatively well-known and accepted benchmarks in the HPC community.
For more information on IOR, see this paper; this page is also a useful quick reference.
To be honest, though, the best benchmark for any system is the real application.
"Relatively", because I/O benchmarks can produce holy wars in HPC (especially vs vendors)... but none of them are really bad.
I trust running the real application against test data more than any benchmark, as I've been bit by overly-simplistic measurements not representing real performance.
Perhaps you could do dd if=/dev/sda | nc otherside 9999 and on the other side, do nc -l 9999| dd of=/var/lib/somewhere
Most of the parallel I/O benchmarks on that page should actually write data (albeit often random noise).
You could pipe it through pv to get some idea of the amount of data and speed..
