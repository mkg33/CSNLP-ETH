It will ask you for your read and write passwords when it needs them, and can save them.
My suggestion your be to look in the info.plist file for hints about the command line arguments that are passed by the finder when it launches
The XRAID utility is written in java, it may be possible (although I haven't tried) to jumpstart it on a linux machine.
I suspect that it's all SNMP under the hood, but I haven't verified that.
If you're not running the latest firmware, upgrade ASAP.
Being that you admin it over that Ethernet... bad.
The actual interface to the XRAID utility is a variant of webmin over http, on a non standard port.
It's written in Java, and you can run it under Linux pretty easily.
(as in, "java (whatever).jar")  I would strongly suggest not letting it remember the IPs of all of your XRAIDS, it seems to query them all periodically, without letting the GUI update (this could be a problem with the old version of Java I'm running it on too.
If you just unboxed the things, their passwords are "public" and "private" respectively.
You could also check out lithium, a 3rd party monitoring solution designed to work with the XRAID
The older one that all of mine came with had a bug where it would occasionally forget how to use the Ethernet port.
