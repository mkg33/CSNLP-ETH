I somehow managed to change the domain from home.local to home.mysite.com and everything thing seems to be working.
I also removed and re-installed the offending role with no luck.
To prepare for an upcoming college course that I might take, I have re-purposed one of my computers as an all-round network server (domain, DNS, IIS, Hyper-V et al.).
How can I fix this issue and eradicate all traces of the old domain?
I tried Googling this error and found nothing useful or relevant.
What's funny is that I am joined to the domain and other computers on my network are too.
When I set up the machine, I initially set it up the domain as home.local but after I added all of the roles I realized that I actually had a spare domain name that I wasn't using.
The only problem is that when I click on AD Certificate Services from the Server Manager I get an error message, titled "Certificate Templates", with the text "Windows encountered problems enumerating writable domain controllers for the home.local Domain.
