It takes only a few clicks to white-list the current site (read the manual).
Ublock Origin allows you to block all image downloads by default but allow image downloads on specific websites.
You can configure whether, if ou open a new tab from a link in an old one, it inherits the setting from the parent or it uses the default.
for Firefox : 1) Image Block; 2) ImgLikeOpera (for image blocking) + FlashBlock (for flash blocking)
Similar settings for JavaScript, plugins, frames, redirections.
after this, the images+flash files wont be loaded on sites, but if you want to temporarily enable for specific site, then while you are on that site(page), click the icon and clcik Dont run on this page (or pause).
Anyway, there exist other several extensions to disable image load :
The firefox add-on "Tab Permissions" (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-permissions/) allows you to accomplish this.
 After instalation, on the right upper corner (along with address bar) there appears an icon.
For every browser, there exist Extension AdBlock (also, there exists Adblock Plus) - For Chrome;
It adds buttons to switch images per tab, and to set the default for new tabs.
There is information on how to write these filters here.
right click on that >Settings> Edit filter> and add these lines
You should be able to accomplish this by using the free AdBlockPlus extension for Firefox.
I would play around with the blacklist and whitelist filters.
for Opera : Click CTRL+F12>Pages>Images>Dont load, also enable Opera turbo from left bottom corner.
