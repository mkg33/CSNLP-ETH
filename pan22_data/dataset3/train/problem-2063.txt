(Ctrl + arrow down is not working, because it will stop at Cell 2.)
If you want to go to the last cell in a column, AFAIK, you may need a macro as (which you noticed) CTRL+DOWN will stop at the first empty cell.
The downside to this is that you need to navigate back to the column you actually want, which of course may or may not extend all the way down to the end of your data.
Your quickest way, though it's still two steps, would be to use the Name Box or Go To to jump to the last cell in the column you're interested in, then use Ctrl+Up.
If you know roughly how long your data is, though, you don't need to use row 65536 or row 1048576 - any row that you KNOW is beyond the end of your data would work.
Here I want to use a shortcut to jump from Cell 1 to Cell 5.
As mentioned above in comments, CTRL+END will take you to the last cell in the worksheet.
How can I jump from one cell in a column to the last non-empty cell in that column whereas there are empty cells in between?
Put this macro in a module in your workbook, and you can then assign a keyboard shortcut to it and it'll select the last non-empty cell in the active column.
You can then use Ctrl+Up as normal to find the last actually used cell.
Assuming we wanted to find the last used cell in column A, you could click in the Name Box and enter A65536 (if you're in compatibility mode) or A1048576 (if you're not), then hit Enter.
It may be simpler, though it's still an extra couple of key presses, to use the Ctrl+End method suggested in other answers.
