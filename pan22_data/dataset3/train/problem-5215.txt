You could try the history command in the session that ran the script to get a list of commands that have been recently executed.
I accidentally did "command > ~/.profile" instead of "command >> ~/.profile" on my computer.
The only thing I can possibly think of at this point is that I still have a terminal session open running the lines that were in the ~/.profile file prior to my mistake above.
My question is: Is there any way to get the currently executed source?
I didn't have it version controlled (never happening again), and since the .profile wasn't open in an editor at the time, I don't have an existing version in any backup file or Vim buffer.
This will get you all of your shell variables and defined functions.
Is there any way to see what got executed in that terminal session outside of looking at the file that was sourced?
These won't give you any logic that was in your .profile that helped decide how or why to define the things above, but they may get you much of what you need.
Not that i know of, but depending on what was in there, you can get a good portion of back in the terminal that is still open:
it may be a LOT of stuff because, in Ubuntu for instance, there are all sorts of other macros for completion and whatnot defined, but you can extract what was yours.
Okay, this is a last attempt to see if I can salvage something I accidentally did.
