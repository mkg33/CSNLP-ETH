The site link failed between the sites, and the server at Site B needed to be rebooted.
Both sites are linked together, as a single domain.
Why could Site B's server not be rebooted correctly when the link happened to be down?
This is not what we want, Site B needs to operate independently of Site A should the link fail, and then sync once the link is restored.
Only after the link was restored did everything start and work again.
This is the first multi site network we have made.
On viewing the information in AD on the server at Site B replication seems fine, and changes are replicated between the servers.
It would not show any AD users or computers, and no machines at Site B could join the domain.
On reboot it said it could not contact the domain.
However, Site B seems to be totally dependant on Site A even though it appears to have a fully active separate DC that is a GC.
We have quite a basic network setup in a test environment that is going to be deployed.
We are aware that there should be more than one DC at each site, but this is not something our budget will run to, and we have some other fallback methods if needed.
