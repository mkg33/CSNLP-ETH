Does the frame type is decided by the type of cables which we use to establish a network ?
And again you can make any topology using any cable.
Please help though i understand the topogy, network and cables differently but don't know how they amalgamate in a network ?
Which type of cable will be used it depend on bandwidth, length, cost etc.
As an example the LAN is a network which is in the close geographical location.
So what i get from this is any network which is established in a small geograohical location is  a LAN.
And what are the roles of cables which we use to establish a network ?
Cable type is defined at the physical layer of the OSI model.
Frame type is defined at the data link layer of the OSI model.
A physical topology is the way devices are connected physically so are there any standard topology which we follow while establishing out a LAN like star,ring,mesh,bus ?
and does the topogy is dependt on the type of cable which we use in establishing the network?
But in real life it is not used in LAN because of cost and some other issues like performance, equipment etc.
I know this might sound bizzare  that why some one will use a fiber cable that in start topology but just to clear the concepts ?
Does the Cable types determine which type of frame it will carry?
Just for a example can't i use a fiber cable to create a star topology which carry ethernet frame?
