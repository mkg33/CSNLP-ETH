We have a server with lower specs than you've mentioned and I would only point out the following:
We have about the same number of clients as in your organization.
I would caution you to check the size of the POP mailboxes currently, as uploading them to the server will take FOREVER if they're really large.
-Use the Exchange 2010 Mailbox Server Role Requirements Calculator to help you determine your storage needs.
I tend to build my Exchange Servers with more memory (minimum 24GB) because Exchange will utilize it, but 16GB should be sufficient.
In particular keep an eye on where you place your databases and logs.
The server looks like it should be able to handle Exchange.
-Place transaction logs and database files on separate disks (off the system disk and/or the location where Exchange is installed â€“ you can move the location of your DB)
We have recently migrated from Exchange 2003 to Exchange 2010.
I gave the 2010 server only 8GB of memory, because that's all I had available in our environment.
I think you should keep aware of issues that arise if you have all roles and databases and logs on a single server.
For storage needs, please take a look at the Exchange 2010 Mailbox Server Requirements Calculator that the Microsoft Exchange Team wrote to help with sizing questions.
