I see this rather often when moving customers from one Managed Service Provider to another.
Usually this is a configuration somewhere on their network to ensure that one session doesn't take all the bandwidth within the facility.
I have a strange problem on a Windows Server 2008 r2 Server based VPS.
I checked all the single server services and I can't find any limit in their configurations, and as far as I know Windows Firewall cannot limit the bandwidth this way..
I tried the same test via ftp on the same server, and in upload and download I get the same results..one download or upload max 500kb/s, if I start another one that one as well is up to 500kb/s and so on.
So if I try to download a file via http I go to 500kb/s, if I download a second one that one gets another 500kb/s, and so on till I fill the maximum connection of my cable connection from home (50mbit/s).
Any suggestion about how to test more this problem or how to solve it?
You probably won't be able to change this as it's probably within the Quality of Service settings within their routers.
The same thing happens if I try to send a big file or download something big via email (imap and smtp).
So from the server I can get a total of almost 5mb/s but every single connection arrives top to 500kb/s.
I noticed something very odd, because I see that every single connection (http, ftp, mail etc.)
My provider gives me unmetered and unlimited bandwidth, and obviously full root access (I administer the machine via RDP without using any web interface to have complete control).
