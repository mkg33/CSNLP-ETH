My Vaio draws 1.3 amps, according to the power adapter, and any cord with an amperage rating higher than that and a voltage rating higher than the local line voltage is fine.
The only exception would be that it's unwise to use a power supply with a MUCH HIGHER (ie, 10x) current rating than what the device requires.
And, as a general rule, so long as a power supply has essentially the same voltage (within about 5%) and a current capability greater than what the device demands (and proper connector polarity) then it should be fine.
If you are talking purely the "power cord" -- a piece of wire with a connector on each end and no "box" of electronics somewhere along its length -- then it really doesn't matter.
(And it would be rare to find a power cord that was below 250V and 2.5A.)
(Plus of course, the output needs to be DC, and the negative and positive terminals need to be correctly oriented at the plug going into the computer -- a diagram on the adapter will generally show the +/- orientation of this plug.)
If you're talking the power adapter -- the box of electronics in-between two pieces of wire -- it's OUTPUT voltage should be within about 0.5V of your computer input, and it's OUTPUT current should be larger than your computer's current drain.
