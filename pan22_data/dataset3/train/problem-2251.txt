This is draft 2 of my answer, didn't notice the beginner so I'll try to be gentle:
I don't care what anyone says: sharing private keys in encryption is a horrible idea.
I just want to make sure that you know exactly what makes this poor, and how to fix it.
The more people you share a key with, the less secure it becomes.
I feel like this would be much more appropriate as an instance class, which would allow you to treat it much more intuitively.
If you establish a key based on the user's password, you have now created actual encryption.
Making the aforementioned change will definitely get you a very large step in the right direction.
Yes, you are using an AES Encryption library to process your data, but you have one, unfortunate issue that prevents this from being considered encryption.
This is all well-and-good in theory, but anyone (and I do mean anyone) can decompile your source and get that key.
A better alternative would be to use Rfc2898DeriveBytes on the user's password to get your encryption key.
