That said, its probably useful to analyse the problem in some minor depth to understand what's going on.
Chances are your power supply is faulty, and there's a higher than normal voltage somewhere that's connected to earth.
Tap water may contain some dissolved minerals that are bad for your system.
Something clearly is wrong - be it an alien parasite, government tracker being installed wrongly and causing infection, or plain old appendicitis.
Household voltage can be lethal or at the very least very very painful.
On the bright side you've isolated the problem to your PC, and most PC components run on 12V DC or less.
Even if the PSU is replaced, there's no guarantee that the rest of the system is entirely functional.
This wikipedia article is a good place to start if you want to educate yourself on breakers.
While usually I'd benchtest the old power supply, in this case its likely too much of a risk.
Basically your breakers tripping is probably the equivilent of having a serious pain in your side.
tldr: You probably might possibly be a danger to yourself and others at this point, and you computer might possibly catch fire or you nay be putting yourself at risk of electrical shock.
I;d start with the PSU however, test to see what works and if there's any issues and go from there.
