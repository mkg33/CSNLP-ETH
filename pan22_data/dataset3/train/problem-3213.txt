How can I tell the virtual host not to serve requests for URLs other than the top-level one?
If you want a catch-all for * or a specific IP, create it as the first virtual host in a set of matching ip:port combinations.
Apache always find the best ip:port based in the first pass, when only connection level details are available, then looks at hostnames in a 2nd pass from what remains (if in 2.2, a NameVirtualHost directive has to be present to allow the 2nd step)
I have an SSL-enabled virtual host for my sites at example.com:10443
However, also browsing to https://subdomain.example.com:10443/ (with DNS set) shows me the same pages (after SSL certificate warning).
Check out http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/details.html for the full semantics of virtual host matching, including the results of using NameVirtualHost.
You seem not to use the NameVirtualHost option so Apache will not bother to check the hostname of the server in the request sent by the client.
Whatever hostname you use, does not matter, you'll get exactly the same website.
I would have expected the directive ServerName example.com:10443 to reject all connection attempts to other server names.
Browsing to https://example.com:10443/ works as expected.
You have not enabled NameVirtualHost so the _default_ would send any connection to your server to the config.
If you've only got one virtual host for a port, it will be used regardless of whether there is a name-based vhost match.
The request will be directed to the first VirtualHost section, where the IP:port matches, and that's it.
