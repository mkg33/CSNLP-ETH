Vista on a brand new machine feels like XP does on a 3-4 year old machine.
One problem you may have is that this entire question is based on what may be extremely subjective observations on your part.
You can even see this codinghorror article which discusses the problem in more detail.
For example, the time for a window to minimize to the taskbar is a bit longer than it was in XP if you have some of the flashy bits turned on.
There are a number of changes to the Vista interface that may actually fool you into thinking that it is slower than XP.
I've recently changed laptop and I would have expect it to be quite a lot faster, but it feels more or less the same?
Also, see this codinghorror article for a discussion on how the design of the Vista progress bar makes you feel like copy operations are taking longer than they really are.
Just because you have a faster processor, does not mean that disk operations will take any less time to complete.
For more detailed tweaks for perceived speed there are a number of registry changes that you can make too!
Looks like Windows 7 will be faster than Vista on the same hardware, based on the betas and RC, but we really won't know for sure until it's released "for real".
Right click Computer, choose Properties, go to Advanced System Settings->Advanced->Performance and you can tweak some of these visual settings.
Also, keep in mind that there are a number of places your system can be bottlenecked.
