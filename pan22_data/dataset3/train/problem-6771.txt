You might want to consider running some benchmarking tools to assess the stability of the hardware in the machine.
As schnaader mentions, it is a good idea to also update your system with the latest Windows Service Packs.
Check which application is using a lot of CPU and/or memory.
There are many applications and web sites that can perform these tests for you and some even give you comparisons to systems with similar hardware so you have an idea what state your system is in.
It was one of the many reasons I got away from the platform.
Most of it has to do with fragmentation of filesystems or the registry, as NoCanDo said.
Even simple use does things like update MRU lists (most recently used) which are stored in...the registry.
Check for memory leaks in your application too--they can cause the swap file to become fragmented, and that's difficult and inadvisable to defragment while in use.
In addition to getting patches installed to possibly improve stability (as noted by Schnaader) I would look at disk fragmentation.
Some apps will slowly leak RAM and then the system starts disk swapping which can really hit performance
