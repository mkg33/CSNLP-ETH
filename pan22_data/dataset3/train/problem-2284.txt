Now Im not a very exprienced user but do like to learn and play with Gentoo.
You're best off using the Gentoo minimal CD, but starting from any other Linux environment will also work as long as all the needed tools are available.
It is up to you whether you want 64 or 32 bit guest OS.
Apparently the ISO from June is currently the best one to use.
Use whichever minimal iso is compatible for your system architecture and download the corresponding portage and stage 3 tarballs.
You still need to partition the virtual disk as if it was a physical one (as described in the Gentoo installation guide) with fdisk (or whatever you prefer).
The procedure to install an operating system in Virtual Box is practically identical to installing on real hardware.
I'm googling for a while about how can I install Gentoo on Virtual Box.
Here is a straight forward blog post for installing Gentoo on a VirtualBox image for an x86 architecture but it should work for all with slight variation.
(Not sure this is a bug or Im using a wronng command)
We are informed (#gentoo on freenode) that the current amd64 ISO (minimal) has problems.
Whenever I'm booting into gentoo Im going into a LiveDVD environment where fdisk returning "command not found !"
Downloaded File: livedvd-x86-amd64-32ul-2012.iso (Do I need to use Gentoo 64 as OS version in Virtual Box ?)
I thought there will be a GUI tool to install Gentoo.
But note that the amd64 version can provide a hybrid environment also able to run 32bit binaries.
You might be able to install fdisk (into RAM) with your current live-DVD using the distributions package installation procedure, if it isn't included.
The hand book provides less information about installing it on virtual box rather on a real partition.
You don't need to install the amd64 version of Gentoo, the x86 version will also work.
