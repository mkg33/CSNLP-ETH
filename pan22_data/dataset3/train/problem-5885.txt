I have read information from various places such as this, but they are all looking to delete the file.
moving, opening, setting security information, windows reports "specified file not found".
We boot into safemode on the server itself and was able to takeownship directly on the affected files and folders.
After the copy, I have 100++ files that gives the following error:
I have tried using the property dialog, cmd prompt takeown and icacls.
Clearly, the file is there on the server because it contributes to file item count and folder size.
The recovery was done by copying backup files from a Linux based NAS (Baffalo Terastation Pro) back into the win2k8 servers.
@techie007 We did the chkdisk first, there wasn't any errors then,
Something or someone had recently deleted 90% of the files on the network.
that is what appears even when accessing as domain\administrator on a windows 7 client machine.
It's possible you may be able to access the file from cmd.exe using the 8.3 name.
Again, i think this is something that should have been in a KB or something than having us to trial and error.
Was able to bring the server down this weekend and try out some of the suggestions we got so far.
