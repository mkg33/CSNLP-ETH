Now, Windows 10 uses digital licenses tied to out Microsoft Account.
On the part when when Windows installation assistant asks you to create or insert your existing Microsoft account you enter your Microsoft account and when the install is finished your copy of Windows should be activated.
What I want to know is , How do I check whether the digital license is there in my MS Account or not ?
Only thing I can't seem to figure out is how do I check if I have a digital license linked to my account.
https://account.microsoft.com/devices does show my connected devices but there isn't any option to check my license.
If not, when asked you choose "I don't have a product key".
Download the same edition you had on your old computer by using the Microsoft's Media Creation Tool.
Also,found a answer elsewhere stating that this page only shows the devices linked, not the one which have license.
So, I guess I should be able to grab a iso of the same edition of Windows online, install it, and then activate it by signing in to my MS Account.
If your product key is stored in the computer's motherboard it should automatically insert it during the installation process.
My harddrive just crashed and HP is asking me to pay them to get a recovery media in order to re-install Windows on the new hard drive.
