If you use PHP to generate sttaic, cacheable files like images, JavaScript or CSS, or if your content is cacheable, you may notice a huge performance boost.
Unless your PHP code is really awful, the answer is that any of those solutions should handle the load.
I would personally recommend Apache using mpm_worker with FastCGI PHP, eAccelerator, and possibly disk caching via mod_disk_cache, depending on your PHP application.
For performance testing, there's lots of great tools out there but I find that the apacvhe benchmark tool that comes with Apache is a fast and easy way to test for performance.
I've used lighttpd before and it was pretty slick, but in my experience Apache can be tuned for extreme performance, and the mpm_worker module gives you the same basic threading concept that lighttpd is based on.
You should go with whatever is most familiar to you and the easiest for you to configure and manage.
We switched from Apache's mpm_prefork + mod_php to mpm_worker, FastCGI PHP and mod_disk_cache, and we saw dramatic improvements in speed.
One reason is, we use PHP to minify JS and CSS files, and even just calling PHP to readfile() a cached minified JS file is far slower than letting Apache with mpm_worker serve that file from a disk cache.
The specifics of how it should be used warrants a separate question :-)
Many people tout lighttpd above Apache at all costs saying Apache is bloated and slow.
