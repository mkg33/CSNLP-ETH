Deleting saved credentials in the client.rdp session and re-entering solved the problem for me.
Otherwise you can restart the Remote Desktop Services in services.msc (and say yes to also restart the dependant service).
Using Wireshark I only see one connection attempt.
I've expirenced this issues several times lately, and one workaround is to connect to the machine locally if possible (or via a VmWare console).
For me none of the above answers solved it, but I was able to connect again after I restarted the Remote Desktop Licensing service.
    The RD Session Host server received large number of incomplete connections.
Restarting the Remote Desktop Service worked for me.
I have set MaxOutstandingConnections to 3000 as @Dexmox reposted here and can confirm it works on both Server and Client Versions of Windows.
In your local computer run services.msc then go to Action, connect to another computer, and choose the remote computer.
The Server sends TCP RST what obviously causes the eventlog entries we see.
Maybe the defaults from older versions of Windows got discarded.
