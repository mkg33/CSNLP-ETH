While you validated the user input on the UI layer, MainInterface , it is also important to validate the argument passed on your business/service layer, NumberToWordsConverter.
Putting it in a sigle class might not be the best idea but here it is:
int is a pretty wide range, not only does it holds positive numbers up to 2,147,483,647, but also negative numbers down to -2,147,483,648.
If we pass any negative number, the method simply returns null.
All units and tens are in title case, while the names of large number are in lower case.
NumberToWordsConverter is a helper/utility class here, so it is best to make it a static class.

That way you don't have to instantiate it before using it.
Finally it adds a thousands multiplier to each triplet if necessary.
I don't know if you have noticed the inconsistency.
It works like we think by dividing the whole number in sets of three digits and translating each into words.
This is a generic method and can very easily be extended by just adding another thousands multiplier.
It is not like you have various converters that will be used depending on the context like localized converters: English, French, Chinese...
but it's purpose is to just show another possible sollution.
