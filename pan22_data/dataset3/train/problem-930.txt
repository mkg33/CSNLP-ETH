On the other hand, the staging versions are also more risky because of the experimental nature of those changes.
The x.y-staging and x.y development version are developed in parallel.
Please note that there is never a "full merge of all remaining stuff in Wine Staging" - each feature and bug fix is evaluated separately, and merged if it is suitable for the development branch.
If you want to know what bugs are fixed in Wine Staging, you can take a look at https://bugs.winehq.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=STAGED
Are WINE x.y-staging versions older or newer than x.y release?
The general idea is that simple bug fixes are added directly in the development version and more risky stuff is added in the Wine Staging first.
In some cases a patch stays in Wine Staging only for a couple of days, while more difficult feature can also remain for a very long time.
There is no fixed point in time when certain features from Wine Staging are merged back into the development release.
Since the x.y-staging version usually contains more features and bug fixes than the x.y development release, it could probably be called "newer".
but that applies to both x.y being the base the staging patches are applied on or the predecessor of x.y which will become x.y after patches from -staging have been merged or posponed for the release.
