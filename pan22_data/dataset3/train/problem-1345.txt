Just because that path is sideways is irrelevant, you have increased the pressure inside the unit by using a fan and the best path available to equalize the pressure is via the outlet.
Without this mechanism then air pressure would continue to build up in the area and, as fusion is pretty hard to achieve with oxygen and nitrogen, you would first end up with some kind of electron degenerate matter.
If your PSU has an inlet fan pulling air into it from in the case as your comment suggests, then that fan will by definition be pushing air out of the PSU as well.
Your PSU is not a sealed unit so it has an airflow through it.
You cannot push a volume of gas (air) into an area and expect it to just stay there, it will raise the pressure slightly, then that pressure increase will push outwards and the air will then flow out of the area through any open vents such as the back of your PSU.
Quite simply if you push or pull air into an open area then it will flow through that area and out via any path available.
If you continue pushing air in then you may well achieve fusion, but by that point I would expect your computer to have achieved several million degrees Celsius and probably melted.
