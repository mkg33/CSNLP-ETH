This is what I did and I am able to see the same properties displayed for all folders now:
The properties seemed to be carried down the child folders.
C) There is a drop down called  (WHAT KIND OF FOLDER DO YOU WWANT?
Also if you go into your music through c:\users\XXXXX it is the same format as the rest of the drive.
This step will set the folder type as Music Details.
SO now all of my child folders under itunes with music in them, now display date created, date modified, bit rate, and size.
You will see some MP3 properties displayed in columns default by explorer.
Right Click on one of the MP3 properties like Name or Title etc and choose the (MORE) Option.
SECOND STEP - Choose the properties that needs to be displayed for a MP3 Folder.
Under this Drop Down choose (MUSIC DETAILS)  and press (OK).
You can also apply this property to all sub folders by ticking the option (ALSO APPLY THIS TEMPLATE TO ALL SUB FOLDERS)
G) You will see that for all MP3 folders now display same properties like Name, Title, Size, Album etc whih you chose
Now, Go To (VIEW) Tab - Click on  (APPLY TO ALL FOLDERS OPTION)  - Explorer will ask you to confirm the current view for all Music Details folders - Choose (YES)
I changed the details shown to date created, date modified, bit rate, and size, while in my itunes parent folder.
But if you go to your music through libraries it saves its properties for details shown per library, so in that case it is unique to that library only and is unaffected by the "Apply to all folders" button.
F)This is the main important step - Go to Windows Explorer (ORGANIZE) Option (This step could be different for XP, Vista, Windows 7) but a similar option is there in all the three OS - Choose (FOLDER AND SEARCH OPTIONS) – You will see 3 TABS – General, View , Search.
Note, the type of the folder should be Music details (Refer Step ABC to set a folder of type Music Details).
FIRST STEP - Set the MP3 Folder Type as (Music Details).
I wanted to set the list of properties that needs to be displayed for all MP3 Folders.
A) Go to a MP3 Folder on windows explorer and right click and choose (PROPERTIES)
Choose all the details you want to be displayed for a MP3 folder – Arrange it using (UP) and (DOWN) buttons – Press (OK) to save properties
