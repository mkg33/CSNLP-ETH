Normal capturing occurs in real-time, with the computer recording what the DV tape plays back.
Would I need special camera software, or special OS X software?
I have 2 eyeFi cards and this is definitely the way to go.
Are there any ways to do something similar, if not exactly this?
I'd like to bypass my memory card altogether, and store media directly to my iMac.
(If you take photos away from home, when you return, it will transfer the photos then, automatically.)
Simply setting your capture software to record while the camera is running should let you capture directly onto the hard drive.
Note: you can configure your EyeFi card to work on several WiFi networks.
You could get an EyeFi memory card which will automatically save photos to your computer as you take them via your wireless home network.
It is possible with most digital SLR cameras, but I'm not aware of any point-and-shoot cameras (such as the Powershot) which support tethering.
I've done this in previous versions of Adobe Premiere (v6 if I remember correctly); as always, you may get different results on different hardware/capture combinations.
It has the high benefit to work with most of camera with SD cards; some recent models even integrate the possibility to disable/enable the wifi connection of the card.
Currenly, I can take pictures and video with my Canon Powershot, and then upload them to my computer's hard drive.
Not as fancy as tethering but at least it is working with small compact cameras.
Then you just take a picture/video, wait a bit and it's in your computer.
If you have a DV camera, it is possible to capture directly to hard drive.
