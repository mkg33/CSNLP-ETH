if you could set one of the vlan's on un-managed switch, then you can put other vlan on native vlan and it will be possible with one cable.
There are a couple more scenarios but I think the point it made.
with two cable you will have native vlan mismatch or stp loop.
Connecting two ports from the same VLAN creates a bridge loop, bringing down the network (unless the L3 switch detects this and blocks one of the ports).
The unmanaged switch you can only use for one of the VLANs as it can't separate traffic.
Is it possible to for a device with the ip address 192.168.0.1 and Vlan 100 to communicate with an other device with the ip address 192.168.1.1 and Vlan 200 with the following architectures
VLANs separate L2 traffic - you need the router/L3 switch to enable L3 communication between the VLANs.
You cannot connect an unmanaged switch with two cables: using one cable/uplink for each VLAN effective bridges the VLANs, creating a single one again.
i dont think even with native vlan it could be possible.
