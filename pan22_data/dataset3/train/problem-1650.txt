Best practice says you use something like corp.dentalofficedomain.com.
This is a very important part of AD planning as you never know what this dental office may eventually need or want, and the domain you create today will likely persist forever and will be difficult to change.
Does the dental office have a website and a domain name they own?
It used to be common practice to use a .local (awesomedental.local) domain name.
If you’re just starting, start over, and do it properly.
There are many reasons why this is bad practice and why this has become more problematic nowadays.
You’re not supposed to use a domain name you don’t own.
Your computers will have the FQDN of pc1.corp.awesomedental.com.
For instance, if the dental office’s website is www.awesomedental.com then your AD domain should be corp.awesomedental.com.

That’s to be expected being you are just learning.
