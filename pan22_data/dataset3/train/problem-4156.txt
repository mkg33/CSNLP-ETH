check for existing records of disk errors (event log, hardware logs, etc.)
Second, make sure you have a unique index on the combination of NetworkUserID, NetworkID (with the highest cardinality one of those two first).
You have no transaction there and no locks being held on the table while performing reads and writes.
Third, patch your host OS and move that leaky service to another machine.
Or, if you absolutely cannot, then reboot the server often enough that it doesn't run out of memory before the next reboot.
For 2008 R2, at this time I'd say the hard minimum is build 10.50.6220 (SP3 + MS15-058), and you really should be at 10.50.6537 (SP3 + MS15-058 + TLS 1.2 capability).
I second the suggestion of a unique index on NetworkId+NetworkUserId.
Incorrect results may be due to the way you're writing to that table unsafely.
I suggest that you rewrite your procedure with a MERGE statement:
First, make sure your SQL Server is fully patched and up to date.
if you're on RAID, try a consistency check and/or patrol read or other validation.
My expectation is that EITHER the patching will fix it, OR putting the unique index on will fail because you've got duplicates in the table already.
The other thing that might be an issue is that you have an actual hardware fault, and may have corrupt data - this is actually very rare.
