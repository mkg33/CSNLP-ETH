If your problem server holds all the roles above, I would transfer the roles to your good DC, as per:
This will probably solve the problems you get when the problem server drops out.
I also take it that you have a single domain forest with two DCs.
Once you have transferred the roles, you can take the problem DC offline and do some diags on it, or as a last resort rebuild it.
You can determine if your problem server holds the FSMO roles like so on the command prompt:
Do you see anything in the event logs during the restart?
We had something similar to a couple of laptops once where it completely lost the network and it would occur (eventually like a month later) even after a reinstall.
It sounds like this server is the owner of all the FSMO roles on your domain (each of the five FSMO roles can only be on one server at a time).

Take a look at the network drivers and see if there are updated ones.
there probably isn't especially if it occurs before the logging service gets started but you never know.
Have you done a recent virus scan with an up to date virus scanner on the problem server?
I'm guessing from your tags that your domain is a Windows 2003 active directory domain.

Finally figured out since it was a group of them with sequential serial numbers that it was bad components that were somehow screwing with the OS.
