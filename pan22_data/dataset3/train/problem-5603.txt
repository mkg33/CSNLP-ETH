This influential hypothesis has created quite some literature though mostly in the form of articles, not books, I think.
To complement some of the above answers, Avi Widgerson's recent book Mathematics and Computation briefly discusses philosophical interplays between computer science and philosophy in section 20.5.
While not a book about philosophy in itself, it makes the reader wonder about the new light shed by ToC on all these concepts.
And it significantly departs from standard schoolbooks (indeed, that's not what this book is), as it contains no proofs.
lance fortnow "the golden ticket" , it deals with the consequences of what happens in case P=NP and other issues in a very lighter manner.
In particular he states that "being computational" is not a property inherent to any process.
Here is another essay of a philosophical nature by Scott Aaronson.
I haven't done much reading myself but i find the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" very eye opening.
Rather, there must be some observer attributing the "meaning" to the process.
Gerry Sussman has done an amazing work with that book.
More broadly, the entire book contains a lot of material of philosophical interest, as it focuses mainly on the interplay between seemingly different fields, and does so by explaining the underlying structure and meaning of various concepts of ToC (randomness, knowledge, interaction, evolution, induction, learning...
John Searle in his book "The Rediscovery of the Mind" among other things raises the question what a computation is.
