For instance, you could put this in your DNS zone for example.com:
Is it possible to configure my domain names with the multi-level subdomains?
I have a staging server where I would like to mimic the production server as much as possible.
I would like to be able to stage the blog before I push it to production using the staging address blog.stage.example.com.
Since that's much more likely to be supported by your provider.
Sub-domains and hosting are a bit of an undefined, and you're best served asking them if they support something like that.
Let's say I own example.com and I decide that I want to host a blog using blog.example.com.
If it is possible, what would the DNS zone file look like?
For instance, you could put this in your DNS zone for example.com:
This seems like a simple question, but after some Google searching I can't seem to find the answer.
With the above configuration, one virtual server will bind to 1.1.1.1:80 and respond to blog.stage.example.com, and the other server will bind to 2.2.2.2:80 and respond to blog.example.com.
Sub-domains and hosting are a bit of an undefined, and you're best served asking them if they support something like that.
This assumes that you can assign two IP addresses to your web server.
Since that's much more likely to be supported by your provider.
Your nginx virt hosts will look something like this:
I'm not famililar enough with Nginx to provide multiple virtual-host examples for that.
Obviously, I would want blog.stage.example.com to point to the server running on the staging environment (e.g.
Bind DNS does support that kind of thing, but whether or not your hosting provider lets you do that is another story entirely.
Your nginx virt hosts will look something like this:
This assumes that you can assign two IP addresses to your web server.
Or, perhaps there is a better way to manage this that I don't know about?
It is quite possible to define an A record with multiple labels in it.
Setting up the DNS will depend on how your DNS is managed, but it should be do-able.
IP 1.1.1.1), and blog.example.com to point to the server running on the production environment (e.g.
I am using Nginx for my web back-end and have Gandi as a hosting provider where I manage my DNS zone file.
With the above configuration, one virtual server will bind to 1.1.1.1:80 and respond to blog.stage.example.com, and the other server will bind to 2.2.2.2:80 and respond to blog.example.com.
And finally, if it is possible, what would the Nginx configuration file look like?
It is quite possible to define an A record with multiple labels in it.
Bind DNS does support that kind of thing, but whether or not your hosting provider lets you do that is another story entirely.
I'm not famililar enough with Nginx to provide multiple virtual-host examples for that.
I rather do this than buy another domain such as stage-example.com or use naming conventions like blog-stage.example.com.
Or, am I stuck with naming conventions like, blog-stage.example.com?
The correct answer comes from @sysadmin1138 and @cjc:
Setting up the DNS will depend on how your DNS is managed, but it should be do-able.
