BUT you will occasionally run into problems when there is a large data change on the server and you will have to manually refresh the remote copy e.g.
That's the point where you realise just how slow ADSL upload speed is.
If tyou really, really must use Internet backup here are some of my findings.
We do use Internet backups, but they regularly stop because someone copies or moves 10GB of data and it takes a week for the Internet backup to catch up.
If at all possible I would use backup tapes and take them off site.
I'd also question the need to pay for Internet backup when everyone has a broadband line that you can use.
To rsync Exchange use vshadow to create a shadow copy of the disk and rsync the Exchange store from the shadow copy.
As I mentioned, we do all of the above and it works just fine.
We normally roll our own Internet backups using rsync (see http://www.ratsauce.co.uk/notablog/UsingRsync.asp for some general comments).
You can easily rsync to a server (or just a PC) at the MDs house through his ADSL line because the bottleneck is the upload speed at the office.
If you still want to go ahead I have loads of scripts that you're welcome to use if you think they'll help.
Internet backup is one of those things that seems a great idea until you try and use it.
There are loads of commercial Internet backup companies, but at the end of the day they all suffer from the restricted upload speed.
Alternatively use NTBackup to backup Exchange to a bkf file and rsync the bkf file.
The MD won't even notice the traffic on his home Internet connection.
To rsync Sharepoint use an osql command to backup the SQL database to disk and rsync the backup file.
