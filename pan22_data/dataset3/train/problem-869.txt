If you are using the split configuration, then you should create a symlink to this file with a name like 00_exim-conf-localmacros in /etc/exim4/conf.d/main.
If you are using a Debian/Ubuntu system you can define them in
The option isn't in the file by default, but per the documentation the default setting is
Open the file /etc/exim.conf and find the key smtp_banner, then change that line in this way :
For that, you'll want to define received_header_text, probably in /etc/exim4/conf.d/main/02_exim4-config_options.
Check the configuration in /var/lib/exim/conf.autogenerated to ensure your macros are included.
The post shows the macros that need to be set, but is not clear about how to set them.
If you make your changes using the documented mechanism, version updates should not break or loose your configuration changes.
If you are using other systems, the configuration file may be provided using a different mechanism.
The default configuration may be /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.
smtp_banner modifies the banner displayed to the client upon connection, but it looks like you want to change what's being put in the Received: header.
It appears you may need to make a number of configuration changes.
On a Debian/Ubuntu system I would suggest you use the split configuration.
So you should be able to just paste the above text into your config, making whatever changes you'd like.
