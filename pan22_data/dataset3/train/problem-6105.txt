I have talked with ERP app support, and they have tons of users running on gigabit networks with no issues .
the SBS 2003 server is the DC and also runs Exchange.
all network cards are gigabit cards  set at full duplex.
I just purchased 3 new managed Dell 5424 power connect gigabit switches to replace my 3 older Dell 10/100 unmanaged switches.
all cabling has been tested and is certified gigabit capable with no opens,shorts, improper mapping etc..      most cabling is cat5e   and some new cabling is cat 6.
How many connections exist between the 3 switches?
Everything was running fine on the older switches except we now have about 70 workstations  on the network and network performance was getting very sluggish.
How many paths are there from each switch to every other switch?
These switches have a fiber link back to the server closet where the 3rd switch is located.
I have 2 seperate closets out in the building where i have 1 switch in each closet.
I only hooked up 2 workstations to test connections etc...    here are the problems i run into.
other than that we just store files on the server.
I basically left everything at defaults , just assigned IP address to each switch so i could login and manage them.
My network is very basic so from my understanding no special setup should have been required on the new switches.
Is there possibly a switching loop that's causing the problems?
I have a new Windows 2008 server and a SBS 2003 server.
I picked a Saturday when i would not have any traffic and could test.
The 2008 server is a member server that runs a Pervasive Database Server that handles all the data for our ERP application that all our workstations pulls data from.
