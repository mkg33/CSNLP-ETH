Or could you make your current home server accessible for you to backup to when you are remote?
I would backup to S3, its cheap, available, and there are any number of backup solutions available, ranging from automagic to manual.
If you are using 500MB take a look at Dropbox getdropbox.com or Microsoft Mesh http://connect.microsoft.com/LiveMesh.
Google will help you with more info - http://www.google.com.au/search?q=s3+rsync
Here is one such provider http://www.jumba.com.au/vps
If you really want to use rsync look into Amazon S3/EC2.
Do you have any friends with always-on internet connections that they run a small server on?
This (rsync to my home server) is how I currently backup the data on my netbook while traveling - it works well, but I'm only talking about ~5Gb not ~500...
Though the main problem here is speed, including the fact that most home connections are asymmetric so it may be slow restoring files remotely (compared to the speed of backing them up remotely).
A VPS will give you access to a linux box, and you can pretty much do with it what you want (within the TOS).
Dedicated backup services do exist, two examples I know of are http://www.bqbackup.com/ and http://rsync.net/, but for 500Gb these are going to cost even more than the dedicated server you mention.
