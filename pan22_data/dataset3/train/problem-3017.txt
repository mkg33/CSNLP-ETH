A few years ago I found and installed a small Windows utility that enabled me to navigate by using keystrokes instead of the mouse.
I have tried lots of googling but nothing came up.
URL's and disk locations are automatically opened in a browser / explorer as required (I tested this on Windows XP moments ago).
It ran in the background, and with a keyboard shortcut it brought up a command prompt with a translucent background in which you could type a URL, a disk location or other resource types.
So do URL's, but they probably rely on your Internet Explorer history (ie, no so good if you use another browser).
The Windows run box can automatically open many things, press Windows Key + R to quickly get the box up, type in what you're after.
Some time later, the team that developed this utility joined Mozilla to work on some ergonomic stuff there and they stopped developing the application ;) I can't remember if it was open-sourced or not.
Disk locations also auto-fill (eg, typing c:\program files\a should show a drop down of all folders starting with a inside your program files for easy selection).
After pressing Enter, it would open that resource in the relevant application.
I imagine many "other resource types" should be as well, because the run box just triggers the default action for the file/resource/etc - it has the same effect as double-clicking on the target.
I believe the app was originally written in Python for what it's worth.
