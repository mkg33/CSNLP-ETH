Recently while installing Oracle 12C DB on Windows server 2008 R2.
($ORACLE_HOME/dbs/orapw$ORACLE_SID) to the same directory on the standby site.
If you're using a pfile, add the parameter to init$ORACLE_SID.ora instead.
standbysite:/u01/app/oracle/product/11gR2/dbs/orapw$ORACLE_SID)
10) Bounce the standby and verify that it is recovering from the primary properly in managed recovery mode.
7) login to Oracle as SYSDBA locally (sqlplus "/ as sysdba")
3) orapwd file=orapw$ORACLE_SID password=yourpasswordhere
I solved the problem in 11g by creating a password file with the following.
5) Enable the remote login password parameter in the spfile (alter system set REMOTE_LOGIN_PASSWORDFILE=exclusive scope=spfile;)
Now am unable to login remotely into the machine with this user, though user is in Remote Desktop Users Group.
I created an user called Oracle through the Oracle DB installation setup.
4) login to Oracle as SYSDBA locally (sqlplus "/ as sysdba")
Next, the IPSOFT user must be granted SYSDBA on the primary DB.
