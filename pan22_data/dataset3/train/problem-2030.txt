I have tested most of the previous solutions, they don't work after a restart of the Raspberry Pi ( the command rpcinfo -p | grep nfs gave me nothing ).
In reality, you only need them started at level 3, so I edited /etc/init.d/rcpbind, /etc/init.d/nfs-common and /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server so "# Default-Start: 3" and ran this to enforce it -
