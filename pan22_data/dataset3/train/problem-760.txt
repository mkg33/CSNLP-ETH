So I thought the display option in MATLAB can be set to the guest-system X-display which I did by:
If you log into machine A via ssh from machine B, and then run the matlab terminal command in the home directory of A, create a file in the home directory titled java.opts with the contents:
Even then I am getting the OpenGL error and there is no graphical output (matlab runs in shell and figure windows do not pop up).

I had this same issue and solve it using the guide from:
I suppose this issue is related to forwarding the graphics to guest system via ssh.
I am connecting to a local server that runs MATLAB (version 2015a) via ssh with the X forwarding option (ssh -X).
The host has centos-7 and the guest has fedora-20 and both have mesa-libGLU installed.
What is the right way to forward high quality graphics?
When I start MATLAB as root then instead of Permission denied in the first line, I get:
The graphics are terrible, even the text (See the screenshot below).
For myself, this made running matlab over ssh much, much better.
