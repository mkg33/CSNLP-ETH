I would like to link mydomain.com to 192.168.1.X only if I'm connected to my local network.
You'll need to use an internal DNS server on your network to host a DNS zone for mydomain.com.
Now, when I do a ping mydomain.com, it tries to connect to 192.168.1.X wherever I am, because I have the line 192.168.1.22 mydomain.com in my /etc/hosts file.
When you're not connected to your internal network mydomain.com will be resolved by whatever DNS servers you're using on those other networks.
Then when you're connected to your internal network mydomain.com will be resolved by your internal DNS server (assuming that you're using a DHCP server internally and that you're computer is configured to use DHCP for it's ip address configuration and that the DHCP server is configured to provide your internal DNS server to you via DHCP).
Otherwise, I would like to let the DNS servers resolve it (if I'm outside my network).
The problem with using the Hosts file is that it takes precedence over the DNS servers configured in your client TCP/IP configuration, so mydomain.com will always resolve to what is in the Hosts file, regardless of what network you're connected to.
Run script as needed to toggle between HOSTS files (and maybe also have the script reset the network interfaces).
