Someone can correct me when I am wrong here, but I do not believe an easy solution/button exists for such a thing.
Another solution would be to edit the virutalhost entires in your Apache log as such:
E.g just make the default behavior of the web server to redirect an IP to the corresponding domain.
Of course you can automate this using bash, perl or any other scripting language you would like.
Most sites have a dedicated ip (about 100 of them) The other sites are on a shared ip.
I have a WHM/cpanel server with about 200 sites on it.
For new accounts that contain a dedicated IP address, you can always use cPanel/WHM API for this sort of thing: post/pre ww account creation
The dedicated sites can be accseed by the ip address eg, http://123.123.123.123.
Is there a way to set up a mass redirect so that every site on a dedicated ip gets it's ip address redirected to the domain.
I know you can do this for each site via .htaccess or apache config file, but I want to avoid having to modify 100 sites, and have to do it again every time i create a new account.
