I had similar problem and accidentally found the solution for it.
If your first attempt to reset to factory defaults fails, do try again.
from the Network and Sharing Centre go to View network computers and devices inside that window you can see your router device.
It seams you are not the only one who experienced this problem with this router.
Router has some memory problems - probably low memory after some time and can't handle web requests.
When the router comes up, you can access the admin page of 192.168.1.1 only for about one minute.
It may take several attempts to bring it to Factory Default.
First in windows go to control panel> Network and internet
UPnP service is memory hungry and disabling your modem could have enough resources for web requests.
This is how I solved my problem to view router home page.
Itâ€™s probably because the router firewall is enabled and prevents the other devices to connect to it.
Do check that the network cable(s) are firmly inserted, and the ports indicate they're active (light and, or blinking).
These things are not precision devices, and can fail quite miserably.
In this case you have to reset the router (by pushing the reset button with a pin or power off then power on after about 15 seconds).

There is no good reason you shouldn't be able to reach the (web) configuration.
I am guessing that 192.168.1.1 requires certain port to open the router home page.
In case you're also wondering; Windows will not attempt to block you're ability to connect to your router unless of course you've made additional changes to the defaults in the windows firewall.
Using third mouse key open menu in your router device icon and select first option View device webpage.
Reset the router to it's factory defaults as described in the Users manual.
It should open 192.168.1.1:xxxxxx page with your router home page.
