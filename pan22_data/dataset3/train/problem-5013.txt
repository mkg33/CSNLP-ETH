The following Wikipedia section (Wikipedia's page on GPT: “Hybrid MBR” section) indicates possible usage of both GPT and a special type of MBR.
Your safest approach is likely to consider this to be not-very-standard.
GPT-aware boot processes will ignore that useless data, and rely on the information stored in another location on the disk, where the GPT standard specifies such information to be.)
In the spirit of Stack Exchange's standard of having one actual question per Stack Exchange question, I will answer one piece of your multi-question question.
Correction: If you have GPT, you must have an MBR.
It wouldn't surprise me at all if an operating system sticks to more common/traditional standards.
If you don't have an MBR with some specific data, then you aren't following the GPT standard.
However, when a system is using GPT compatibility, the data in the Protective MBR is untrusted and ignored, and is therefore useless.
(I generally try to answer all pieces, but since I have one answer readily available, I'll give you what I have right now.)
So even that isn't a traditional MBR implementation.
See: Wikipedia's page on GPT: “Protective MBR” section.
Therefore, the Hybrid GPT's special MBR could easily be wiped out, as a standard process.
(This Protective MBR says there is just one giant partition.
The boot code contained in this MBR is “modified to recognize GPT partitions”.
It is a custom MBR implementation designed to work with GPT.
