How long, in man-hour, does it take on average to create a:
Anyway what you're asking for is more related to the alchemy between those factors :
It's a bit like saying how much time it will take to build a house, without knowing what type of house, how big it is, who will live in it, who will built it, in which country you are, ect...
The best thing you can do is to analyse the project, split it into small component and analyse the time it will take for each component.
For some people it's a budget scale definition, to others it's a team scale definition, to others it's a art-resources quality scale definition.
The variety of different games (that are often their own type) is bigger than in the industry  and it's a lot more than most people even can imagine.
What phases can we split the game creation process in (story designing, writing the engine, creating art, testing ...) and how long would each of these take (for the above categories)?
In my general experience, this is what companies will allocate, based on how much profit they expect to make:
I know that this question depends really very much on plenty factors: 2D-Pong and a MMORPG are two totally different worlds; it also depends on creators' experience, on game quality, on the available technologies, on target platform and so on, but well, I guess we can categorize games and study the average (or maybe focus on real-world examples).
For examples on time taken to make games (published or not) I recommend searching for Post-Mortem articles on http://gamasutra.com - lot of wisdom and feedback there.
