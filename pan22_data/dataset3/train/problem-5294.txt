On Server 2008 it has changed to Administrative Tools -> Remote Desktop Services -> Remote Desktop Services Manager
Use Terminal Services Manager (in Administrative Tools) to connect to the server and see which sessions are still used.
I've seen it frequently where a VPN user gets booted off the VPN connection while connected to a terminal session.
There are times, also, when network hiccups will kick someone out of a session resulting in a dangling session.
You can reset and logoff existing sessions from there.
If you do not log of properly from an RDP session, but instead just close the window it will leave the session open, which is likely what is happening here.
As for how to deal with this remotely, you could install CopSSH on the server then run cmd when you get to the shell.
If you don't have TS Manager installed, install the additional admin tools from AdminPak.msi which is located in \Windows\System32 on the server.
This nearly always results in a dangling terminal session in my environment.
Remember that just closing the terminal session window does not log the session off.
Then you can use query session to get the session ID and logoff to log the session off.
If you are unabe to connect because there are too many sessions there are 2 options you can use to discconect these sessions:
