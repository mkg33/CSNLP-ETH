Comment-out that wmm_enable=1 line, restart hostapd, and you should find your n speeds up where they should be -- faster than g!
As to the 40MHz, if you are in the 2.4GHz range, there are only 3 (or maybe 4 where you are) non-overlapping channels and your use of 2 of those channels may still be causing issues for your neighbors and possibly you, as well.
You may be able to narrow it down by doing some traceroute tests to foreign sites to see if there's an obvious bottleneck.
If in-country connectivity is good, then the bottleneck is most likely your ISP.
It's either the connectivity between your country and others, or your ISP may just not have good connectivity to foreign sites.
This part of the default hostapd.conf is very misleading:
If you're like me, you probably read that and enabled WMM:
But as I said before, that has nothing to do with the problem you're trying to solve, so long as you can get good bandwidth to local servers.
WMM is a QoS service designed to leave bandwidth available for high-priority packets.
