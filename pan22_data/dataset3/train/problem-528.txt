If neither of the above then it can only really be the motherboard.
Again, not a nice thing to have to replace - especially on an Acer.
It may not sound like the HDD, but it very well could be.
If it is the power board or the LCD screen, repairs could be more expensive than the laptop itself as it is most likely out of warranty.
:(  Is it a whirring sound, maybe like a faint lawnmower sound?
Regardless of what the problem is, if you don't have a backup of your data already, now would be a really good time to make one.
My laptop makes a squealing sound every time I plug it in and it "charges" the battery.
If it is a capacitor ready to burst, you'll need to do some soldering if you intend to try and replace them yourself.
Unfortunately for me, it squeals with both the battery and the power cord plugged in, but once the battery is "charged" the squealing goes away.
As a result of another part breaking, it could damage the disk as well.
If it is a battery or the harddrive, I guess you are in luck as you can do this yourself reasonably cheaply
The battery is long dead, and is probably dead in a 4 year old laptop as well.
If you keep your laptop plugged in all the time and you've checked the screen, fans and hard drive as stated above, then you have nothing to worry about other than a minor annoyance.
Are you doing anything or have you been doing anything noticeable for it to start happening?
Either that or you have dirty power coming into your laptop.
To begin with, it would be helpful to know what component it is that has failed.
Check to see if this occurs when on AC power only.
If you can determine the failing component from the checks above, you will know what to replace.
You mentioned that it only happens from time to time?
