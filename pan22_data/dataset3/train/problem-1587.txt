I've searched the net and the settings and I have not found anything that seems to do what I want.
PowerPoint still works with PPA add-ins as of Office 2016, but if that add-in hasn't been updated for the multiple layout object model introduced in PPT 2007, it might well not work.
I will be upgrading to PowerPoint 2016 soon, if that changes anything.
However, if and when I do make presentations, i would still want to start with a blank canvas.
when PowerPoint opens, I would like for it to show me a blank presentation with no preformatted text boxes like the following, preferably with multiple blank slides (use case below):
Currently, it starts with some text boxes like this:
The default theme/template seems to require that you click on the "Blank" in the start screen, and I can't seem to get the add-in from SKP to work.
Start a new presentation by doubleclicking that, then save to a new name if needed.
Your simplest solution might be to create a "starter" PPT with a bunch of pre-made blank slides in it, then put a shortcut to it on your desktop or wherever it's convenient/easily accessible.
I find it advantageous to use PowerPoint as a place to keep screenshots during tech support calls.
I have looked into changing the default theme/template and setting a default layout.
I guess it's not compatible, or Outlook 2013 doesn't do *.PPA files anymore.
This is my primary purpose in using PowerPoint, and only occasionally do I make presentations with it.
