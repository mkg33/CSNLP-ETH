You implied you'd checked with with Connect As, but just to be sure please check this in Server.app -> Users -> Right-click a user and select Edit Access to Services.
There is a set of presets in Workgroup Manager for correct default Group (staff vs students), home directory path, etc.
Old accounts (created pre-May) still can, and not just with cached credentials (clients wiped and restored).
Also compare user records in Directory Utility (/System/Library/CoreServices/Directory Utility.app) -> Directory Editor -> Viewing: Users in node: /LDAPv3/127.0.0.1; pay special attention to the AltSecurityIdentities, AuthenticationAuthority, HomeDirectory, and NFSHomeDirectory attributes.
Another possibility is that something has gone sideways in the kerberos setup.
For more control, install the appropriate version of the Server Admin Tools, and use Server Admin -> server name in sidebar -> Access tab -> Services subtab.
I have a Mac OS 10.7 server, and a number of 10.6.8 clients in a school.
For the last year and half, network accounts could log into the clients with no problem.
An OS 10.7.4 client CAN log in with the new account, just not the 10.6.8 ones.
Since about May, all new accounts cannot log into the 10.6.8 clients.
I have checked all of the usual subjects (DNS issues, path issues, file permissions) and the logs - nothing.
The first thing that comes to mind is service access lists -- if the new accounts aren't allowed to use the AFP service, they can't mount their home directories, and hence cannot log in.
I can connect to shares using the new accounts (Connect As...), just simply cannot log in.
I do find it interesting that we started having issues at the same time as the 10.7.4 update.
Compare what appears in the KDC log (/var/log/krb5kdc/kdc.log) in a successful vs. failed login, and maybe also the password server log (/Library/Logs/PasswordService/ApplePasswordServer.Server.log).
