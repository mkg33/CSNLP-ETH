As we know, Suhosin hardens PHP and adds another layer of security.
Which version (and associated libraries) are maintained by an upstream provider (your Linux distro, assuming you're running Linux.)
It's just as bad as people who think disabling PHP functions makes a server secure.
Currently on my local machine I am running my code with PHP 5.3.5, so there is nothing inherently in PHP 5.4/5.5 that I need for my scripts to work.
Just keep PHP updated and focus on securing the server and services.
But unfortunately there is no official release for PHP 5.4/5.5 (that I can find anyway).
Suhosin is an old idea/concept which really is no longer a relevant in this day and age.
Do I go with the newer PHP 5.4/5.5 which I presume are more secure than the older 5.3, or do I go with the older PHP 5.3 but with the security hardening patch of Suhosin?
The most secure PHP version is the one you keep updated.
If so, make sure that you allocate the time needed to keep up with all security patches, not just in PHP, but also in libraries required by your application.
