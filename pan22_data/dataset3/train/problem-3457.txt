Based on the chosen answer, I modified the script from Microsoft to set the WMI security.
You may also have to grant "DCOM remote access permissions" and/or "DCOM remote launch and activation permissions" depending on what exactly you are trying to do.
2) Run wmimgmt.msc, right click "WMI Control (LOCAL), goto Security tab and grant the appropriate user "Enable Account" and "Remote Enable" on the desired namespace (usualy CIMV2).
What permissions/rights does my user require for this?
I'm writing a monitoring service that uses WMI to get information from remote machines.
If I manage to get it done for the entire domain I'll come back and update.
Having local admin rights on all these machines is not possible for political reasons.
and used  a powershell script to add this user to WMI Control.
This MSDN article gives the step-by-step procedures.
After granting my user the EnableAccount, RemoteEnable, and ExecuteMethods permissions on the target namespace, I was able to access WMI.

The following worked for me in a 2012 r2 domain environment although I only managed to do it per server and not the entire domain:
Created a GPO Dit to put his user in the group "Performnce Log Users"
My test user was a non-administrative domain user who was a member of the "Remote Management Users" on the local system for reasons not related to this issue.
So, I did not add my user to the Performance Monitor Users or Distributed COM Users local groups.
