Again, the regex I gave above is probably overly complicated for what you need it to do.
(echo '<input_string>' | is the common alternative.)
Basically I'm replacing all the <br /> with a newline character and grabbing the relevant line with grep.
You can use grep with an extended regular expression (regex) for this:
'([-+.[:alnum:]]+://)?([-[:alnum:]]+.)*myURL.net(:[[:digit:]]+)?(/[[:graph:]]*)?
How can I extract one specific URL (of a spoecific domain) with sed?
<<< '<input_string>': We feed grep (which accepts a file) our input string using a here string.
Explanation of each part of the command and the regex:
This does not account for all possible (html allowed) variations of the <br> tag, but it handles the ones in your example.
You could use: sed 's/<br\ *\/>/\n/g' html_file | grep myURL.net
(The complexity is the result of an attempt to give a general solution.)
': This regex is probably a bit fancier than what you need, so you should simplify or remove parts that are needlessly complex for your purposes.
