essentially I have gotten to a point in the process where there are two distinct inboxes for each address--One Postfix, and one Cyrus.
I have experimented with symlinking them together, however the naming conventions for new messages do not match between the two so I am not sure how to "combine them" so to speak.
Youre are looking for virtual_transport = lmtp:unix:/var/lib/imap/socket/lmtp see evt.
As of right now, email sent locally on the box goes to the adresses cyrus inbox, which is somewhere within /var/spool/imap/domain, and mail coming from external machines is going to the posfix inbox at /var/mail/mailboxes.
So just not sure how to put them together, any advice would be really appreciated.
I am setting up a email server on a centos box where I am using the virtual(8) delivery agent within postfix so that I dont need to create a unix user for each email address, and I have set up Cyrus with sasl auth to handle imap.
