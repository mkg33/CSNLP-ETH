We then got some conversion, say 20% of people writing reviews.
If you have just a few dedicated players, TALK TO THEM - setup a forum, a private chat, forum anything like this.
I cannot tell you what that carrot is for your game and there are differences between players.
give them VIP access, treat them as VIPs (cause they are :))
We a F2P game and we've tried a number of things in the last 4 years, and almost always a carrot works the best.
If you are asking players for a review, find a place in the game when they get the first high.
Ideally, offer something for the review (see above - some carrot).
Not because people thought it was a 3 out of 5 game, but we naturally rate games this way.
Find a time/place in the game where they feel great, or when they feel the game is great.
For one person, simply a badge "Friend of the game" is enough.
however, we still had a lot of 3/5 or 4/5 reviews.
In Realm of Empires, when a person captured their second town, they get a big high.
then we added a added a "5 star reviews are most appreciated and help us grow!
In my experience, people are willing to do a lot for a benefit.
Later we tried to offer a carrot - we offered some free credits as a thank you / congratulations.
another lesson, learned from different examples is to be direct - tell players directly what you want them to do.
From my experience, yes, do it but you are right to be careful.
:)" at the end of the message, resulting in VAST majority of reviews 5 of out 5 now.
For another person, it is a benefit in the game, perhaps money or some in game currency.
