I also want to add that because you're already using the E97379 on the i5-6500 (assuming temperatures and noise are fine), I would assume the E97379 cooling the 65W TDP i5-6500 would work more than adequately with the i3-6100 at 51W TDP.
I'm not sure why the one I have is over 3x the amperage of the others, but I want to avoid buying the Delta manufactured part in case the vibration issue is related to them.
Is it ok to use any E97379 heatsink for Core i3-6100 regardless of the revision(?)
I have another Intel build with a Core i5-6500 and E97379-001 Foxconn 0.17A, which is pretty dang quiet.
I'm looking to replace my Core i3-6100 heatsink/fan with another stock Intel one.
I've used different generation Intel stock heaksinks (one from a Celeron G1820 LGA 1150 socket for an i7-6700k on the LGA 1151 socket) and it worked perfectly fine.
I'm only interested in the push-pin style and it pretty much seems that Intel heatsinks are the only type that have it.
As long as the heatsink can handle the TDP of the CPU (51W) and it supports the socket (LGA1151) you can use any type of heatsink.
The one I have now has a vibration that I can't isolate.
However, it appears that, as I'm shopping around, there are a lot of different manufacturers I found on Amazon for the same E97379-003 part.
