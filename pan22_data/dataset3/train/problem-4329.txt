I want to make that remote Linux application window to behave as close as possible to a normal local Windows application.
I would say that VNC has been into Windows for a longer time with a longed user base and its a more tried and tested solution.
Another comment, is that many anti-virus packages like to complain about some components in VNC, typically reporting the view capture software as trojans.
VNC is a nice simple remote protocol, but it always seems to choke on some condition that makes it less than ideal for serious use.
Based on the request for making it work as is you were runing as an App in windows, it sounds like X is the best choice.
You won't notice almost any lag, I use it to work on a remote desktop in Internet and while some lag is noticeable it's something completely doable (with a 1Mb ADSL).
There are lots of options for Windows, you could try the free version of RealVNC.
They'r not, but if you are in a strict enterprise environmennt, X is more tolerated than VNC.
I need to use an RubyMine IDE running on a Linux machine from a Windows desktop.
