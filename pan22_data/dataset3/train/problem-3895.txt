Have tried all the usual ipconfigs (release, renew, flush DNS, etc.).
You can do this by right-clicking the computer icon in the taskbar, opening network & sharing center, and clicking on the "view adapters" in the left-hand column.
I've pinged the Ethernet adapter and it's working fine.
I even bought a wireless adapter for the desktop, thinking if everything is working wirelessly, it would too.
Already talked with ISP and nothing wrong with the router.
All wireless devices work perfectly (printer, phone, tablet, laptop) and never lose connection to the network.
Find out which one has connection, and disable all the others.
All wireless devices have IP address as 192.168.1.x.
(Your one that should be the main connection will probably be called "Realtek Network adapter, Local area connection 1, etc.)
Desktop is connected to the 2Wire modem/router via ethernet.
Then I started losing internet connection on my desktop.
Recently added a new wireless printer (HP Photosmart) and everything was working fine.
Try to disable any other network adapters you may have installed on your computer, as these may be interfering with your main connection.
But nope, connects for a few minutes and then says not connected.
It's just the desktop, which is the only thing connected via ethernet!
The auto IP address for Ethernet adapter is 169.254.191.128.
