Rather old question I see, but unfortunately the slhck's solution two doesn't work for me (OS X Mountain Lion, bash) I get an error.
Check out GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick, they have command line tools for all sort of mangling of graphics files (including boring stuff like transforming to another format).
OS X has sips, which can convert images to (almost) any format.
I have 10k+ GIF files that I need to convert to PNG or JPEG preferably using command line so that I can automate it.
It's a great tool, and I suggest to install it using brew see brew homepage
For other formats you should change extensions (remembering the sips jpg format is always jpeg, the extension could be .jpg)
This one works for me (after cd my_dir_with_gif command of course):
For example, to convert every .gif to .jpeg, putting them into a folder called jpegs:
And if you want to set the jpg compression as well ([low|normal|high|best|<percent>])
Or, to recursively convert them using find, which will place a JPEG file with the same name as the GIF next to it.
I'm not worried about losing quality or transparency, just need to prepare files for OCR software.
