Because testdisk can read almost every disk format like fat,fat32,NTFS,ext2,3,4 and so on.
Step 3) I found only one program which can mount DD file:
Step 4) For recovery from mounted DD Image I used:
Because every user doesn't know every platform but its core is so similar.
I used Data rescue DD which created image file as "DD" format (*.dd).
If you wanna search a file when there is nothing shown while testdisk scan, I recommend to use photorec (usually comes with testdisk) for any extension of file.
- PassMark OSFMount - This program mounts DD File as selected drive letter but not every recovery program detects this drive.
Portable USB Hardrive get corrupted (Bad sectors) and now is detecting as RAW.
Step 1) To not damage HDD even harder I though the best to do is Clone HDD into image.
Bellow programs detects mounted image but can't handle RAW Drive:
I'm trying to find golden solution to deal with this so Everyone including me will have example what to do to recover files.
For this situation I suggest to tell us what you wanna do after you mount the raw disk image.
- TestDisk 7.0-WIP - This program couldn't find any partitions
Step 2) Found only one program which can handle DD image format without mounting:
Is there any other program that can handle mounted DD RAW Drive?
Is the any other program which can work on DD file (RAW HDD) directly?
I am using Linux so that raw disk image files can be mounted easily just typing "mount rawDisk.dd /tmp/myMountPoint".
Is the any other program which can Clone RAW HDD into different image format?
