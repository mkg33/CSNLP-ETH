You can't block applications at a router level, unless they use a different port.
The similar Software Restriction Policys i think have existed since windows 2000, im not familiar with that tough.
Why not just remove all the IE shortcuts and do not allow users to run programs manually?
You might be able to block IE, if you can detect the UserAgent string, but that seems dubious as well.
in win7 2008r2 you can use AppLocker wich is deployed trough GroupPolicys.
IANANG (I am not a Netowork God), however this seems pretty impossible to me.
Agreed with all above ppl, proxy is your best shot for disabling IE.
For example, if you block port 80, it's going to block IE/Firefox/etc.
In applocker its just to disable the exe's filehash to be run from the computer.
If your management doesn't support your efforts at security, I'd consider looking to work somewhere that does.
Outlook Express should appear as an SMTP client and as such you won't be able to detect it on a router or firewall.
Unfortunately you made a genuinely bad decision in getting them XP Home - save now, pay later.
If you want a more secure enviroment generally your users should be users not admins/local admins.
Use ACT(Application compability toolkit) to cheat the app to think its being run by an admin.
You shouldn't have to fight with users about what software is approved for company use.
Violating IT policy should be something taken seriously in your organization.
The best thing to do is to accept that and put in XP Pro; at least then you can start implementing some local Group Policy to lock things down to a more sensible level (although without AD you're going to have to do this on each machine individually - hope you don't have too many of them!)
