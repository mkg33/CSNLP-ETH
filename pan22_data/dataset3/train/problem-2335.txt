If your mail domain points to the GCE server's IP address, there is currently no way to add a PTR (reverse DNS), as this feature is not yet implemented by Google.
Setting up ptr record was answerd in Julie Pelletiers post (you should contact ISP who owns IP you're sending mail from).
Find the option to add DNS record either PTR or Reserve DNS under your hosting account.
That is not something done through Cloudflare, which would be impossible since the IP addresses they use are shared (as described on their site).
First you should know where you're sending email from.
In third case, that company should have PTR and delivery problem might be related to it's reputation or missing/bad spf/dkim records.
If you have modified domain name server then you won't be able to add any DNS record under your godaddy account.
For sometime now we have observed decrease in our mails deliverability to users inbox.
That record needs to be created by your SMTP server's ISP for its static IP address.
One of the method to resolve the issue is to add PTR Record.
Could you please help me with how and where to add PTR Record?
I have a domain from Godaddy, its application runs at Google Compute Engine and is traffic controlled by Cloudflare.
Login to GoDaddy and Select domain, go to Manage DNS and Modify DNS there you will have option to Add PTR record.
In first two cases, you should have PTR (reverse) record set for IP you're sending email from and value should be hostname of your server.
The PTR record (also called reverse DNS record) is not located in the domain's zone but in the ARPA's zone, as it relates to the IP address, not the domain name.
Collect more information about your email settings and mail delivery reports (bounced emails and email server delivery logs should provide necessary data) and update your post.
