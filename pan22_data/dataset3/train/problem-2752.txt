I've never attempted an NT 4 to 2003 upgrade, and I don't know if it's even possible.
I want to make a Windows Server 2008 machine join the domain and also become a Domain Controller.
The 2008 R2 server will be able to interact with 2003 AD comfortably (but be sure you're using R2 of the 2003 server).
Microsoft provided an upgrade path from NT4 to Server 2003.
10 - Upromote the VM Domain controller to stand alone server
Your best bet is to upgrade your PDC to Windows 2000, enable Active Directory, and then upgrade to Windows Server 2003 R2 (the R2 is important).
Once you have AD up and running on Windows Server 2003, you should be able to upgrade from there to Windows Server 2008 R2.
Though I've not considered it, it's more than likely that you can run your AD on 2000 level, but I'd go to 2003 because it's just better.
Anything before Windows 2000, where Active Directory was introduced, is not pretty.
Since Windows 2000 Windows domains use Active Directory, whereas NT4 domains don't, so I doubt this is possible.
4 - Promote the VM Win-NT to PDC so you can try the migration process without break service or lose the service :)
I have a Windows NT 4 Server that is running as a Domain Controller and has Active Directory running on it.
At that point, you will upgrade your domain and forest to 2003 level.
1 - install another windows NT on a Virtual Machine.
3 - make sure that you have replicated it with your PDC
8 - when finished migrate the PDC server and the Time server, GC etc from the VM to the new server.
6 - Now we have a DC in windows 2k make sure everything is ok and that the users still have connectivity migrate all information from the old server to the VM.
5 - In the VM promoted PDC begin to install windows 2000 upgrading it from NT to W2k.
[EDIT: Ansgar has a link in his answer which points at an upgrade path.]
Windows NT don't have active directory, you will need to upgrade your domain to windows 2000.
