It really does do some awesome package management.
aptitude is a wrapper for dpkg just like apt-get/apt-cache, but it is a one-stop-shop tool for searching/installing/removing/querying.
aptitude does have some additional features, like aptitude changelog somepkg and things like holding packages (to stop them being upgraded) - nothing you couldn't achieve via other commands/methods, it's just more unified and nice to use.
aptitude tracks, at the moment of install, the packages that come with the installed one so when you remove the latter aptitude will ask you for the removal of the other (now unused) "orphaned" dependencies.
Firstly it can handle complicated inter-dependencies without intervention by yourself, which often apt-get fails on.
it looks like the latest versions of apt-get has a similar functionality:
To search for a package and install it, using apt-get:
But if you don't like the solution it has presented you (and it will score its own solution to demonstrate how good it thinks it is), you can ask it to go away and come up with another solution to resolve the conflict.
If you had to settle on just one tool or the other for some reason then you need to decide how much effort you want to put into your package management.
Aside from providing a pretty console UI when you run aptitude with no arguments, it combines the various apt-* commands (and dselect) into one utility..
One of the serious advantages of aptitude is its ability to calculate dependencies.
the apt tools, interactively just fine with a lot more effort to get the same results that aptitude provides.
apt-get will keep them in your system silently if you remove the "main" package.
as you know when you install a package if it needs other packages (dependencies) they will be downloaded and installed too.
The biggest difference is that aptitude is designed to be interactive where the apt tools are better suited for scripting work.
