versions were also supposedly all backwards compatible, but there were quite a few problems with 4x cards in 2x slots from memory (or maybe it was 2x cards in 1x slots).
As others have already said, technically, yes... but...
PCIe is backwards-compatible, so you can use 1.0 cards in 2.0 motherboards and 2.0 cards in 1.0 motherboards.
I seem to recall in the early days of AGP that the 1x, 2x, 4x, etc.
If I buy a PCI-E v2.0 graphics card (Nvidia Geforce GTX 275) will it work correctly and to the full potential with my PCI-E v1.0 motherboard (Asus P5B-Deluxe) ?
Invariably, the conclusion was that the slower bus didn't hurt performance noticeably at all.
However, i'm not positive you'll be reaching the maximum capacity of the card as the PCI-E v1.0 slot has a slower bus speed.
Although it was designed to be backwards-compatible, the implementation was flawed and in practice it turned out there were some combinations that did not work as they should.
(So a PCIe 1.0 x16 interface is comparable to PCIe 2.0 x8.)
As to reaching the full potential of your graphics card, it's true that PCIe 1.0 is half the speed of PCIe 2.0.
Providing you have the power and space requirements, it will work.
But single graphics cards really don't saturate the bus anyway: if you dig around through older tech articles, you'll find a number of reviews of video cards in the x8 PCIe slots of early SLI/CrossFire motherboards.
