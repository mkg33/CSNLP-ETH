This way your computer is either in sleep mode, with quick recovery.
Your motherboard likely has states S0-S5 with S0 being the "ON" state and S5 being the "OFF" state.
You must use full shutdown every time you want to encrypt your data at rest.
On power up it is able to skip the BIOS and may also skip features that you want, like BitLocker.
The important bit here is that hibernation is both a software state and a hardware state.
When it receives the command to enter S4 it doesn't really power off.
Then you want to do the whole boot sequence, including BitLocker, but then rapidly resume your Windows session.
Then it tells the hardware to enter state "S4" which is a low power mode that isn't really off.
When you press the Hibernate button in Windows it saves the contents of RAM to disk so that it can recover from a power loss.
It sounds like you want to use the software Hibernation features and then put the Hardware in to S5, full power off.
It will never again be in a state where it appears to be off but is actually unencrypted.
