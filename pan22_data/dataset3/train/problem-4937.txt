There is an advantage to installing another tape drive the same into the new server, making the ability to mix and match the media.
Backup to portable disk - ideally an eSATA one rather than USB - it'll be much faster than tape, I would imagine cheaper too, if you go for a two disk mirrored box then it'll be pretty reliable too.
The disadvantage may well be that the rev drive is an old way of doing things.
What if the director has an emergency and isn't available when you need one of the backups?
My suggestion is to find an appropriate offsite storage service that fits your budget.
I'm thinking of advantages like half the backup time etc.
The function of the drive would be daily backups where we can simply insert the disk and everything gets backed up, then one copy would be sent off site with a director every night in case of any loss or damage to the site.
My question is: if we are going to pay around Â£200 for a new Iomega internal REV drive, is there any newer technology that would be more of an advantage and outweigh the fact that we already have REV media.
What if they're let go or quit, and it's a less than amicable split?
Just a note: In my opinion, sending your backups home with an employee (director or otherwise) is not an appropriate solution for storing and protecting your backups.
Our other (older) samba server uses an Iomega Internal REV tape drive for backups.
