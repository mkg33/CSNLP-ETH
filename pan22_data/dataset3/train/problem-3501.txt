I have two displays, but only my primary display is affected.
In this GIF, I move my mouse into the area and attempt to select some text, but nothing happens.
When I'm in Windows, if I click inside a certain area in the centre of the screen, the mouse click does not register, and if the cursor should change based on the content I'm hovering over, it doesn't.
When I then move my mouse out of the area, the cursor changes to the correct "text selector" cursor and I can select the text fine.

I installed another virus scanner, deinstalled AVIRA and now everything is fine again.
It cost me about 4 hours to figure out what was actually going on... :-(
A strange problem has developed on my Windows 10 machine.
It obviously tried to open an ad window but the script got stuck.
There is a short delay after Windows startup before this problem begins, and it also doesn't occur on the Windows lock screen.
The problem must've been caused by some sort of adware program, because I ran ADWCleaner and the problem was instantly resolved without the need for even a restart.
If you minimize everything (so as to not accidentally close the wrong application) then click into the empty space and press alt + f4 it will close that invisible application that's running.
I know this thread is old but thought that I'd add that I was having this problem and after reading this thread I went into my settings and turned off the pop up blocker and the problem was instantly fixed

The mouse wheel and clicks (left, right and middle) don't work while the mouse is in this area.
In my case it was a malfunctioning of the AVIRA virus scanner and the area was in the top left corner of the screen.
