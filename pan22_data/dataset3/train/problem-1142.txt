As for the pdf itself, are you sure it's being displayed at boot, or is it displayed at login time?
Seeing as you don't know what is on it there is nothing to lose.
With a fresh image you will be sure not to have any other weird artifacts such as you already have with the pdf.
If it's the latter then you should look in the /etc/update-motd.d/ directory to see if any script in there is running it.
Check ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart or  /etc/xdg/LXDE/autostart.
Backup the current image of your sd card to your computer (google how if you need help) you can always go back to it.
Typically the role of a session manager is to restore windows you had open before a reboot, but it's possible that the session manager was either configured to re-open the PDF on every login, or this entry got stuck (e.g.
due to a permissions problem) so the document re-opens even if it shouldn't.
Another possibility is that session manager is installed, which re-opens some programs on login.
Personally I would recommend starting with a fresh image.

Once you identify which service is loading the pdf, execute the following command and the pdf should stop displaying when you boot the RPi.
I want to dive deep in it's programming, but I've faced a disturbing problem:
If the system was setup to display a pdf, you will see it among other services that are enabled to startup when the RPi boots.
I found the PDF file, but I'm afraid, if I'w delete it, it would cause issue during boot process.
I can close it, but I don't want to do regulary, I would like to remove of its boot seqeuence.
You will have to determine which service is auto-loading the pdf by executing the following command that will show all enabled services.
One place to look for the autoboot sequence is in the /etc/systemd/system folder where you will find files with a .service extension.
Just download a new OS (which will have changed since whatever you are using) and install it.
Most likely you have an entry in LXDE autostart file which opens the document.
Run sudo grep -r "name_of.pdf" * on the root directory and report back the matching files if you need further help.
I checked the .bashrc file, but it doesn't include reference to this.
Replace the [filename] with the name of the service that is loading the pdf.
