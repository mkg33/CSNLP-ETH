This seemed kind of tedious and figured someone out there had already come up with an easier method:
If you like, you can repeat the process to consolidate files back to your original location.
Well, you can manually do it by exporting the list of music in your library by right clicking the Music in the top left frame and selecting "Export."

Then head to File -> Library -> Organize Library….
I believe there are music files in my iTunes folder that aren’t in my library.
Assuming OS X, although instructions should be very similar for Windows.
Once the copy is completed, delete your old iTunes Media folder.
This will copy all files in your iTunes library to your new location, and will not copy files that are not in your library.
Then you could compare this to what is inside of your iTunes folder.
As usual, you should back up your files before doing either of the above just in case!
An alternative may involve making use of the iTunes preferences for keeping your music folder organized - maybe if you move where iTunes stores its music in your settings, it'll move just the files you're using?
Click Change… beside iTunes Media folder location.
