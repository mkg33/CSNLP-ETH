This is an Office product meant for Office Document collaboration.
Yeah you can store other document types but I remember in documentation that SharePoint isn't supposed to replace your File Servers... but I believe it had to do with a upload size limitation.
People are using Sharepoint Server (moss 2007) for a little bit of work but its still not widely used yet.
I have file servers that I inherited with little documentation on the complex file permissions.
I wanted to know how many people have gone the route of nearly or completing replacing your standard file server which we have all come to become so comfortable with by using Sharepoint.
You can't put EXE files on a Sharepoint site; there's probably other restricted executable content as well.
I was wondering if this would be a good time to upgrade to 2010 (not sure which version yet) in an attempt to largely reduce my usage of file servers.
What kinda of limitations prevent you from fully replacing file servers?
I feel like I could get away with Foundation but I'd need to make sure what features of MOSS are being used before determining if features would be missed.
