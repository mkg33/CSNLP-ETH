I think that is why you get bad performance, because VLC is using software encoding and Raspberryis not powerful for that task.
There is element for hardware video encoding that would make good server from your Raspberry.

I had the same problem, found this thread when searching for a hardware encoder, not for c920 issues.
I posted a possible solution in raspberry forum using a lightweight RTSP server based on live555 that capture H264 from a V4L2 driver.
For me there is dramatic difference between 1000ms buffer and 200ms buffer.
If I understood your situation well, you want Raspberry to transcode video to H264?
This seems to work for me @ least... cvlc v4l2:// :v4l2-dev=/dev/video0 :v4l2-width=640 :v4l2-height=480 --sout="#transcode{vcodec=h264,vb=800,scale=1,acodec=mp4a,ab=128,channels=2,samplerate=44100}:rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/live.ts}" -I dummy
This was done for the raspicamera, but it should works with any V4L2 device that provide H264.
Try with larger buffer on the client displaying the video.
I would suggest to to try with Gstreamer and gst-omx plugins.
Nevertheless, execute a firmware update for the raspberry pi and the garbage should be gone
