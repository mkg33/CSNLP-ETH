This sends to default printer with printer's current settings and current settings of each file.
I also noticed that if I open a blank Word window and re-size it to the bare minimimum rectangle on Desktop (this is not minimizing it to status bar) before I sent multiple files to Print, efficiency of Word with opening, sending and closing each file was increased.
Now we are switching to Windows 7 and I will need to figure out a new way and I did notice the file limit is 15 (if you select more than 15, "print all" is not available in R-click menu), which then you cannot just click on print and leave the computer to do something else, you have to wait until all printed and do it again.
I print all documents (usually up to 30-32 documents) at once from a folder, by selecting all of them and then R-click and choose print.
Also, the efficiency with which Windows XP and MSW 2003 opened a document and sent to print is way better than Windows 7 (but I was running 7 from a MAC Parallels Program).
This was possible using Windows XP Professional, with MS Word 2003.
