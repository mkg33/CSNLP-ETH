Toggling GPUs is easy enough, usually, if you have them and have the ability to force the machine to use one or the other, but that's pretty hardware-dependent.
The documentation you linked calls out the four most common reasons for a device reset:
You probably don't want to physically remove the device to stimulate the error, as most consumer PCs are not set up to safely hot-swap that way.
Note that you can just wrap the calls that might return DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED, ignore their actual return value, and pretend it was DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED on a temporary basis.
Downgrading drivers should work as well, so you can just toggle between two driver versions while your code is executing to make sure you react correctly.
This can be a quick way to test that the code path for handling the error works at the most basic level, although it is still good to check by stimulating the error for real, because the real error will come with side-effects that are much harder for you to simulate.
So you should update your drivers to trigger the error.
Similarly it's not that easy to make the device crash and have to reset.
