You can get a single cert for both www.domain.com and domain.com.
Hopefully, you can directly write this code in your web.config to get things done.
After installation I found this module in IIS 8.5 then I added new rules.
There's no way around these requirements, I'm afraid.
These multi-domain certificates are generally more expensive though.
Actually I generated above code in web.config by installing "URL Rewrite Module" using Web Platform Installer.
You can't use HOST headers to differentiate between the two requests, because that's far too late (thus, separate IP addresses).
I setup both domains each with their own conf files, (shared)cert, and separate home dirs then added an html meta refresh in the index.html at domain.com to redirect to www.domain.com.
If you can't do that, you're out of luck, unfortunately.
I had exact same requirement like redirect all https://domain.com to https://www.domain.com and also redirect all http to https, here how I achieved and get it working IIS 8.5.
And unless you have a valid certificate, the browser is going to choke, so you also need the 2nd cert.
