I'm using "StartIsBack" and I have to say that its a whole better experience than using stock MS WIN8 taskbar ..
There's a link here that might help: Removing Windows 8.1â€™s universal desktop taskbar and i think the screenshot says it all (which i unfortunately can't post yet due to rep) - so you'll have to make dow tih the link: screenshot
I don't know any way to keep the taskbar visible all the time.
would be to install Modern MIX from Stardock's website and give it a try.
Right click on taskbar > Properties > Uncheck auto hide taskbar.
right click anywhere on the taskbar ---> PROPERTIES ---> uncheck "auto-hide the taskbar "
With the recent Windows 8.1 update we are able to run "Metro" apps inside the desktop view, but when so, the task bar fades away (hides) and it is very irritating to click twice and some times more to just make the task visible again.
Is there any way to force the task bar to be visible regardless if I'm using desktop applications or "Metro" application inside the desktop view?
But you can use a quick shortcuts to get this back.
I'll be testing this when i have access to my windows 8 machine, but for now this is all i have.
Also check whether you taskbar auto hide option is not enabled.
