A worn battery (and after 14 months it could be worn...) is continuously being recharged.
if you replaced a 95W Dell PSU with a 65W generic one) it will complain at boot and run the laptop is low performance mode.
As a result something has to give: Charge the battery slower or throttle down the laptop, possibly both.

And ideally the replacement should be able to deliver at least 2/3 of the original power (you're borderline OK there) but more is always better.
So double-check if the replacement PSU you are using now is really suitable.
This can cause the laptop getting very hot which in turn causes the CPU to "throttle down" to prevent overheating.
Also run it on JUST the battery and see if you get reasonable lifetime out of the battery.
It should have the same output voltage (within 10% of the original PSU, if it is not exactly the same a little higher is better then a little lower).
If that is out of spec it can cause all sorts of weirdness.
That should tell you if the battery is end-of-life and needs replacing.
a low power adaptor would make it charge slow but it will not actually slow down the laptop
The under powered power-supply might also be part of the problem.
The linked article is for alienware laptops (bought by Dell) but I have seen the same on the Dell lattitude series.
The original PSU had enough juice to power the laptop at full-speed and recharge the battery at the same time, but the current one not so much.
As Sean already wrote: A low power adaptor would make it charge slower, but it will not actually slow down the laptop.
... except in some cases where the laptop is made by Dell.
