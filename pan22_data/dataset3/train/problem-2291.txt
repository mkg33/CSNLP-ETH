Here is a copy of the "how to" with my variations (but you should have a look at the link to read "how it works")
The keyfile may present problems if you want to view the database on your phone, but if your phone has an SD card or other easy way to get files in it, you could work something out.
I'm thinking about starting using KeePass2 with the password database on Dropbox to manage my passwords.
You'll notice that Keepass2 asks you for a key file in addition to or instead of a password.
I would at least use a very simple password in any case.
NB: See the {DB_NAME} variable variation in the trigger setup below to handle this!
This will give you a decent compromise to the need to memorise two complex passwords but still keep your database sufficiently secure.
Do I need to memorize two complex, different passwords (one for KeePass and one for Dropbox) or is there a simple workaround for this I'm just not seeing?
Make a Dropbox specifically (and only) for your KeePass database which has a complex password, then keep a simpler password on your database.
I've been doing my research on the subject and I already moved a couple of passwords there to test the waters; so far, so good.
But if I store my Dropbox password on KeePass, and KeePass is stored on Dropbox, how would I access my file in the first place to log into Dropbox?
Assuming you're going to need to memorise at least one password, why not make the KeePass (or Dropbox) password simpler?
My most important passwords that I definitely want on KeePass are my Google account password and my Dropbox password.
I am using Keepass on my local storage and with the help of a trigger it is synchronized with dropbox.

Have your local file synchronised to Drop-Box, so you always have a local copy to find your Drop-Box password.
