The purpose of the setting is to make sure that you can not use up all of your memory and cause the OOM killer to start killing processes.
But this is not a limit on how much physical memory is used.
As it says, it limits committed address space, not physical memory usage.
According to this document: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting , if I set "vm.overcommit_memory" to "2", then "The total address space commit for the system is not permitted to exceed swap + a configurable amount (default is 50%) of physical RAM."
My question is, are the "vm.overcommit_ratio" and "vm.overcommit_kbytes" limiting the total sum of memory commit by all processes, or just limiting each process?
Of course the system will use pretty much all of its RAM.
I think it should be the latter, because it makes no sense to limit the system to use only half of physical memory in total, but the description in the document suggests it is limiting globally.
Also, "The overcommit amount can be set via 'vm.overcommit_ratio' (percentage) or 'vm.overcommit_kbytes' (absolute value)."
