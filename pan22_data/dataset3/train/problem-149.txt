It will point to a folder in c:...\Temporary Internet Files...
if all else fails, you can check in the registry to see where the temporary files are stored: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook\Security\OutlookSecureTempFolder
If you look in explorer and try to navigate to that folder, you won't see it.
For instance, in MS Word, open Prepare > Properties
I realize this is an old post, but this may be helpful for some who Google and come across this post looking for a solution.
Another way to know which folder is used is to open another attachment, and ask the editor where this file is.
I have my folder options to show all hidden files, and it still doesn't show up.
It was only after I did that was I able to view and navigate the Content.Outlook folder in Windows 7.
Another way to find the file is to use the advanced features of search and limit to .xl* files saved on the day in question.
If you try all the proposed solutions offered above, and find that none of them work for one reason or another, you may try right clicking on the Temporary Internet Files folder, select Advanced, then check the box for indexing all files.
