Run the batch sequence on the files/folders you wish to convert, and PRESTO, hundreds of documents converted in minutes!
Additionally, Acrobat 8 or Acrobat 9 Pro can run the PDF Optimizer in Batch Processing to convert multiple files at once; simply create a new sequence with no commands.
(Save A Copy, in contrast, just creates a byte-identical copy of the file.)
If you're using Ubuntu 11.04 (or probably any Gnome distro) and can view the PDF in the built-in Document Viewer, you can then Print to file to save it as a PDF-1.5.
Adobe Acrobat DC is $15/mo and its "Optimizing PDFs" dialog can do what you need
I work with some software that can't handle newer PDFs made with Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro and other newer office programs.
I did this today to convert a PDF from 1.6 to 1.5, so now I can use it with the FPDF lib.
In addition to the Ghostscript solution suggested above, you can use the "Reduce File Size" option in the "Document" menu of Adobe Acrobat 8 or 9, and choose the compatibility level you desire.
I used the PDF Optimizer/Batch Processing method to convert 297 PDF files in about 3-4 minutes (most were 1-page flyer type documents).
It's also worth noting that the PDF Optimizer can't convert secured documents ;)
In the sequence's Output Settings dialog, check the "PDF Optimizer" box and click the Settings button - enable or disable any optimization settings you'd like, and set the "Make compatible with" dropdown near the top to the appropriate Acrobat/PDF version you desire.
Price and platform doesn't matter as long as it's not too expensive.
