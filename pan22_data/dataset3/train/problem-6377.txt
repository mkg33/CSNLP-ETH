Maybe you can do what you want if you get an Open source Router and you may be able to make it do what you want like just use a static IP for your machine using the mac address as a way to identify it and set its IP and the rest of the network could bne DHCP.
Also check out this link and you may be able to do more with your router if it is supported
IDK as i have never done thins i am just throwing out ideas so Sorry for not having an answer for you.
from your question i see thats what you want so unless someone knows how to do it I would wait and stay with DHCP until someone gives a better answer.
Although if you dont have more than 1-2 pcs and nothing else on the network (printers media extenders etc) then I would not use Static IPs as IDK how or if it is possible to set these items with a static IP.
Also For the Open Source router I believe Netgear and D-Link make them I am sure more but IMO these two brands are the ones I would choose.
Personally I prefer D-link as they are the most customizeable routers i have found.)
IMO unless you have a REALLY good reason for why you want to do what you want I would just stick witrh DHCP.
I personally dont like Linksys since they were bought by novel (you would think they would be better but NOT IMO.
I dont know for sure But i believe unless you have a open source router then you will have to use static IP to do what you want.
Although the link posed by Bryan looks like a nice resource on DHCP ans Static IP issues.
