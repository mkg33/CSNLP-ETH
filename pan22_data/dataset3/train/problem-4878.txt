if you come up with some kind of logical/manageable system for organizing your hard-drives you should be golden.
In my previous job, our most common backup/archive method was using harddrives.
the only "difficult" part for us was managing what was saved on each disk.
Are you talking about data backups or data archival?
Other Server Fault people, leave their names in the comments, heck there is probably a question with the "what is the best online backup service" somewhere already.
I wouldn't feel comfortable backing up data on consumer grade drives...Maybe a netapp or an xiv but then your cost savings go out the window..
Then you don't care how they store it, they do and I bet the costs would end up being less.
It sounds like you're not dealing with terabytes here if these are your choices.
It is not listed in the question, but one other option that may or may not work depending on your situation is storing it with a service like Amazon S3.
I'll add to chopper and state that unless your backup requirements require you to keep backup media rotations of years or permanent storage, then either will probably last for the life of your backup rotation.
Keep in mind that if your data needs to be encrypted legally (and even if it doesn't you may want to anyways) you will need a process in there for that as well.
Questions to ask yourself when choosing a solution for backup.
But I would vote on external hard drives if you follow the following guidelines.
I know there are other online backup options out there besides S3.
