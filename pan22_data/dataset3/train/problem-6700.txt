Things that degrade the performance of a copper network are unterminated leads, unfiltered jacks, loose connections, cable runs alongside a noise source (electrical cable, fluorescent lamps, etc.
One way of troubleshooting such a network is by systematically isolating each portion of wiring, much in the way you've already done, by disconnecting most of it and then reconnecting portions until the troublesome part is found.
If I understand your description, it would appear that when you connect your dwelling's existing telephony wiring to the telco demarcation (master socket?
Right now, you know the problem is not one phone, nor your DSL modem.
(*) I noticed you mentioned 'your flat' which I understand to be an apartment.
), broken insulators, broken or pinched wires, faulty phones/faxes/modems, cheap splitters, poorly wired junction boxes; I could go on...
Next, you might want to either try for the easy win, and unplug all other phones and devices from their sockets, to see if one of them might be leaking noise onto the lines, or you can find the nearest junction point to the master socket, isolating it (*) and testing your signal to see if the trouble is coming from the now isolated portion.
Worse, is that most of these are hidden behind walls, beneath floors, above ceilings, often with no one junction point, let alone a box, or punch-down block.
This may be a job for your landlord or maintenance staff, since you can clearly demonstrate that the problem is in the building wiring, not your equipment or the provider's line.
