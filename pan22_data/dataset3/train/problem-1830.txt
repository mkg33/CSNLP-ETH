The shell scripting tools: bash/sh, awk, grep, head, tail, less, cat, sort, uniq, wc (and others)
Combine awk with sort, uniq, tail, grep, and wc to make your life pretty easy.
On any platform you should be familiar with the native, and popular backup tools.
Nothing bugs me worse the a sysadmin who doesn't know how to make a good backup.
Tricks like this save you lots of time, and it's all due to the shell scripting tools.
this lets you grep the logs on three servers for something.
No need to install PowerShell or cygwin to get a decent scripting functionality, especially when the scripts are supposed to be deployed on client machines.
Some tools are not mandatory but make the daily life easier:
Awk lets you easily analyze log files or other files which is critical when you need to diagnose a problem.
You don't need to know everything about either tool, but you should know something, so that you can check that access log or http log and figure out if something unusual is going on.
I learned that even Windows' standard command shell can be really useful.
vi - I know not everyone likes it, but its pretty much going to be on any *nix server you come across, and when everything else is broken you are going to need to edit config files.
I would also suggest csh and sh for the same reasons
A good backup will save you from almost any mistake you may make.
