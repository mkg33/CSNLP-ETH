The only way you can affect these values is to change the lease time.
https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01193/0/DHCP-4.2.7-Release-Notes.html
The client will attempt to contact the original DHCP server when this times out.
If it times out the client will attempt to contact any DHCP server to renew it's IP address.
I've always understood that the renewal time is 50% of the lease time and is calculated when the lease is handed out.
Both options I'm interested in are marked as "not user configurable", but my understanding of the above paragraph is that, depending on the option, only one of the side (client or server) can configure the parameter.
The Rebinding time is 87.5% of the lease time and again is calculated when the lease is handed out.
So far I was not able to have the client adding such options to his lease database.
Specifically I'd like the client to set into his lease database the following options: dhcp-renewal-time and dhcp-rebinding-time
These timers are reset whenever a new lease is obtained.
I'm using dhcp on both client and server on Linux machine
In this specific scenario I would imagine that the server can communicate the client the values for renewal and rebinding, not the other way around.
Someone out there succeeded in configuring such options?
Reading the dhcp-options man page I noticed the following paragraph:
I would like to "force" some dhcp options from the dhcp server to the dhcp client
Those parameters are user configurable in that version.
