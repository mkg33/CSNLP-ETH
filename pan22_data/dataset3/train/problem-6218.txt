How would I go about moving all of the data from one CentOS server to another server box?
I do not have access to the physical hard drive of the server, but I do have SSH and FTP access.
As a general recommendation: You should always install Linux twice on such systems.
My hosting company does not manage the servers and I have been told I will need to do it manually.
A small service Linux makes many serious tasks easier (and a lot faster).
Would I need to stop ALL of the services running on the box, or is there some way I could go about this without "breaking" everything?
A backup seems like the logical option but I have no idea how I would create the backup.
It is a dedicated server and I am trying to upgrade to a better server box, but I have absolutely no clue where I would start to migrate it.
Last time I tried to backup (into a tar file) lots of files corrupt as they were constantly changing.
That way you could easily backup your main installation because it would be inactive during this.
