Is it possible to connect multiple light sensors to one port and similiarly control multiple motors through one port only?
You can use use multiple devices on the I2C buses (the Pi has 2, each of 2 gpios).
This shows how to read the analog photo sensors over spi using WebIOPi as well as control a stepper motor.
The number of gpios needed per sensor depends on the sensor.
You can also look at my corresponding python code to read the sensors here..
(I've tried searching for answers on Google, couldn't find a convincing answer anywhere)
Often these will include more than one input, so you can connect multiple LDRs or potentiometers.
A pin can only take one input or output one value.
You need an external ADC (Analogue-to-Digital Converter).
The GPIO on the Raspberry Pi can't take analog input like that from an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor).
You can use a MCP3008 chip to read up to 8 analog sensors via the 4 SPI pins.
So you could connect multiple LEDs in series to one pin, but you couldn't connect multiple light sensors to one pin.
Any help, redirection to literatures, tutorials, answer is appreciated.
The Pi has no analogoue gpios so you can't connect sensors with analogue outputs to a Pi gpio.
