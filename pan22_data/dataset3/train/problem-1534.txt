On this server the user "user_a" can access the share "group_a_folder" (with "770" permissions);
III - From what we can understand so far the problem is making Linux/Unix/CentOS 7 "understand" that group "group_a" should have access to share "group_a_folder" since when permission is "777" this happens perfectly.
User "user_a" can access via ssh "server_a" (eg: ssh user_a@10.0.0.10).
... for the folder "/srv/group_a_folder" user "user_a" can no longer access the share.
II - In our tests users without access to group "group_a" do not access the share "group_a_folder" even though they have permission "777" as expected;
I have a server "server_a" with a directory "group_a_folder" ("/srv/group_a_folder") shared via Samba service available to everyone in LDAP service who is in the group "group_a".
First we put the server "server_a" in LDAP (domain controller).
I - I am currently migrating an environment with LDAP+Samba to a new server ("server_a").
Then give access to "group_a" in the folder "/srv/group_a_folder"...
User "user_a" can access "group_a_folder" share...
I really need some help because I can't identify what's going on...
There is a LDAP user "user_a" which in turn is in "group_a".
