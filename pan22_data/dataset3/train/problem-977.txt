If you have tasks that last more than a day, go to your week view.
It puts the tasks in the "cells" of you calendar and thus "occupy" a timeslot.
Thanks for posting this question, because I have often wondered about this but had not taken time to investigate.
If you view your calender in "month view" and have the "To Do" bar showing.
Do not forget to put in the start and finish dates.
I was wondering the same thing and just found something that works.
This will create a view in all calendars where you can see the task.
It appears tasks are only visible at the bottom of the calendar when in the day and week views.
At the bottom of the Calendar, you should see a section with your tasks:
Alternatively, double click in that area and type the task details in.
There is a third party solution here: http://tasktocal.com/
This should work nicely in either Day, Work Week, or Week views (in the Arrange Section in the Ribbon).
Then when you print your calender all your appointments and tasks will appear together.
(Mine is on the right side) You can drag the "task" item and drop it onto the correct day on your calender.
Drag the item into the area below the row of days at the top of the calendar.
As an alternative to that, you can also turn on the "To Do" bar in your inbox or calendar view which will list tasks to the right.
