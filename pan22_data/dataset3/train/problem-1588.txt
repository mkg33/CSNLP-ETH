Just trying to understand better how all memory thingies work.
Pen drives and SSD drives inherit the scheme from the hard drive, their older cousin.
This isn't much different from the basic concept of how long term storage works, the file system and partition maps are simply an abstraction to prevent you from having to directly access the raw disk.
To grossly oversimplify, RAM does have a layout scheme but it's abstracted away by the hardware.
Internally, RAM is arranged as a matrix of "memory cells" laid out in rows and columns, like a spreadsheet.
Each memory cell is used to store a bit of data, which can be instantaneously retrieved by indicating the row and column location (or address) of the data.
A partitioning scheme was created for hard drives so that you can install multiple incompatible operating systems that can coexist on different parts of the same platter.
For personal computers usually RAM is only used by one operating system at a time and thus there is no partitioning scheme for it.
But even so in some large computers (mainframes), there is also a partitioning scheme for RAM.
"why Hard Drives, Pen Drives and SSD need a partition scheme and the RAM doesn't?"
