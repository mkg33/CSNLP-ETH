It's impossible to tell whether the KCC is doing a good job or not without knowing how your topology is defined; the KCC usually does a pretty good job, so there are good chances there's something wrong with your site links if there are no connections where there are supposed to be some.
To do this, you can edit the 'options' attribute, and add the 1 to it (to specify it is automatically generated).
The KCC creates replication connections based on your site topology, which you must define by creating sites and site links (and additionally by specifying site link costs); if f.e.
One scenario for manual connections is to have control over specifying a bridgehead server, perhaps due to firewall or network issues.
These can be spotted when the ms-DS-ReplicatesNCReason attribute contains an entry with the OSCILLATING_CONNECTION_TOPOLOGY bitflag.
When manually generated connections exist, the KCC uses them wherever possible.
If you cannot find a plausible explanation for the manual connection objects, and you want to use automatic connections, you can convert the existing manual connection into an automatic connection object.
This may preserve the manual connection object and eliminates the need to delete them during cleanup.
The KCC will then either keep the connection or remove it and create a new connection.
In the case of network issues, it's possible that the KCC may repeatedly create a lot of what appear to be redundant connections.
you have 5 sites but site A is only linked to site C, then the only replication connections for DCs in site A will be created to/from DCs in site C, and nowhere else; the KCC will not create connections between a DC in site A and a DC in site B, D or E (well, unless all DCs in site C are down and site link bridging is enabled, but let's save this for another day).
