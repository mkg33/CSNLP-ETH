I won't recommend this process, but the RAID controller will not initiate a rebuild based on drives having been removed while the system is offline.
If you don't have it installed, I'd recommend that you procure a copy and use it.
Slow access usually means that one drive has already failed, and that the RAID management is having to rebuild data from parity information, or otherwise verify that it's OK.
So, your plan will work, provided you put the drives back in to them same slots and don't power the server back on until all the drives are back in place.
Now, if you're using a RAID controller but have no management console installed... then you might run into difficulties... :)
You'll want to label the drives with their position before you pull any of them out, however.
Since you're running Dell PowerEdge Software RAID, Dell's OpenManageâ„¢ Storage Services would be recommended for RAID management and monitoring.
You should be able to pull status on the drives in the RAID, and see which one is showing as Defunct or Predictive Failure Alert (PFA), from within your RAID management console.
RAID controllers aren't capable of telling if a drive (or a whole array) has been pulled while it's powered off... unless the drive is still missing or in a different slot when it's powered back on.
This should be shown as an alert within the RAID management; you should not have to pull each drive to test them because the 'bad' drive will be flagged with an icon.
