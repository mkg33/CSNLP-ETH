Please by all means do a youtube search and find a video that you like that is easy and informative enough to allow you to feel comfortable to make the repair.
Not sure which diagnostic tools you ran, but you may want to try running HP's Support Assistant which gives you specific categories to troubleshoot and can help you find the problem.
If it doesn't I will be following the above video.
Here is one video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSCb_ZjdpLk .
You've pretty much isolated it to being a hardware issue.
Also, you MUST be careful not to heat it to long or damage any of the other components.
If I don't post again here then the hair dryer worked.
It is a simple fix ONCE YOU TAKE THE WHOLE THING APART and heat up the area around the video chip for a SHORT period of time.
Just in case there is still anyone looking into this problem, there are some pretty serious issues with the video card on the motherboards of the DV6 as well as countless others.
Because you said this happens in BIOS, Windows 7, Linux and an external monitor works normally, I am inclined to believe the graphics adapter is good, but the LCD and/or it's components (back-light, inverter, etc) are starting to fail.
You need to lookup a repair video on youtube or elsewhere that will show you how to take apart the computer to do a reflow on the chip connections.
There are some that claim that you can do it by just using a hair dryer on high.
