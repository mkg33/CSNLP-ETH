I guess the question is, does your ISP block incoming ports, or is it a misconfiguration that causes the VPN to not work.
Otherwise, she might look into a VPN service, which would cost money, but would allow access.
You could forward 1194/UDP to your computer and set up an OpenVPN server to see if it would work.
Without knowing a bit more why you haven't been able to successfully set up a VPN, I'm not sure we can help much.
I have used proxyfire, works great, it's not free though
If you want something that she can simply turn on and have all her network traffic automatically reroute through your computer, without application by application, then what you are looking for is a VPN.
Basically it is a Java Web VPN that operates entirely over SSL so you just need to port-forward 443 on your firewall and you are in business.
there's plenty of free proxies available in the US, Europe, etc.
then if that doesn't work, route that traffic through a public proxy.
i'd point the main dns server down there to obtain dns info from an outside source(other than her local isp) first.
However, what I would do in these circumstances is have her contact her ISP and get them to fix the service.
You might look into using the Bitvise products, free for personal use.
OpenVPN is the type of VPN I normally use, and you are able to set it up to listen on other ports than 1194/UDP, the default.
I've never used this combination, so I hope it answers your question, but you'll have to try it in order to find out.
