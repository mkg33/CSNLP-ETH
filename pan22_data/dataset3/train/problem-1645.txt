We're having a discussion here about Hyper-V and vmware.
Yes, running a virtual machine (such as Hyper-V on Win2k8) as a guest vm inside VMWare ESX host is not a good idea.
I am not sure whether or not this would work or not, but I can't think of a reason why anyone would want to.
Creating a virtual machine that hosts another virtual machine I think would be extremely detrimental to overall performance.
There would almost certainly be a negative impact running hyper-v on ESX as I am sure then virtual processors wouldn't provide any Intel/AMD VT support.
Granted I think if you wanted to host Hyper-V within ESX, it should be feasible but I would argue it would be a waste of resources.
Not (only) because they're competitors, but technically there's a lot of work the processors do behind the scenes using nested page tables.
Is this because the machines vmware emulates do not have virtualized implementations of the process virtualization support?
To cut to the chase, an article (link) briefly explains the benefits:
Am I right in thinking that ESX and Hyper-V are competing technologies and it is not possible or desirable to run hyper-v on a box virtualized on ESX?
