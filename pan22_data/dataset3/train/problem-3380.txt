Within a subcategory, I would like to write articles about Apple's operating system that is running on Macs.
And since Apple has gone from Mac OS X to just OS X, then I cannot use "Mac OS".
I was thinking about just calling the category "Mac", but that is not precise either - but perhaps the closest I can get?
I am really looking for a meaningful all-round name for the Macs' operating system that does not involve the versioning.
Therefore, I have created a main category called "Operating systems".
I have a website where I would like to write articles about some operating systems.
Therefore I cannot exactly call my category OS X, because what about when OS 11 is released in a few years?
However, I do not know what to name this category.
While they may have similar names, they are very, very different beasts inside.
First of all, I hope that my question is fairly suitable for this site.
I have always thought the name was just OS X, but come to think about it, the "X" is actually part of the version (10).
And, if I remove the X from OS X, then I only have "OS" left, which does not seem so proper.
When talking about versions 1-9, it's generally referred to as Mac OS.
Starting with version 10, it is either referred to as Mac OS X, or simply OS X. I would not group OS X with Mac OS - The two are radically different, as much so as DOS and Windows.
