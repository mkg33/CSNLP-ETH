The 192.168.0.0 block of addresses was originally supposed to be 256 separate Class C addresses.
   pre-CIDR notation) the first block is nothing but a single class A
   class B network numbers, and third block is a set of 256 contiguous
As Kyle mentioned, there are no classes anymore, and haven't been for almost 15 years.
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the
And if so, is 192.168 than actually a Class B network?
Classful IP addressing is outdated and can be confusing at times.
   following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:
A class C address is an address with a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask.
Valid subnets were 192.168.0.0, 192.168.1.0, 192.168.2.0, etc.
With CIDR, all you really need to know is that these addresses are valid private IP addresses:
We will refer to the first block as "24-bit block", the second as
But then I look at ifconfig virbr0 on my Linux computer:
No, there is a block of 256 class C networks reserved for local use, 192.168.0 through 192.168.255.
How you divide those up into subnets is up to you.
   "20-bit block", and to the third as "16-bit" block.
