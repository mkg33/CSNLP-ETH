The host will be accessible from the IP you designate as the management IP in the console.
By selecting all of the NICs this will place them on the same virtual switch and into an active-standby team.
You can access the DRAC BIOS by using CTRL+E during POST, can set IP address in this BIOS for iDRAC interface.
Please reference the VMWare Networking Documentation for more information.
Please refer to VMWare documentation for best practices regarding networking with virtual hosts.
Using the VMWare vSphere Client you can configure multiple virtual switches with different subnets and even assign them directly to an individual NIC to segment traffic onto multiple networks.
As your screenshot indicates you can select which NICs to configure for management.
It is also possible to configure the network interfaces via the console or ssh session.
Since the other answer covered the iDRAC part of the question this will cover the VMWare ESX part.
For 4 ports on the integrated NIC you set IP address during OS installation or network interfaces configuration process.
On the console of the host you can configure the management network for the host.
