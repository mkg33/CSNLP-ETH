In Windows 7 is there a list with all the processes that were executed?
The Text file will look like this, except much longer, and repeated over-and-over for each time the script ran.
My computer has been running for a couple of days now but this only started happening today: I keep seeing a flicker in my taskbar.
I looked in the Task Scheduler and it's empty, so it's not that.
Open Notepad, paste the below in, save as all files with the name logger.bat.
The txt file will become quite large if you run it for long periods of time.
Or a program that can create such a list by tracking all executed processes?
It will write to txt file that you can examine later.
Is there something that I can do to find out what process is being executed?
You can create a batch script that will run tasklist over-and-over while you use the computer.
Every few dozen seconds or few minutes something starts and then it immediately stops.
Obviously you will need to replace yourusername with your user name.
Just double click the batch script at startup to run it, and close the command prompt when you want it to stop.
Or a way to make Windows log the execution of all processes?
