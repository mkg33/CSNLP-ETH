When the switch is powered up, the Diag LED flashes green for about 40 seconds, then extinguishes.
It will be solid red, and the corresponding port LED will flash amber/ green, if a port fails the loopback test at bootup.
The LED display has one LED for each port, laid out in the same order as the ports are located on the front panel.
Both Power and Diag LED's should be green when everything is okay.
When the LED comes back to a solid green colour (approx 60 seconds) then the switch is ready to be managed or pass traffic.
If the power LED is off, or RED, then there is a power supply fault and the switch will not boot up.
The switch will continue to operate, but the failed port will be disabled.
It will flash red if a fan has failed, and the switch will continue to operate.
Note: The LED's will not show whether the port is in full or half duplex mode.
The Diag LED will show if a loopback fault has occurred on a port, or if an internal cooling fan has failed.
The Diagnostic LED indicates the status of the switch.
When the port LED is off, there is no link, when it is green, there is a 10/100Mbps link present and when it is amber, there is a 1000MB link present The port LED will flash when there is traffic being transmitted or received by the port.
The power and diagnostic LED's are used to indicate whether the switch is operating correctly.
