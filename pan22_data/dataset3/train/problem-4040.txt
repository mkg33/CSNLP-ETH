Most of the devs in my team are using Windows boxes.
By nothing I mean, the command prompt returns immediately, no error, no nothing.
Are there any logs I can look at to see why the command line commands may be failing?
This is compounded by the fact that if the command being executed in turn also calls other commands, these may fail too.
Both these things are Ruby based so maybe there is something there.
Specifically, these guys have been trying to run cucumber tests but I witnessed this when trying to add a new box via Vagrant this morning.
The net effect of this is a very frustrating time trying to run things like cucumber tests from the command line.
All, I'm not sure the best way to describe this problem, but here goes.
This does not happen every time but on average you need to run the same command about 5 times before it actually 'sticks' and the command executes.
With the above information in mind, have you experienced the windows command line not executing commands randomly and if so, how have you fixed it?
Just speaking to the two devs in question now and they both said they are running Win XP 2002 SP3.
When running commands from the command prompt nothing happens.
