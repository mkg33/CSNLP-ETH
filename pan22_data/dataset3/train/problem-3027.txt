Here's how I just made Java "just work" for my WSL installation.
I'm however able to launch the windows installation of Python successfully.
If wat you want the other way around you can call the java bin on cmd like this:
Invoking java from the actual installation path seems to work as expected.
You will probably need to adjust the path as Java versions change in the future.
This issue is because WSL does not support windows shortcuts in the Creator's update.
As I'm running the Creator's update, I was was expecting the to be able to invoke any windows application.
My goal is to avoid having to install the JDK/JRE again in WSL.
I'm not able to run the windows version of java.exe from BashOnWindows10.
/mnt/c/ProgramData/Oracle/Java/javapath/java.exe is actually a shortcut to the actual installation directory which is C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_31\bin in my case.
Whenever WSL tries to invoke Java now, it's redirected to the Windows version.
It is present in PATH, but the invocation fails silently.
What this does is create a symbolic link in your /bin folder to your Windows Java binary.
If you want to execute your java.exe inside the linux subsystem you can follow this answer:
