FreeBSD's InfiniBand support is 'lacking' (ie, nearly non-existent) last I looked too.
The current ZFS implementation in FreeBSD stable (8.1) trails the OpenSolaris version by quite a big chunk.
Sure, the release is labeled as "technology preview" but this is because on the desktop it's not fully usable yet (there are many bugs that populate GNOME/KDE libraries and other important desktop components).
you have to ask yourself how many people are running the debian/bsd hybrid...and how many of them rely on it to be stable
The code in the development tree (9.0)is a lot more current, but I don't know how stable that is.
this project has always struck me as a fun idea and experiment, but i wouldn't presume to rely on it
It's also currently at version 13/14; a ways behind OpenSolaris.
It is far more commonly used in production, and it probably supports your hardware already.
I'm not sure it would be a big win over OpenSolaris.
The FreeBSD 8.x-STABLE branch's ZFS support isn't 100% stable (I've crashed it a few times myself).
We're using it on production already (as backup server, not a big deployment mind you) with no serious trouble.
Because of the version difference, you lose out on features like dedupe, which can be huge, depending on your usage, and you may have issues downgrading your zpools.
I'd highly recommend against using GNU/kFreeBSD for anything related to production.
With Squeeze is will be a stable Debian port, with full security support and updates.
