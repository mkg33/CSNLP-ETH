It can be Windows Search or something else, as long as I can find a way to get the job done I will be happy.
If it finds your text in multiple files or multiple times in a file, it gives you a list of all the instances it found and clicking on one takes you to that file/location.
Don't forget Logparser can be a good Text parser/search utility as well.
I currently run a mail server for my small non-profit company.
Problem is that when I put text into the "Containing text" field on Windows Explorer, it always misses the files and tells me no results returned.
The 'TEXTWORD and TEXTLINE input' formats and the 'CSV and TSV input' formats are worth running the logparser -i:INPUTFORMATYOUWISHTOKNOWMOREABOUT -h 'help' call on.
If you go to Search -> Search / Replace in files you can search any text string in a set of files in a specific directory.
Then when I search the files one by one (painful at best), I find the files I need.
I really don't care what I need to use to search the files, even a third-party app is fine with me, I just want to type an email address into a box and search all of my log files or email files and find out which one I am looking for.
Essentially these are just text files that are kept on the server.
My mail server (Merak Mail Server) keeps logs in .log files and mail as .tmp files.
Note that in powershell v2 you can also use the -context switch to get the lines above and below the line where the match was found
I use PsPad (a free advanced text editor) to do similar log searches.
You can tell it to seach all the files in a directory (or limit it to certain file types or any other wildcard) for a string you specify.
select-string -path c:\mylogfiledir*.log -pattern "my string"
Do I not understand the search feature well enough, or maybe I have it indexing wrong.
