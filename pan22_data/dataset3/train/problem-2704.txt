You will need to have Windows Scripting Host installed.
If you are handy with C# then its another good solution.

So here is my sledgehammer approach (recommended if you have done major moving/conversion of files in library):
iTunes will now rebuild your library (might take a while), and therefore not have any dead paths mixed in.
symbol is displayed), then that'd be great, since you can just highlight from the very first track, down to the last (use SHIFT key to do this), and hit DELETE.
Source code is provided so if you have C# Express or Visual Studio then you should be good to go.
If you're happy with your new library, you can go and delete the original library index files you moved at step 3.
Found this but it is dated 2004 so it may not work if the iTunes API has changed in between
Scott Hanselman blogged a C# solution about this last week.
You will need to get all your album artwork again (File>Library>Get Album Artwork) and it may take multiple attempts to get it all back again as it is a little temperamental...
I won't go into how absolutely ridiculous it is that there are people actually writing scripts and apps and selling them to fix this problem which should be a BASIC function of iTunes... but i suppose iTunes is getting a cut, so why should they fix it?...
If you wanted to restore your old index, just move them back again.
Pardon my ignorance, but can you not just delete them from the library by right-clicking on them and choosing "Delete"?
