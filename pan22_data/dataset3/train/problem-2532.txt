I know nothing about OS X, but the behavior you're describing sounds just like the behavior of the old Windows 9X OS's.
This folder icon will open the user's folder (\\server\share\user) as you desire.
To get properly "mapped" home directories on those old beasts the user's home directory had to be the share point (because a \server\share\user UNC would map the root of the drive letter to \server\share).
I can tell you that 2004-era W2K3 Server machines could handle hosting 2,500+ shared folders with no I'll effects...
Your share point is \\server\share, so that is what is being mounted as a volume.
We ended up sharing each user home directory individually.
If you want the user's folder to be auto-mounted as a volume, you can use one of the following workarounds.
It would work for what you want, but it's certainly not preferred.
If you look in the dock on the client machine, you will see a folder icon.
The problem is that OSX will only mount the share point as a volume starting at some version (10.10 or so).
