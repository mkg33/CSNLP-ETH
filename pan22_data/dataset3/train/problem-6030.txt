You may want to try updating the BIOS of the server.
Unfortunately I am not used to windows servers so I can't answer on that.
They will increase in speed based on temperature and load.
That being said, most Dell servers I've worked with run the fans at full speed during post and reduce the speed once the post process has completed.
I have had multiple Dell products have a very similar issue and a BIOS update has fixed it.
If they don't then I think what you're seeing is normal.
Assuming that the fan speed is directly related to the power consumption of the server as a whole is probably an incorrect assumption.
If you look at OMPC (Open Manage Power Center) that will give you a lot of data on your power and thermals from servers.
PE's really go full speed (and others servers too) when they boot, but they go down after the OS boot up or, in the case of a a open chassi, several minutes.
If the fans aren't going down at all, it may be sign of a deeper problem with the OS or even hardware.
If the fans run at full speed constantly then you have a problem.
