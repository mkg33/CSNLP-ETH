I noticed that on my larger switch the default gateway is blank.
I have a small network of devices, 3 plus a "smart" managed switch and a PC, and I'd like to have the PC serve as the DHCP server.
The thing is, it's a new requirement that this network runs with DHCP enabled (sort of... there's a lot of background there, so let's just take that as a given for now), so I'm trying to do this in a cost-effective way.
I define the configurations and give more background below.
In it, I have a range set with the subnet set to 255.255.255.0 and the default gateway set to the address of my switch (.1/13).
So I took the switch, gave it .1 as the address and it wants a default gateway as well.
I have the DHCP server set up and working in one configuration, but not another.
Not a networking guy by trade, but I know enough to get myself into some trouble.
I don't get any errors that I'm aware of, but the DHCP Discover messages never make it to the PC.
The DHCP server expects a Default Gateway for the network, and it won't work if I point it back at itself (in this case .100).
Is there somewhere else I should look for problems?
The DHCP configuration works on another rig where the situation is similar (buncha devices, a switch, and a PC with 2 NICs), except that there the managed switch is full featured, and about 20 times more expensive than the little Netgear ProSafe GS105 I'm using.
Is there some reason a "smart" switch can't function as a default gateway?
So it seems like this is only an issue when I'm using the smaller switch.
The NIC is set to the address of the PC (.100/26).
I give it .100 and the DHCP server .1, with the intent that all the devices will forward to .1 and then the switch will forward to .100.
I'm using OpenDHCP to configure the DHCP on the PC.
I need to set up a DHCP server on a PC for a small subnet of 3 or 4 devices.
