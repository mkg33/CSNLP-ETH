I checked the drivers of both my video card and the built-in graphics card, they both seemed to be updated.
I guess that screen poweroff and computer sleep mode go together - if the PC is'nt sleeping, it does not expect a waking command, therefore will not turn on the screen.
i.e Hard-Disk, OS keeps running and I can shutdown also by pressing alt+F4 and Enter (in the blank).
I updated display drivers, Graphic drivers, Chipset drivers to the latest version.
if I manually do sleep from shutdown menu, or close the lid, or sleep due to power plan, after re-opening the system, screen doesn't show anything.
Its a bit power consuming solution, but is also a good one.
I also tried to set them both to never, and left it a night.
I had the same problem and I finally solved it - the cause of this problem is going to  amaze you!
see the other instructions to fix that - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/black-screen-after-sleep-mode-windows-8/d759b75d-4784-4a82-bf48-a1cb78275db3
(i.e was set to 'never') i changed that to 15 minutes, to match the screen poweroff timer, and never had this problem again.
then out of no reason at all I decided to go check the power saving settings (sleeping mode, screen poweroff etc..) and the thing I found was that screen poweroff was set to 15 minutes, but computer sleep mode as not set!
