Other things worth trying are how you're connected to the device, ideally via ethernet & not over wifi.
For countless hours I've been trying to figure out the solution for a problem I've been having.
I've factory reset it and rebooted it and every time it just says the username and password are incorrect.
In general would try every combo of /admin/root for user/pass.
looking here: http://support.routercheck.com/Sagemcom/F%40ST+5260/DefaultPassword-0.html seems like the defaults could be admin/admin which you've probably tried or possibly blank/blank.
If the firmware was updated/changed the default user/pass could be specific to that firmware revision, you could look around for release notes for the specific version (most resets don't fall back to an older factory firmware, just reset settings for the current version).
I clicked on an option for my Remote Access panel in my Router (My router model is Sagemcom F@st5260 Router), and then the page got all messed up so I logged out and I can't log back in.
