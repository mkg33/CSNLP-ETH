Maybe the masks aren't the most efficient, but from a pure communication standpoint no issues at all regarding the PCs in question.
In this case PC11 still sees PC12 as a member of its network (using the test described above).
From PC12's prespective, the same test is performed:
To figure this out I assume PC11 does the following test using his subnet mask:
So he finds out that PC12 is indeed in his own network and so it sends traffic directly to it.
Despite the different subnet-masks PC11, PC12 and PC13 will still see each other in the same LAN,
                                                 Secondly, the mask is only important when sending data from the sender's standpoint.
PC12 also understands that PC11 is in its own network, and likewise sends traffic directly to it.
PC11 asks himself is 100.50.1.12 a member of my network?
So routing is required - but it won't work in this particular scenario, since the router itself will require routing to reach 100.50.2.11 (since it's not a member of its interface's network 100.50.1.0).
- First of all, he doesn't have any knowledge of what it is.
and be able to send traffic directly to each other wihtout the need for routing.
