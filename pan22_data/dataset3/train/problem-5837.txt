It can be used with PoE, so power requirements must be very low.
These are a bit more expensive than the ALIX and don't give much benefit if you don't need the power of the Atom processor.
While the accepted answer is certainly a good one, I doubt you'll end up with less than 10W.
Why not look into OpenWRT with your current router?
You can build the hardware from MiniITX, MicroITX or PicoITX form factor mobos running an Atom or VIA processor and flash drive for pretty cheap.
If you want something to tinker with, you might want to have a look at this: http://www.ubnt.com/products/rs.php It has a 680mhz MIPS CPU, 64mb of ram, three mini-pci slots(for wifi) and comes with openwrt preinstalled.
It's smaller and more compact and there are many suppliers around the world.
There is also the option of a fit pc or other small system (Viglen used to do once called MPC, but they don't stock it any more).
It's firmware you install instead of the factory firmware that turns it into a mini-linux box.
It seems that the best bet for sub 10W usage is a small embedded board, something like an ALIX from PC Engines.
Netbooks will use between 18W and 35W, according to this discussion board post, which is based on battery capacity and quoted battery life, so seems reasonable.
Looking at the ITX option it seems that ITX boards use between 15W and 40W, depending on which board is used and what the storage device is (HDD seem to grab lots of power).
