As mentioned, while the DGS-1024D is (small) "business grade" switch, it is not a managed switch.
I need some help, I want to monitor the DGS-1024D which is a business grade d-link switch.
99% of our network is HP Switches and I monitor them all.
Each switch model is slightly different though, so you'll need to use tools like snmpwalk to discover what values you care about.
It has no concept or support for anything Layer 3 or above so there is nothing you can do to monitor it.
Most HP switches IME should be able to give you CPU load, fan speeds and temperatures.
I have no current way of knowing if any of these have IP addresses on the switch or if there is away to monitor the switches.
I am wondering if anyone else has, monitored a switch and how they have done it, even a cfg file would be good to view to see what I am to do.
We also have a master switch which is in our server room, which is a HP J4906A 48-Port Ethernet Switch
The HP on the other hand is managed and completely monitorable using SNMP.
