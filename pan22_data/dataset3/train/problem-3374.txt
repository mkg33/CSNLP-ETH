If I cant ignore it, what are the steps to diagnose and resolve the error?
Standard output and error can be redirected in 2 different files with something like:
The script appears to run succesfully, in that a useable .tar.gz file is created after the script runs.
I had a similar issue untarring a file I had received.
However, I get this annoying message after the script finishes:
This should reduce the output and let you see what is going on.
I have written a little script that tars and compresses a list of directories + files.
Where xyz and abc are files and we are storing those files in done.tar
They forget to perform operations in the directory where the files are present
Since I am using this as part of my backup, I want to make sure that I am not ignoring something serious.
You will get that message if, for any reason, tar can't add all of the specified files to the tar.
One of the reason to get this errors for beginners is that
I do not see any error messages whilst the script is working, and like I said, the produced file can be uncompressed with no warnings/errors.
If we go and perform the command in other location we will get above error
Sometimes backing up files that might change during the backup like logfiles, you might find useful the tar option '--ignore-failed-read' (I'm on Debian Linux, not sure for non gnu tar).
This could be a big problem since you are using this for backup.
I find this to be generally safe, but please be careful though as tar won't stop ...
What are the possible reasons that this error/warning message is being produced - and can I safely ignore it?.
Turns out I didn't have permission to write the files in the archive owned by root.
One if the most common is not having read permission on one of the files.
