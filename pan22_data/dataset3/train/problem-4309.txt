But XLSurfFit, a third party Excel addin can do it pretty easily: http://3dexcel.com/excel-3d-surface-equation-fittinng/
Create a 3D surface chart based on that data and you're done.
Smashing a surface on top of an already busy 3D chart would probably be bad UI anyway.
If you wanted a second degree polynomial, the array would be {1,2} and the row_num parameter for the INDEX function would only go up to 3.
Is it acceptable to have it be in a different chart?
Finally, you can create a second table that calculates this best fit for each point.
I don't know if you can do a best fit based on 3D data but you can do a best fit based on each series and then create a 3D surface based on that.
These formulas need to be dragged out to the right so that you get a fit for each series.
I used a 3rd degree polynomial fit such that the surface would be of the form y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. Based on your data, you may want more or less but you can adapt this proof-of-concept to fit your need.
Rather than a trendline, I guess I need a trendplane.
