Hope this helps - I was hoping for a more elegant solution, so if someone knows a macro or other export solution please let me know.
You can then edit the resulting slides to use your corporate theme if you want to.
Better late than never, I suppose, but here's my .02$ that I've found.
You could try the GanttMagic app for Windows 10, which can read your MS Project schedule and create a high-level view (no links, though) directly in PowerPoint.
You can also print the entire project as a PDF and export the PDF into a JPEG file.
This should activate the snipping tool so you can capture  the desire area of the screen you like, then save it as  jpg or png format, or copy and paste into powrpoint.
Find it in the Microsoft Store (free to use for a week).
A little Copy Picture dialog will then appear and you can choose how you want to export your image.If you use the defaults (just hit OK), it will copy an image to your clipboard for pasting into another tool such as PowerPoint.
On windows 7, Click start(windows icon botton left handside of the screen), type snipp  and press enter.
