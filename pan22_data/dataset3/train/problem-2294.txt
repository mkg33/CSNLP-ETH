Basically, you'll have to copy the content of "Format" and "ContentType" keys from a format to another.
On my system (Windows 7 x64, with WMP not installed) the function that opens the confirmation box is
Whenever I try to copy a video onto the device, it prompts if I want to convert it, like so:
which returns 0 if the copy is allowed, otherwise 1.
However, it may have unwanted effects on any app using theses keys... Maybe WMP ?
I have a Samsung Galaxy S II, which when connected to my Windows 7 computer acts as a "Portable Media Player"
For those of you having trouble getting any of these technical suggestions to work (like me) I found a workaround.
and _DoesObjectMatchDeviceCapabilities is at RVA 0x95118
I just replaced the first few bytes of the function with:
Just make a new folder on your PC desktop and copy into it all the files you want to transfer to your device.
Working well so far; I'll report back if I notice any unexpected results.
The prompt will appear, but you can just select "do this for all files" and it will transfer across the entire contents of the folder without prompting you again.
This gets quite annoying in the long run, so I'd like to disable it.
for reference, the CRC of my wpdshext.dll was d6ca5ac8, before patching
We could also add new formats, like .m4a (audio mp4) :
Then, once that is done, just drag the whole folder onto your device to copy it across as usual.
