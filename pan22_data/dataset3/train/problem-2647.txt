All of the answers I read were for people who didn't even have ideas in the first place and knew nothing about development.
Try to work as modular as possible, so you can more easily scale your project and make changes.
My problem is more about project management after the design phase.
I have written pages of notes and concepts about the game.
Basically, I know most of the things I want to put in my game and a big part of their design is done.
make a test-map and character, and see if you can get most of the basic functionality to work.
Basically, I know the basis most of the technologies I'll need to use.
Well, if you have everything planned out, it think it's fair to say you can work on a proof-of-concept setup.
I already have most of the ideas in terms of gameplay, lore,...
I'm undecided because many of these tasks can be done in parallel if you have people working with you and are more or less independent in early stages of development.
I made a few small projects with Unity, I know how to program, I know how to use Blender and I have edited some textures.
