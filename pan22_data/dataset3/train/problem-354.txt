I suppose the idea here is to be able to prefer, say, a route learned within an OSPF area to one learned from IS-IS but to continue to use the IS-IS route if the OSPF route is external (i.e.
I guess it's nice that such a knob exists and I'm sure it can be useful in some circumstances but can't help thinking that it'll all end in tears more times than not.
Also - the default AD of OSPF on anything Cisco is 110.
It could be also changed manually from 1-255 value.
The first command sets the AD for all routes learned by OSPF.
It's been my experience that if the answer to a question is tweaking AD that one is almost always better off asking a different question.
The second allows you to set different AD's for different types of OSPF routes - so different values for externals vs inter-area vs intra-area.
Could you tell me what is the differences between the following Cisco XR commands: distance vs distance ospf/bgp ?
I know the basics regarding administrative distance, that sets the priority for the protocol.
This is basically the traditional AD command, as seen in IOS since they invented dirt.
But I don't understand the differences between these commands:
There are also some default adm distance values for protocols like- static route: 1, ospf: 90 etc...
