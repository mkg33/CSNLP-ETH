The real-power in nagios is that you can write your own custom triggers to inform you by email/txt-message/phone-call/blinky-lights/whatever you can script... of any problems/warnings/errors.
Once you have that down figure out exactly what you want to add to your Nagios dashboard.
It allows you to log everything centrally, search through them and even create graphs/charts, etc.
Since you can use Nagios by writing your own plugins there are definitely ways of doing this.
This way you need just to look in one place for all related information.
There is also a web-gui that shows you everything you're monitoring in a variety of configurations... (i.e.
We've been using it for about an year now and I really like it.
I would suggest that if you want to go this route get a good feeling for how to write custom plugins.
The same could be done with a general syslog server or dumping to a database.
If your intent is to monitor things without the need to login to each server alone, you can gather all the logs in one place using syslog server.
I have searches set up in Splunk that Nagios executes and performs the alerting logic for.
For example I use Splunk to collect the event logs for all of my servers, network devices, etc.
service-groups... servers... individual monitors... etc...)
