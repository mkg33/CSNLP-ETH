I've seen lots of defective computers, but monitors don't die too often.
Newer monitors sometimes have LED backlights, but 4-year-old won't.
it becomes dimmer and dimmer until it is unusable.
The most probable source of trouble is the backlight.
I have a used Dell 2407 on hand cheap, but it's four years old.
And these (usually multiple years old) monitors usually were in use 8h/day+, often ran 24/7.
I worked quite some time at my university's computer department and didn't see lots of dead monitors, but lots of dead computers.
I know it probably has a lot to do with usage pattern and how long it's been used per day on average, but I don't have that info.
Can I expect to get a couple of years of usage of such a used screen, or should I keep away from it ?
I am looking to get a second monitor for my home PC.
Occasional home use is not the same as office use.
I wouldn't care buying used screens if they fit your needs.
It is essentially a fluorescent light inside the monitor, and once it's gone it's gone.
The amount of its remaining useful life hugely depends on usage pattern, you realize that.
