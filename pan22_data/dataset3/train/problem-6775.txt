You might try using Flump: http://threerings.github.io/flump/
This will take a snapshot of each frame of the animation, at the interval for the frame rate you specify, then combine all the frames into a grid in a single image.
Yet another option, which I used to create the spritesheets for the HTML5 demo on my site, is Zoe, the spritesheet tool that comes with CreateJS.
Have you tried using ShoeBox it has many utilities for SWF files.
You can then load the sprite sheet into Unity to create the animation.
You'll have to port one of the existing client libraries to Unity, but the client libs are simple and should be pretty easy to port.
You can export a sprite sheet directly from inside Flash Pro.
There's a tutorial on raywenderlich.com showing how to do this:
While not exactly what you're looking for, this post on reddit might be of interest - an upcoming tool for rendering swf animations in Unity, from the sounds of it the performance is good and you still retain the cross-platform functionality.
Most of the heavy lifting is done by the exporter.
Flash itself has an option for something like Export to PNG Sequence.
One of those allows you to create spritesheets from a SWF file.
