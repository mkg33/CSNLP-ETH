The compiler may be having some sort of bug and "hogs" the file even after it has completed it's operations.
Files are no longer "locked" / "file access denied" for a very long time...
Permissions have been clearly corrupted in such case.
Especially if Windows cannot state who's the owner of such a file or folder.
Since so many people contributed to the post, I wanted to share back my findings as well.
Sachin Shekhar's idea of using Unlocker is good to see if there is any other processes that is concurrently using the file.
Windows 10 seems to drasicly have improved and solved the behavior.
Unlocker does natively support deletion, renaming etc, too.
Use Unlocker to unlock those files and then try to do whatever you want.
Also check your task scheduler in case there's anything unexpected going on.
So changing o Windows 10 is kinda an answer as well.
From this security Tab, click Advanced, Click the Owner Change link, in the Enter the object name box type your name and click CHECK NAMES then click OK.
Yeah, running CHKDSK /R C:\  (at the next boot) did the trick!
Afterwards it sounds relevant that the file system ought to be corrupted if you cannot take ownership of a file or folder you would be authorized to.
[Optional] I'd also like to suggest you to scan computer for threats using Norton Power Eraser (Its free, portable; it can work along with AVG, too) if you don't exactly know whats causing the problem.
You might want to try checking the permissions for CMD.
