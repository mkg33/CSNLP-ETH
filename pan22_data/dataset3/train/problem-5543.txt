Unfortunately these solutions are messy and difficult to debug.
Depending in exactly how the network is set up, there are some tricks you can use.
Thus you can advertise individual IPs across the VPN link so the router knows to prefer that.
This is a lot easier but means forsaking DNS or running solution DNS.
This leaves the problem that, while the router will know how to direct the traffic, the traffic won't get to the router because it's on the LAN.
You can fix this by putting static routes for particular IPs with the router gateway on  your workstations or move OpenVPN to the workstation.
Easy to say, hard to do, not sure that Windows can do it out the box.
Unfortunately the correct solution is to move 1 network to a different range.
IE you request something from 100.0.0.1 and the VPN server uses NAT to rewrite the packet to 10.0.0.1.
It will also mean that an overlap of IP addresses in your LAN means where the IP is identical on both sites your VPN won't work.
You can solve this on a per host basis using source routing if supported by the host.
A more specific netmask will take precident over a more general one.
An alternative is to use port mapping and have the VPN server translate your request.
There is no simple solution other then the correct one you appear to want to avoid - You really don't want to be doing this as having the same IP in 2 places in a network breaks things.
