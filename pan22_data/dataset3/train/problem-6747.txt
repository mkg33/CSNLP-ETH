Our small business server has 2x 400GB SSDs and 6 slower 7,200rpm SAS drives.
We create a RAID1 array for the SSDs (henceforth Fast Disk) and a RAID10 array for the 6x SAS drives (henceforth Big Disk).
Does it dump the whole contents of memory into that file?
Our Virtual Machines therefore have configuration files and VHDXs dedicated to user data on Big Disk, and VHDXs dedicated to guest system drives on Fast Disk.
Assuming we would prefer to keep Save State enabled, i.e.
Nothing like our real world; please use your imagination.)
Of course, we don't want these 30-40GB files to take up our precious Fast Disk, so we set the default location for virtual machines as the Big Disk, safe in the knowledge that these BIN files will be stored here.
we do not wish to get rid of the BIN files altogether, will there be a performance hit in having these stored on a different disk?
The physical server has 128GB of RAM, and we know that if we allocate much of this to our virtual machines, and opt to enable "Save state", Hyper-V will create large BIN files.
Or does some other clever black magic / optimisation take place behind the scenes to make this process happen quickly?
(It would be ideal, of course, to avoid storing any virtual disks on our host's C:\ drive, but this hypothetical world in which we find ourselves is strangely devoid of logic and our customer or boss has expressed that she doesn't have unlimited funds for their servers.
