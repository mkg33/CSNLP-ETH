I apologize if this has been clearly asked somewhere and I missed it.
I went from a 120GB SSD to a 480GB SSD, but because I dual-boot between Windows and Linux, I can't seem to get the new, unallocated space beside either of the partitions for an extension to happen.
I deleted my Windows Recovery partition to free up room in the MBR for another partition and created one out of some of the unallocated space.
I think it's because the new space is not aligned with either of the existing NTFS or ext4 partitions.
I want to give ~240GB to Windows and ~90GB to Linux, but I can't seem to get them to move.
I designated it as an NTFS partition and put it toward the end, leaving ~90GB of unallocated space beside the Linux partitions.
But I can't move either and I can't create a new partition because I'm now at the max.
I've tried searching and searching and most entries I've found don't describe this situation.
Even when I had created an ext4 partition right beside the Linux partitions, I couldn't extend the / ext4 partition into the new partition.
