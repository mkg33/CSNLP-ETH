I have them set up to all replicate, instead of the hub and spoke I did the spiderweb approach - HOWEVER - the code is written in such a way that it tries to drop the image on server 1, if it succeeds it stops there.
Now when I want to setup DFS replication between the three of those, I've chosen a primary member.
Im setting up three servers with DFS, it is Image servers attached to webservers, where the images is displayed.
This means if I want to take my servers down to do updates or other maintenance I don't have to worry about things not working in the mean time.
Should I set up the primary server (Most up-to-date) as the only server on which the pictures is written, so the replication process is then replicating the pictures to the two other servers?
The whole question is, what is happening if something is uploaded to the primary server while the initial replication process is running?
If for some reason the save to image 1 fails it saves to image 2, then 3 etc etc.
I guess if I still was writing all pictures to all three of the servers, there will be a lot of Conflict And Deleted.
It's about 350gb of pictures on each server, but they are slightly out of sync.
I have a similar setup, but with more servers in my DFS replicated list.
