Today I roughly measured the benefits of enabling write-back on the RAID controller on a server at work.
how about ugly OS crash because of something... bug in drivers, bug in kernel of the os?
I have seen every single one of them in a production scenario though, so they're all possible :)
What is a realistic fail scenario which could be prevented by a BBU?
Does this depend on the type of the system (database, file, terminal)?
It got no RAID battery-backup-unit (BBU) so the write-cache is currently disabled.
The write cache does not commit data instantly to the disk, so if there is a power failure you will lose all the data in the cache without a BBU.
As the server is not used to capacity (by far), the results in most test were spectacular, e.g.
From my experience, unless the server is receiving power from different PDUs, I can't really consider redundant power supplies a complete solution.
Of course having a BBU is always recommended, but what are the main benefits of installing a BBU to a system, which got redundant power supplies and is attached to UPSs?
How likely any of these are in your environment is something only you can determine.
