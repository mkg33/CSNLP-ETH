Now, every time you press F11, the time will be inserted in the current cell.
This means that if you click record, then click cell A5, then insert the time there, then stop record, then every time you run the macro, the time will be inserted into cell A5, regardless of which cell you had selected before.
Is there a way I can set an easier shortcut for the current time in Excel?
To assign a shortcut, under DEVELOPER tab, click Macros, select your macro and click Options
You can include things like formatting in the recording, and that will also be executed.
Do note, if you click on a cell after you start recording, that cell click will also be recorded.
I know about "ctrl+shift+;" but I need something that can be used with one hand.
Ideally if I could set up and F key to add the current time.
To do this, start recording a macro, press CTRL+SHIFT+;, then hit stop record, and assign it to a key, such as F11.
The easiest method is to record a macro where you do that keypress, and assign it to one of the F.. keys.
