You can download the iPad/iPhone development tools.
I work for a school division and our teachers are very happy about being able to show iOS devices on their computers (and thus, through their projectors).
There is an application called Veency, but according to this article, though, it is an application you will not find in the app store.
The software isn't free, but isn't terribly expensive.

It includes an iPhone simulator (and, I hope, an iPad simulator), which you can run on a Mac.
It will not be nearly as fluid as using it by itself, mind you, and I doubt you'll be able to install third-party apps.
You will need to sign up for a free Apple Developer Connection membership.
For playing around and testing code on the computer, you don't need it).

I don't know of anything that you can use without jailbreaking your device :(
