Boot sector is pretty small (just 512 bytes), so you can just disassemble it (using anything from NDISASM to IDA), fix the messages and then reassemble it again (NASM will do).
Little unknown fact: NTFS boot sectors come in different languages.
On my Vista, the boot sector is in English, even though I have Polish system.
This requires a bit of programming skills, and maybe also reading some x86 assembler textbooks, but certainly doabe if you strive enough.
They can say "BOOTMGR is missing" and "Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart", but they can also say the same thing in other languages.
But if you replace the boot files, like bootmgr, BCD (from a system with the exact same boot configuration), bootsect.dat, boot.sdi, or whatever combination of files that you have, I think you'll find the messages in your chosen language.
This depends on the locale of the Windows system you are using when you create and format the partitions.
I know this is a purely cosmetic thing, but I'd like to know: how to create a localized NTFS boot sector (without re-formatting the partition in a localized system, of course)?
Due to a malware messing around, I had to rewrite the NTFS boot sector of my system drive, which was hiding a rootkit; I did this using the bootsect.exe tool on the installation DVD, the same italian-language installation DVD I used to install Windows originally; there was also a nice bootsect.exe.mui file in a it-IT folder around there.
But the tool was speaking English, and my NTFS boot sector is now speaking English, too (and, of course, it didn't before).
