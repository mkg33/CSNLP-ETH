Make sure your network adapter is properly "mapped"
So after a reboot, your interface will switch from eth0 to eth1.
Pinging the router fails too, although this is fine from a windows pc (with a lease from the same DHCP server).
If your other VM on that server works fine with it's network settings, and you have similar settings for your Ubuntu VM, you might verify that you don't have any firewall (iptables) entries getting in the way.
If not, you might want to look at /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules.
DHCP may be assigning IP settings that are completely inappropriate for your virtualised server.
This is getting fairly annoying now, i can't understand what it could be!
What could happen is that Hyper-V will issue a different MAC address for your NIC and therefore Ubuntu will consider it a different NIC.
Try setting the IP address manually (and don't use an address within a range assigned by DHCP!).
I have a Hyper-v Server with a complete fresh install of Ubuntu Server 64bit.
The virtual network card in Ubuntu is set to DHCP, it has the correct lease from the DHCP server.
When setting up the Virtual Server i chose a legacy network adapter.
Once Ubuntu has ran through the install (including dragging some updates from the internet) i log in.
All i get is Err's and Failed to fetch error messages.
If you issue ifconfig is the adapter name the same as in your /etc/network/interfaces?
I've seen this happen regularly in VM environement, especially when "moving" VM's form an hypervisor to another one.
