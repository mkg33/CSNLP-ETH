Connections from the client to the proxy are encrypted, albeit with a proxy SSL certificate.
If this is not malware or a misconfigured anti-virus product then it is almost certainly a hardware firewall or web filtering device that's acting as a proxy.
You sometimes see this happening in third-party firewall solutions on clients, where the third-party software will act like a corporate proxy.
There is a work around in that Firefox does not use the system CA's but comes with it's own.

I guess you are in a corporate environment where the proxy acts as SSL in the middle.
Legal SSL interceptions are typically done in company networks or by Antivirus products.
Without knowing more on your particular corporate network I can't advise on how to update these.
Continually getting https Certificate Errors on all browsers
The device in question will have a self-signed/issued certificate that will need to be imported in to the trusted root certificate store of your local computer.
I got certificate error in all the browsers I used.
I assume this is corporate device/network so I would speak to your IT department or whomever manages the network.
And connections from the proxy to the target site are encrypted with the target's site certificate.
This problem occurs when your corporate proxy does not have the correct or up to date certificate authorities installed.
But also adware like Superfish or other malware will do such attacks or it might be that your router is compromised.
Refer to this discussion for a more accurate answer of why this happens.
After reading the link, I learnt that these errors are due to disabled 'Automatic certificate root update'.
This is probably some legal or illegal man in the middle attack against your computer.
The advantage is that your proxy can perform anti-virus scans and check the content for malicious code.
