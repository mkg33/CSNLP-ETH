Again, pick a random IP address from the range to assign to the PC.
Once you have them connected in this fashion, the easiest way to proceed is to set up a static IP address on the PC.
If you do not know how to get to this dialog, see the "Set a Static IP Address in Windows 7, 8, or 10" section at https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/19249/how-to-assign-a-static-ip-address-in-xp-vista-or-windows-7/.
the randomly-chosen 10.x.x.4) and configure the subnet mask.
If you do not know the specific subnet, you should also be able to use the entire 10.0.0.0/8 space, with a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0.
Wireless connections are usually bridged to the LAN-side ports and act as an extension to that switch.
Assuming you're using Windows, the configuration would look something like:
10.x.x.y would be considered the 10.x.x.0/24 network, subnet mask of 255.255.255.0) you just need to put the PC on any address on the network (e.g.
Remember to change it back to what it was (probably automatically-assigned (DHCP)) when you're done, else you will no longer be able to connect to the internet.
A direct connection might also work, but this depends on Auto MDI-X support — a switch is usually easier.
The LAN-side ports on the 'router' usually serve as a switch.
This should, in theory, tell the PC to attempt to communicate with any IP address from 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254 via the local network.
First, you need to connect it to the same network switch as the PC.
If you know the specific subnet the camera is on (usually the last octet on a home network, e.g.
You'll want to put it in the same subnet as the camera, with the same subnet mask — this puts them on the same network so the PC will not try to send packets through its default gateway as it would do for non-LAN destinations.
