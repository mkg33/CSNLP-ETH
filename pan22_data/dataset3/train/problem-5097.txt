TM performance became painful and I had to turn it off.
Since I have never used a non-partitioned Time Machine drive, I don't know whether this issue is specific to the partitioning of the drive, but I highly doubt it.
Ideal to have an external HD for each purpose if you can afford it.
During that period, you will see in Activity Monitor that a process named UASysAgent eats up 100% CPU.
In fact, I have always partitioned my Time Machine drives in order to keep the size of the Time Machine backup at bay, or to use the same disk with multiple Macs.
I stored a bootable copy and the TM backups on the same external disk, which was fine until my internal HD went bang and I need to boot from the external hard  drive.
There is a known issue in OS X Mountain Lion 10.8â€“10.8.3 (rdar://12184052) regarding the feedback of Finder during the ejection of a Time Machine volume on an encrypted and partitioned hard drive: when you eject the volume by clicking on the ejection icon in the Finder sidebar, it will take up to a minute until the volume is unmounted, even though the icon of the volume may disappear from the sidebar much sooner.
Question pretty sums it up - should I expect any problems having an external USB hard drive with 2 or more partitions and using one of those partitions as my Mac Time Machine backup (formatted HFS+ of course)
When that process disappears, it is safe to disconnect the volume in my experience.
The only problem I've seen is if you need to boot from it.
I don't think there should be, except, of course, the drive space issue.
