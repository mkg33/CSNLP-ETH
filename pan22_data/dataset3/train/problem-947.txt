The main point of having distributions, and not working with Linux raw, is that the people who put the distributions together have figured out how to have all these programs working together alongside each other.
Having said that, on my Mac Os laptop, I have been using two package managers alongside each other: the ghastly Fink and the equally ghastly, now defunct DarwinPorts, and it sort of works, because both of them take a little bit of care not to touch on each other's feet, or interfere with the Apple installation.
And the packagement management systems of the distributions will suddenly become your enemies.
And they do that... by mainatining their own /usr and /var hierarchies, under /opt and /sw.
As soon as you try to mix and match between them, you are going to be having to figure all this stuff out for yourself.
It's crap: I have three installations of Perl 5.8, and it's all I can do to make Fink believe that I have a 5Gb Tex Live installation and not add another Tex installation of its badly configured own.
