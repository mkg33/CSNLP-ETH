Your issue is because the original directory contains one or more files that appear under two or more paths each.
The copy lost information about which multiple paths should lead to the same file.
doesn't use Unix-like inodes, yet it supports hardlinks in its own way and Linux driver understands this.
For this reason each file in the copy is independent from any other, there are no two files being hardlinks to each other there; so Dolphin counts more of them.
Dolphin like du detects hardlinks and counts each inode just once.
It's hard to say if and how this will affect the game after you restore it to Windows in the future.
You can have 1000 files of 1 MiB each but if they are just one file hardlinked under 999 extra names then these tools will say there is one file total and the size is 1 MiB total.
I guess you used a copying tool that doesn't care about hardlinks; it just naively reads files and writes somewhere else, one by one.
It probably lost more: metadata like ownership and permissions, because Linux filesystems use different scheme than Windows.
I expect Dolphin or du to behave in a similar fashion when they calculate the number of files and total size.
