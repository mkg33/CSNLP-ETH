I'm not seeing any way to configure Monit to do this, but maybe I missed something.
I use more descriptive names in the real configuration.)
Say, if Monit has started a service and another service depends on it, poll at a 5 second interval rather than 2 minutes.
The 2 minute sleep is the default polling interval that Monit uses to check on services.
I stop a service and Monit keeps starting it back.)
If I instruct Monit to start the site, then once Monit has figured the dependencies, the sequence of actions on Monit's part is:
To bring up or bring down the site, there's a definite order by which the processes must be started or stopped.
I would also have to change the length of the polling cycle to something smaller so that a cycle is less than 2 minutes.
I've bracketed the last 2 steps because they are practically moot since the site is effectively up and running before the last 2 minute interval.
Here is an illustration of my prose description above.
(The names have been changed to protect the innocent.
After removing things that are not pertinent to the issue, the Monit configuration is like this:
I'd like Monit to only poll services more frequently when it is in the midst of waiting for a state change.
I'm using Monit to monitor various processes that need to be up and running as a group for a web site to work properly.
The problem is that it takes much more time than necessary to bring the whole site up.
I know that I could reduce this interval so that these services are always polled more frequently.
The site is always started or stopped through Monit so as to avoid the possibility of race conditions, or Monit working against me.
However, I don't want Monit to always poll these services more frequently.
