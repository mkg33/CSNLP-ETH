Dick Lipton has a new post out on the non-monotonicity of mathematical knowledge, and in it he documents examples of claims made that turned out to be false, or at least needed fixing.
Fortunately, Edelsbrunner, Seidel, and Sharir almost immediately found a correct (and much simpler!)
In 1990, Raimund Seidel discovered that the published proof was incorrect, after being challenged on a subtle technical point by a student in his computational geometry class.
The Zone Theorem is a key step in the proof that the standard recursive incremental algorithm to build an arrangement of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ runs in $O(n^d)$ time.
Raimund had taught the published "proof" in detail for several years before he was challenged.)
The proof also appears in Edelsbrunner's 1987 computational geometry textbook.
This is the favorite example of Verification people for doing formal analysis of crypto protocols.
proof of the Zone Theorem [New Results and New Trends in CS 1991, SICOMP 1993].
The Needham-Shroeder public key cryptography protocol, a 5-line protocol, has been shown insecure 17 years after its publication.
An infamous example in computational geometry is the incorrect proof of the Zone Theorem for hyperplane arrangements published by Edelsbrunner, O'Rourke, and Seidel [FOCS 1983, SICOMP 1986].
Meanwhile, a huge literature on hyperplane/halfspace/simplex/semialgebraic range searching had been developed, all of which relied on the $O(n^d)$ construction time for arrangements, which in turn relied on the Zone Theorem.
