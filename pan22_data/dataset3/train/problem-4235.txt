GoToAssist from Citrix will actively reduce the data being sent by optimizing the image.
I know this is an old topic, but for others, in your RDP file make sure this line is set to 1:
There may be a way around this but I'm not sure of it.
Optimal speeds can be achieved by pairing a gigabit ethernet card with a router/switch that can also handle the gigabit standard.
It doesn't matter if you have a fiber optic connection if the hardware on the computer cannot handle the incoming/outgoing information fast enough.
This will max out your bitmap cache so you request bitmap data less frequently.
It can be quite restrictive as to what you do on the PC you're remoting in to.
Many older XP machines and many laptops, even new ones, do not have the ability to make full use of high speed connections.
You can learn more about the speeds and standards by reading this article on it.
For example, in Vista, any network connection properties cannot be touched remotely.
This is because the network adapter is usually maxed out at 100mbit.
You might want to consider using a remote desktop application that does all of the above for you.
A major factor that hasn't been mentioned yet is the hardware installed on the computer.
I've only used it from a support point of view but for what it does, I think its pretty ingenious
Works well for anything down as far as a 512Kbit / 128Kbit ADSL connection
You can do this from the UI, but then add this magic line too:
This improves the speed to a maximum of 1000mbps (~1gbps) or 125 megabytes per second.
This bottleneck usually takes place in the ethernet adapter/network card.
To put that into perspective, 100megabits per second is 12.5 megabytes per second, not taking into consideration including any overhead on the network, host/remote PCs, and any traffic on the larger internet.
