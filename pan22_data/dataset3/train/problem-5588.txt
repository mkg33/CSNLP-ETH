Client sends packet with timestamp t1, Server responds with it's timestamp t2.
Assumption 1: When I say a is substracted from b it means "b - a", maybe in the text they actually meant the other way arround?
if it is latencies are asymetric then the las calculation gives different results depending where I put abs

Is there something I'm not seeing or there is a flow in this algorithm(which everyone is referring to)
clock delta = t2 - t3 + RTT/2 (again, gives a negative value, abs again?)
latency = RTT / 2    (more or less, again it shoul be positive)
RTT = t1 - t3  (gives a negative value, I guess it should be t3 - t1)
Surely this cannot be... if the client time to server time is the same as the client thrn the clock delta is the RTT or 0 if I do abs (t2 -t3) + RTT/2.
client server time delta = t2 - t3    (server timestamp - current time)
Assumption 2: the synchronization is to get the server clock on the client - If this is the gase shouldn't latency from server to client suffice?
