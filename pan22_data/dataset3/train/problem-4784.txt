Computer B just has the management tools, including Hyper-V Manager.
If something is still wrong just verify your configuration with this neat script (big thanks to its author!)
Almost every result I find when I search is for Hyper V server in a domain environment.
Check that the Virtual Machine Management service is running and that you are authorized to connect to the server.
Can I remote manage a Hyper-V Server that's running on Windows 8?
I have the same configuration and I had the same problem.
I am trying to connect to computer A from Computer B in Hyper-V Manager.
I have tried several suggestions I have found online to resolve this.
Computer A has Hyper-V installed with several VM's.
"An error occured while attempting to connect to server "Computer A".
Contact the administrator of the authorization policy for the computer "Computer A"."
I have created an account on both machines with the same user name and password, both with admin rights, and both in the Hyper-V Administrators group.
You do not have the required permission to complete this task.
I still receive the same error, and I have rebooted both machines just to make sure all the changes have taken place.
I have 2 computers with Windows 8.1 Pro in a Homegroup.
I have tried shift right-clicking Hyper-V Manager and running it as the account on Computer A.  I receive the same error.
