Its almost as if there is a loose connection from the raid card to the back plane and both of disks get lost and the raid card drops the config.
The raid card uses a SCSI SAS cable to connect to the back-plane so I guess the next step is to replace that, but... then I might as well replace the back-plane with a SCSI SAS to sata breakout cable, but... then I need a way to power the disks.
If you wish to try breakout cables instead to test the backplane - as you mentioned powering them will be an issue unless you are happy to make a cable yourself - there is a 20 or so pin power connector to the backplane that supplies enough power.
If you've connected consumer grade drives you should be aware that the PERC is expecting a FAST response (as in NOW not 2 or 3 seconds) on a write.
Another thing to consider is what type of drives you have connected to the controller.
I can build the raid fine and after a little while an install of server 08 r2 will blue screen and restart.
Also, check the firmware level on the drives as well.
Here is the link for the bios update: ftp://ftp.us.dell.com/bios/PE1950_BIOS_WIN_2.7.0.EXE
Ironically I want to get this system up and running so I can work on MCITP labs.
Sorry for the wall of txt but it would be great to get some thoughts from people who worked with perc raid cards or poweredge servers with this type of issue before.
The quick and dirty: the machine is a Dell Poweredge 1950, dual xeon quad cores, 8GB of ram, 2 2TB seagate SATAs in (supposed to be raid1) using a Perc 5i raid card.
For the drive firmware, go to support.dell.com and select your drive and then download the appropriate firmware.
When it comes up the raid controller says "Foreign Configuration Found."
When I go into the raid configuration panel there is no raid listed but I can import the "foreign config", and the OS will boot up fine, until it blue screens again after a little while.
If you have Dell certified drives it's worth upgrading the firmware on those as well - find as appropriate on Dell website.
I have tried swapping raid cards, swapping the RAM module on the raid card and swapping the raid battery, all to no avail.
Make sure the bios is completely up to date, along with the firmware on the Perc 5/i.
Thank you for any/all help and feel free to ask questions!
It's worth upgrading the BIOS's as mentioned - there will be one for the backplace as well.
