I understand that TCP/IP protocol is widely used as it is more secure (the third handshake).
The statement that UDP is unreliable is not to be taken at face value.
TCP/IP is widely used primarily because it is standardized vs competing networking protocol suites such as IPX/SPX and Appletalk.
But, is there any other reason why TCP/IP is more popular than UDP?
I'd say that the reason TCP is more commonly used than UDP is for several reasons:
On the other hand, in UDP the upper protocols have to handle the error cases, but with the freedom of connectionless communication.
Unlike UDP which is connection-less, meaning there is no communication channel established, the application just starts sending data and there is no mechanism to ensure data has been received successfully by the receiving endpoint (Unless some mechanism is implemented in the application layer) - it is mostly useful for real-time data (audio, video)
This has nothing to do with security, TCP is a connection oriented protocol which means the communicating end points have to setup the communication channel (using a 3 way handshake) and has an acknowledgment mechanism to assure data transfer - also, lost segments will be retransmitted.
The World Wide Web, the web, is another reason TCP/IP is so popular.
