So you could do a yum list available on your package, then compare your installed version using yum list installed, and have a good idea of which repo it came from if the versions match.
bluez-gstreamer.i386               4.30-2.fc10            updates
With yum-utils installed, repoquery will provide the information you seek (here 'epel' being the repository).
To see what installed from repo epel: (Should work under Centos 5.5) note, if you have no repo named epel, it will spit out every thing installed.

gstreamer.i386                     0.10.21-2.fc10         fedora
gstreamer-devel.x86_64             0.10.21-2.fc10         fedora

The package doesn't have that information, and yum doesn't care after it finds the package.
Not a great solution, but I found that yum list available will show you where the most up to date version of each package is available, e.g.
repoquery --repoid=epel -a | xargs yum list installed
You could probably piece it together by figuring out what repos have the package and then determine which one has priority.
