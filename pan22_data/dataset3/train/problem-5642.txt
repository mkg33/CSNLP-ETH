Put the email to be uploaded there and it will sync with Gmail.
Is there any alternative way to migrate this database to Microsoft Outlook or any open-source analogues like Mozilla Thunderbird?
Here is a free program that can handle very large email data stores.
I have a big mail archive (about 10GB) from the beginning of 2000x in my Microsoft Outlook Express.
They have a forum and FAQ to help answer questions like how to import OE to Eudora.
This client is very old and sometimes it is not usable to work with it.
Create a Gmail account and enable IMAP, then setup Outlook Express to sync with only one folder (Create a folder called Sync).
If the maximum size of email exceeds what is allowed in Outlook, then you may have to create multiple Archive files and move the mail accordingly.
Once in Gmail do the same setup from the new mail client like Outlook to get it from Gmail to the new client.
