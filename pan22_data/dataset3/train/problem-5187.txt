Each SYN packet received by that server will allocate some memory, which will stay allocated until the connection times out.
You could reduce the impact on that server by ensuring that your firewall responds to the unrecognized packet with a RST packet.
That way instead of having memory allocated until the connection times out, it will only be allocated for the few milliseconds it takes to send the SYN-ACK and get a RST back.
If that is indeed what is going on, it will be easy for the administrator to fend off this particular SYN flood, because they could just reject all SYN packets using 1 as ephemeral port.
The only part of the packet, which looks wrong, is the ephemeral port number.
That IP is being attacked, and the attacker is spoofing your source IP address in the attack (the attacker is likely spoofing thousands of other addresses simultaneously).
A SYN flood is attempting to exhaust memory on the server.
The ephemeral ports are supposed to be from 49152 and up, but in your packet, it is 1.
The packet looks almost like a legitimate SYN-ACK packet.
And the ephemeral port number is chosen by the attacker as well.
It looks like a possible SYN flood attack against 195.39.196.50.
