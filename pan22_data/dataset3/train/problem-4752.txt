If you did it from the server itself and it didn't work than I imagine Apache is not configured to listen on that port, or perhaps it isn't started /etc/init/httpd status or something similar.
Check the apache logs- is there anything in the error log showing any further light on the matter?
Also might be worth checking dmesg (/var/log/message) it might be that they use a SAN for your storage and its not been mounted correctly.
The server had been running fine, serving up sites through Apache2 until an engineer mistakenly cut through a power cable, taking the server offline.
Since they have resolved the power failure, I have been unable to access any of the sites on the server through my browser.
Default configuration won't necessarily have port 80 open.
I also found that MySQL had become corrupted after the unplanned shutdown and I have had to modify the my.cnf file to get it working again.
You can also run netstat -l to see what is listening.
Take Rapidswitch's advice and check the iptables (or whatever firewall you use) configuration.
I have tried TELNETing port 80 on the server and get no response.
Have you tried to telnet to port locally on the server itself?
A ps aux shows that multiple instances of Apache are running on the machine.
It's easy to configure the running configuration without saving it as the startup configuration.
If port 80 is being allowed (and on the correct IP address etc) then you have something to go back to Rapidswitch with.
When you say iptables does show anything, what does that mean exactly, can you post the output?
iptables -vNL will show you what the current config is.
Rapidswitch are refusing support for the issue claiming that it is probably to do with firewall settings but I have not changed anything along these lines on the server.
Any ideas on a fix or further debugging would be greatly appreciated!
