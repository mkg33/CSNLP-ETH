You have to place recovery.conf in the data directory.
We need to take incremental backups for postgres databases as well as we must be able to perform PITR.
However, as per 11.5 installation, there is no main directory.
The data directory is the directory where postgresql.conf is, unless the data_directory parameter in postgresql.conf says differently.
Also, there is no folder named "postgresql" got created in this installation at /var/lib location.
It will be appreciated ,if someone specifies where to create  recovery.conf, so that it will actually work or share the doc/link to implement incremental backups as well as PITR for postgres 11.5
I started working around the steps mentioned there.
The article says to create the recovery.conf in main directory.
It is better to understand the process (as explained in the documentation), then problems like this won't happen.
I tried to go with creating recovery.conf at this path "/var/lib/pgsql/11/data" only.
However, I couldn't find much and found https://www.scalingpostgres.com/tutorials/postgresql-backup-point-in-time-recovery/
However, after that when I restarted postgres services,it didn't work.
I searched a lot on internet and tried to find out any article referencing method for incremental + PITR for postgres 11.5.
