No more using "adb install" besides a few random times.
Many try to install the newer Androids and do not realize on slow machines, this will not work well.
And also installing it through "adb install" then path to appbrain.apk.
Then in "Variable value" go to the very end of the line, the very end.
If you want a environment thats quick on slower machines.
You can also install android-x86 in a virtual machine (virtual box...) on your pc, copy your APK from your desktop to this VM and install it.
You can also consider getting "RAM Booster" from the "1Mobile Market".
And add ";C:\" plus the path where you have adb located on your system.
Here below are some of the Top Android Emulators that you can use to run Android Apps on your System without any issues...
Or click "New..." then under "Variable name" add "JAVA_HOME".
Then in terminal type "adb install" then the path where you have 1Mobile Market .apk.
If you would like to just make a simple environment variable for Java64 then either look for "JAVA_HOME" and add the Java64 path.
Few other suggestions if you have a intel with virtualization.
From now on you will be able to install all programs from emulator.
Test the example environment first with your system.
Select "Advanced system settings" from left side menu.
The below example on a slow system takes no more than 2 minutes to start.
Then in "Variable value" add the path of your Java64.
If it slows down, revert to the state you had it previously.
Then under "System variables" find "Path" then click "Edit...".

As well as "Appbrain" will always make sure you have the recent one installed.
Once this is installed you can do all future installs through "1Mobile Market".
