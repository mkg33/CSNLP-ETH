- Try disconnect and re-connect (without rebooting laptop) when the issue comes on.
- try to update to the latest WiFi driver for my dell laptop.
Ever since the beginning, it has a strange issue of: I'll be using it for about 1 hour to 2 hours, the Internet all the sudden will become very slow (the wifi connection still shows connected, but it slows to the point where you got no response).
I suspect there's something wrong either with the wireless adapter in the laptop, or some kind of driver or software bugs that at the beginning it would work, after you use it for a while, it fills up something that don't clear.
If you're certain you have Dell's latest NIC drivers then I suggest installing Avast (http://download.cnet.com/Avast-Free-Antivirus-2015/3001-2239_4-10019223.html) or equivalent AV software.
I downloaded the dell update tool and it installed 3 updates (not sure what are installed since the Dell update tool shows you no details).
Start task manager (TaskMgr.exe) and on the Processes tab sort on CPU usage so that the higher percentages are at the top.
This laptop is about 1 year old, and the problem is a problem from the beginning.
I rebooted, and the problem seems to go away for now.
Then after I reboot it, it will start working normal again and then stop working again after 2 hours.
Note which processes are demanding the highest CPU usage - investigate any that are not M$/W8 specific.
What's the CPU / hard disk usage look like right around when the WiFi slows / stops?
Avast works really well at obliterating virii / malware.
