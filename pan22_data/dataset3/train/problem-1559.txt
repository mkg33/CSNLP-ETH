services already configured, how about a cron which scp's the log files from the server
You want to send mail, but not configure a mail server.
If it works better, you could place the cron on the Ubuntu server and have it issue ssh commands to the second server to pull the data down and mail it.
Also, most programming/scripting languages have SMTP libraries available, so if you're familiar with, say, Perl or Python, you could write a little script that connects to an SMTP server to send the mail - basically you'd be writing your own, simpler version of ssmtp.
Prior to this you could put the stuff you want reported in that file with whatever scripts or cp commands you would need to do.
Allows command line usage incuding the ability to send attachments.
I use a perl script with Mail::Sendmail to email reports from my servers (and Net::Twitter for status updates).
Postfix can be set up to send out email in a few seconds, and it would often be
It's probably one of the simplest ways you can get the capability to send emails programmatically.
A web search for "ssmtp" should come up with plenty of tutorials and instructions on how to configure it.

If you cannot or will not set up email on that system, what do we have left?
If one of your servers or web hosting sites does have ssh, and probably has mail
useful to get normal emails sent to root, such as notices of MD raid components in failure.
Of course, that means dealing with CPAN which may not be worth it as you have to make the packages.
It will work on most Linux distributions out of box.
Look into ssmtp, which is a sendmail replacement that just passes on email to an SMTP server that you configure it with.
