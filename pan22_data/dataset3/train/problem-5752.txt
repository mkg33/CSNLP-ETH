When I bought them I didn't think about the connection issues that I might face.
I saw one showing how to connect back to back but it still needs a serial interface which I don't have.
If three routers are enough for your lab, and you just need lots of interfaces, you can try connecting them up like this (since you say each router has two interfaces available):
These sub-interfaces will show up in the running-configuration as independent interfaces allowing you to, for example, create a network with hundreds of interfaces, subnets and so forth.
The AUX port is a serial interface used for managing the router itself.
I'm trying not to buy anymore equipment i.e HWIC cards.
I have 3 cisco 2821 routers for home lab studying for CCNA.
They have only 2 gigabit ports and for many of the labs it looks like I need more.
and then create as many sub-interfaces on each physical interface as you like.
I've looked up connecting routers by the AUX ports but cannot find a specific document.
Any way to connect just using the AUX ports and what cable do I need?
