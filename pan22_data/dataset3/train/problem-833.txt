I understand the question (and I really like Ryan Thompson's explanation of the problem, though it's more an anachronism than a design flaw).
This was tested on Ubuntu 9.04 after installing the xsel package.
In particular when programming, it's handy to post error messages in Firefox' search box, to see what Google has to say on the matter :) On linux and particularly X11, it's even more handy since you only have to select some text to put in the X buffer, to later paste it with the middle button.
It should be easy to adapt this to another desktop environment.
Unfortunately, before pasting in the search box, you need to clear it.
The keyboard shortcut was added to the Gnome environment via the tool Keyboard Shortcuts found in the menu System->Preferences.
If your system does not provide the command xdg-open, you may replace it with the command firefox (xdg-open chooses the default browser to open urls).
I'm not entirely sure I understand the question, but here's a favorite set-up of mine:
So basically I have to Ctrl+K Del middle click to paste my text in the search box.
Perhaps the simplest, no-install way is to make a change in your habits.
Once done, you just have to select the text you want searched on google and press your chosen keyboard shortcut.
Then you can map the middle mouse button to send Ctrl + k + Del in one shot only if Firefox is the active window.
