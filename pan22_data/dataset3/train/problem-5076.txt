Instead of mapping a new share with the new password, you should disconnect the shares with a bad password, and reconnect with the new one.
I should note that the difference between Joe and other users in domain A is that Joe already has some folders from the server mapped onto his machine.
If you have a lot of drives that need to be redone you can do net use /d * to remove all mapped drives at once.
In domain B we have a server, with the share "Company$".
AND, because he forgot his password, I changed it for him.
You'll want to disconnect all drive using the old credentials.
It's trying to use the credentials it already knows about to map the drive.
One of my users, we'll call him "Joe", cannot mount that share.
I'm a Linux administrator by experience, so this is new territory for me.
In domain A we have users that are mapping the share to a drive letter.
We have Windows 7 SP1... is this a bug, or do I just not understand Windows shares?
So he has shares mapped using his old password, and now we want to map a share using his new password.
When he attempts it, including using credentials in domain B, his workstation simply sits for a minute or two "Attempting to connect to...", and then the credentials dialog box comes back.
After you unmap the drives you'll want to go into ADUC and make sure the account isn't locked.
