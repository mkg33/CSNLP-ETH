The workflow may not work for you, but that is the big gotcha on this type of thing.
You can avail of the FREE trial versions for 60-days for evaluation to see how it meets your needs.
Instead of using different tools you mention, this MS Project would consolidate all project management tasks in 1 user-friendly dashboard.
But I can suggest you to use profhub as we are using this software for the past 2 years.
Requires some time investment to learn, but then is very flexible in how you can use it.
You can test drive the service free for 30 days, then pick a plan (starting @ $15/month) that best suits your needs.
Emacs with org-mode http://orgmode.org/ works very well for me.
The Mac version of the software may have different features though.
IIRC (never used it), MS Office has Journaling, which tracks usage across all office applications including outlook, and outlook has task lists, integrated calendar, flagging/categorizing of email etc.
I did a quick search, but journaling is also used in linux filesystems, so there is a lot of noise in the results.
It's really hard to tell what's going to suit you without a detailed description of what particular tools you need.
It is one of the best project and portfolio management software I have used.
