Now tracks will play at their individual volumes; watch out for
In Spotify, go to edit, preferences, scroll down to the Playback section, and uncheck the box beside
what Spotify's specific policy on this is, but for many music-managers the volume level of the quietest song is used,
usually used is that when you digitally increase a track's volume past 100% it results in poorer sound.
I like my music LOUD, and if I want to listen to Spotify loud, I need to turn up my amp 40 percent more than usual, which just isn't good.
The reason why the track with the lowest volume is
Is there some way to raise the volume of this application alone in live time, or some software that would let me do this?
Normally I'd just tollerate it, but Spotify's output is about %40 lower in volume than the other applications on my computer, meaning that I really have to crank up the volume on my amplifier, which I don't like doing.
One thing that really bothers me with this software is that it's output volume is very quiet compared to the other software that I use on my computer (Premiere Pro, iTunes, Cubase, Firefox, and pretty much any other software that can output audio).
It causes my audio to distort or crackle sometimes, as well, which I don't like either.
I use Spotify to listen to music on my computer while working.
all tracks above that are lowered to match its volume level.
It could be due to automatic-volume-leveling (aka volume-normalization) which adjusts all songs to the same loudness volume level; something to try anyway.
sudden-blaring caused by volume difference between songs (the reason why volume-leveling what invented)!
PS: Make sure you have the volume turned up appropriately within Spotify, it's the bar on the bottom left.
Spotify just doesn't output as... loud... as other applications do.
This is not caused by me not having the volume setting at 100 in the windows 7 volume mixer, or anything like that.
