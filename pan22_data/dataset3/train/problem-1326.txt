I don't know whether to use postfix transports, procmail or something within zimbra.
With procmail I think I would need to use a pipe, but I've never used procmail.
Note There are no accounts on the local Zimbra server under the fax.mydomain.com subdomain and the prefix 123456 will not be constant, e.g.
As an example, a user sends an email to 1234564@fax.mydomain.com and I want the exact email forwarded outside mydomain.com to 1234564@example.com.
I think that postfix transports requires that I specify a different SMTP server, e.g.
I've tried to find a feature within Zimbra and I tried to zmprov md fax.mydomain.com zimbraMailCatchAllForwardingAddress @example.com but the emails bounced.
How can I automatically forward outgoing emails to a different domain?
I know that the easy thing would be to have users send the emails directly to the @example.com domain, but I'd rather have them use the local fax.mydomain.com domain and have the email forwarded/ redirected.
it will change depending on fax recipient's number.
