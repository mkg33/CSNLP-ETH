You should look into Electro Server, or if you can dumb down the design a bit and make everything play asynchronously like a lot of facebook games do then using a RESTful webservice setup can work very nicely...
To be able to handle the number of simultaneous users that you intend to, for any game relying on realtime interaction, you'd typically need a dedicated server with a mighty strong/fast connection, running a direct tcp/ip connection to each client.
Even for something turn based, such as chess or magic the gathering, if you tried to implement an RPC or REST (http tunnelling) service, the resulting speed drop with 200 simultaneous connections to a single server would degrade the user experience to the point of frustration.
Otherwise Jordaan Mylonas said it all pretty well.
the throughput is important and by using a web service, you will increase the size of the message by unnecessary information inside your header messages.
I would advise you to make your own customize web service over a tcp or udp connection.
