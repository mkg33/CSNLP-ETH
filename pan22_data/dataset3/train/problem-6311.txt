I can also ping to my workstation, after setting up the VPN connection.
My goal is to log on to this workstation from my Windows 8.1 laptop, which is not connected to the same network.
Now the problem is that SSH (using Putty) through the tunnel does not seem to work.
Any ideas on how to get my Windows laptop to connect to the SSH server through the VPN?
From my laptop, I can log on to my University's VPN using a Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.
Putty keeps giving me "Network error: Connection timed out".
The SSH server is listening on both IPv4 and IPv6:
On my Ubuntu Linux workstation, I have a properly working SSH server.
(The Cisco client is (I think) configured to drop all IPv6 traffic, that's why I checked that IPv4 connections were also allowed.)
Note that I am sure I'm pinging the right computer (thus ruling out IP conflicts or so), since when I monitor incoming ICMP requests there, the pings from my Windows machine are coming through.
I can log on to this machine from other machines in the same (physical) network.
