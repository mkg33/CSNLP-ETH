I sometimes have to look through files that contain thousands of similar adjacent lines that, for example, all say "Computing something" and I'm interested in the next line after the current block, which does not contain the word "Computing".
Not only can you jump between lines that don't contain X, you can hide the lines that do contain X, using less's & regex filter command.
Once you find the line you want you can bring the others back if you need their context - type & then the enter key to remove the filter.
then type &!^Computingthen the enter key and all those line will be hidden from view.
In the Unix less tool, is it possible to jump to the next line that does not contain a certain expression?
You can still search within the remaining lines with /.
The disadvantage is that you have to quit and restart grep to change the pattern; the advantage is that the lines you don't want to see are hidden, which makes it easier to spot interesting patterns in the lines that you are interested in.
