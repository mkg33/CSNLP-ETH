Worst case would be to find another mobo with the same disk controller as your old one and set it up so you can boot your old RAID, then shovel the data onto your new server.
My file server is dead, I think it's the motherboard.
You RAID 1 volume should be able to be loaded into any external enclosure and read from.
If that doesn't work, things could be a bit more difficult:
They all contain the same data, with the exception of the parity data which ensures the data is correct within the RAID set.
with any luck, you will be able to read from it and you can move the files to your Synology.
If you had them all attached as single volumes, and used Win8 to RAID them, the above method should work for you.
This is one of the only upsides to using software RAID, that it is hardware independent(for the most part).
Before anything, I would take the non-Parity disk and pop it into an external enclosure.
AFAIK, if you are using Windows software RAID, the only thing that can utilize that particular type of RAID would be the Windows where it was created.
Unfortunately, I have no idea how you also had your disks configured within the controller.
In theory, if you connect all of your disks to your NUC in the same ports as your file server, the system 'should' boot up.
You also only need one of the disks, since they are simple mirrors of each other.
Like a RAID1, a RAID5 is simply 5 disks mirrored to each other.
I have an Intel NUC, is it possible to use SATA to USB cables and then recreate the RAIDs on the NUC so I can migrate to Synology?
I have a RAID 1 and a RAID 5 setup (Windows 8 software RAID) which I would like to migrate to a new Synology DS414.
After that just transfer the files over to your Synology.
