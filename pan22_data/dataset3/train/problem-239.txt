I would rather not spend another chunk of money, and I've no actual AlphaSSL account so I am not sure I can really ask for support or redo the signing.
Just look at the file dates, because names might be random.
If you loose your private key - bang, you're gone.
If you could provide any advice or help I would appreciate it.
If you have a root login to a server you have generated it on, and if you did it via whm/cpanel
Like @sh1ny already said: if your private key is gone, you're* out of options.
It had asked me for confirmation and I received apparently an intermediate chain certificate, however I just placed it in foo.com.crt and it worked fine on my domain.
If they can help you out in another way than revoking your certificate or maybe signing another CSR free of charge, then you should avoid them anyway!
Perhaps this time from somewhere that doesn't gauge you on simple things like automatically signed basic TLS certificates?
I thought this was due to me not using the intermediate chaining, so I had foolishly overwritten the .csr and .key to try to install the GlobalSign root cert before the AlphaSSL one provided to me by dynadot in the same .csr file, however it gives me a warning about a mismatch with my .key file now (I am using nginx)
I had tried to reproduce my steps and settings, however I cannot get the (fresh crt, just what was given to me by dynadot) and .key that I regenerated with the same settings - it just mismatches.
I have generated a .csr and .key file to send to dynadot (which sends that to AlphaSSL) with this command:
they might have been there until the system cleanup...
or generate the private .key from the .csr I was given?
Contrary to what the purchasing pages had stated, SSL only works on (domain.com) and not (www.domain.com) and I had used domain.com for my common name when generating the original signing request.
