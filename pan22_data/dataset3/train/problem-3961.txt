To convert from DV HD to mp4, ffmpeg can do that easily using a single command line.
The NAS/computer would see new files there and automatically transcode the video to settings I have already picked and save them to a folder that is sync'd with AWS S3 or some other cloud storage system.
Sending to the NAS can be done by syncing a folder on your machine and a folder on the NAS.
- it may be possible to feed ffmpeg directly with the camera output stream (virtual file as input to ffmpeg).
I know that freenas and such will do somehting similar for xbox360 and ps3 transcoding - can I tap into this for my solution?
I'm looking for a solution to take video files from my HD Camera and automate transcoding to a smaller format and then uploading to the cloud (AWS or otherwise).
To monitor the first folder and run the converter, a simple script can do this.
Sending from the NAS to Amazon S3 is supported by some NAS (Synology for instance).
- it may be possible to sync a PC folder to S3 or Google Cloud directly without the NAS doing it.
The ideal workflow would be, I have a NAS or a folder where I could simply drag the raw files from the camera to.
