then set this one instead of unknown 10.11.12.13:85
I'm trying to start an instance of Apache 2.2 server with a fairly-close-to-standard configuration file.
The change is that I inserted this into httpd.conf:
To find the local address in use, go into control panel, network and sharing center, click on the wireless connection, then on the "details" button, and the IPv4 address should be the local machine address.
In order to find a socket to bind to you can point to the local machine address.
You can add this address and a good socket like 8088 to httpd.conf as a "Listen" parameter - e.g.
: make_sock: could not bind to address 10.1.1.233:443
That seems to change when you turn the computer off and on.
There could be reason the IP address you are pointing is generic one.
I made one small change because I want Apache to serve a single XML file separately from everything else it does, purely for testing on my local machine.
There's nothing special about 10.11.12.13:85; I just figured that was an IP that wouldn't interfere with anything.
What does this error mean, and how can I resolve it?
And you get error >>> (OS 10049)The requested address is not valid in its context.
in CMD , type: ipconfig, and see your local IP address.
Listen 127.0.0.1:8088 (that is a default localhost but your IP will be different) - you can list more than one of these addresses and it will bind to one that is free.
Apache cannot bind to the local IP address you gave, because the computer is not configured with that IP address.
