As to what mechanism is actually doing that, I don't know; but that explains the "2e".
You might also see files that start with ._ and these files are the resource fork of the file from an Samba connection.
These are a real pain if you also use other systems than MacOS to access the files because they don't know about this pairing and if you move, rename or delete files, you end up with lot of orphaned ._xxx files.
I wouldn't recommend deleting the dot files because it can cause problems with some of the applications that still use resource forks (plus most of them will just get recreated anyways).
Not sure why they are called :2e_something instead of .DS_Store, but nevertheless, TemporaryItems are created by Carbon applications (which is the old MacOS 9 compability layer still used by a few programs, ie.
Just a guess here, but 0x2e is hex for 46, which is ASCII for the period character ..
MS-Office), and you can't get rid of them, AFAIK, but they are safe to delete.
The system creates them in the first place because MacOS can't use extended attributes via Samba, even if the underlying FS would support them, so it stores such things as resource forks, folder labels etc.
We have these files on some of our servers and in the end we decided it wasn't worth the effort to clean them up every night due to the potential loss of data.
I assume that the .DS_Store files are getting renamed in such a way that they don't collide with the Linux naming convention that anything beginning with a dot is a hidden file.
