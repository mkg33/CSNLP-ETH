The problem arises when the user tries to enter a folder created by himself, resulting in a "Permission Denied".
I tried giving the folder ownership to the group, and just to test I chmod -R 777 * /mnt/nas/rec this will make the folder hts created writable, but if I then create a new folder inside this one the same problem persist.
I now have a user hts that should be allowed to write to my /mnt/nas/rec folder, I started with adding the user to the group nogroup this went well and the user can now create folders inside /mnt/nas/rec, good.
This will prevent hts from being able to cd into the directories,
I don’t see anything in your question that would explain why this is happening,
I'm currently at a point where I dont know what more I can try.
I guess I have to give all new files created inside /mnt/nas/rec a "writable by group" setting, but how?
I don’t see where you’ve said anything to indicate that your problem
To access a directory in just about any way, you need to have “execute” (x) permission to it.
but, if all the other users are OK, we can assume that there’s something wrong with the hts user.
And created a new folder in /mnt/nas/rec giving me this :
(Just type umask in the shell when logged in as hts.)
The owner of the test1 and hehehe directories (which is hts)
The “obvious” possibility is that his umask is set wrong; e.g., 102.
I then tried ls -al which gives me the following :
The mount is shared with SAMBA, and guest users are assigned as the user nobody and are tied to the group nogroup, this may not be ideal, but it work pretty good for my intentions.
I know there is a trillion different questions concerning this / problem like this, but I feel like I have tried them all, setting umask and ACL and much more..
doesn’t have execute permission to the directories; it has only read & write (rw-) permissions.
It should be something like 2 or 22 (i.e., 002 or 022).
It is woth to mention that SAMBA users can write and make as many directories as they want in the /mnt/nas/rec folder.
Why is this folder not writable by the user creating it?
