The two options i see is to either convince management that IE6 is a large security risk to the network (as it is) and that if anything the intranet apps need to be updated to avoid the risk of the entire network becoming open to attack or convince them to allow something like Firefox or chrome for browing online but restrict IE6 to local browsing for the intranet apps.
You will found arguments on stopie.com or, from a developer point of view, things that you will do when IE6 will be over, but also, use the fact that many websites are now making ads against IE 6 like :
We're tired of supporting an ailing browser when users call us up constantly complaining that website don't look right, and more and more people asking for browser tabs "because that's what they've got at home".
This is a tricky thing that i have tried to fight but i haven't had much luck in the past.
Regardless of the numerous security warnings our there and lack of applicability in the greater world wide web, my manager still sees intranet apps written for IE6 as the main reason to stay on it.
Also, if you read French, take a look on Tristan Nitot's blog ("CEO" for Mozilla Europe) where you will find some good content on that subject.
We've already rolled out Windows XP SP2 (no hope of going to Vista or Windows 7 in the foreseeable future unfortunately) across the enterprise and our latest internal roll-out actually incorporates SP3 as well - but unfortunately IE is explicitly being kept at version 6.
