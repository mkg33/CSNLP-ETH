you'll see only 255 first text characters, because EXCEL thinks it's a negative number.
It seems that Excel's import tries to process the field as a number because of the dash, and the number import trims it to 255 characters.
Then Excel won't even try to parse it as a number, and I get the full column width.
In the import wizard, I selected the column that was having trouble and switched its type from General to Text.
Get Excel to run through the text import wizard (by using something like a .txt file extension or use .xls extension, accept the warning, select the first column, and do Data => 'Text to Columns').
To avoid the problem, I had to import the csv instead of just opening it.
I had a similar problem, all my values was in format(to can convert numbers to numbers, text to text, but it was cut long texts:
But if you have a cell that calls to number parser, fails and then calls to text parser, here will be the big mess.
I'll explain here how to avoid (not fix, just avoid) it, and maybe it will fixed soon by MS Office programmers.
The maximum length of the text cell is 32767, and it's OK.
I ran into this problem with a csv file that had some long text fields that sometimes began with a dash.
But if you'll put a little minus at the start, as in
When that fails, it imports it as text, but only the first 255 characters.
if you'll put a = at the start, you'll see only 255 first text characters, because EXCEL thinks it's a number, so remove = at start.
The maximum length of the number cell is 255, and it's OK.
Maybe it even WAS fixed in Excel 2013, I did not open it yet.
Then change the column type from General to Text near the end of the wizard.
