I would also have issues where if I suspended the laptop on a dock which was using the external monitor as the primary, when unsuspending undocked I would have a totally black screen.
Under Windows-7 it is better, but there is still a 5-second wait for the UAC to pop up, during which time the monitor is all black.
I've had my Dell Vista (and Windows-7) laptop and desktop behave a bit like this.
In my laptop's case, if I suspend the laptop undocked, then unsuspend docked when attached to a new monitor (or one the computer hasn't seen for a while) the video mode goes 800x600 until I define the resolution on the monitor correctly.
I would then have to type in the password to login blind.
My desktop, which is an older Dell Dimension 5150, would also go all-black when the UAC popped up -- except for the UAC window.
Upgrading to Windows-7 and making a habit of hibernating rather than suspending turns out to be a more-or-less effective work-around, even if hibernating is much slower than suspending.
I blame this on the stone-aged video chipset in this computer.
I worked out that this was because the video-display applet (either the built-in or the supplied nVidia one) only ran once the user had logged in.
I think this was because the video chipset wasn't supported properly under Vista for Aero.
