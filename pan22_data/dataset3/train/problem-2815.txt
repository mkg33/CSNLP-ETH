and on the public Internet I have the domain name home.notarealdomainname.com.
My NAS comes with a self-signed certificate which isn't really fit for purpose, I would like to install an SNI certificate that supports both the hostnames nas.domain.local.
I don't want to issue my own certificate as, for expediency in use, I would like browsers to trust the certificate.
Which means: either you accept the self-signed certificate once on all internal devices or you need to roll your own private PKI structure and import the relevant root-CA on all devices.
pointing to my home router (which then forwards port 7000 to my NAS' HTTPS server on port 443).
domain name so they wouldn't issue that certificate.
Public CAs will only issue certificates for public domains.
Inside my LAN my NAS has the hostname nas.domain.local.
There was a time when they did but abandoned this behavior because this caused problems with newly introduced top-level domains.
- however all of the major CAs perform some form of domain-validation (as they should!)
Also, CA only issue certificates for domains which are only owned and used by a single party, which is not the case for internal names.
I have a Synology NAS at home, which has a web-based user-interface which I expose to the public Internet.
