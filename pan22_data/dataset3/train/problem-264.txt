There is also a number of other solutions available on market that can help you to get the desired result.
This is, essentially, a built-in hyper-converged solution from Microsoft itself: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview
This one can be built from 2 or 3 hosts and does not require Datacenter licenses.
To sum up, the answer is "Yes" you can achieve what you want :)
Single storage host is always a single point of failure.
That's why HA clustering requires a shared storage.
In order to achieve the "True HA" which means not only the VM failover but also the storage failover, one storage host is just not enough.

I can also recommend you to try "StarWind Virtual SAN", which is a third-party Windows-native solution that does, basically, the same thing as one above along with providing some extra features.
If you have 3x Windows Server 2016 Datacenter licenses, you can consider configuring the Storage Spaces Direct.
