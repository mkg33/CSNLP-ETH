And make sure uncomment pam_limits.so from the different files under /etc/pam.d, e.g.
ulimit -n upon login (and for services that are started upon bootup) shows 1024 still.
Had to add both 'hard' and 'soft' entries in /etc/security/limits.conf for pam to recognize settings for rtprio (-r) and memlock (-l).
All init startup scripts source /etc/init.d/functions so for all services you could hack that script and set limits there.
In my case the limit was not set due to an error causing the default value (1024) to be used.
I have the following lines in /etc/security/limits.conf
If you want to set it permanently, especially for a particular user, change the file /etc/security/limits.conf to have the following lines (assume user = www-data)
For services in init.d you cannot use /etc/security/limits.d inittab is not reading that files and it is based on pam.d which is not used in initialization startup scripts.
The pam_limits.so file is required in each of the following files.
I used to hack /etc/sysconfig for particular services when I needed {httpd, some brokenass oracle stuf} e.t.c.
sudo, login, sshd, ... after following above steps which you have already did.
