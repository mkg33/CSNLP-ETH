Can somebody tell me what I'm doing wrong to have docker send give this particular error ?
COPY failed: stat /var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-builder780242597/nginx.conf: no such file or directory.
If you want to look at the full project, it's a dotnetcore websocket server test application with a server and a client application.
I have two Dockerfile, one for the app and one for an NGINX proxy.
I am building a simple DotnetCore application with docker-compose support with VS2017.
This is what the docker-compose.yml file looks like
Which was simply moving the Dockerfile that was having issues at the root level of the docker-compose.yaml file.
I tried building this Dockerfile by itself and it works, but when I use docker-compose it gives the error above.
This is the aspnetcore app Dockerfile, there's many COPY statement in there and they all work properly!
On top of that, there is a docker-compose.yml file that wraps both of these together.

This is the nginx Dockerfile which can't manage to copy files properly.
