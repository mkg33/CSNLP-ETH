The WD Web page you refer to is quite clear about the meaning of error 226:
At this moment, the spare pool sector is re-mapped to appear as occurring in the logical sequence at precisely the same spot as the de-commissioned sector.
At some point, however, the spare pool is exhausted, and no relocation nor remapping can take place.
This is why WD's suggestion to replace the disk is a sound one; your disk is still fully functional, but just yet.
When a bad sector is found, it is marked as defective and thus de-commissioned, and replaced with a functioning sector from its spare pool.
If a sector in a critical position fails (there are linked lists on any HDD), most if not all of the data on the entire disk will essentially be lost, or may be potentially recovered only with some effort.
In any case, even if the failure does not occur in a critical sector, it will entail data loss of some sort.
All disks have a small pool of back-up sectors, which are used to replace bad sectors in two distinct phases of an HDD life, first during manufacture and then during normal disk operation.
It is perhaps useful to remark that these defects occur even immediately after completion of the manufacturing process, and it is a testament to the efficacy of these recovery mechanisms that most us are not even remotely aware of the existence of the defects and of the recovery strategy.
The manufacture's message is basically a you have been warned sign.
In other words, all of us, all of the time, are using partially defective disks.
