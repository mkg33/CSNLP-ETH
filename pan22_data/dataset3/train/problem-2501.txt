I moved the database from its original location to another path a few months ago, because I was running out of space.
Trying to start again, the logfile /mnt/media/mysql_db/hostname.err did not even get touched anymore.
On Arch, but also on Debian, I tried to start mysqld with their respective commands.
I checked /var/log and any other location I could think of, but no file gets touched by mysql.
* files again, since they weren't intially there anyway, but it still failes and does not give any output.
So I mounted it on the new system and it complained about some mysql-bin.index missing, so I copied that file from /var/lib/mysql (it assume it was created when I first ran mysqld with an unmodified configuration).
The old operating system still exists (nearly) unmodified, as I bought new disks.
This is the only modification, I made to the original folder.
/mnt/media is the exact same LVM drive for both systems.
Any idea how to limit my search or find a solution?
So now the start commands fails but does not give notice to me why.
I just installed archlinux x64, previously I used a 32-bit Debian.
So I tried booting into my old system, but here same thing now.
On both systems it just hangs until it finally gives up and reports failure.
