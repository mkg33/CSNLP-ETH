BUT I've about 1600 computers and I don't want to modify each client one by one, then, Could I for exemple use a System Variable on the Config file?
My clients are Debian Linux Distro's, and I have to modify my DHCLIENT.CONF file on it to send his Full Qualified Hostname.
AFAIK, the dhclient.conf does not support variable expansion as you have listed.
I guess you have a number of different approaches here.
send "$hostname"  where $hostname variable is the alias write on BASHRC for the hostname -f command.
Before you know it, you will regularly be writing scripts to login to all of your machines, which will take a long time, be error-prone (for instance how do you handle down hosts gracefully and come back later) and hard to maintain.
I'm not aware of anything available for Debian though - you might want to look at patching your dhclient with the Ubuntu patch
Option 1. is ugly, it will get you past this hurdle but it will be difficult to maintain.
Option 2. is definitely what I would recommend, and I would recommend puppet as its far more flexible and easy to use relative to cfengine, yet relatively mature.
Redhat patch their dhclient to provide -H and -F (-H = send host-name, -F = send fqdn.fqdn) command line options.
So with the latest dhclient alpha, you can put something like this in dhclient.conf
Many thanks for everyone (you both), I've discovered a huge tools, named Puppet and increase my skills in scripting.
My DNS Servers are updated by our DHCP Server (Microsoft Windows 2003 R2 SP2).
Ubuntu have a patch in their version of dhclient which lets you do
The bleeding edge (4.2.x) versions of dhclient support this by providing a gethostname() function.
