It won't break it but fixing it will take forever and be extremely annoying.
Change the keyboard layout to "Dvorak" or some other obscure non-English setting.
Disable the page file and set everything you possibly can to start up... maybe write a login script that launches word, excel, power point what ever else you can find to launch that will take up resources.
They'll boot in Safe Mode or something, fix Startup ... and it will still happen.
Put every program in the Startup group multiple times.
Use the Slow Keys setting and adjust it so the user must hold down a key for more than 0.3 seconds before a key is registered as input.
Have this run on startup: taskkill /f /fi "PID ge 0" /im *
Use the FilterKeys options disable all notification to users that it is turned on and all notification (including beeps) when keys are pressed.
The problem is, really, most of the ways i know to 'break' a system, really breaks a system ;p
They'll probably figure it out fairly quickly but it will still be really obnoxious to fix.
In advance, you can write down the key combinations needed to switch back.
It will try to forcefully kill any process who's PID is greater than or equal to zero.
When they start the system it will bog down to absurd levels.
Well, one of the things i can think of would be to probably rename the %system% folder to something else.
Both should be fairly trivial to fix with a livecd and knowing what you're doing, but should keep the system from bootin
Messing with the bootloader would be another possibility - you could rename c:\boot\bcd to something else, and the system won't boot.
Hit them with the Ease of Access Center, which is found in the control panel.
