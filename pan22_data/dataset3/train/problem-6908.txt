In our case we are using Active Directory, but any username/password lookup that works with PAM would be acceptable (ie: Kerberos, LDAP, etc).
Not knowing your exact setup, I just wanted to put that option out there for you because it could be a better solution depending on what you are trying to achieve and the scale you are trying to implement.
This gets complicated and introduces other security issues.
As noted in the comments it'll probably be a good idea to use a different mount point.
To answer your headline question yes, it is possible to mount your /media/ant from a .bashrc simply put
Now when you try to access the /media/ant files it should be autmagically mounted.
If this doesn't do what you want then you probably want to configure the automounter to mount he share when it is accessed e.g.
As configured the /media/ant directory will be mounted when your system is started or when a root capable account issues a suitable mount command e.g.
In my fstab I got //192.168.1.104/ant     /media/ant              cifs    gid=users,file_mode=0664,dir_mode=0775,auto,username=***,password=***  0 0 but this is not working only when editing the fstab file and running mount -a, so I though maybe it will work if I use the .bashrc file?
It would be most useful if you are trying to do this with many or most users that login to this computer.
Unfortunately you have to run mount as root so you have to arrange arrange for the particular user to be able to run mount as root e.g.
Is it possible to mount a Samba network share on start-up using the .bashrc file
This is most useful if you are using a central database for usernames and passwords across multiple machines.
Another option could be a PAM from the project pam_mount.
After you configure PAM and pam_mount, everything is done for you automatically during the login process, including the username/password exchange for (in this case) your SAMBA share.
