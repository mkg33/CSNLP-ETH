I have a mapped network drive to do the copying, but I could also use FTP.
Once those executables are copied I want to instruct the remote PC to run the application.
Once the application completes some logs will be generated.
If you don't want to rely on this you could also take psexec, which is part of the Sysinternals tools, into consideration.
With your kind of scenario there are a lot of different approaches you could be going for.
In my opinion the last option is probably the most comfortable one.
Again you would need to make sure that you're able to reach the remote machine on certain ports but it could be easier to use this in combination with VBScript (Original Suggestion by Zumo de Vidrio).
There are severals guides available on how to set this up (Quick Guide to PowerShell v2 Remoting with PSSession) and after the initial Setup it would be as easy as creating a new Session (New-PSSession/Enter-PSSession) and using it (Enter-PSSession/Invoke-Command).
For PowerShell this would mean you need to enable PowerShell remoting on the remote machine and would establish a connection from your build server to directly execute commands on the remote host.
I have a build PC that is going to deploy executables to another PC on the network.
The Build PC needs to know when the remote PC has finished so that it can collect the logs from the network drive.
