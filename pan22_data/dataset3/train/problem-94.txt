This seems like a simple 'what tool to use for x' question, but it's more general.
Programs like Dropbox and Google Drive come to mind, but that's not possible for legal reasons; the data has to be stored on private hardware.
We have a customer that has employees with Windows laptops that never plug into the LAN.
I need a tool that can deal with connections that drop-out and ideally, that can sync back to a new laptop (when the laptop gets replaced).
One that comes recommended a lot is Owncloud, but by now, I reported dozens of bugs and we're still getting the most scary data corruption.
Traditionally, before the 'cloud', I simply setup a Samba server that used rdiff-backup to backup remotely.
How do people address the issue of backing up these kinds of laptops, preferably with tools that work over SSH and do some kind of checksumming to make sure the data is intact?
All they use is constantly changing and intermittent Wi-Fi.
But, when people never connect to the LAN, this becomes impossible.
I'm rapidly running out of ideas, so I hope to get some insight here.
A private cloud would work, but the options are limited.
