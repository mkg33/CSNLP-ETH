This should also work for any other program that does not implement its own custom size setting parameters (i.e.
This will save that window's size and position (be it maximized or any other position and size you have set) and use it as the default for that program.
The next time you open Word it should remember that and open maximized.
In Windows (I believe XP and above), you can set the default window size by holding the control key and exiting the program.
(so far, anyways)... Also worked for Outlook and opening email docs.
For example, to get MS Word to open your documents in full screen by default: open a document, maximize it, hold ctrl and click the "X" to close it.
Then close the window by clicking "x" button on the right top corner.This will not solve your problem %100 but, at least you will keep the size that your manual size for your next windows.
The 'Hold Control button' while closing out of maximized Word Doc worked for me!
Right click on the word icon, select properties and then Run "Maximised".
Open a word document, then maximize the window size "manually" ,
Word should remember the size, position and status of the last time you used the application.
If that doesn't work, try opening Word from the menu/desktop, maximize and then close.
So if, when you double click a document, Word opens a non-full screen window make it maximized and then close Word.
Otherwise, as I know you should play with the registry codes by using regeditor of Windows.
