My question is, which would be the best virtualization platform to allow me to include docker at a later point?
(For the single machine reason I would also like to avoid OpenStack, unless it would be the ideal match for docker + VMs).
I figured it might be a good idea to be prepared for Docker as it comes up quite often lately.
Also, if this is for strict dev purposes, I believe Digital Ocean offers a Docker image.
As far as choosing a hypervisor to work with, pick the one your most comfortable with, fits the budget, and offers the features you need.
Guest machines will most likely only be Linux with perhaps an occasional *BSD.
I also have an Ubuntu VM on my laptop running Docker within Virtualbox.
I have been running several different virtualisation servers, (ESXi, XenServer, Proxmox/KVM) in the past.
Any advice what virtualization infrastructure is going to play nice with docker?
If you're still looking into this, perhaps Xen Orchestra (running on XenServer) might be of interest:
I'm running Docker on an Ubuntu VM running on my XenServers at home.

I cannot set up two systems, so the docker containers will have to live on the same hardware as the virtual machines.
I have used vagrant in development environments very successfully, but not yet docker containers but will possibly start soon.
Also, if you're interested in Docker, I would look at CoreOS, which offers Docker features in a clustered form.
I am now in a position where I need to set up a new virtualisation environment that is supposed to be long running.
I would love to stay with something built around Xen (preferably not the Citrix flavor) but anything else would be ok as well.
