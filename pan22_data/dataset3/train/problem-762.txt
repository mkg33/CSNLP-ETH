I would look into a embedding a scripting language like lua or ruby and coding dialog interactions in that.
You can work with other game variables during creation of dialogs logic.
I think , that You use your own script language for directing these type of game(if not, You should).Then expand your script for dialogs handling too.
In the game You find id and try to match id and the condition.
If you use XML, make sure you build a small tool to edit the XML file.
It does not matter  if You make some script interpreter or compiler.
This also works well for coding AI and other simple things that are useful to tweak during run time.
You can even add an editor built into your application that can be invoked when running in debug (or as an Easter Egg).
Data drive your characters with LUA scripts or even XML files.
The biggest gain from doing it this way is you can easily go in and manipulate the dialog, add new characters, etc.
When you interact with an NPC, grab the file that is attached to it, read it in, adjust for any game variables that may have been triggered, and product the valid response.
You also avoid mucking up your code base with special logic in handling each and every case.
