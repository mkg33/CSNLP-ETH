For example, you can use the typical movement commands (h, j, k and l) to move the cursor to a window in that specific direction (left, down, up and right, resp.)
See https://linuxhint.com/how-to-use-vim-split-screen/ for further commands.
There are also many other window commands that use Ctrlw as a prefix.
The fact that you can access this command by pressing the same key twice (even while holding down the Ctrl key) makes it the most convenient way to navigate through windows in Vim.
This command will cycle through windows to the right, then towards the bottom (in the same order you'd read the letters on a line, then the lines on a page), finally going back to the top-left window when done traversing them.
Use the Ctrlw + w command to move the cursor to the next window.
If you only have two windows, it will simply switch between them.
Generally, Ctrl + 'w' + 'r' works to get to either side.
See :help windows for a full list of commands and options related to windows in Vim.
it opens the files horizontally aligned but I dont know how switch between them ?
(Also possible: Ctrlw + Ctrlw, pressing it twice.)
