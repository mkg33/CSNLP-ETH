For my 'natural born programmer' students, they like Python.
Rstudio/ the R community is very supportive, resourceful and smart.
I think R is more bang for the buck in terms of getting at data and meaning.
Eventually, if professional, one needs more than one language but you'll never get to be a professional if you don't get a start!
In my first Intro to DS class I had thought I would focus on Python but as I experimented I found that I did indeed need to spend much more time teaching syntax and that took away from the focus on the work.
There is no wrong decision- but I think in future I will stick to R for Intro.
In my experience, there is less 'overhead' with R, especially if you use incredible resources like Intro to Data Science<https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/> and R for Data Science<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/> You can more quickly focus on data wrangling, visualization and stats.
For my new students- coming in to work with data but not coming from a programming background- they really like R.  The tidyverse has been a godsend (ggplot, dplyr and other libraries) and  the libraries/resources for spatial data are awesome.
