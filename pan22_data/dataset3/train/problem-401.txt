1- Make sure you understand the licensing terms around the floating license.
The decision about whether to overbuy or underbuy from there depends on whether there is lockout when all the licenses are consumed and the mechanism for getting more licenses.
3- Make sure all know before the decision is made the cost and mechanisms for the addition of licenses.
2- Also make sure you know how the licenses are enforced .. license manager server, honor system, some kind of token/dongle, or something else.
I would negotiate with the company the right to purchase more licenses are the same price for some period of time.
If you can, survey the manager and developers about what fraction of their time will be spent using the tool.
If you decide to get three licenses, and two of them are being consumed by guys at lunch, two other folks may be out of luck.
It would depend on how that company does their licensing.
If you can't, then I would use 50% and make sure everyone knows that this is a WAG.
I assume a standard "concurrent user" licensing scheme and that all 15 guys work the same hours.
5- Plan for review of the situation 2 or 3 times a year plus during budget season.
Not every company supports "floating" licenses, even if you are planning on using them that way.
4- You may need to enforce discipline around folks leaving the tool running when they aren't using it.
Generally, I like to err on the side of getting an extra license or two.
I would get a sales guy on the phone and talk him into letting you expand when you need to and start out small, say, 5?
