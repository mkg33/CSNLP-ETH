Even something that looped through the dom0s and ran xm list would probably do for your simple purposes.
Unfortunatly when somebody else move the domU I don't have any clue where my domain is hosted.
I'm wondering where I can't find my dom0 name with inside domU.
I'm looking for something like the gzonename command on a solaris sparse zone.
I'm pretty sure there's no way to find the dom0 "name" (which is a nebulous concept at best) from within the domU.
If you're not running pygrub, you could add something to the kernel boot command line (in the domU config file stored on each dom0) that you could query from /proc/cmdline, but that's a bit of a hack.
I'm actually testing RHEL 5.3 with Xen between two servers in order to have a disaster recovery solution.
What you really should be doing is having a script that can query the dom0s to display which VMs are where.
I found a clever solution (which I can't take credit for): add a parameter to the Xen script to tell the domU which dom0 it's running on
I check inside /proc/xen but I don't see anything special except the dom0 kernel release.
So I'm playing with moving my domU from one dom0 server to the other server.
