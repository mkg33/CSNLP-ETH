You would have to create application logic in the back end to accomplish this (using C# or whatever .NET or other technology).
As an alternative, consider Forefront Identity Manager (FIM).
It was meant to allow HR to create new "employees" but you could easily adapt it to meet your needs.
I'm in the middle of updating our open-source tool (http://umanage.codeplex.com) which allows for letting non-privelaged users update and create user accounts in AD.
This is a product specifically designed for provisioning, but obviously there's a cost attached.
Disclaimer, I worked on the Workflow Power Pack so consider me biased :-)
If you have the proper licenses or are willing to try beta software, you could use Microsoft Opalis / Orchestrator beta to monitor a sharepoint list for changes, then perform those changes on AD.
System Center Orchestrator can capture the data input by the users into the portal and take custom actions, such as creating user accounts.
To answer your question, you can do this using a SharePoint Designer workflow and something like the Workflow Power Pack or a more complex Visual Studio Workflow.
You can do whatever you like with the data from the Infopath form.
All of this is capable of being integrated into SharePoint.
You may want to move this question to StackOverflow or SharePoint Overflow.
We're hoping to roll out the next version in mid September assuming nothing changes.
It also allows for users to edit their information if its not correct.
System Center Service Manager has a Self-Service Portal where IT staff can list services that they offer (create accounts, provision VMs, raise mail quotas, etc).
I know that this is very late, but I accomplish similar functionality for clients without Infopath, but with System Center instead.
But I don't think there's any native functionality to accomplish what you want.
