So if your cat walked on the keyboard and you closed the window, Apache may crash from the cat's scripting.
This will close out the window without saving any changes.
Users running a Server version of the OS will typically come up against this limitation but it can affect anyone with a desktop and a RAID card.
As of 10.8.4 "autosave" is applied to all applications including Xcode.
I am still working out whether creating a Time Machine backup on another drive will allow the behaviour we're seeking.
This is especially problematic for webapp scripters who may find their unexpectedly autosaved Python scripts crashing Apache without their permission.
If you want you can remove the option to reopen files in the System Preferences screen under general.

When you get out of that document a window appears that will ask you to revert changes.
You have to turn of versions (or whatever it's called) in Time Machine dialog (Lock documents X days after last use) - video here.
The problem is complicated if you use hardware or software RAID, since Mountain Lion cannot create a recovery partition on a RAID volume (where RAID volume = any physical drive with at least one RAID-enabled partition).
Without a recovery partition, Time Machine Control Panel in System Preferences is disabled (greyed out).
