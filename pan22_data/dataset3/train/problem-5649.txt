None of them seem to be related to phat-reaction.com.
This is a pretty standard WordPress installation running theme Belief.
I don't have much experience with WordPress and I don't know where to start.
It has some reasonable-looking plugins installed: Easy Columns, Formularze (https://ideasilo.wordpress.com/), Free Social Slider by ARScode, Google Analytics, Jetpack z WordPress.com, MailPoet Newsletters, PWA+PHP Picasa Web Albums for Wordpress, Simple Custom Post Order, Simple Lightbox, Stop Spammers Spam Control, Traffic Counter Widget, WordPress Hit Counter, WP-Optimize, Youtube Playlist Thumbs.
The hosting company helped me to detect that it's because some piece of code tries to connect to IP 85.214.232.25, which is phat-reaction.com, but it can't, and it does that when generating the page.
Is it possible to debug it somehow from the WordPress account?
I could potentially grep the code but firstly, I don't have access to SSH at this moment, and secondly, the bad fragment of code could be stored in the database.
It's also possible that the bad code is injected in some widget, or where else to look?
There is a website which is running very very slow.
