Rearrange the code to reduce the need for declarations
When a C++ program reaches the end of main the compiler will automatically generate code to return 0, so it is not necessary to put return 0; explicitly at the end of main.
While this code works, there is still some room for improvement.
I see a number of things that may help you improve your code.
There's more, but that's all I have time for at the moment.
This single change makes the code run about twice as fast on my machine.
A function declaration is only needed by the compiler if it hasn't already encountered the function itself.
Leave the printing to the calling function instead.
With that said, if the functions in the file are in the order check_sort, merge, merge_sort and then main, no separate function declarations would be needed.
The check_sort function does not alter the passed vector, so that should be passed as const &:
By having it &array instead of array you tell the compiler that it may use the passed object directly rather than making a copy.
That is, rename check_sort to is_sorted and have it return a bool value of true only if the vector is sorted.
The easy thing to do to speed up the code is to simply use references like this:
The check_sort routine is not bad as it is, but I'd advocate separating the I/O from the logic.
