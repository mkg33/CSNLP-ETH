IE is trying to be "helpful" and decides what it thinks would best server the client, in this case is display the png file in the browser.
Remove the .PNG Mime Type - Instructions here for IIS 7
Note: this is really handled better through an index.asp|aspx|jsp|php|whatever page that would serve the image and set the headers appropriately - but hey, you asked for an IIS solution.
In the end I individually zipped up the 67 PNG files and linked to those.
You can turn on directory browsing (Directory tab under properties) and add the following header on that directory (HTTP Headers tab)
All solutions I have tried make it so that it'll download in other browsers except IE.
There is always the programatic way of doing this as been pointed out.
I need to be able to have a subdirectory of images all PNG's to be downloaded instead of opened in the browser window.
You could do this using some server side programming to effectively obfuscate the content-type header of the png file sent to the browser, this should then do what you want.
The only way I know of doing this is to try and confuse the browser into thinking the return image file is not an image, and so forcing a download.
This will have the unfortunate effect of making the first hit on the folder that would normally display the list of images popup an Open/Save dialog (you can just hit open) and then each image will also receive that same treatment.
