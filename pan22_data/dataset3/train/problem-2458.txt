I had this working fine years ago before this Mac failed between it and an XP pc.

I've recently repaired my ancient G4 Mac Mini, I have reinstalled Tiger and applied all updates.
Synergy 1.4.8 is the latest version supporting 10.4 so that's what I've been trying.
I have tried various versions that support 10.4 and of course the matching version on the PC each time (even 32-bit), the configuration all shows that it's working fine but the Mac mouse does not move.
I have Synergy setup between the PC and the Mac, with the PC being the server and the Mac being the client.
Also Scroll Lock doesn't seem to be the issue because, if I lock it to one screen or the other after the log says it's crossed over, it locks like you'd expect - but the Mac's mouse does not move.
Thanks for any help, I don't have the desk space for 2 sets of mice and keyboards, especially not with my midi keyboard I wanted to use with GarageBand, and the Mac only has 2 USB ports, and I have no hub.
Thanks for any help, this is really baffling, it all says it's working but the mouse does not move.

They show in the log as being connected properly, and when I mouse to the Mac's screen the log shows that it switched screens, and the clipboard gets updated properly as well - but no matter what I try the Mac's mouse will not move.
I also tried enabling "access for assistive devices" in System Preferences, as I saw somewhere that that solved someones problem but it made no change for me.
