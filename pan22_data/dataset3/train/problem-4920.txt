You use it just like the snippet above, except that you have to put bash /path/to/script --option in the command box, where --option can be any of the things listed in the script.
The whole script, which gives some other nice features like going to the previous or next track and displaying the title of the song, is below.
(Put bash /path/to/script in the first box in the "Commands" tab, then add a key binding in the second tab.
Use xev (X event viewer) to determine what keycode is sent when you press that key.
Or jbonney found a pretty neat solution using dbus-send here on his gist
You're just asking for the "playpause" function, but I figured I might as well include the whole thing.
The way I do this is to use the following bash script, which I wrote using various commands borrowed from other sources.
To use it, save it in a file, mark the file executable (in the file permissions dialog), and then use CompizConfig Settings Manager to add it to commands.
In short, it uses wmctrl to move to the workspace Spotify is on, uses xvkbd to send a space keystroke to Spotify, then uses wmctrl to move back.
You will need wmctrl and xvkbd installed; search them in Ubuntu Software Center.
On my Debian system, xev is installed with the x11-utils package, so it's likely included in a typical Ubuntu desktop installation.
Then you can remap the key in the keymapping utility of whatever system you're using (Gnome, KDE, bare X, etc).
