This is important should you be trying to find older RPis wirelessly and wondering why you cannot see MACs beginning with that value...
Both the Ethernet and the Wifi on the RPi3 (Raspberry Pi 3) have are prefixed b8:27:eb.
The best resource to find the most current OUI assignments is from the MAC Address Block Large (MA-L) Public Listing at the IEEE -- http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/public.html.
According to this list there is a single OUI/MA-L assignment for the Raspberry Pi Foundation:
Doing a bit of random searching online ("raspberry pi MAC address") also turns up this OUI.
A complete list of OUI assignments is compiled daily and is available at http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui.txt.
A WiFi USB dongle added to give an RPi wireless-networking where it does not have it natively will have a OUI that is specific (one hopes) to the manufacturer - though there are now utilities to fake the whole MAC number for good (or evil) purposes.
So this is pretty straightforward; the first half of a MAC address is the OUI and the second half is arbitrary.
It is worth noting that the MAC-48 number applies to the Network Interface and not the Host device and thus the B8:27:EB applies only to the wired EtherNet interface on older Raspberry Pi devices that do not have a built-in Broadcomm device providing Wireless networking!
The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B already has the new OUI.
Low and behold, on the four pis I have here (two B's, one made in China, one B+, and one pi 2), the first three octets are:
according to http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui.txt.
To elaborate the answer from @cachius: the OUI has changed from
