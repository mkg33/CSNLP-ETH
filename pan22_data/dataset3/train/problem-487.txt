I would like to know how can I ping the machine from my local PC to other netwrok?
Is the network connection of your virtual machine set to bridged or nat?
I installed a "dummy" windows 7 and the space is only 8GB.
I got a VM with static IP preconfigured within the range of 192.168.1.0/24
After reviewing some comments: Here is the better answer:
As you are using vmware workstation, and android phone for hotspot (aka internet router), the only practical way is to create another vm
temporarily, you can change the subnet from /24 (aka 255.255.255.0) to 255.255.0.0... it should help with the ping issue.
This vm (i.e dummy vm) should have static ip address 192.168.1.1.
I started the VM but don't have access to the netwrok.
Use windows 7 or windows XP that has small disk print.
If you want the VM to be a full member of your private network you need to set it to bridged and change the IP to something starting with 192.168.0.
Also you should change the gateway to the same one your host OS uses, probably 192.168.0.1
