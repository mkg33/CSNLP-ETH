Always put a space before the opening brace, or never.
For example by displaying a more accurate error message to the user.
Similarly, another bug that has 'creeped' (crept?)
You have two-space indentation in one place, and eight-space in another.
I think this pattern of creating an instance, running it through the loop, and at the end of the loop re-initializing it, is a bad one.
But I want to post several times by using for loop.
but for the remaining loop iterations the method is simply:
If you don't have a logger system nearby that can handle exceptions completely, at least use e.printStackTrace();.
There is no reason, in this case, why you can't initialize the method inside the loop, it makes more sense, and you eliminate bugs....:
This case is a good example of what can go wrong... because you have introduced a bug as a result
And as stated in the comments to your question, System.err.println(e) does not give full information about the exception.
Also, I would say that your line if(br != null) try { br.close(); } catch (Exception fe) {} should be on multiple lines.
in is you change the 'p' parameter after the request is posted....
It is however recommended that you should handle and exception, and not only report it.
I don't think Java supports this kind of statement.
Even if it increases line count, it improves readability.
The first time through the loop your method is configured as:
It is said that one should be specific in throws clause, but that applies for catch as well.
Only catch the Exceptions you need to catch, such as IOException.
Do not use catch (Exception e) as this will also catch NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and a whole lot of other ones.
