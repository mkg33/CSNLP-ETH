another approach with parallel and expr (should be a bit faster on multiprocessor machines):
Put the jar file in the directory you want to get the page count of all the pdfs in.
I made an application just for this, Its written in Java so works on all os's.
Click combine, and see how many pages are in the final PDF.
Double click on the jar, it may take some time if there is alot of pdfs, it will eventually output a txt file in the same directory of the jar file, and it will have the page count within it.
I know its too late but I just found a way better and simpler solution for this.

Select that, copy, paste into excel or opencalc, you got it.
Its best to run the application from terminal (java -jar) to ensure it will work properly.
Hi dont know how you can do it on windows but on linux bash it should work with this
In Adobe Acrobat Pro, go to file > create PDF > merge files into a single PDF.
Drop all your files on it, and in the screen it generates a spreadsheet-like report on the number of pages and info of each.
Download and install from sourceforge "pdf split and merge"
It will cycle through subfolders aswell, no need to place all the pdfs where the jar file is as it will cycle through the subfolders where you place the jar file.
