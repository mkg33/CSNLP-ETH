You could: optimize the logic calculations, thread individual part of the logic (though I haven't actually used threads in a real application, so how to seperate but coordinate the logic, I don't know much on).
As per how to calculate it every 1/2 seconds, I am sure whatever libraries you are using contain the simple contraption of some sort of timing devices/timers, etc.
For example, if you had your logic and render in the main loop, if logic takes a long time, you don't get anything rendered till it is done.
The problem of ensuring the logic is completed by the time it must next be calculated might be tricky, depending on specifically what you are doing.
Alternatively, perhaps you can either set a minimum calculation time (say 0.5 seconds) and give it as much time as it needs, or somehow otherwise coordinate the application to the time it takes.
With multiple threads, the render can be independant of the logic, and so evedn if the logic is bogged down, stuff still gets rendered, etc.
Or, in the case the logic is threaded by itself, a sleep might also suffice.
