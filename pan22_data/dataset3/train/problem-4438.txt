(I also check group policy->Administrative Template->Network Connections-> Windows FW everything is not configured)
All the servers are running a site on the TCP Port 80 and I check with netstat that the web server is binding on every Ip of the servers.
The DNS works, the ping is successfull, the servers are on the same subnet, the firewall is turned off (even though windows advanced firewall says that some settings can be managed by the System Administrator, i guess group policy).
I'm setting up an infrastructure based on Windows Server 2012.
If i try to telnet  from the server itself on the port 80 it works (using DNS name) if I try same telnet from another machine I get connection failed.
Is that possible that the FW looks turned off but there are some group policy blocking the connections?
I'm experiencing some connection problem between servers.
The firewall is turned off and I can't access the Domain controller to check for the group policy.
I need some hint on how to keep troubleshooting such a problem.
