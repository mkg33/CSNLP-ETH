Look up your router’s CPU architecture¹ and speed, the amount of ram, and what kinds of permanent storage (internal flash memory, USB stick, USB HDD) it supports.
And the boot loaders of those routers usually aren’t configurable.
The only problem is, to get a command-line, so you can install something, you need to boot your own environment.
Just install whatever you like and the hardware can handle.
Basically, just treat it like any other headless PC.
As it, being a meta-distribution, is extremely adaptable.
Make sure you use the same kernel configuration, drivers, etc as that firmware image though.
But you can do about as much on them, as you could do with a computer having the same specs.

If you have a Linux kernel running, and a package management system available (every distribution does), all limitations are gone.
But usually, things lite Tomato⁴ (or its predecessor DD-WRT) save you from this step… provided you have a suitable router.
As soon as you have any sort of Linux command line, everything else goes as usual.
And in the process you learn how to actually use a computer.
So the trick is, to either find a pre-made (unofficial/custom) firmware that allows you to ssh³ in and re-flash in case you want to undo everything… or to make/modify your own firmware image*.
Because if you don’t (like with Windows/OSX/Ubuntu/KDE), and you get to even the tiniest problem that doesn’t have a colorful clickable, you’re stuck.
