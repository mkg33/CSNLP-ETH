My youngest child is 9 now, and quite the nerd as well - but for her that still means games, Minecraft etc.
they can play, that it's hard if they are not internally motivated.
I slurped up every bit of information I found in books or magazines.
can be fulfilling as well; and their language is far simpler than any PC language with its plethora of libraries and special stuff going on).
I fully expect us to upgrade to something like Lego Mindstorm or whatever gadgets there will be around when she's about 12-13.
That may or may not be a factor you can alleviate if you roll your own course, obviously.
I consider myself to have been the ultimate nerd back then.
There may, obviously be exceptions, and it's harder in our case because she is only starting to learn English, so all the really good resources are closed to her yet.
I daresay I have tried a little bit to encourage her exploring with Scratch etc., but hit little interest.
For these ages, I found the Nintendo Labo series excellent, or websites like Pixel Papercraft, where they can combine child-adequate real world skills (working with pen, paper, scissors etc.)
She would be motivated by results (like, and I kid you not, "Daddy, I would like to program... can you show me how I can program my own Minecraft, next weekend").
And I may introduce her to some programming using Javascript or something else which leads to immediate results (don't, also, dismiss the IOT angle, i.e., Arduinos and the like - having lights blinking etc.
Mainly because it is hard to motivate a 9yo finding a "domain" to program in - the joy in purely abstract stuff (like first data structures, control logic etc.)
But anything you can program today is by necessity so vastly inferiour to even the simplest web game etc.
I taught myself programming at the age of 13, on one of the first gen 8bit home computers.
