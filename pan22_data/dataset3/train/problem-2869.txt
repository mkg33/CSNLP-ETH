To keep the same partitioning setup across all your servers, your best bet would be to create Kickstart files and to install your servers with it.
devices are dynamically assigned at boot time by the device mapper, and should never be used as the source of mount points whether it's mounted manually or via /etc/fstab.
That implies you need to make the kickstart file available online through one of the supported network protocols (http, ftp, nfs, cifs, etc...)
Of course, you can always manually customize the disk partitions during the interactive install of the server and just do the same thing on all server (so document it somewhere).
Example: ks=http://myserver.example.com/kickstart/mykickstartfile.cfg
Here's a good reference for Kickstart from the official Red Hat docs site:
Here's an example of the LVM partitioning I've used on a small VM of mine:
You can man those commands for more details if you are not familiar with the options.
To install with a Kickstart file, you need to edit the kernel parameters at the grub menu and add ks=URL_TO_YOUR_KICKSTART_FILE.
Instead, use /dev/volume_group/logical_volume or /dev/mapper/volume_group-logical_volume, or the UUID obtained with the blkid command (or the lvdisplay command, which shows it too).
Unfortunately, the system-config-kickstart GUI application does not allow you to configure logical volume groups, so you'll have to first save it and then manually edit the .cfg file to setup your disks.
