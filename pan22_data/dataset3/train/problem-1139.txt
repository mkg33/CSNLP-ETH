They are still running and responding properly as well as reading/writing, etc.
This is not mission critical data so I'm glad to experiment here.
If you stop a guest, it will refuse to boot due to a missing image though.
So if you just want to recover data, you can still ssh, then rsync to some other server what is important for you.
Due to carelessness, the qcow2 images of the running hosts have been deleted.
If I remember correctly we used lsof to track down the open handle and pull it from disk into a rebuilt file.
On closing the file the open handle drops and attempting to use the table to look up the file fails.
So the first order should be data saving, and then if you have time left, you can attempt replicating an image.
It would mostly just be a time-saver if I didn't have to rescue the data and re-create each guest.
You try to dd if and pipe to ssh to dd of to another image.
I am curious to know where these files are written to and read from currently.
I am running several KVM guests on an Ubuntu 10.04 host.
Bonus question is, is it possible to recover the data back into a qcow2 image?
The answer from support was that the file still existed on disk and had been unlinked from the file system table.
When the backend is gone, things are all cached either in memory or swap.
