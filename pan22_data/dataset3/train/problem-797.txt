In the Log method, the order of the arguments should be level, message, args, since the message and the args belong together.
By the way, having void async methods totally makes sense here since logging doesn't produce results that could be inspected by the application.
Make sure that asynchronous log messages cannot be reordered on their way to the log destination, otherwise the log files will become an unreliable source of information.
Formatting the message must be done in the synchonous portion of the logging code, since the state of the args may change after the call, leading to wrong log messages.
There is no point in declaring var result when you don't actually use the result.
Once you (as the developer) have read and understood them, you should remove them, since they just waste screen space.
Make sure that when an asynchronous call to Log is executed, the logger is fully initialized.
Also, after terminating the logger, further calls to Log should be ignored.
There are a lot of boilerplate comments left in the code, such as the one about the Blank Template.
