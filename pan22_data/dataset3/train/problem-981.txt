To paste it at the end of another line, you can go to its end and just press p. In case, if you are not able to paste the line as you expected, you can go to the end of line where you wanted to paste.
To cut a line without new line, you can press d$ or D from cursor location.
Then, press i and then press <C-R> (Control-R) and " (double quotes).
Your example would be dd, move to target line, $gcp.
dd is simply operating on full lines (short for 1dd).
Indeed, often the use case is as follows: You want to delete a complete line (including the newline, so d$ / D don't work, as the leave behind an empty line), but paste this at the end or inside some existing line, without creating a new one.
It means: enable insert mode at the end of line and paste the content of the register +.
After you pasted your line after your current one via p just press another j in your previous line to join the two lines, thus eliminating your unwanted line feed...
My UnconditionalPaste plugin provides several mappings that automatically convert the register contents to the desired use case.
