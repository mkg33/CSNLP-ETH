If the webserver was rewritten to work on a GPU it would be substantially less efficient than one that runs on similar CPUs.
If Intel's 'Larrabee' had worked out then perhaps that would have helped but right now you're out of luck.
Not yet no, as even development versions don't support DirectCompute/OpenCL/CUDA.
They're basically horrible at logic, branching, and dependent operations (greatly simplified for the sake of argument).
Can IIS be set up to take advantage of new massively multi-core GPU's to provide additional thread for maximum concurrency?
A task like serving web pages involves almost no math at all; it's almost purely logic.
If anyone knows a way to take advantage of these cores I would appreciate it.
My thought is that with technology like the AMD Fusion would it be possible to execute threads off of these  400+ cores to have a huge level of concurrent connections to a server.
In fact given the types of computing workload IIS does I doubt that the types of 'core/processors' in current GPUs would be much use in accelerating that kind of load.
GPU cores are (comparatively) very simple devices.
They work great at massively parallel tasks, like rendering, encryption, and other math.
