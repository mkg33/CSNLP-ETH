Oddly, that's about the vertical size of the monitor on the left, but much much smaller than the size of the monitor on the right, which is where I'm trying to display the larger console.
In Console2 (if you dont want try ConEmu) you may try to Show console window and manually change size of its font (4x6 for example) and then resize GUI window.
I had similar problem with my own ConEmu (Console Emulator).
Somewhere in the menus of Console2, you'll find the "Hide console window" option - use it to reveal the hidden console, then drag it to the secondary monitor.
Doing the above will affect the size of Console2 window.
It was solved (programmatically) by decreasing font size in real console.
restart Console2, and you will find it now has a horizontal scroll bar.
The idea is that font in real console must be noticible smaller than in GUI window.
You can get Console2 to have a buffer width much wider than  screen width, but you can't set it from the console settings->console window, which limits width to 200 (at least on my PC).
set buffer_columns to whatever you want, I used 600,  and save the file.
Instead you manually edit the console.xml file, (will be found in same directory as the console2 executable I think)
Console2 won't go over 44 rows on this machine, for some reason.
Great for looking a long lines of debug as they no longer wrap.
see the line at the very top of the file containing   buffer_columns=
Console2 is only a wrapper around an invisible Windows Console window (due to the architecture of Windows console functions), so its size is the same as of that hidden window's - which is still on the primary display.
