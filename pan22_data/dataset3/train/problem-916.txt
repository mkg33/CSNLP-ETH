As far as I know there should be only 1 primary partition active at a time.
So I have to create the other primary partition for Kali Linux.
I would like to install 2 Operating Systems (one Windows and one Kali Linux) on 1 hard drive.
1) If windows is already installed shrink the partition with GParted and leave the rest of the hard drive empty.
2) Install linux and tell it to leave your existing partition alone.
It's easy to install both on a primary partition but I would like to put them into 2 different primary partition.
I hope it's just some kind of flag indicating that it's the partition from which the currently loaded OS was booted.
(If windows isn't already installed don't let it patition the whole drive to begin with.)
Currently my hard drive has only 1 primary partition (currently installed with Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit).
It will partition the rest of the drive and you won't have to worry about the details.
Does that mean once booted from this partition, I cannot access to the other partition (to read/open files, ...)?
