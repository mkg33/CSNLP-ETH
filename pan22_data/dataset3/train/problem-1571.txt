Assuming the context is that the clients that would normally use this RADIUS accounting server end up using their next (less preferable) choice, that's usually called "fallback".
It says that when there are many (more than 200) authenticated terminals, if a command is issued to forcibly clear the terminals, "sliding to the next RADIUS accounting server may occur" -- the original text literally says "RADIUS accounting server-slide".
"failover" also gets used, but more often in the context when all the clients would use the other server, not just some.
If I'm asking this in the wrong forum, please let me know.
I get the impression from my inability to find it simply by Googling that perhaps it's described differently in English.
The text is talking about RADIUS accounting functionality.
Normally Google can answer my questions, but in this case I'm coming up blank.
I think I can basically understand what they are getting at in terms of meaning, but I would like to know whether this is the correct expression to use.
"it may cause some clients to fallback to the next RADIUS accounting server."
I am not a network engineer, but rather a translator, so I apologize in advance if this is a rather obvious question to some of you.
