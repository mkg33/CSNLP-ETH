Remove the "-i" and it should give you correct numbers.
i summed all the size of the directories that it shows and it doesn't go up to 20GB
i resolved the issue by copying all the content of /home/ufk/* to a different partition,
i have a 260GB drive and it seems that 99% is taken.
the output shows alot of directories and their sizes and in the end:
i have gentoo linux x64 kernel 2.6.32-gentoo-r1 using ext4
now tmp should not contain anything (assuming sda5 is a clean partition, etc) but the directory before the mount contains a file of random data.
deleting and re-creating the /home/ufk directory and copying all the files back.
"-i" returns the inode numbers (the number of "entries" in the "catalog of files"), not the block size (the space used by the files).
Probably ufk is mounted over a directory that contains 250gb of data.
Use "-hk" for human-readable numbers and block-size expressed in kilobytes.
In fact, df shows the filesystem usage per mount point.
This is confirmed by the header of "df": Inodes   IUsed   IFree IUse%
