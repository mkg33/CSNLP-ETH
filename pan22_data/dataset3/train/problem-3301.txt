I haven't been able to find any help in the official documentation (neither from RedHat nor from Linux-HA).
but how can I add a second network in the "clientspec" parameter (for example: 192.168.100.0/24) so clients from both subnets can mount the shared directory?
For example, the following command obviously works fine (with only one network defined):
you simply add 2 seperate resources each with the subnet you need and same fsid then you will see that it exports it once with both subnets
I'm configuring a NFS export resource on a RHEL 7 cluster, and I need to let a shared directory be mountable from clients belonging to different subnetworks.
I had a similar issue where I have a lot of servers so I have them split up by subnets based on what they do and needed to export some dirs only to 1 subnet or the other and some to all the subnets and I discovered a neat little trick thats un documented.
I know its an older question but its in the top 10 on a google search so I thought I'd answer with what worked for me in case anyone else hits this looking for the same thing
