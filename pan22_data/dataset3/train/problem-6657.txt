At that point it will have forgotten it's clock and (in most cases) will have reset all Bios settings to factory default.
If the computer is running while it is removed nothing will happen, until you shutdown the computer and try to start it again.
(And if you remove the battery when the computer is OFF same thing happens when you try to start it up.)
In a desktop it is just easier to reach the battery.
Or cause arcing across the contacts which also may do damage.
Most computers will refuse to boot to the OS and you will have to enter Bios and correct/save the Bios settings first before you can start the computer normally again.
It is damn easy to have the battery (usually a CR2032) drop onto the motherboard and short-circuit something.
In some case (depending on motherboard design) the same will happen on a reboot (without doing a full shutdown), but most computers will get through a reboot fine without the battery as usually the Bios doesn't try to reload the CMOS settings on a reboot.
It doesn't make any difference if this is a laptop or desktop.
Most laptops require a fair bit of de-montage to get at that battery.
