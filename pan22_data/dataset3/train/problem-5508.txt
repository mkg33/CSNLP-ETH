I'm writing a script that gets a count of rows for a few tables, however for some tables I want to only get a count of rows where a flag is set (in this case active=1).
If the table has a column named active, the query is "translated" as if it had:
Table clients does not have a column called active
Before you say "just hard code it" this is a query that's going inside a python script that could be run on numerous different databases and I have no way of knowing what tables my script will be selecting and if they have a column called active, and I would prefer to have just one query to do it all instead of two separate ones and relying on mysql to throw an error so I know to use the other one.
My first thought would be to use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA first, so you get to know (in one query for all tables in the MySQL instance) which tables have an active column and then use that info to construct your queries.
I would like to supplement the answer of the @ypercubeᵀᴹ, but i can`t write comments because of the restrictions.

There is one other, tricky way though that works no matter if the table has or not such a column:
I want to get a count of users where active=1 and just get a count of clients.
If you do not know what column name is used, and you need to get its maximum value, you can do that:
