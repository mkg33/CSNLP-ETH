This makes it possible to discover that 66.6.44.4 is the address we want to go to.
I have built many web servers but I haven't built a DNS server, and not sure what that even means or what it entails.
What the A and CNAME records are allowed to be (if they can both be example.com for example).
Basically looking for a brief explanation of how a system such as Tumblr's Custom Domain feature is implemented.
If users want a custom domain, they simply enter example.com for the A-name record, and example.com for the CNAME record.
Question is, what happens at the server at that endpoint, what it does.
First question is, if that is possible to support somehow.
The A record was published into some domain registrar's system (maybe this is the DNS server, so like GoDaddy if the domain was registered there for a tumblr site), which connects somehow to the external registries of some sort.
If it is possible, wondering roughly what is required.
From what I can imagine, the request starts off in the browser as example.com.
It seems it would know the domain being requested, then it would look up your tumblr profile given that info.
And generally how the request to a Tumblr page would be directed by using the A and CNAME records.
Second question is what exactly happens when the user specifies 66.6.44.4 (or in my case, example.com) as the A record, and likewise for the CNAME record.
It shows 66.6.44.4 as the IP address for an A record, and domains.tumblr.com for a CNAME.
