Right-click the folder > Share > " share to yourself (means nothing) .
The other method would be to see if the Share is published into Active Directory.
or if you are looking at the file via UNCpath the UNCpath+filename
The easiest way for other users to find shares without knowing the UNC path or File Server name / path.
(Thanks Jimbo, your answer was good but not brief!)
Looking through the responses above I don't think I saw the simple solution above which I obtained from:
Going forward it will display the full path in the address bar.
If your sharing documents with large number of users, something like Microsoft SharePoint may be a better solution as offers a web interface (with WebDAV for UNC style access) and offers built in tools to alert other users to documents.
If you unmap the drive as a drive letter, then re-add it instead as a "network location" (i.e.
right click "Computer" on the Explorer Window and select "Add a network location") Type in the full path for the folder.
In corporate networks most IT Departments create shares using DFS Name Spaces, within DFS Shares you can right click on a folder and find its target.
This is 'standard' behaviour of Windows, and therefore my favorite, above all explorer plugins which slow down systems.... ;)
However, applications that depend upon the drive as a letter may fail.
