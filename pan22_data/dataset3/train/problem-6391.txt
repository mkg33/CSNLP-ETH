If I click to continue past the SSL error and view the certificate it seems to be for a completely different site "*.silverstripe.com.au".
Internet Explorer may have cached a bad redirect for this site.
It seems the issue ONLY occurs on IE, Chrome works fine.
If it does not work, try to create a new Windows account and connect to https://wllearning.com.au with IE on this new account.
If this works, it means that IE has cached something and this explains the problem you have encountered.
I'm getting an error on multiple servers (on the same network) when using IE11 and navigating to the following site: https://wllearning.com.au
It produces the following two errors on page load:
Note that there is no proxy service on the network having the issue and DNS does report the correct IP address.
Try https://www.wllearning.com.au instead of https://wllearning.com.au
The unique IP in the reverse DNS response does not prove there are not multiple web servers managed by SNI on this host (most people do not set multiple PTR records when multihosting with SNI).
Now for the strange part, it doesn't always return this, sometimes just refreshing the page will result in the correct cert.
I did consider that it might be similar to the SNI issue listed on other server fault questions but an SNI issue requires multiple sites using one IP I believe, and a reverse DNS lookup shows only one site associated with the IP address.
In fact, there are multiple servers managed by SNI: just try https://{ip address of wllearning.com.au} and you will get the certificate for *.silverstripe.com.au.
