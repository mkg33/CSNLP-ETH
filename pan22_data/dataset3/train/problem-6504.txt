You can install Windows via Boot Camp, preserving the Mac functionality, but it will not use any part of the SSD, only the HD.
Any attempt to alter any partitioning from within Windows will 'break' the drive, as Windows does not see exactly what Boot Camp does to the drive in order to install Windows.
In order to get Mac OS back onto the drive at any later stage you would need to start up from Internet Recovery [Cmd/R at the chimes] & rebuild from scratch, or boot to your existing USB key with Mac OS install on it.
You can manually break the Fusion Drive down into 2 separate drives, SSD & HD & install Windows on the SSD.
I have a Mac Mini with a fusion drive (128GB SSD + 1TB 5400RPM HDD).
Windows cannot use the 'Fusion' aspect of a Fusion Drive - it doesn't understand the technology.
Running Windows on a 5400RPM Hard Drive (with boot camp) is a bit annoying, so if I'm not intending on using OS X for a while can I install Windows onto the SSD instead, and then safely go back to OS X (with a fresh OS X install) in the future or will this break my Mac?
I would highly recommend being entirely sure this is what you want to do before starting out.
This will, of course, destroy any data already on the drive & possibly leave you struggling to boot the machine into anything at all, trying to get Windows onto it.
Make sure you have bootable Windows and Mac USB keys before attempting anything.
It looks easy enough in the Windows installer (it can see the SSD etc) but I'm apprehensive to go ahead so thought I would ask here first.
