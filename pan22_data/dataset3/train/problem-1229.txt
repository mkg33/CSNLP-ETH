But if I use rsync or scp to transfer a file up or down, then the open vpn connection gets dropped.
I can connect to Open VPN form the college network.
I  tried ping flood with this command sudo ping -i 0 -n -s 4088 somewanhost.com.
This made me to think if only tcp is not filtered.
The college does not do domain blocking or ip blocking.
Transmission works fine, if encryption is enabled ( but it takes a long time to detect peers).
So I used hping3 (a tcp ping tool): sudo hping3 somewanhost.com -S -A -F -V -p 80 -i u10000.
Even I can access webpages, also I can download large files via http or https.
When I tried downloading a Linux distro on Utorrent, after enabling encryption and using a higher port, then it gives connection error.
If Open Vpn works, then I can access the squid proxy installed on my webserver, and can browse without any issue.
The pinging starts, after some responses the pinging suddenly stops.
Then for about 15 minutes my client cannot establish a connection with the Open Vpn server.
More than that, I want to get Open Vpn working, so that I can run my small website hosted on a Webhosts server.
I am curious to know what kind of filtering system is used.
I study at a college where they use Cyberrom for Internet traffic filtering.
I use Open Vpn to connect to my server run by a Webhosting company.
If I run a shell command on the hosting server which continuously prints out output on to the shell, then too the VPN connection gets dropped.
So, in order to detect what type of filtering system is used in the college firewall, I made my Open VPN server run on port 443.
