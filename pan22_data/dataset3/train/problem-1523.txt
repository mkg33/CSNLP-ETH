For simple automated responses, Dennis' suggestion is sound.
The vacation program is also an ancient, honourable and extensively-tested piece of software to build simple autoresponses around, and it has all the necessary tests to avoid autoresponder storms (where two autoresponders start talking to each other, very very fast, and fill up your email spool).
Make this email address an alias to an address on a nonexistent domain, and define your script as transport for this domain.
In Github, you can reply directly to the mails that they send you.
I used this trick to send mails to an autoreply script when employees are on holiday.
Postfix can do what you want, by creating custom transports.
Their mail servers will "detect" that you sent it, and then my python script will act accordingly.
If you also want to receive the mail yourself, make it an alias to yourself and that nonexistent domain.
I'm looking for a good overview answer or a link to a tutorial that goes through this.
For something more sophisticated, which you seem to be alluding to, where multiple emails are related to each other, something like RT might be a good place to start: emails to particular recipients are ducted into RT, and the first in the chain creates an autoresponse with a custom Subject: line, and as long as anyone who replies to that email preserves the RT token in the subject line, future replies will end up in the right thread inside the RT database.
