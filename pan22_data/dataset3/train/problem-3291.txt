Printer 123 was sent to branch B with a different network 172.16.4.0/24, BUT the static IP from branch A was never removed from Printer 123.
There is already a route that points traffic to 192.168.5.0/24 out a particular interface.
A printer was sent out to a location with a static IP from its previous location.
The majority of the traffic (95%) from this branch forwards to branch A.
Apparently restoring to default does not work, then again I do not have an IT guy out there to ensure it actually is being restored to default settings.
Printer 123 was on subnet 192.168.5.0/24 in Branch A with a static IP of 192.168.5.5.
How can I access the web interface to change it to DHCP?
Now it is sitting in Branch B with a static IP from its old network.
If I place the switch port that the printer is connected to on its own vlan and place the vlan IP on its same network but a 192.168.5.0/30 (4 IP's 2 usable)just enough to cover the printer's static IP so it can be accessed, would that cause any issues with the routing tables?
