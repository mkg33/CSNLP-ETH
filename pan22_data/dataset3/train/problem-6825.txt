However, two web servers would add a level of fault tolerance.
Change it in php.ini and share the fs for sessions and uploaded files between servers via samba, nfs or what you prefer.
We ran into the same situation, ended up installing an s3 plugin that hosts your wp uploads directory so you don't have to deal with the syncing.
There are so so so many ways to improve wordpress performance that don't require a second server and load balancing.
Wordpress is a heavy "read" site (vs. write) with most requests limited to a few hundred pages (blog posts).
This would be simpler and require no sharing of session information.
I truly doubt you're site will be doing enough traffic to require two web/app servers if the above common enhancements are implemented(the above can easily handle the slashdot effect).

You can increase the requests per second 10 fold by serving static versions of your most popular posts.
This is the one we used: http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/wordpress-s3/
The Windows equivalent is the Distributed File Service.
Since performance can be achieved with one web server, then fault tolerance can be achieved using an active/passive setup.
I am not positive if that particular plug-in is compatible with 2k3, but the general idea of automatically creating static versions of your pages and periodically updating them to include new comments, edits, etc is going to be your best bet.
You must share between servers the uploads/dir, and the sessions dir , usually in /tmp
