If you prefer an event based solution you can wrap all input polling inside a component and expose the relative and subscribe for them.
I'd prefer to subscribe directly to Unities input events, but have yet to figure out how.
Edit: If you need to describe you could go with the dreaded singleton and process subscription requests to provide KeyCodes and press types.
I have a Unity Answers post that may have some relevant info to my question as well: http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/878485/is-there-a-more-efficient-way-to-make-events-for-k.html
Right now I poll through the inputs and fire off my own events if a button is pressed.
My recommendation is to explore the UnityEvent namespace new to Unity 4.6 and above.
You can go the extra mile and implement a custom editor with a serialized dictionary and button to add new listeners.
As said by Heisenbug is no built-in way to do this.
This will allow you to expose functionality to designers that will allow them to rig up interesting inputs and receivers.
Been trying for days to figure out if there is a way to subscribe to keyboard/mouse events in unity.
Instead of having to poll for them every frame and make my own events.
