This vista forum has two suggestions, one is to try and setup the printer port as 'persistent' using the dos command
Since last friday (5/24) all network printers stopped printing from the printer queue in the server.
I've got a few ideas for you, in the hopes that they'll help but nothing really conclusive :)
Another site suggests restarting the Print Spooler service, which should reset the offline status.
The other is to apply the hotfix #934455 available from microsoft.
Local network, no routers, no filters, no firewalls, no natting.
The default is it stops restarting after 2 failed attempts.
If all else fails, you can disable SNMP monitoring in the printer's TCP port properties.
I found i had disabled SNMP in the web interface and had changed the SNMP community name on the printer when i reenabled, as soon as i changed it back to public to match the communication port settings on the printer driver.
Also in the properties of Print Spooler / Recovery try setting the 'Recovery on Subsequent failures' to Restart.
Unchecking the snmp option in the server's port settings did the job.
We've seen somewhat similar issues here, but outside of a few high-end plotters that we print directly to IP for, we're hosting the rest of them off of a printserver, and your symptoms are not exactly the same as what we've seen, but close enough.
You won't be notified when the printer becomes ACTUALLY offline, but you won't get false positives anymore.
