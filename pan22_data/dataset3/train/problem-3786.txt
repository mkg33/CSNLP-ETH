Fedora is an Ok distro for me.I don't think Fedora is as bleeding agae as Gentoo and Arch is.
You can even use Slackware too for that purpose.Personally I believe that an source based distro give much more insight into the OS.
I would recommend Gentoo for the absolute bleeding edge thing.
Thomas an unix like system is made by the developer for the developers.. right?
I'm looking for a Linux distribution that will allow me to obtain bleeding-edge software through the package manager.
I don't think it matters, but beyond having bleeding-edge software in the package managers, I'm going to be using the distro for software development (C, C++, Java, Scala, Clojure, Haskell, Erlang, .NET using Mono) and file storage.
So whatever the open system distro you use doesn't really makes a big deal to hinder any development.
Arch and Gentoo are probably the most bleeding edge of the distros.
For a comparison between different distributions you can look here although it is dated (Fedora equals Fedora Core 5).
You can also see how Arch compares itself to others.
The development track of Fedora called Rawhide is probably quite up to date with most stuff.
(for instance Redhat was one of the first distributions to start using libc version 5 in the a.out to ELF transition back in the days for instance).
Fedora (and previously Redhat Linux) has a long tradition of being bleeding edge
I've looked at OpenSUSE, Fedora, and Ubuntu so far, and it looks like OpenSUSE and Fedora are the best options, but I'm wondering if I'm overlooking something.
Arch is wonderful...is an Gentoo without the compilation time.
I do not know too much about other distributions to say if there are any even more bleeding edge, but Rawhide will not be a bad choice.
