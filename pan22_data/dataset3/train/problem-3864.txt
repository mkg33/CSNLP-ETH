I am trying to create hidden "mini-LANs" for use in testing application deployment and using VMware workstation on Vista x64 to create the machines.
All my network duplication problems went away and I could perform the NET VIEW command described above.
I have tried changing the name as it suggests, but this does not help.
I was configuring SQL Server on one of the VMs and having problems connecting from any machine other than the one hosting SQL Server.
A web server running on one can be accessed by the other.
They both have single NICs on the NAT'ed virtual adapter VMnet8 and generally work fine with regard to the network.
By accident, I noticed when pinging that the machine's name was resolving to 192.168.17.1 rather than the VMs real address 192.168.17.128.
If so, you may need to verify that VMWare is creating a new unique MAC address for each of the virtual machines as it comes online.
This prevents the other virtual machine from accessing its CIFS shares, for example:
Have you definitely changed the computer name and not just the computer description?
However, one of the machines is continually complaining about another machine on the network with a similar name.
If you right-click My Computer and select properties, in the "computer name" tab you'll see a box labelled "computer description".
What you need to do is click the "change" button and edit the computer name in the dialogue box that comes up after that.
This does not set the network name of the machine.
I would prefer a cleaner solution, but for now everything is working as I wanted.
With that info, I added another VM to host DNS and configured all the VMs to point at it for DNS rather than VMware Workstation's DNS proxy.
Are you using multiple copies of the same virtual machine file to bring up all of your test machines?
The problem may be related to using the name resolution mechanism provided by VMware Workstation.
