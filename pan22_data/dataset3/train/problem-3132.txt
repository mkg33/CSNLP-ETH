I would recommend that it is also worth looking at SmoothWall's UTM and commercial firewall offerings.
Gartner has a June 2009 report out for Small/Midsize business devices, top contenders were from:
If you're looking for something cheaper there is a good list at the wikipedia
Try out this.http://www.fortinet.com/ One of our client is already using and its doing wonderful job.
I won't comment on the quality of the kit - as I am irretrievably biased (I work @ SmoothWall).
We recently switched from an aging Watchguard to a Juniper SSG and have been really impressed.
They also do some agressive trade-in pricing if swapping over from other manufacturers.
Watchguard have recently released their XTM (version 11) software which gives all their products a good overhaul.

The SSGs come in a number of models depending on performance and feature requirements.
SonicWall has a great line of appliance hardware and subscription based services.
We don't use many of the UTM features so I can't speak specifically to those, but you should definitely put Juniper on your list.
All do weeny little appliances for your remote offices right up to mega sized highly-redundant multi-WAN boxes for your Headquarters.
If you need more 'Enterprise' sized boxes then you'd be looking at something from Cisco or Juniper Networks probably.
