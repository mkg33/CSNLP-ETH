when you look at the properties, there is a setting called "close window on exit"... if you remove the check on this, then the ipconfig (or any other command you run) window will remain open.
there is another possibility, and i am writing this from memory so it may not be exact.
You can also use ipconfig /all to get even more detailed output if you need it (such as DNS servers and such).
This way you won't get a chance to read the messages it returns.
To be able to read the ipconfig messages run ipconfig from the command line.
What's happening is the ipconfig command is running and completeing and windows closes out the command prompt window as soon as the command it's running completes.
This works for all other similar commands/programs in the command line.
Type >> IPCONFIG >> Press [Enter]  (That should give you the configuration info that you need)
The reason of why closes so fast it's because it's a command line tool and not a Windows app., that's why just appears for a few seconds.
Open a command prompt first before typing ipconfig.
Click OK                           (That should open the command prompt window)
Instead of ipconfig, type cmd and then in the new command prompt window type ipconfig (followed by enter) and then you can read the output.
It's because the ipconfig has finished, and automatically closes itself.
