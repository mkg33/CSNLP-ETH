Now I understand the 'timed out' error, but this is between two hosts that have a 1Gbps internet connection so I cannot see how that can be possible, certainly not if it is trying to say that the source/destination servers do not have enough bandwidth.
I have now resolved the space issue on the destination server and Hyper-V is requiring me to 'resynchronize' a few VM's.
I have tried this, but on two of the VM's it is giving me a Hyper-V failed to resynchronize changes for virtual machine '<VM NAME>': The operation timed out (0x00002EE2) error in Event Viewer.
It seems to get to 45% then throws that error, stops and tries again from 0%.
Due to a HDD space issue, I paused replication from our main server to replication/backup server.
I would accept that it times out for a different reason, but what could that be?
I assume that it is trying to resync the whole thing as it was disabled for around 2 weeks and cannot perform a simply 'replicate changes' and needs to do the whole thing.
To do so I simply removed replication on both sides, deleted all replicas on replica server and then initiated the replication on the main server again.
This was definitely not a connectivity issue, so I really do not know why I was getting the 'timeout' error.
My solution for this was to completely remove all replication and start again from scratch.
Is it possible to give the operation more time to try and complete?
It then stops and starts from the beginning again and throws up this error again, and it just does this over and over...
