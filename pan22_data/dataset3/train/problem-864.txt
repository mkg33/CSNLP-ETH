You need a person that knows what they are doing not a new server.
The main problem is that you need a complete infrastructure that allows handling many thousand doswload requests per second (or need someone clarifying your post), which means a lot of network bandwith, a lot of IO bandwidth, and a server with a lot more ram than - sorry - a cheap outdated low end workstation (quite like that - my developer workstation had 4gb about 3 years ago, recently moving to 8gb).
You also will need an IO subsystem to handle the load, which possibly means many many many discs in a nice hardware RAID controller (forget software here - you want something with more features than your software raid).
I can serve 10,000 requests per second with web server running hello world and 0.0001 requests per second with some bloatware behind the same web server.
4gb of RAM is a joke for a quad core, especially if handling thousands of parallel requests.
4096mb RAM by 2000 requests (lower definition of thousands) leaves 2mb RAM per request (ingnoring all else).
You will not ind a decent answer hwere - this requires a lot of planning, looking at your code.
The requests per second is magical number and makes no sense.
