This isn't just the case for drivers - right-click any exe and look at the "Details" tab (if it's there) - you'll see that there is file version info there that does not necessarily (and in fact almost never does) match up with the published release version on the website.
Unfortunately one is the internal version of the signed driver files and the other is the external version published and publicized by the company - and there is no onus placed on the developer or publisher for them to match.
The best you can do is approximately match the dates.
However, if you refer to the driver release notes and change history included with the download, it will often (though obviously not necessarily) contain a blurb/statement saying "driver updated to version xxxx" or similar, where that is the version number you are looking for.
So your best bet is to check for and reference the release notes.
Since the internal driver date will be timestamped by a CA server, it must be before the official release date on the site.
Unfortunately, that can be anywhere from 3 months to 24 hours before the release date on the site, so it's not perfectly reliable.
