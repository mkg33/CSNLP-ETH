SOHO cant do that, you need an business entry router, and that mean static IP for them.
Creative solution time: have users log in to a webpage that adds the ip of their device to the list of firewall exceptions temporarily before using RDP.
Currently we have a SBS Server, and a Terminal Server (both 2008R2) where users locally and remotely login to the Terminal Server, and work.
You can include logging to be able to include a method for removing all the exceptions created by X, in case that's ever needed.
A TS Gateway and changing the RDP ports unfortunately aren't an option in this instance.
Due to your budget, make a firewall rule on your router to allow only the 3389 traffic coming from the WAN IP of those worker.
We need to restrict the ability to login remotely to only a few users.
Maybe even include a pick your own TTL option for users that know how long they'll need the connection.
You can even require client certificates for authentication to the server, and distribute keys to each user to add to their devices, for added security.
Any users that don't first log in to this won't be able to access RDP from the outside.
we have previously seen (in another organization) "the requested session access is denied" when a user tries to log on remotely when they do now have the access.
