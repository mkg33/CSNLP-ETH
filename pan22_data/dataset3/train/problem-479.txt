You will need to try to assess what the precision you acheive.
Using Wireshark you just match packets across the two captures, and take the time difference.
You will need a device that can take your payload and generate TCP sessions.
An alternative would be to use a couple of network taps and a packet broker that can apply hardware time-stamps before handing to a simple Wireshark PC.
I also never needed to use real payload myself, but you obviously do.
I'm in the UK and there are specialist suppliers who hire out network analysis equipment like this.
I haven't done this for a while so I don't know who sells what any more.
If the required accuracy is no better than about 100 microseconds, you could even just use two taps and a properly-configured PC with Wireshark.
I used to use Wandel and Goltermann and Smartbits but it was a long time ago.
You can export the capture files to a spreadsheet to match them.
You will have to ensure that NIC interrupts are not coalesced and there may be other settings to optimise.
I don't know your full circumstances, but if an accurate figure for device latency really mattered to me then I would hire specialised equipment for this task.
