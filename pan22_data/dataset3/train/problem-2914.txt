-Get onto some IRC channels for Linux and UNIX security and system administration.
I learned there some basic stuff about how security works and which common methods hackers are using the break into your systems.
Got a good though not particulary indepth overview by doing the security+ certification.
Get a book like the Fedora Bible, Official Ubuntu Server Book (HIGHLY recommended), and/or "Ubuntu Linux Toolbox" manual.
For the tools you might be interested among others in the ones linked in the Penetration Testing Framework
There is a big community which is only about security and hacking technics.
Have been chuntering through a book on pentration testing from Syngress that seems extremely interesting.
I will post the link to the book and another book I have found interesting on TCP/IP when I have them.
I also am interested in the security field though mainly as an interesting aside at present.
I hope that I could help you with this information ;)
-Get the RSS feed for LWN.net, which has a lot of good articles and listings for security updates in a lot of distros.
Then, there are book on maintaining secure systems, configuring firewalls, network scanning, etc.
-Read the security and firewall related questions here.
Learn TCP/IP, Operating systems architecture,learn at least one scripting language to write automations and exploits, you can read the CISSP related litterature.
This is because mostly hacking is not like crack opening a door it's more that you are using an "error" in the system or weak configurations which the systemadministrators have made to bypass the security controls.
More: anything involving Wireshark, Backtrack Linux, etc.
NOTE: You have mentioned it, security/hacking requires that you have a decent knowledge about unix/DOS systems.
-Sign up for some Linux magazines, such as Linux Journal (great) and Linux Pro Magazine (good).
