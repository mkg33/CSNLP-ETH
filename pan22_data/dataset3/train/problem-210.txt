The patch kb2823324 released Tuesday is causing problems.
I have no CD/DVD for Vista to try, and it also won't let me boot into safe mode.
I turned it back on and now it has no blue screen but will go to a black screen before the login with just the cursor.
See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2823324, second section "Known issues with this security update"
When I first turned on my computer today I would get a very brief and sudden blue screen which would then go away.
Looks like there is an option to uninstall the patch from the command line in system recovery.
It also won't let me do Startup repair saying there are no problems.
See this article http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2839011 (last option, Option 3: Uninstall security update 2823324 at the command prompt).
I have no restore points so I can't do system restore.
Microsoft recommends uninstalling it, and removed download links for it.
It's a 7 article but you should have the same options for Vista.
I was prompted to run Startup Repair...I was doing the startup repair when my computer suddenly turned off.
