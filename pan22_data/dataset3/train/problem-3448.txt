For the vectorized application of backpropagation algorithm, have a look at (5:09), the algorithm at the right-hand side; you can apply this inside an (inevitable) for loop for each layer l:
You should avoid explicit for loops in Python, whenever possible.
For that, you should use the power of broadcasting and vectorization of Python NumPy.
In the lab assigments, I became able to write forward and backpropagation algorithms by only 6 lines each by vectorizing the flows through the layers.
The course instructor, Andrew Ng really forces the importance of this; Python NumPy can use parallellization structures of the CPUs and GPUs, you get both compitationally efficient (nearly about 300x faster in the course experiment) and you can write those in with few lines of codes, getting rid of the scary explicit for loops.
Those videos are from Coursera course "Deep Learning".
I wish I could share my own code here, yet  it is prohibited by the Honor Code of Coursera, and Andrew Ng describes those basic concepts better than any way I can.
