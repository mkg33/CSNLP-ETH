This problem can seem really bad if using prefork MPM in Apache because more processes into which that loading of the application has to be done and so more initial requests affected.
Maybe you give this Apache module a try and see if the issue remains.

Apache is good at serving static files but your parser will do an awful job.
See http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/#install-apache-and-mod-wsgi for more informations.
Django recommends mod_wsgi for productive installations.
Apache/mod_python lazily loads Django application on first request for it so your first request will see that delay in loading all the code and initialising your application data.
For other problems with using Apache/mod_python see:
There is some information in the Django docs here.
If this is a problem you need to configure preloading of your application.
You should also ensure that you aren't serving media through mod_python.
You may get more detailed help by including sanitised copies of your configs.
