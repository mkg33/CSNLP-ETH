Here's a good thread on using powershell to set the DPI registry key and toggle back and forth between two DPIs a little quicker.
I have a 14" 1920×1080 laptop and a 24" 1920×1200 screen.
Now you can see if you can get anybody over at http://stackoverflow.com to help you with it.
This will be needed because if you run your script while you are not logged on, or during startup your registry hive will not be loaded.
The tricky part is that you will always have to be doing a new logon to get the new settings to take effect and to me, that is the biggest drawback about this.
Now, a better solution might be to change the actual display resolution which can be done without logging off: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2010/07/07/hey-scripting-guy-how-can-i-change-my-desktop-monitor-resolution-via-windows-powershell/
Combine it all together with some ingenuity and you could schedule this script to run on logoff and on computer startup.
How can I make Windows switch DPI scaling automatically when external screens are connected or disconnected?
A lot of programs do not function properly with a non-standard DPI, and so if you ask me, changing the display resolution is a better solution.
And, here is information about changing the registry key of a specific user.
You can't change DPI scaling automatically because it requires you to logoff and logon.
But when I'm away from my desk and the external screen is disconnected, I'd like the laptop to automatically switch to 100% scaling to maximize desktop area.
If you want to expand on this, here is information about reading monitor information with Powershell: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2013/10/03/use-powershell-to-discover-multi-monitor-information/

When I'm using the large screen as a main one and laptop as an additional screen, I'd like to have the smaller one set to 150% scaling so that I can use it comfortably.
You still have to logoff, and the script automates that.

I'm okay with using 3rd party software if it's necessary, but I'd rather stick to built-in features of Windows.
All the resources to create your new script to automate this.
