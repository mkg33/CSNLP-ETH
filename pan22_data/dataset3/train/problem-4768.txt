You can see this in the TCP/IP settings on your adapter.
"NetBIOS" the protocol (NBF) is gone, long replaced by NBT, CIFS, etc.
That said, DNS is the modern/preferred named resolution method, however NETBIOS is still around for compatibility with legacy applications and/or networks.
Windows still has an embedded WINS server, even if there's no dedicated WINS server on the network.
I did a trace once on a machine that had WINS disabled, DNS disabled and NetBios over TCP/IP enabled.
NetBios is very resilient and might be picking up the slack more often than people know (like on networks with WINS disabled or DNS is misconfigured).
Rather than try to rehash what's well documented elsewhere....read http://www.jacco2.dds.nl/samba/smb.html
And when a query was made for a machine on another network, the client broadcast 100 queries and then received a response from a machine in that second network.
With that Browse Master turned off, the client sent X (can't remember but it was >=10) broadcasts before another client responded.
NETBIOS over TCP/IP is most certainly still supported in Windows Vista and above.
A query for a name in the same network, generated a single broadcast, answered by the local Browse Master.
"NetBIOS" as part of the name of other things still exists.
We're running multiple WINS servers here on campus and all of our clients still use them.
There is still a spot to add WINS server addresses.
Netbios must have a mechanism for forwarding requests between networks.
