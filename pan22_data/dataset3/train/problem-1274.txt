I have a Digital Ocean droplet (similar to an Amazon EC2 instance) running Ubuntu Server 12.04.3 x64 with both strongswan 5.1.1 (built from source) and squid 3.4.2 (also built from source) installed.
That is, the flow of traffic should look something like this:
I don't see any packets following the rule (periodically checking the incoming/outgoing packet counts with a iptables-save command) as I attempt to load content while connected to the VPN.
A friend pointed out that the Output chain of the NAT table in iptables may be my solution, suggesting a rule like this:
Unfortunately, I can't seem to figure out a good way to get this sort of connection to work.
Both the strongswan VPN and squid proxy function just fine individually, with some minor iptables rule changes between testing, of course.
Mind you, I'm no expert with iptables or linux, so please bear with me here if something I said (or something I say) is silly/dumb/obviously-the-damn-problem.
I've provided both ipsec.conf and squid.conf, as well as my current iptables rule script.
I'm open to any suggestions about how to solve this, but removing a component isn't a solution.
Changing versions of either component is also not ideal, although much more feasible.
What I would like to do is be able to initiate the VPN connection from my computer/device and have the outgoing VPN traffic automatically route through the local squid proxy.
While it makes sense to me logically how this might work, it doesn't appear to be doing so.
If you notice, there's some stuff related to using RADIUS for authentication.
It's not currently being used and shouldn't have any effect on this question.
