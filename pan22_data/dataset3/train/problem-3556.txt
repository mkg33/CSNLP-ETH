As expected (since host acts like a classic router), VM's are able to talk to the v4 internet without a hitch.
There are still plenty of people running IPv6 networks with an IPv4 mentality though, and they try to give as little as possible to their customers, thinking "A /64 contains so many addresses, it will be more than enough for then".
I tried to "split" this /64 network in two /65 networks, then reconfigure xenbr0 like this:
From my understanding v6 addresses are routed pretty much the same like their v4 counterparts, which means that what I want to accomplish is impossible with only one /64 range (at least while eth0 & v6 gw are configured the way they are).
My ISP has assigned me a 10.100.0.0/28 IPv4 range, statically routed via 10.0.0.2.
That is the great thing about IPv6: always plenty of addresses!
All of this makes your planning and operations much simpler, once you get used to the big numbers that are suddenly available :)
On the host, I have built xenbr0 virtual bridge interface:
I am building a virtualisation host, and I want my virtual machines to be available via both v4 and v6 IP address.
Is it possible to make use of a single IPv6 /64 range, so that VMs can have static IPv6 addresses, without having to go and ask my ISP for another /64 range that (I guess) would have to be statically routed via 2000:1111:1111:11111::2?
And then you run into problems when you want multiple subnets... Network operators and service providers will have to change their mindset and always give bigger blocks (big ones like /56 or /48, you don't want to ask them for each and every extra subnet) to customers that want to use them.
The host I have (Xen 4.1.3 with Debian Wheezy in dom0) has one physical eth0 interface:
On each guest VM, I set any of unused addresses from 10.100.0.0/28, i.e:
Also, eth0 was reconfigured (only network size has changed from 64 to 65):
Getting a bigger block of addresses from your provider is the correct solution.
Running IPv6 networks can be so easy once people start to use the enormous amount of address space that it provides.
However, guest VMs were unable to contact anything outside of host when configured like this:
It is very normal with IPv6 to give a customer a /56 or a /48, which corresponds to 256 or 65536 subnets.
That's where my lack of experience with IPv6 kick in.
