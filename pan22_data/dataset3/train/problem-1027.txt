You should look in your system BIOS for a floppy controller option - that's one clue if your system supports it.
If your motherboard does not have this connector then you'll need to get a USB floppy drive instead.
I have just received this 34pin floppy connector to USB adapter cable from :
My SAMSUNG 1.44 floppy with four port SD card combo now works perferctly again with the floppy as disk A as in the past.
Although the post took two weeks the supplier posted immediately the PayPal payment went thru.
Floppy drives don't use a normal IDE (PATA) connection; they use a special 34-pin connector.
that would provide the 34-pin connector you need to attach the drive
Floppy drives are not IDE - IDE is a 40 pin connector - Floppy drives use a 34 pin connector.
Another one is to look in Device Manager in Windows, or the kernel messages Linux.

If you get the correct floppy cable it should clearly and easily match up with the connector on the motherboard, assuming the motherboard has one.
I found I can either power the floppy via a molex floppy power connector or use the USB power via the extra floppy power cable supplied.
It's possibly your motherboard doesn't have the 34 pin connector since most people no longer use floppy drives.
Unless you're looking for the aesthetic value, and then you need to look for the floppy drive connector on your motherboard.
you could also install a floppy controller card if you have the available space in your desktop.
Even though my country was not on the list they posted to a polite query via Ebay solved that problem.
