I understand this will likely involve 3rd-party software and/or hardware; my issue is I don't even know where to begin.
For day-to-day tasks, this connection is fully sufficient for all my needs.
The only reason I care is that on a regular basis, one of the machines will flatline my internet bandwith, and consume it all in order to upload/download/spam people/whatever.
I have in my home a standard Comcast cable internet connection.
When this happens, the latency of the connections for gaming and the like becomes unacceptable, and everyone suffers.
However, on regular occassions, we have social gatherings that involve many people bringing laptops and other PCs and using the network and internet simultaneously, frequently for gaming.
You could add another "link in the chain" as it were.. put an ntop box between the wifi and the internet, it will show you graphically, everything.. fantastic software!
My question is: Is there a system I can set up whereby I can easily monitor the various systems connected to my wireless connection, see how much bandwith each one is using, and for what ends?
That way, at a glance, I can spot the offending machine and kick it from the connection, without having to go from machine to machine, checking each one's "bandwith used" properties manually, and dealing with the owner's indignant protests all the while.
I have it going from the wall to a cable modem, and from the modem to a late-series Linksys router, which provides wired and wireless networking.
The vast majority of the users are wireless connections.

I have no administrative oversight over these machines; they have been known to be riddled with spyware and/or bloatware or be running torrents, legal or otherwise.
