He went to make a drink, I plugged a LAN cable into the router and logged in to the web interface with a guess at what the default username/password might be (tut tut Netgear!).
Since the effort is minimal, and the possible (if unlikely) alternative is the loss of all data on your computers, I think it's worth doing.
If they have physical access, then yes they can get access - otherwise no.
By the time he had come back with the drink, I had got the wireless key from the admin page of the router and was browsing wirelessly.
You should still change the default anyway though - just for good measures.
Unless you plan on pursuing a career as a security admin (or a black hat), you're not going to know whether or not that setup is safe.
It's generally a bad idea to expect that the factory defaults will keep you safe.
There's always a chance that the router's OS will have a vulnerability (now or discovered in the future) allowing somebody to weasel their way in.
You're stuck minimizing your risk with due diligence.
I've done this before with a friends router - he was insistent the wireless network was secure and said I wouldn't be able to get in to it (which I knew was true).
If it's visible from the internet side, then... yes.
