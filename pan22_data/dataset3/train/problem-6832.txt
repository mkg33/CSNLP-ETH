Note: this definition is for a 69793218560 Bytes disk for VM larry, change as necessary for the actual VM.
Find the disk definition in the file (search for "source dev =") and replace the device with the one just created (you can ls /dev/centos/ to see vm), eg: /dev/drbd4 -> /dev/centos/larry.domainname.com.au
Note: the sync will take a long time - about 100 seconds per gigabyte, ie: 90 minutes for a 60 gigabyte disk.
Note: the name and last part of the path should match and will be used as the new disk name.

Note: this will destroy the contents of the target disk, make sure that /dev/mapper/centos-larry.domainname.com.au is correct!
Note: it may be necessary to alter the details of the VM to suit the new environment.
You can cancel the sync with CTRL C  and restart it later by running the command again
 During its sync, it will display a running total of blocks copied and its average speed.
you are changing source bridge so line is like this
However, you can do a sync while the VM is in use; subsequent syncs can be up to 25 percent faster
Note: the first device name is for the source host, as determined from the 'lvs' command; this one is from a [[chewie]] source host.
** Find any references to "br1" in the interface stanzas and change it to "br0"   e.g.
The script will print out the parameters that it is using (there may be a message about a deprecated module, this is okay).
it will say Vol larry.domainname.com.au created from larry.domainname.com.au-vol.xml
These instructions apply to a VM using a LVM provided disk and assumes that Python is on each of the hosts
Detailed Instructions on Copying VMs using blocksync.py
Download the blocksync.py script from https://gist.github.com/rcoup/1338263 and put on both source and destination host in your /home/user  folder.
 Next, it displays the ssh command that it is using and runs it (you will see the authorised staff only message when it does this).
 Finally, it prints out a completion message with the number of seconds it took.
