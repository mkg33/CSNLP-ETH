Same thing though, does delta copies, but this has its own network backup method, so setting up a file share wouldn't be needed
This is a perfect use case for http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html
There were three different ways to keep programs in sync, that I took advantage of:
I'd note the original sync has to be one way however.
The only problem now is that I need more DropBox space!
Otherwise unison might work, but i found initial sync to take ages.
I made folder for My Pictures, My Documents and My Music in the DropBox folder and took advantage of Windows 7 libraries, redirecting the libraries to those folders.
I ended up answering my own question and like rob said in the previous answer ended up with a cloud syncing solution.
For those of you wondering, I ended up sticking with DropBox as it seemed to be the quickest out of the cloud solutions.
I currently use Bittorent Sync to keep all my local and mobile computers in sync..
It was also my chosen cloud solution due to its LAN syncing feature, which saved me bandwidth.
If you can create a file share common to both bvckup works brilliantly - it does delta copies (so its fast) and is dead simple.
