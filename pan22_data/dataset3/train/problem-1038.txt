The OSI model is a conceptual idea -- it doesn't relate to anything that people actually built.
Many IPv4 protocols don't really fit the model, and the same is true of IPv6.
The answer concerns particularly the two UPDATES which I appended to the initial question.
So normally NDP messages have capability to travel only locally in the network and should not be routed.
People spend endless hours debating at what layer a particular protocol resides.
Moreover, IPv4 and IPv6 were developed without the OSI model in mind, so there is no direct correlation between them.
I wondered what will happen if I try to send any NDP ICMPv6 message to a host outside my local network.
See this questions and answer for more information on the OSI model and networking protocols.
So I found that the problem is solved in the following way in RFC-4861
So in each of the sections of this RFC-4861, corresponding to each type of NDP messages, --
NDP belongs to the L3 network layer, it is an essential part of IPv6.
Just like IPv6 it is encapsulated in L2 frames, so it uses - or operates on top of - the data link layer (most often Ethernet).
