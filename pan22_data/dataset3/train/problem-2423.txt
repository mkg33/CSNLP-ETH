Just because you are an Administrative user, does not mean that everything you do, you do as an administrator; it simply means that you have the ability to do so.
When you try and preform administrative tasks - certain applications will be run with administrative privileges (such as when you click run as administrator).
This is a security risk though, please think carefully if you really need this.
The problem is actually very simple: in Windows 10 the hosts file is read-only by default.
Furthermore (at least on my machine) this means that editing a copy as others suggested won't work, because it will be read-only too!
Remember to re-set the read-only bit after you're done to prevent other applications from modifying it without your knowledge.
This means that even if you can access it with administrative privileges, you still cannot write to it.
I would not recommend doing this but if you give your user Full Control on that file it should work as you want it to.
To be able to edit it you must first disable the read-only bit:
Then you can freely edit the hosts file with your favourite text editor (running it as an administrator).
By default, your user runs just the same as any other user would, as themself.
