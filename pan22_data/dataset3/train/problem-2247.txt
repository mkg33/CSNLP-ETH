If you change the properties of a RAID array without backing up any important data you store on it first then you must be mad.
I use Adaptec raid controllers, and thy do that, without pulling the raid.
Now i start filling up the last 8... the next server will be a 4 rack unit 72 bay machine allowing me to put in 72 discs.
Anyone who stores data on a drive system without backing it up is a fool.
Also, consider using an external JBOD (just a bunch of disks) instead of trying to cram all the drives into a standard chassis.
That's without even considering the potential for issues with changing drives and expanding the array.
Re 3: Except investing oney into a decent raid controller and making sure you have the hardware layout in place for that?
Yes, it is feasible to expand a RAID 5 by either adding more disks or by replacing existing disks with larger disks.
Ask yourself first, however, whether your filesystem will support this operation.
"The maximum number of drives in a RAID 5 redundancy group is theoretically unlimited."
Lets be clear about something - RAID is not a backup, period.
I would characterize a RAID reconstruction as inherently risky.
But then, this costs (just th case) around 3000 USD, so "cheap" and "expansion" are very relative terms, you know.
Adding larger disks needs to be done across the entire RAID before you will be able to recognize the benefit.
I copy all data to another server or two with large slow drives.
I run a 24 slow server for that reason (to allow expansion),  rack units.
I do it all the time but I never do it without careful thought and a bit of nervousness.
