If you do not have another backup of the file and Previous Versions does not show the version you are looking for, then more than likely, that version of the file is gone.
Under Protection Settings, select the drive you want to increase the limit on, and click Configure:

System Restore only affects system files, installed applications, Windows Registry, and other system settings.
The default is 5% of your SSD lost to previous versions; 10% would be better:
A System Restore is not a backup of your entire system.
Please know that Previous Versions is a part of System Protection/System Restore in Windows.
Can I, for example, run a full System Restore to get earlier previous versions of this Excel file?
The System Restore feature is limited in how much of your hard drive it is allowed to use for previous versions.
To be assure that many version of previous files can be backup, you have to also enable file backup in Windows 7, the previous version feature can also track this to help you restore.
If you want to access even earlier restore points, you have to allow System Restore to consume even more hard drive space.
Is there any way to restore even earlier versions?
Since the previous version of files only created depend on when the system restore point was created, if there is no restore point, the version of file on that time period, can be not restore.
When I right click a Windows file and click Properties and Previous Versions, I can only see very recent versions.
The default setting under Windows 7 is to consume 5% of your drive to store previous versions of files.
