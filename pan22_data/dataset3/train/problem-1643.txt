The easy method for deleting file is to "right click" on the file, then "click on add to archive" then "click on delete file after compression" then click "ok" then go to archive dashboard an fined file an delete it, simple :)
I must have disabled this a long time ago for whatever reason.
See http://www.diydatarecovery.nl/kb_undelete_article.htm for an explanation.
It recommended that you first use "Microsoft auto fix" before doing this.
I don't know WHY disabling that service caused this problem to happen, but I'm just glad I don't have to worry about executables getting "stuck" anymore.
In Process Explorer, use CTRL+F and type in the name of the executable.
After a quick Google search with the right keywords, I was able to figure out that the reason why Explorer was hanging onto my executables was because my Application Experience service was disabled.
I know this is a really old question of mines, but this was driving me absolutely nuts.
My first step would be to check the disk for errors.
This will identify what is keeping it open, either the executable itself or a virus scanner...
It is possible that the NTFS Master File Table is in error.

After enabling it, deleted EXEs stay deleted and I can now update programs without any problems.
