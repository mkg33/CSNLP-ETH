There is no DNS service installed (which is known to reserve ranges of UDP ports).
I've encountered some strange behavior I don't understand.
These are example commands I use to try and find the "offending" program:
Other presumedly free ports like 5002, 5010 also fail.
My program is written in C++ (Winsock 2), although I also performed quick tests with a simple VB6 program with the same results.
How can I find the "offending" program, i.e., the program taking the UDP port I need to use?
This software needs to bind to a specific UDP port an all TCP addresses in order to listen to requests.
I run all tests using the local Administrator account to no avail.
I seem to be able to bind to several ports of my choice but not others; specifically I can't bind to the one port I need, which is 5001.
My first guess was "it's in use by another program", but it doesn't show either in netstat or TCPView (from sysinternals), so I'm at a loss about what to do about this.
The program is getting socket error 10048 (address already in use).
