Again, I think you'll find the router is the common point of failure in these tests.
Does the problem occur if you connect a computer directly to the modem?
You can of course test this by directly connecting to your modem and setting your computers to repeatedly ping your DNS servers for a period of about an hour or so and you should never see lower than about 3% loss (granted with satellite, it may be different, but you really shouldn't stick with that connection if it is normal to see loss over 3%).
If not, it could be indicating that your router is causing problems.
If this works then again the router may be to blame.
Another solution is to connect your computer together and use Internet Connection Sharing, and connect 1 of the computer directly to the modem.
The difference in the OS's is not of any relevance since I had this problem before I changed over to Windows 7.
Windows troubleshooter, naturally, is about as much use as a politician in government.......NONE.
Not being a nerd when it comes to networking I wonder if anyone has any constructive suggestions.
If you get failure on one machine and not another, then there is no problem with your ISP.
Perhaps see if you can find a firmware update for the router.
The main computer is running Windows 7 Pro 64bit and the secondary computer is running Windows 7 Home Edition 32bit.
I'm willing to bet, given the information present already, that it is something with the router (most connectivity issues are with a home router and not the ISP).
There appears to be no problem with the ISP bad as it is and often the connection will be remade without any help from me.
On occasion there is a loss of internet connection usually on the main computer, often followed by a loss on the secondary comuter.
I have two computers networked through a Netgear WG914 router which is connected to an Ipstar satellite modem via the RG47 LAN connector.
