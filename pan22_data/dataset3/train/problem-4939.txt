If you don't have one of those, you can try rebuilding the ownership and permissions manually by comparing them to a similar CentOS host.
This metadata was not tracked at all and was therefore lost.
You may also want to institute some sort of backups.
Unfortunately git only stores the content and executable bit of a file, so the read/write permissions, user and group ownerships, and ACLs if any are lost when you restore from git reset --hard.
They wrap around git to keep /etc in version control, while also keeping the metadata that git doesn't, and restoring it if necessary.
That's more than enough to break your host when the directory being restored is /etc.
To prevent this happening in future, consider using etckeeper or a similar tool.
By itself, git doesn't track ownership and permissions of files.
You currently don't appear to have any sort of backups, and this is a recipe for disaster.
Your best hope of recovery is from a full filesystem backup, which will include all of the file ownerships and permissions.
But it might end up being less work to reinstall the OS from scratch.
Yes, you have a permission and file ownership problem.
You've been lucky to escape with as little data loss as you have.
Since you weren't tracking these, you'll have to fix them manually, for every single file.
