Ensure that the disk controller is enabled in the computer's BIOS menu."
My system doesn't use EFI or GPT, which cause known issues with Windows installation.
Also,in GParted, I can't change the partition type from logical to primary, though I flagged it as "boot".
I checked the error log (in X:\Windows\panther\ I believe), and it says that the partition is large enough but it is not a primary partition.
Finally I discovered that no, primary partitions can't be created inside an extended partition.
Trying to install Window 8 on a separate partition alongside Ubuntu, I got the message "Windows cannot be installed to this disk.
Your computer hardware may not support booting to this disk.
Yet in Windows installation, even when I delete the partition and recreate it, it's created as a logical not a primary partition.
Windows must be installed to a primary partition, not an extended or logical partition.
So using GParted, I shrank my extended partition and moved it to the right/end of the drive, and created a NTFS partition to the left/at the beginning of the drive.
