Works great for multiple servers and is pretty lightweight for you to use for a single server even.
You just have to schedule your own commands and output of those will be monitored every interval specified.
You can get Zabbix packages (both server and client) with many Linux distributions' package management system directly.
CPU, memory, disk and network are in the default template for all OSes, so it should be relatively configuration free.
It uses more traditional databases like MySQL, so it does consume more resources than RRDT.
(command line thingy, not so useful because I'd have to write my own graphics and logging layer on top of it..)
Setup is pretty simple and shows all of what you ask in a simple timeline for easy debugging.
I was wondering if there are any tools out there that make it easy to log and graph usage statistics of how my cpu, memory, disk and network are used.
I need to somehow know when I need to scale up / when I'm going to get problems soon.
If you aren't quite happy with the way RRDT-based tools work, you may want to try Zabbix.
