Then, I can copy English text from any other program - it could be a browser on an English page (e.g.
I recognize that language is part of text formatting.
copying the instructions on this page) or Wordpad or even a browser's own chrometext when all its settings are English, and when I paste it in, it's marked as German.
I've never used this computer for German correspondence and never set interface languages to German.
More importantly, how can I stop that from happening, other than CTRL+A and selecting the language from the Language tool on the Review tab after every paste?
It's kind of the opposite problem of having non-English text marked as English, which could be blamed on the Web marking most language as English by default.
I can do CTRL+A to select all, and in the Review ribbon -> Language group, choose Language -> Set Proofing Language and "Mark selected text as" English.
I've only opened about a half dozen distinct Word documents since installation, and none of them were in German.
