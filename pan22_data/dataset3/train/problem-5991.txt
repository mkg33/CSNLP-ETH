Oh, and replace lighttpd with nginx; sorry to all the lighttpd fans out there, but you've been superceded.
*/examples/my-small.cnf) which is billed as being for "<=64M".

Then I ask my hosting provider about it they just told me to buy more expensive plan because this one just  cannot possibly run MySQL because there is not enough ram.
You should probably use the my-small config (/usr/share/doc/mysql-server-5.
I have Debian 32bit OS running on it and I have decided to install some light weight LAMP, so I installed lighthttpd and MySQL but then it had to be started It said it was starting.... and failed.
I don't warrant that it'll perform at all well, but it should at least start.
I wouldn't be trying to run anything production in 128MB of RAM these days, there's just too much bloat on a modern system, but if you're up for a challenge, have at it.
You're probably running a default mysql config that isn't tuned for a smaller RAM footprint.
