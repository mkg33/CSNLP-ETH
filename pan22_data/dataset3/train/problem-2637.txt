You need the package mcrypt installed and you can find more information in the man pages for usermod and mcrypt and http://www.ryannitz.org/tech-notes/tag/usermod/.
WinSCP supports password change requests so this method should be nearly effortless on the part of the user.
This means that the first time these users login they will be forced to change their password.
You could create new accounts with the same password for all users and then set the passwords to expire immediately for each of these newly created users on the system.
--Is there another way I can set passwords for new users?
It sounds like this server is in a bit of a mess if the passwd command is failing, so good luck user36651.
You could verify that everyone has logged in and changed their password by checking the last login time for each user or trying to login using each user's default password and verifying that they have changed it.
--Is there a place the adduser script stores the default passwords?
Yes, You can use the command usermod -p PASSWORD, where PASSWORD is as returned by the crypt command.
A search for crypt usermod will return more examples.
