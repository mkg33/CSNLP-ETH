I guess I eventually found out where that term comes from—it's a pirated movie release type.
So, in order to get a "micro" or "mini" 720p rip, you'd specify a lower bit rate.
Choosing a slower preset gives you better compression at the cost of having to wait longer.
Calculating from those guidelines, the usual bit rate for a 720p Blu-ray rip would be around 4.5 MBit/s.
Better compression means that the video will look better at the same file size.
Unfortunately, the default constant bit rate encoding mode in x264 is considered quite bad in terms of quality.
You can change the preset from slow to ultraslow, or in the other direction to medium, fast, ultrafast.
Ideally you should do a two-pass encoding if you have the time.
Note that if your original file already contains a valid audio stream for MP4 (usually AAC or MP3 audio), then you can skip the -c:a libfaac -q:a 100 part and simply copy the bitstream with -c:a copy.
It describes a 720p movie (thus, resized to 1280⨉720 pixels), but at a lower bit rate than what you'd usually need.
One scene guide I found also uses 4 MBit/s for x264 encoding.
