Microsoft and other companies have spent a good deal of time tackling this problem for their products (for example, Windows Genuine Advantage).
But if you and I both ran this command, we would get wildly different output.
You should know that it's quite likely that if you swap out a component for another of the same model and revision (say, you bought two NVidia GeForce 7800GTS cards at the same store at the same time), you would probably get the same hash.
For example, it will list out your network card, video card, sound card, and some motherboard components.
This tool shows, in human-readable text, the hardware visible on your PCI bus.
While this is certainly a less secure way to handle hardware fingerprinting, it's a quick and easy way to get the job done.
Now, you could use "lspci", but you're probably looking for something a little more concise.
This will redirect the "lspci" command into "md5sum" which will return an MD5 hash that looks something like this:
But here's a quick way to get a hardware footprint of a system from Linux, and your live CD will probably have these tools built-in.
