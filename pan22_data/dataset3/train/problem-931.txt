I would have done this one for you, but you didn't say what kind of laptop it is.
Details regarding your specific laptop would be good.
Find those speakers on ebay or a local used computer store.

Put the laptop back together, plug it in, and test the new speakers.
If you're not well versed inside laptops and with electronics, I would suggest referring to your local computer store.
Google disassembly instructions for your laptop (for mine I would google "gateway md354 disassembly")  Sites with images are the best.
