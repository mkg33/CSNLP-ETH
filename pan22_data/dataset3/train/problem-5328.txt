A surefire way is to use a Virtual Machine to start the program.
When you find it, the port will be around that line of code.
You can filter out calls to well-known application libraries like WinSock, or even set a breakpoint on when the "host was not accessible" error dialog is shown.
If it is really difficult for you to find the correct network activity, attach a debugger and do a trace on the program.
There are a couple of different options, ranging from "simple and a long shot" to "sure to work but tedious".
If it's not in the documentation, you're going to have to sift through a Wireshark or Netmon dump.
That being said, a quick call to the mystery application's support staff should resolve your problem.
Have you tried to shut down all unnecessary programs and network communication first?
If you have the source code, grep it for the word socket.
This makes it a lot easier for you to trace its activity, since it is limited to a specific IP.
This is however very tedious and will require some reverse engineering voodoo.
Contacting the supplier/manufacturer of the software would seem like a sensible thing to do in this situation.
