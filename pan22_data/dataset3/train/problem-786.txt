Usually N routers allow you to select 20MHz-only mode if you need to, so that you don't have to worry about your transmissions going across so much of the band.
If that limited setup worked fine, then I'd test using wide channels or using the 5GHz band, knowing I could always fall back to the more limited config that worked fine.
When it transmits a 40MHz-wide signal, it uses channels 1 and 5 together.
If that doesn't work I'd return the router and buy a higher-quality N router.
Now you set up an HT40-capable N router on channel 1.
"HT40") in the 2.4GHz band, which can give higher throughput in clean environments but because it uses 2 contiguous channels bonded together instead of just one, you have to make sure that both channels are clean.
You should also note that some N routers can be configured to use wide channels (40MHz-wide channels, a.k.a.
This is a shot in the dark, but when you set up your N routers, you didn't set N-only mode (disable G and B rates) did you?
Let's say you'd been doing G on channel 1 and it had been working fine.
So if your neighbor's network was on, say, 6 (the channels in 2.4GHz overlap quite a bit), it will interfere with your HT40 N gear when it never would have interfered with your old G gear.
If I were you, I'd set 20MHz-only, leave G and B support enabled, and put my N router on the same 2.4GHz channel as I had been running my old G router on.
Because turning off G and B rates can kill your range.
