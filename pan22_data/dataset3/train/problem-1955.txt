Concurrently, when experiencing performance degradation, verify that a wired host has good connectivity, which will also help identify whether WiFi is an issue.
In this case, though, as stated, it's not clear if there is a wifi issue.
There are a plethora of online WiFi tuning articles to be found to suit the spectrum of network configurations.
If you've no .11g devices, setting your wifi AP to exclude .11a/b/g will improve performance.
We've got around 10mb download internet which we connect to over wifi, we have about 8 machines / devices connected at any one time.
This should be verified by transferring data between two hosts, and noting its characteristics:  transfer rates, error rates, hangs, signal levels.
Is there a way i can see all the traffic over our wifi network and analyize whats slowing it down ?
I know i could go through each machine disconnect it, monitor and try and trouble shoot the issue that way, but its unscientific - is there a better way ?
If your router/wifi AP supports it, it can provide an abundant account of interface attributes to assist in diagnosing a problem.1
The internet speed ranges from ok to bad depending when you use it.
I think studying each component of a system to determine why it may be behaving in a certain way is the epitome of scientific; perhaps you intended 'technical'...
Are all hosts connecting with 802.11n (or better), or is there a mixture?
To examine an access point's or router's packet counters and stats, I suggest investigating [SNMP].
