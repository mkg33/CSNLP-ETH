For example, if you are using a US DNS and perform a lookup on duckduckgo.com, you get IP addresses of servers in the US that resolve to that name.
for the domain/zone,if not all A and CNAME records
Is there anyway to get all A records in existence that resolve to a single name, regardless of your current DNS provider?
You are being returned IP addresses corresponding to servers closest to your geographical location.
Or the only way to do it is to get a list of all public DNS providers in the world and query them one by one?
This would at least list all name servers, mail servers (MX records), TXT records, etc.
The closest you are probably able to get would be to check the SOA records.
dnschecker.org is a website that will resolve the fqdn from lot of DNS servers around the world.
nslookup works to give you only the A records your configured DNS has.
However, like I said, this is a rather poor configuration - zone transfers should only be allowed to secondary/slave nameservers for the domain/zone in question.
But if you are using a DNS provider in Germany, you get IP addresses of servers in Ireland that resolve to that name.
You could use either of these methods to pull a list of all name servers for the domain/zone, then query each one individually for the hostname you are wanting the list of A/CNAME records for.
If the zone is configured on the authorative name server somewhat incorrectly, so that zone transfers/queries are allowed to any host, you could pull the entire zone's information with
