I believe Cygwin (and thus du) treats junction points as soft-links.
Today I had to check how much space certain directories consume and found out that one of them makes heavy use of hardlinks (which could cause certain files be considered in the sum more than once).
Du by Sysinternals might be what you're looking for.
These 14,9GB equal the amount of what du (see earlier answer) return as size (if you take 15.620.679.650 and divide it by (1024*1024*1024) you get a rounded 14,9)
An all-default install of Cygwin (a POSIX emulation layer for Windows) includes the du utility from the GNU core utilities collection, and it is fully hard-link and junction-point aware.
It may be a little lowbrow for Server Fault, but Tree Size Free (http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/) will do that quite well, especially if you're just trying for a one time use.
You really should look at http://foldersize.codeplex.com/releases?ReleaseName=FolderSize.Win32.1.0.7.0 it rocks!
It's free from Microsoft, and it's basically a rudimentary version of the *ix du.
Easy graphical way to see who is chewing up what space.
It deals with junctions and denied permissions by reporting the file doesn't exist.

The Professional version has a lot of nice features that I use for ongoing maintenance.
You can see that WinDirStat shows 14,9GB for the winsxs directory.
