There are some times when the pause key actually does what it says.
Film your screen, or take repeated photos on the key moment, and then you will manage to read it ;)
I pulled the drive out - connected to another computer and deleted the offending driver.
The best option at this point is to do a reinstall.
In my experience, the error message isn't going to be useful at all.
You can try and get lucky with the pause key, but as far as I am aware there is no way to get to the event logs even through recovery console.
Use a camcorder to record the screen, then play back a frame at time.
Windows normally blue-screens at boot time due to a faulty driver or a hardware fault.
I had a similar problem once - I just recorded video on my iphone - and went frame by frame.
This may be one of those cases, if you can hit it just as the screen is blue.
However you can also check any of the following for or try the following to see if the system still crashes.
In my experience, removing the video driver (in safe mode) will remedy the problem.
Might sound silly as a solution, but you obviously need to see what is on this blue screen, but you can't access settings (that happens).
I have had USB hard drives cause the fault, and also had the problem switching the hard drive mode in the BIOS from IDE to SATA.
