To prevent routing loops BGP filters out AS paths that have your own AS in them.
Splitting up your allocation from RIPE NCC is possible.
But in the end they are just blocks of integers :)  There are no technical differences between them, only policy differences.
You can do multihoming with any address space you get from RIPE NCC.
For IPv4 you can usually deaggregate down to a /24.
As your routing in Germany is different from your routing in Sweden you qualify for that so you should have no problem getting two AS numbers.
Splitting your /22 into two /23s will therefore work.
You can get multiple AS numbers if you have multiple routing policies.
The last /22 you can get is PA space so you are allowed to assign/delegate addresses to third parties if you want to.
If you would use the same AS then your network in Germany wouldn't be able to see the network in Sweden and vice-versa.
You can use them independently of ISPs, connect them to multiple upstream ISPs (multihoming), change those upstreams, participate on internet exchanges etc.
If you have two disconnected networks you need two AS numbers.
The difference between PA (Provider Aggregatable) and PI (Provider Independent) is what you are allowed to do with it.
