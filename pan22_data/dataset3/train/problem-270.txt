Performance tests are often difficult and tests involving files are particularly so.
At the least you would need to repeat the tests several times both before and after deleting the temp files with a reboot between each test.
But I suspect the reality would be even more complex.
Unless proper precautions are taken you often end up measuring something other than what you are trying to test.
Personally, I don't believe in that advice, partly because my TEMP folder currently
Such tests are subject to the placebo effect and are of questionable value.
Delete temp files to save disk space but don't expect performance improvements.
For a slow-down, you would need to run a program that:
contains 2270 files in 196 folders with no bad effects.
I expect that the majority of those claiming a performance gain from deleting temp files have done no measurements at all and evaluations were completely subjective.
And of those that did do measurements most would have been too simplistic to produce meaningful results.
If the number of files in the folder doesn't exceed a few
The results are heavily dependent on the hardware and exactly what operations were done and the state of the system before the tests.
And after all was done I fully expect the results would be inconclusive.
The TEMP folder would need to contain many thousands of files and folders for any
And the tests themselves will effect the contents of the file cache and other things.
hundreds, then any improvement will be measured in milliseconds.
There are some tools to measuring your system speed by cleaning garbage files on both applications.
