This script will start Vim on a copy of the tutor file!
It works, but when I type vimtutor on the command line, a window opens and closes immediately, and nothing else happens.
Save a copy of the file to My Documents using the menu.
Is there a way to run vimtutor with Vim for Windows?
This can happen when Vim doesn't have a translation of a tutor file into the language set by the system, when you have installed additional language files during Vim installation (if installing through the Windows installer) and use Windows with an unsupported locale.
For those who prefer to launch the tutor directly, here's a simple no-frills replacement (adjust Vim install directory):
I was able to run vimtutor without problems when I reinstalled Vim with the checkbox to install additional language files unchecked.
The vimtutor command is a merely a shortcut command to do this, as well as automatically showing the correct translations if necessary.
