This will try to recover any deleted files that it finds, and you can easily end up with gigabytes of data written to the target.

At some stage this software makes changes to your disk so you may want to try one of the non-destructive file recovery utilities first.

Is there any way to either convert it back to NTFS without loosing the data or recover the data in its current state (EXT3)?

If you formatted your entire drive, you will need a second drive to accomplish this, either an external drive or a second internal drive.
Be sure you have enough space on the target partition to write the data to.
