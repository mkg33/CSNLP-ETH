However, we do know that $\textsf{NP}^{O_2^P}$ isn't contained in $\textsf{SIZE}(n^k)$ for any $k$, as shown by Chakaravarthy and Roy.
It is not known whether NEXP is contained in P/poly.
Since nobody posted an answer, I will answer the question myself with the comments posted in the original question.
Thanks to Robin Kothari, Emil Jerabek, Andrew Morgan and Alex Golovnev.
This is because the usual Karp-Lipton argument doesn't go through for $O_2^P$, since we don't know whether $\textsf{NP}\subseteq O_2^P$  (in fact, this is equivalent to asking whether $\textsf{NP}\subseteq \textsf{P/poly}$).
But in this question I'm not interested in results for fixed $k$.
$P/poly$ is closed under complement, so it contains $NEXP$ if and only if it contains $coNEXP$.
Indeed proving that NEXP is not in P/poly would have some applications in derandomization.
Note: I'm aware that $SP_2$ is known not to be contained in $Size[n^k]$ for each fixed constant $k$ (This was also shown for MA with 1 bit of advice).
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I can tell, we actually don't know a fixed-polynomial size lower bound for $O_2^P$.
I'm really interested in classes which are different from P/Poly, even if these classes are very large.
$O_2^P$ seems to be the smallest known class not having circuits of size $n^k$ for each fixed $k$.
By diagonalization, it follows that for any super-polynomial (and space-constructible) function $s$,  $DSPACE[s(n)]$ doesn't have polynomial-size circuits.
$MA_{exp}$ seems to be the smallest uniform class with known superpolynomial lower bounds.
