I restarted the service, and checked all the websites, everything seems to be running smooth.
HOWEVER, the scan should have told you what to do to resolve the issue I would think.
Does anybody have more understanding of SMB service or windows permissions, and can turn me in the right direction?
Using the "sc sdshow iisadmin" command I was able to see that "Everyone" had "Access" in the "Discretionary" permissions:
Either way, it seemed a good idea to remove the "Everyone" entry from discretionary.
A vulnerability scan of our network has turned up this response:
I've been looking at the services, and reading up on Windows SMB (Server Message Block) but still am not able to really detect what the problem is here.
I've looked at the services, there is an "IIS Admin" service and I've checked the permissions on the executable (C:\windows\system32\inetsrv\inetinfo.exe) but it doesn't list anything abnormal:
You still have to be careful, because there are certain special permissions on the IIS admin service for the Everyone group: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903072

I simply removed that "WD" entry by resetting the permissions with:
It's been a while since I've worked on a 2003 server, but it's possible that the scan (sounds like a Nessus scan to me) is picking up a best practices issue.
