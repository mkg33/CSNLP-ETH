If you need to increase performance on the server, then you will have to turn off the Windows Firewall and install a hardware firewall instead.
If you're running IIS from a computer within your organization, I would argue that it would be better to have a hardware firewall setup in front of your network, rather than relying on a software firewall such as Windows.
I'm running into an issue whose cause is difficult to spot but is easy to describe: if Windows Firewall and some related services (Windows Firewall, IKE, IPSec Policyagent, Base Filtering Engine) are stopped, then IIS performance doubles (from aprox.
Even if this is a personal machine, I wouldn't connect a computer directly to a network without some sort of hardware firewall up in the first place.
Needless to say, stopping Windows Firewall is not an option.
Environment is Windows Server Enterprise 2008 SP2, II7.
If that's the same result, then I doubt there's much you can do, apart from turning Windows Firewall off.
If you don't do anything specific only to the Windows Firewall, you might try an alternative firewall, maybe it'll do better.
(Note: I went through the related questions list and couldn't find one that answers this situation.)
Might I ask why stopping Windows Firewall is not an option?
Of course the Windows Firewall will degrade performance.
I wonder if it is because you are using a non-standard port 9876 for HTTP traffic.
Repro scenario is plain simple: just create an IIS web site and serve a single image i.e.
While CPU stays low with and without firewall enabled, CPU Privileged Time % increases in comparison with User Time %.
It has to inspect all packets in and out of the server.
