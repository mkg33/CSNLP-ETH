The nginx before varnish also serves to terminate ssl since varnish cannot handle it.
In your circumstances I would focus on understanding the configuration of one web server rather than two or three.
Or would just running Nginx as a reverse proxy with Varnish caching with Apache as the backend (as I understood it at least, might be wrong) overall the best solution?
Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on either Linux, Nginx, Varnish or anything related to servers but I've managed to get a Linode VPS up and running, serving two blogs with Wordpress on them to different domains.
Tried Apache, tried Nginx with Wordpress and W3 Total Cache and APC.
Atleast version 2.1.5, haven't looked into 3.x yet.
Nginx can be configured to serve static content, serve PHP-generated content via HttpFcgiModule, and cache content via HttpProxyModule.
Our site runs on all ssl if you are logged in so we still want to cache pages.
and behind varnish I have a bunch of apache servers
This is with a Wordpress site with APC and W3 Total Cache.
Putting an nginx in front of varnish is also good if you want gzip compression, because that's also something varnish can't handle.
The sites are basically just copies of other setups and nothing that I've done myself, so I wanted to try things out for myself.
I love optimization, and was curious if running Nginx and Varnish together would yield better results than just Nginx?
