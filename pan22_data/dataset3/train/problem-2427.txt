Decent amateur performances can often be found on YouTube for some, but not all, of the remainder.
We sometimes perform new and original works for which no recording exists anywhere; for those we usually ask our rehearsal pianist to record accompaniment tracks.
A more important consideration is that many of our singers are not sophisticated computer users so the solution needs to be something that works with minimal effort.
This would be relatively simple if every piece were available on GMusic (or Spotify or iTunes) but the typical situation is that only about 80% of pieces have commercially available recordings.
As a GMusic All Access subscriber, I can upload extra material for my own use and add it to the playlist,  but GMusic excludes it from the playlist when I share the link with others.
I'm looking for a solution that lets me create a single playlist that provides access to all the tracks to anyone with the link.
ad-supported, option for those that don't wish to take on a paid subscription.
The playlist comprises good recordings of pieces we're currently preparing for performance and, hence, will change every 3 months.
I want to use a music streaming service (preferably Google Music) to legally share a playlist with a 100+ member choral group.
