Websites that query your page to see if popups are enabled don't get a response if the management is turned off.
For firefox, the settings are usually in files in the mozilla paths of the users profile that end in tags like .js, .properties, and .config.
Also, both of these only affect IE, so you'll need to configure each browser separately to achieve similar results.
Things you change in the top area are per computer.
What you can't do in these areas, you can likely set (custom option) in the security tab of inetcpl.cpl.
One thing to note is that the pop-up management reference in gpedit.msc isn't about turning off popups, its about turning of the management of popups.
This means that even if popups are enabled, the sites querying IE will assume that its disabled anyway.
A lot of that can be managed by running gpedit.msc  This should open up a window where the left pane has two main sections with multiple sub sections.
Near the bottom of each main section there's a windows subsection.
