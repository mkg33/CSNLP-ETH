*I've tried to access the Gateway config page, however for there seems to be a problem with that as well (I typed the Default Gateway IP into the browser, and the page continuously loaded til it timed out).
Recently my windows machine that has been working without a problem for over a year decided to start using a dynamic IP address instead of the static one I manually configured it to use.
*I've tried to restart the computer but that just got me a different dynamic IP or kept the same IP from last time
I'm thinking this may be a problem with the Gateway due to the problems I'm having accessing the config page for that, but before I call comcast I would like to make sure it isn't just some quick fix I'm missing.
The only recent change we had was adding an Ethernet splitter between the server and gateway in order to add an additional server to the network, however that was about 2 months ago so I don't know why that would cause it to start acting up now.
*I've tried to /release & /renew the IP, but that didn't do anything
