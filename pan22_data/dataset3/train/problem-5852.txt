Disabling via the web interface is not an acceptable option for my mangers.

the particular host that you don't want to run it on:
We have a nagios setup that uses inheritance to a larger degree than I am used to.
The host inherits all the services defined in the hostgroup linux-servers.
I’m sure I’m missing something obvious… based on my reading of inheritance this should be possible but I’m not able to wrap my head around it.
But I still can’t get my head around how to accomplish my goal.
I investigated this and it is a known bug and safely ignored for this specific server.
I have server/host that has notified for procs warning.
Ideally I’d like to increase the warning/critical points for the service definition for just this host; but I’m also comfortable just not using this service check until a patch for the current problem is issued.
I’ve tried giving the service check a name and then setting that name to null in the host definition, but I think this syntax is wrong and/or I’m not understanding that part of inheritance:
This will leave the service applied to every member of "linux-servers", except "unixlab".
In the service definition, you can exclude (using !)
