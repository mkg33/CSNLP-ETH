One possible solution, which I haven't tried myself, is to point PHP:s sendmail_path= toward the Anubis helper script msg2smtp.pl
Of course, if there's multiple Postfixes involved, one on your web server as well as one on your companies designated mail server, then there really isn't any problem.
If you want to encrypt the mail with pgp/gpg/smime, then you probably have to write a filter for that and specify it with content_filter.
If you want to encrypt your outgoing mail using GnuPG, without involving your PHP code, then GNU Anubis might be what you are looking for.
While there obviously isn't any problem with using SMTP to pass the mails along to Postfix, PHP tend to use the local sendmail binary.
It can sit in-front of your SMTP server and (among other things) apply GnuPG encryption to your mails.
If by encrypt you mean that all mail should be sent with SSL/TLS, with postfix then you can simply set smtp_enforce_tls to yes.
In that case all you have to do is simply plug Anubis in between.
You can tweak the SSL/TLS settings, check all the smtp_tls_* options.
The potential issue here is that Anubis both accepts and submits mail using SMTP.
