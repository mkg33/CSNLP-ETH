Is there anything on your system that would impact loading a browser control from resources in a dll (specifically the F12Resources.dll).
this happened to me in windows 8 on more than one occasion.
I opened it up and it was showing the browser window and inspector window.
I was at the end of my tether until I noticed that the IE icon on my toolbar was indicating that there were multiple windows.
You may also want to run a sfc /scannow if you haven't already, to ensure system files are in place and not corrupted.
Update to the latest version and if that doesn't help, uninstall IE11 and reinstall it (using the latest version).
Not sure if the same will be true for windows 7, but if anyone has this problem for windows 8, this solution seems to work :)
Issue is due to the Update Versions: RTM (KB2841134).
According to your picture, that's not the latest version of IE11 for Windows 7.
For example do you have any virus scanners or settings that block the res:// protocol?
Install required Important Updates and Optional Updates
When you detach it and use it as it's own window and it works much better.
It looks like the 'shell' part of F12 is loading, but the tools themselves aren't loading.
Best way to fix is to update the Internet Explorer 11 to the Latest Knowledge Base (KB) update
I switched to the inspector window from the toolbar IE icon and it was showing up fine on my desktop, so I clicked the button that controls if the inspector shows up in the browser window or on its own.
