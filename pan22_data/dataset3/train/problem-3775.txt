The best way I can think of is to create a batch file to do it for you.
At home, I can connect using automatic configuration.
Is there a way to set up the ethernet adapter to automatically switch configurations?
you should be able to add multiple gateways,dns servers and ip addresses.
My problem is that I have to switch between the manual configuration and the automatic one when I move between locations.
I tried setting the work options in the adapter's IPv4 settings, and then adding the gateway and DNS servers from home in the advanced section of the IPv4 settings, but I can't seem to get it to work.
The gateway and DNS addresses for work do not function at home, and vice versa.
Copy and paste the below code into filename.bat then edit the various settings to match your configuration.
And, in a separate batch file, to change back to DHCP
For the ip address you may have to change the order
You might need to change "Local Area Connection" to what ever the name of your network card is that you are changing.
At work, I connect through the network, and must specify a static IP, gateway, and static DNS servers.
