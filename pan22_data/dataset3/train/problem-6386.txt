Below is a method from the openDMK library to send out a SNMPv2 Trap:
I have read the RFC specs, but most of the text appear to be gibberish to me.
The RFC Alarm MIB would just have an element in it's instantiated list of alarms that describe that alarm; not the actual value of the alarm, which in this instance is temperature.
The RFC Alarm MIB is a way to tell the SNMP manager what alarms will be coming in and what they might mean.
Please excuse any brutal ignorance in my questions.
Your MIB will be different in that your MIB will actually describe the values of that alarm, such as the temperature of a CPU thermometer.
The RFC Alarm Reporting Control MIB defines objects for controlling the reporting of your alarm conditions.
So, I am asking on ServerFault now, hoping someone could help me since this is also related to networking.
Another requirement is "SNMP support must be comformable with Alarm Reporting Control MIB (RFC 3878)".
The RFC Alarm MIB is used to describe the alarms/notifications that you will be implementing in your own MIB for your own agent.
I have asked the following questions on StackOverflow, but haven't received a single answer yet, presumably because no one there seems to be knowledgable enough about SNMP and my questions.
One requirement is that "SNMP support must be comformable with Alarm MIB (RFC 3877)".
The MIB you write will tell the manager what the actual alarm values mean.
I am new to SNMP and have troubles understanding the SNMP requirements of a Java application I am required to implement.
The RFC Alarm MIB is related to your MIB in that the RFC Alarm MIB will create and list of your alarms and describe information about the alarms/notifications that are common with all alarms.
My understanding of how to use this method is trapOid will refer to the OID of the Notification in my application's MIB and varBindList is any additional parameters to send.
