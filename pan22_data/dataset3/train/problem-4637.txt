If so, what's the difference between '$' and '^M' in vi?
If that's Vim behind your vi command, you can reload the file with
or, if you need to open these files frequently, prepend ucs-2 to the 'fileencodings' option, e.g.
$ is the end of line as displayed by :set list with the default value of the listchar option.
When I try to use Context.write(k,v) in MapReduce(using Java) to write data to a file ,I find the following contents in file(opened with vi, have :set list):
This is not a Vi(m) problem: check the documentation of that method to see if there's a way to output your data without those nulls.
The file that you opened is UTF-16 or UCS-2 encoded, which is the standard in Java.
I know that $ means the end of the line, but does it mean the enter key, just like \n?
vi (as in real vi, not vim symlinked to vi) can only handle ASCII (or ISO-8859-1?)
For some weird reason every meaningful character in your file is prepended with a null character except digits and (probably) spaces.
Use vim, or convert the file to ASCII (e.g., iconv -f utf-16 -t ascii <input> <output>).
