How can I set up an email notification on a Linux server for when a disk/volume exceeds a certain usage quota?
You may think you only need to monitor disk space right now, but the reality is you almost certainly need monitoring for more than one or two servers.
-- look around here for lots of suggestions & opinions), and configure it to send you a notification when your disks are filling up.
I recommend you the "Monit" software that is very light and easy to configure :
I'd personally recommend Zenoss, it's F/LOSS, relatively easy to setup and get going, and they have great documentation.
Option 1:Write a script that runs df, parses the output for the percent utilization & sends an email when it exceeds a given threshold, then run this script from cron.
(If you're feeling lazy you can find a bunch of pre-written scripts by asking The Knower of All Things for Unix Disk space check script.)
Deploy a monitoring system (Nagios, InterMapper, OpenNMS, etc.
While you're at it configure alerts for other stuff you might be concerned about :-)
