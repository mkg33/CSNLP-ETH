And what's the rationale behind it in the first place?
My usual workaround is to make a quick copy of the file in the version control system working directory with select-file, CTRL-C, CTRL-V, and then edit the copied file to view it.
Since you can't change anything, I'd think Powerpoint won't ask you to save.
If i open a .ppt file in Powerpoint 2007 and then just close it without modifying anything the file will be saved/modified by powerpoint.
This is very annoying as versioning systems detects it as a file change and promts for commit or notifies all other colleagues depending on system used.
This can be deselected but, unfortunately, I don't have 2007 on this PC so I can't talk you through it.
Powerpoint may be set up to autosave at regular intervals.
By default, version control systems such as SVN / Tortoise will usually ignore additional uncontrolled files like these.
I don't know where the .ppt files are saved, but can't you just open them in read-only mode?
I don't want to notify the whole team that I've just read a document and they surely don't want to get notified about it either thinking it has been updated.
This is useful if you are editing but not, apparently, if you only wish to view the file.
