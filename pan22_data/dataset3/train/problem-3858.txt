So long as you can keep the router from assigning the addresses you want to give to PXE clients, all should be well.
that one doesn't support adding a special dhcp-option which itself is required for PXE-boot.
If you want the DNS server to only assign addresses to certain macs, setup the range with no available address.
the server in question is a windows server 2003 R2 SP2 with the DHCP-services installed.
You can set up DHCP on the 2008 box to ONLY serve out PXE requests.
or the other way round: how can i let the DHCP-server assign an IP only to some very special mac-addresses?
(Yes none) then use the reservations to assign the macs you want to allow in there.
how can i refuse to assign an IP to a certain mac-address?
We do this to stop certain machines connecting to our network at times.
i clicked around and looked for answers on the internet - without big success.
i'm running two DHCP-servers on the same physical network - not good, i know that.
Don't have one handy atm, but leave a note if you need a hand.
Edit: You can do the other way around by using reservations with invalid ip addresses.
but i need to boot a machine using PXE and the dhcp-server should assign addresses only to this machine, and not touch the others.
Of course that won't stop your PXE machine from getting its IP address from the router if that answers the request first.
Limit the scope on the one DHCP server to only the PXE MAC addresses.
I'm not sure how it might affect you since you do need them to connect but a quick test will show you.
Set a reservation for that address to be assigned to the MAC address you want to use.
That way it won't assign IPs to any other machines except the ones that use PXE.
