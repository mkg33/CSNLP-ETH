I have only ever had a pst file become corrupt in two instances:
the only other time I had a pst fail on me was back in the days of 2000 when I had one get to almost 2 gig in size.
They get real unreliable near 2 gigs in older versions of outlook.
Though I can not debunk your IT guy's misgivings, I can point you to a resource that I found helpful when I was worried.
I have been using Outlook for around 8 years and I have had to transfer all kinds of emails between different pst files as well as creating more when one got too big and as you can imagine, this took all kinds of copying from one to another.
but hey who knows, this is Microsoft we are talking about.
One time I had a massive failure while outlook was closing, this corrupted my personal pst file.
So though I can not point you directly to a resource that says he is wrong or misguided, I can assure you that searching google for a half an hour about the subject shows no links that say copying emails from one pst to another has been a vector for corruption.
