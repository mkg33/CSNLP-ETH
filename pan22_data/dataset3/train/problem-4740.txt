Currently, libvirt does not support this parameter in its XML format directly, so you have to pass it in as a qemu:commandline parameter.
Here are the relevant bits of a libvirt configuration that I use for an OSX guest:
If you set it to 1, the guest should treat the disk as an SSD.
As a workaround, for Linux you can override this by unsetting the 'rotational' flag for the block device in sysfs for any disks backed by SSD.
There is no mechanism in QEMU today to mark a SCSI, ATA or VirtioBlk disk as being backed by non-rotational storage.
If the virtual disk is a QCOW2 image, or is on thin provisioned media such as SAN storage or a sparse LVM or ZFS volume, then it will be presented appropriately as a thin provisioned volume to Windows.
This disk is on a QCOW2 disk image on local SSD storage.
I'm talking to people to find out if it is possible to add this feature to QEMU to make it 'just work' in future releases.
This will cause Windows to only issue TRIM commands, and not to attempt to defragment the drive.
You don't need to do anything at all with current versions of qemu.
Recent versions of QEMU (I tried with 2.12.0) support a rotation_rate parameter.
So the guest OS wouldn't do the optimal settings out of the box.
