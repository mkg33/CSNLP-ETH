Considering this is an important looking file, tried sfc /scannow to confirm that system files are all in place?
compatabilitity for Windows XP) but is actually compiled for Windows 7.
Now I have other applications which haven't been touched like Chrome which are reporting the same problem- the message box pops up often.
If this is an application that you got from the Internet or a friend, uninstall it and then reinstall it.
But I went to Windows Update and installed all the latest updates.
I've compiled a relatively simple Direct3D9 program in C++.
However, whenever I try to use the Debug runtime, this error pops up.
This looks like your program is running in compatability mode (e.g.
i had the exact same issue, when starting a program (Autodesk 3dmax ) after removing VS2011.
This indicates they are compatibilty related files and do exist
The date/time on d3d9d.dll was from 2011 and so I deleted both copies of d3d9d.dll and left the d3d9.dll alone (from 2010).
I've reinstalled Visual Studio to no effect and run all the latest Windows patches, which also have had no effect.
At first, I figured it was a problem with my application.
On my system, I found I had d3d9.dll and d3d9d.dll in windows\system and windows\syswow64.
According to all of the references I have found, this DLL is not listed to exist in Windows 7.
The only solution I found was simply to reinstall Windows and never, ever, go near VS11 and install the DX SDK before VS10.
api-ms-win-core* files are virtual dlls used by Windows7.
If this is a new application, try changing the output EXE file name to reset the compatability  state for the program.
