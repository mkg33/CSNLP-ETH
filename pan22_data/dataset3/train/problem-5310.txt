Since Dell doesn't publish the image for their proprietary version of Ubuntu, I reinstalled stock Ubuntu 16.04, and everything works fine.
I have a Dell 5520 laptop, and it's Internet (both wired and wireless) randomly stops working for seemingly no reason.
How do you diagnose your Internet dropping out under Ubuntu 16.04?
Running cat /var/log/syslog |grep -i network finds:
Also, simply turning my wifi off and on, or unplugging and then re-plugging the ethernet cable immediately fixes it, so it seems like it's some local bug with DHCP or the networking driver.
As you can imagine, this is quite frustrating, and breaks a lot of automated systems that need Internet access.
So it seems Dell's custom Ubuntu distro is buggy and/or has bad drivers in it, which can't even be fixed by running a normal apt-get update.
Clearly, that shows there's some sort of network problem occurring, but I'm not sure what.
I don't think it's my router, as no other device on my network exhibits this problem.
My hard drive died, forcing me to re-install onto a fresh drive.
