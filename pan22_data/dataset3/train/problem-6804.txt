Maybe someone may know if I'm supposed to configure something specifically that I haven't?
When I ran "netstat -nr" I got the following output:
Which is apparently an exact copy of his configuration he used on his mac where he was able to connect and work successfully with the VPN.
The VPN connected successfully but when I tried to load any pages the connection would just timeout.
A friend of mine setup a VPN to connect to his server using openvpn.
I feel as if maybe there is too many things being routed through the VPN.
All I've done is install network-manager-openvpn and imported that file to create a new VPN (and entered credentials) and nothing else.
My friend and I tried troubleshooting but I'm not very knowledgeable with OpenVPN I've only used PPTP where I just put the IP and my credentials and I'm good to go.
I installed "network-manager-openvpn" (I'm in ubuntu) and I created a new VPN connection using the certificates he sent me.
So I imported that file to create a new VPN and I was still having the same issue.
