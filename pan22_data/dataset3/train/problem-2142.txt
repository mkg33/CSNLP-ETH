Is it possible that it's either a Debian/Ubuntu bug or a RAM issue?
I'm trying to build a new headless computer using a mini-ITX board with a Celeron processor.
The RAM is PNY (blah I know), but if it were RAM I would not expect an issue quite like this.
If I power it on with no video plugged in, the hard drive spins for a while then eventually stops, SSH isn't working, and if I THEN plug in a display, it shows a blank screen -- the monitor doesn't even come out of power save.
Same thing happens if I unplug HDMI or VGA while the computer is running, the system completely locks up.
The only two commonalities are the OS (both Debian-based, but very different kernel versions) and the RAM -- I don't have another DIMM to try.
I want to put Linux on it and so far have tried Debian 7 as well as Ubuntu 14 LTS.
I get the OS installed, it reboots, I can SSH in, all is well, until I unplug the VGA or HDMI.
Either way the computer eventually (after maybe 30 seconds) shuts off then powers back on and enters a reboot loop.
I have a strange issue, one I've never seen before.
Then immediately the computer completely wigs out.
The system will run stable for as long as I keep the displays plugged in.
