I tried re-flashing the DD-WRT firmware on the router (without resetting to factory default), but it didn't work.
The only way I could fix this issue was by resetting to factory defaults.
I had the same issue with a Buffalo WZR-HP-6300NH.
Here's what the Wireless Security page looks like:
Yesterday, I found that the 2.4 GHz network had become open and that the Shared Key field of Physical Interface ath0 was blank.
I tried to set the password manually using the nvram command, but the setting cleared after a reboot.
The build name and version doesn't match what's on the dd-wrt site but the build date does.
I've tried rebooting the router, choosing different combinations of Security Modes and WPA Algorithms with no luck.
I was then able to set the WPA shared key, and it remained after a reboot.
My network suddenly went down and came back up (I hadn't touched router settings in weeks, if not months).
After it came back up, it wouldn't keep the password on the wireless anymore, despite setting it, saving it and applying it.
I was able to fix this by going under Status > Wan clicking 'Release DCHP' then 'Renew DHCP' (I had saved my passkey but not clicked Apply).
I had two SSIDs setup (both with passwords, one was for guests and isolated from my private network), the second guest SSID worked fine, but I couldn't get the first private SSID to work again.
Finally, I went & cleared some old static host lease entries, and moved the newer one up to fill the blank spaces.
I had the same problem immediately after adding additional static host entries.
I've made so many customizations to this router that I'd hate to have to upgrade the firmware and reconfigure from scratch.
I've put the shared key back in and find that it usually disappears when I hit Apply but doesn't disappear if I click Save.
For some time, I've been using DD-WRT (DD-WRT v24-sp2 (06/14/11) std - build 17201) on a Netgear WNDR3700 v2 router.
