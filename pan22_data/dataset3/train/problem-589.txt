You might want to try resetting the power options (Change plan settings -> Restore default settings for this plan).
well i am using a hp pavalion gaming processor: i7 8750H and a gtx1050ti , moreover i also had this problem after hours of gaming my laptop onerheated and the performance got halfed ; but it is a normal problem which happens when your processor gets overheated , so not to worry in my case the performance came back after 10-15 hours ,just keep your pc shutdown it will recover fast from its problem of this speedlock ....
This solved the problem on my laptop also I couldn't see any difference with respect to the settings I had made before.
Applying the latest BIOS can also be a good solution.
Just make sure you have your battery in the laptop, and it is charged > 60%.
I experienced the same issue on my Lenovo Carbon X1 after upgrading to Windows 10.
I mean opening it, sucking dust with a vacuum cleaner, then with both vacuum cleaner and pressurized air.
It allows your CPU to downclock, go to 100%, and even turbo boost if needed.
Having a "balanced" power scheme is not the issue.
