However, there's nothing in /dev, and if I try to send with irsend I get hardware does not support sending.
I am able to use my old recorded lircd.config to send signals to my tv.
I have a IR led to pin 23 with a transistor, however there's nothing in /dev/lirc or /dev/lirc0

I use Lirc for my Smarthome with "fhem" to send signals to TV and to recieve signals from tv-remote to switch some lights.
Basically I'm trying to get an IR transmitter with lirc.
I'm using a RPi 3B running Raspbian Stretch with Linux raspberrypi 4.19.42-v7+ #1219 firmware.
Very new to this low-level driver stuff, so many places to make mistakes.
I don't know what other command dump you might need so just comment and I'll add to the question
Any link to any library with IR transmission would be appreciated too.
But I cant use ".lircrc" in the old way, to recieve signals.
and after adding this line to /boot/config.txt and rebooting
Update the following lines in /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf:
then added dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_out_pin=23,gpio_in_pin=22 to config.txt and changed lirc_options.conf to
NOTE: I was reading about gpio-ir however that seems to be receiver only.
