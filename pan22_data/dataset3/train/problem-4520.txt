But I've tried to cut down on some of the code so try this (obviously untested) and see if its faster and does the same thing :)
Use LINQ for your queries, which will also allow you to easily attempt Parallel LINQ.
Even if done right, it is often the case that you will have much better things to improve.
If you could comment your original code you would get a better response i'm sure
While I don't have time at the moment to look through the code at the moment (and due to the lack of comments) I can't give a broad answer but I can already note two things.
Just implement the IComparable interface on the priority object if it doesn't already.
You can replace two foreach loops in GetBookListByPriority where you're adding the whole sublist to a new list with these:
If you don't want to use LINQ as Steven suggests, have you considered a SortedList?
Its pretty unclear what the code does/needs to do.
This would give you the opportunity to use several cores for your query ... aka as increased speed.
