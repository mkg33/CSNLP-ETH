For that very reason, I suggest you rename it to size.
You should have always one space before and after a binary operator:
Kindly provide your suggestions on design, coding style and algorithm.
since JVM initializes integer fields to zero by default.
In almost all methods for example in this one instead of
For Java, more conventional way of writing blocks is
Below is my implementation of dynamic array without help of library functions.
You use positionPointer for keeping track of the number of elements in your data structure.
Also, it seems strange what you do in the case if index is invalid.
Also, conventional lists return the value -1 in case of missing element instead of throwing NoSuchElementException:
However, you must make sure that they are not negative either.
Because otherwise the first element will get you an error.
Omit the arraySize and use dynamicArray.length instead.
Above, if the index is correct, you basically set an element instead of adding it.
If the array contains a null value, if(dynamicArray[i].equals(element)) will throw.
