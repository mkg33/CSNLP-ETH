(this is because at last wp-config.php looks for config-default.php)
Same problem here, but with the following command any client in any network has it solved:
You have to set the url of your site during installation, and since it works from localhost, I would guess that's what you set it to.
On closer inspection, it may be that the setup-mysql script is responsible for creating those configuration files, it will be worth looking at what that script does.
It sounds like the flavor of Wordpress that you're using allows you to have a development configuration file that's read when it's accessed from localhost and other, "production" configuration files when accessed from different IP addresses.
Either way, it won't hurt you to have a read through wp-config.php to see how it's operating.
To remedy the problem quickly you could always copy config-localhost.php to config-192.168.2.119.php - just be aware that when it goes on a public server you'll need another configuration file for it's public facing IP as well.
