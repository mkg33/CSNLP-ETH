Next, I brought the buttons for the forwarding to the front.
You need to create Action Buttons (draw a box, click on it and go to Insert on Ribbon).
First, set the presentation to Kiosk Mode (Slide Show | Set Up Show)
I'm working on a presentation, I have a standard slide where you click to bring up bullet points on by one, however after all the bullet points have appeared I want the presenter to click one of two buttons to go to certain slides and do not want the next click to progress to the next slide.
I brought it to the front and hyperlinked it back to the same slide.
using Powerpoint 2016, i was able to accomplish what you're asking by selecting the transition tab at the top, and deselecting "On Mouse Click" in the Advance Slide pane...
The only hitch I see to this is that repeated clicking will reveal all of the text lines then cycle back to none showing, then one then two etc.
I have tried disabling mouse click to advance on the transition options but that also disables triggering the animations.
Kiosk mode will prevent the slide from advancing due to any random clicks, and your action button can advance to the next slide.
Next, add a rectangle that fills the slide, send it to back, format it to match the background or give it a 99% transparent fill so it disappears.
This may not answer your question fully however its too long for a comment...
So far the only downside I have found is that the cursor is always displaying the Pointing Hand.
In this section you can select hyperlink to... Slide... and select what slide the button should go to..
Select the text that's set to appear line by line and use the animation settings to have it Trigger on click of the rectangle you just inserted and sent to back.
Now when you click the slide (actually the rectangle), your text will appear, line by line.
I ended up using a "no-fill" shape the size of the slide.
now if you accidentally click on the screen (not one of the buttons) it will not jump to the next slide.
