This works in .htaccess, no http.conf access required.
That would also match things like .htaccess and .htpasswd inherently.
Btw, good changes are, your lithmus test for the two are:
For those looking to simply deny all "hidden" files and directories on a Linux distribution (generally all files beginning with a ".
Comment one of the two out, to ensure, the other works for you, too.
I always add the following line into vhost template
Personally, I like issuing 403s for such requests instead of 404s, but you could easily use a RewriteRule instead of auth denial, like so:
From a security angle, I prefer a bogus 404 over an 403, more informative to the attacker.
Just to be sure that no one can access VCS specific data.
And here's the older Apache 2.2 style (same regex, just different auth directives):
Assuming your webserver is using a different user than the one you use to access the .git repository, you could disable the execute bit for others on the .git directory.
To protect both the .git directory as well as other files such as .gitignore and .gitmodules using .htaccess, use:
Then you don't have to worry about .git or .svn specifically.
This should work with other webservers and doesn't rely on performance-consuming .htaccess files.
"), here's what works on Apache 2.4 when placed in server conf context:
