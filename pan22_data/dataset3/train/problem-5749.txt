With SQL Server 2008 you can go up to 64 cores and max 2TB RAM (on Windows 2008 R2).
With SQL 2008 R2 you can go up to 256 cores, but requires DataCenter edition.
Of course, you'll need some pretty serious IO subsystem to keep up with that.
VMware recommend starting with a smaller number of vCPUs and then increasing... also, make sure you are licenced for SQL - it's so easy with virtualisation to add more vCPUs, but forget to pay for them!
I'm not an expert on VMware but I think the max memory they support is 255GB, see Virtual machine memory limits and hardware versions

Watch out as you add more cores on a virtual platform - the cost of coordination means 8 vCPUs would give you quite a bit less processing power than on native physical.
