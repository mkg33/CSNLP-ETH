For imaging requirements, I'd highly recommend clonezilla for its' speed and broad compatibility with various storage setups, including NVMe drive support out of the box.
I've been using ubuntu in dual boot for a while now and it works great.
the best way to make a Dual-boot partition is to either:
Some vendors (such as Lenovo) may insist on having the OEM drive with the standard Windows installation it came with as a requirement prior to processing RMAs.
Although designed to preserve data, an error can mess up 1 or more OS installs.
That will depend on whether the original partition is overwritten or not.
Warning: You must back all important data before shrinking a partition.
Can I still restore Windows 7 or was recovery partition overwritten by ubuntu?
What the tool does is scan the partition table for deleted partitions and offers the option of restoring it.
If this system had a recovery partition, you may still be able to recover it via a tool such as cgsecurity's testdisk , with one caveat: Over-writing a partition table will result in the loss of the current partition table and its; partitions.
It's recommended that prior to an operation such as setting up dual boot and new installations, do image the drive so that you're able to restore it in case of disaster or warranty claims.
Usually, when you are asked for dual boot, have to choose a partition.
the chosen partition get formatted so Ubuntu can be installed on it.
I've got a new laptop and I want to bring my old x220 to factory settings.
If you see the program but are not able to run it, or you don't see it; then the partition is gone.
