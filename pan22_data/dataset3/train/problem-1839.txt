However, when i ran the below batch script, the output csv file was blank.
The batch program  wont properly handle a path or file name with a space unless you put quotes around it.
How do i correct this batch script so that i can see the contents in the output csv file generated using wireshark's tshark command?
Probably the problem is that you didnt enclose \program files  with quotes.
I have written a batch file that runs a tshark command to filter fields from a wireshark pcap file and write them to a csv file.
tshark -T fields -n -r "C:\Users\L33604\Desktop\SynFlood Sample.pcap" -E separator=, -e ip.src -e ip.dst > "C:\Users\L33604\Desktop\logcapture.txt"
I did the following to your batch program, and it assumes that the Wireshark directory is on the C: drive and that the logcapture and synflood sample files are where you report they are:
When i ran on the windows cmd CLI, i had to change the current working directory to the wireshark folder directory in the My Computer> Program Files, so i changed the current working directory in the batch file so that it would run the same way as i ran in the windows cmd CLI.
