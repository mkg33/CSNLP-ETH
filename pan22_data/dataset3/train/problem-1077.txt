I read in another post that the slowing down part could be because the indexing of the copied files fill up some sort of transfer buffer.
This time the speed jumped up to around 480MB/sec, but just for a short moment, then it declined down to around 30MB/sec again.
So I looked my problem up on google and found a method for getting higher speed.
I was getting really slow transfer speed of about 18 - 30MB/sec while moving (single)files to and from my computer; which is fitted with a Samsung EVO PRO SSD with 500GB storage capacity.
I went into my device manager, selected my external disk and went into properties/Policies and chose "Better performance" rather than "Quick removal (default)"
I have a Western Digital: My passport ultra external hard drive with a USB 3.0 connection.
If that is the case however, what is the point of having fast connections and devices?
I think the speed realistically should be somewhere around 150MB/sec since that is the read/write speed of the hard drive.
I would be really greatfull for any help I can get.
