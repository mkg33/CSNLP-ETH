I didn't see any errors during the first install, but it looks like some aspects failed anyway - most notably the missing /usr/local/nagios/bin directory.
systemd specifies the pid file it is looking for in /lib/systemd/system/nagios.service
This answer assumes you are installing using yum from EPEL.
If I create an empty pid file then try starting the service again I get an error saying it contains an invalid value, then it gets deleted.
Also interesting - I couldn't verify the Nagios config as suggested in those instructions because /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios doesn't exist.
Make sure the nagios user has permission to these files.
Having followed the instructions here http://linoxide.com/how-tos/install-configure-nagios-centos-7/ (but downloading Nagios 4.0.2 instead of 4.0.7 - I have to use that version), I have reached a point where the Nagios service won't start.
That is the file Nagios will create when it starts up.
Initially, the /var/nagios directory didn't exist, so I created it.
This needs to be the same as lock_file in your nagios.cfg, or systemd will timeout and stop your nagios service.
Older versions might use nagios.lock, or the path might be something like /usr/local/nagios/
The answer to this appeared to be re-running the various make install-* commands.
I've tried changing its owner to nagios and I've tried changing its owner to root.
After that service nagios start hangs for several minutes, then claims to have timed out.
If you install from source, the files may be in different locations but the ideas are the same.
If you want to see related messages to this issue, run fgrep 'systemd' messages | fgrep -i nagios from /var/log/
