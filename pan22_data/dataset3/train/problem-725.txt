Without that they will do no better than driver's education students will do with their eyes closed.
But if students do not learn right away that the whole point of programming is basically this mental game called symbolic thinking -- give a name to an arbitrary idea and then manipulate the contents of the name -- they will fail.
Perhaps it is because nothing else in the universe works this way, and so we do not encounter such things in our daily lives.
I don't understand why the idea of variables and assignment gives people so much trouble, but the evidence is in: it does.
If so, we need to dredge up some teletypes, or start ringing little bells in class.
One of my students the other day said in exasperation, "Everything is a variable!"
I learned the "Post Office Box Model" sitting in front of a teletype 40 years ago when I was in middle school.
Maybe the little 'ding' that the teletype made caused Pavlovian Conditioning, so that I just associated names with content and assignment of variables.
But there is no secret to this association, and no way around learning it.
I also do not know the best way to inculcate this understanding.
To a kid with a variable, everything is a program.
I just wanted to put in the word that before people expand their thinking toolbox, they need to have mastered the very first and most essential tool: the concept of named variables and mutability.
as if he expected that programming would turn out to be something else.
