As MarkM said, this is completely application dependant and hard to do.
If you are really that paranoid, you could always make an installation of Windows with an unattended file or a kickstart install of Linux and just reinstall your machine regularly.
I think the easiest way is to start a virtualmachine on a usb thumbdrive and then enable 'undo disk', and discarding the change every time you end the session.
Given the current virtualization technology this should not be a big performance penalty.
Ubuntu 10.04 also offers to encrypt your home directory on install.
For example, this link allows you to encrypt your home directory and swap partition with Luks (Linux Unified Key System).
You have to substitute "partition_name" with the mount point directory of that partition, and run it for each partition that may save personal data.
There are probably logs of it in dozens of places between the source on the Internet and your computer.
for linux most common culprit is .bash_history if you ask me
For Linux exists some ways to accomplish such a thing:
It is all completely application dependent and there are thousands of applications that could potentially store this type of data.
Be aware that deleting these things from your local machine doesn't mean much if it's illegal content you are concerned about.
Running the following script on shutdown will clear all unused space on a parition, including delete files:
You can address Linux privacy questions through encryption.
