However, I'd recommend using a micro controller for communication.
Something you make yourself would likely be over the Parallel port.
FYI this is how those lava lamp random number generators work, so there is good precedent.
If your goal is a "digital dice" hardware for use with physical games, then no pc is required.
On the other hand, if your goal is a PC game, it already has a perfectly good random number generator, and has no need of your hardware, and even
You could do an arms-length integration by using a web cam and image recognition to decide what number was rolled.
So, assuming this is just a cool science fair project, not a serious attempt to build hardware to be bought, sold, and used, I would think about packaging it as a USB device.
if your hardware were somehow useful, no existing application will know how to use it.
Additionally, a micro controller will allow you to easily expand to other types of control inputs and hardware outputs.
Many have USB connections and will allow you to interface with your existing circuit with a few changes.
Parallel port is nice, but hard to find on a modern pc, and windows has made its programming rather difficult since XP or so.
I'm quite sure you can connect a device like that on the Parallel port of a PC.
Get fancy and call it an "optical air interface" to make it sound official.
The program would read the value of the 4017 and the button.
You'll have to build an additional or different circuit to communicate with the PC.
Or you could connect a button and 6 diodes to the port and let the computer do the rolling and lighting.
