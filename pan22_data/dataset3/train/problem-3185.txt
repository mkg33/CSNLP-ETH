Also there shouldn't be allowed any byte streams (0x numbers) that can be converted to avoid many dictionary checks especially if the exec commands are forgotten from the dictionary.
Returns admin and the technique of adding characters together in that manner can be used in WHERE without having to use quotations.
And if it is a web application, make sure you check this server side and not client side.
So basically - you'll have to build your query, and right before sending it to the database, verify that it's not doing anything you don't want it to by matching it up against SQL Keywords, but there are a good number of things to check.
So make sure stuff like select, exec (all variations), convert, union, drop, truncate and pretty much any dangerous keywords in any upper/lower case combination, so on are not in the user string.
The normal way is to make sure that the various keywords from SQL aren't permitted in the string the user enters.
It's pretty much the best advice I can give if you cannot use parameters.
