(Not sure how to determine if it is a child table or parent table but I assume it is a child table)
I learned what cluster index and non-cluster index are but couldn’t find a solid document that tells me if applying unique cluster index can impact other related tables or not?
I appreciate your help in advanced and will be grateful if you can point me to any link to learn more about this subject.
I have run DBCC CHECK DB for my current database and I see there is issues with the indexes.
I have a Database that the earliest solid backup file I can see without any corruption belongs to 7 months ago.
I am very new to the world of DB maintenance and recently ran to an issue that will appreciate your advice on.
My question is this: is it possible to break the records in child/parent tables relationship with applying “unique cluster index”?
Be aware that creating a new unique index will of course fail if duplicate keys exist.
Creating a new index, clustered or not, will not break existing foreign key relationships.
When I do a compare between what has changed in database I realized that someone added a “Unique cluster index” to a child table.
