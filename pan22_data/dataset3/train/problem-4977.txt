The Dell switches support VLANs and I can configure each port in the VLAN to Layer 2 or Layer 3.
Basicly, you need "someone" who make the L3 routing between these two networks.
I have one network cable run from the .20.x switch to the .80.x switch currently and have them both setup with a subnet of 255.255.0.0 and I can see the other computers, I just can't access shares or ping anything.
Now you are able to communicate a host in the VLAN 20 with a host in the VLAN 80 (assuming you have set up correct ip, mask and gateway on the hosts).
I would like the ability to access shares, ping, etc from computers on the .20.x network to computers on the .80.x network.
I have two separate networks, a 192.168.20.x and a 192.168.80.x each on their own Dell X1026 Switch in Layer 2 mode.
Is this feasible with the hardware that I have on hand?
interface g1/0/1 (port where the host is attached)
You are in a very early stage in network knowledge ;).
This someone can be the switch working in L3 mode.
Each computer currently has the gateway set to the IP for its respective switch (192.168.20.1 and 192.168.80.1).
Ok, i'll try to summarize it the actions needed and the command associated.
As far as I can remember, the X1000 series come in unmanaged mode and you need to do some trick with the front button to transform it in managed mode (and gain ability to create vlans an so on).
