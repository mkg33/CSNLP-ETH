If more than one 802.11 AP in range is publishing the same network name (with the same security mode), the 802.11 standard leaves it up to the client to decide which to join.
So, in answer to Question 2, I'd recommend turning off the N300's Wi-Fi if the AC router can cover the whole house, so that nothing accidentally joins the N300.
It seems to me that 4x4 is failing to catch on in the client market, because with the trend toward aluminum, thin & light laptops, there's just not enough room inside the laptop for 4 Wi-Fi antennas (plus Bluetooth, etc.).
I could see some sense in getting a so-called "tri-band" router in order to keep the slowpokes out of the fast lane, but I recommend against the models that do 4x4.
Going from 1750 to 1900 means it supports a nonstandard 600Mbps mode in 2.4GHz, which few client devices support (and why would you bother when you can do 1300 in 5GHz?).
The second AC radio is usually billed as allowing you to put your good/fast 3-stream AC stuff on one radio on a good channel, and put your lamer 1-spatial-stream (or 5GHz N or 802.11a) devices on the other radio on some other channel, where the slowpokes can't waste the airtime the fast devices want to use.
I think the main path the industry will take toward higher Wi-Fi speeds will be 802.11ax, not 4x4 AC or 802.11ad.
It's even left as an implementation detail; the standard does not specify how the client should decide.
I suppose you could leave it enabled, but give it a different network name so you don't join it accidentally.
As for Question 3: Routers with higher numbers than 1750 aren't necessarily worth the extra expense.
So don't bother paying for 4x4 unless you buy tank-like bulky "gaming" laptops, or you have a desktop PC you don't want to pull Ethernet cable to.
In my experience, most clients just use the naive algorithm of joining whichever network has the stronger signal.
Going above 1900 either means it supports 4x4:4 (4 spatial streams) rates, which most clients don't support (most AC clients only support up to 3 spatial streams), or it means it has a second 5GHz 1300Mbps AC radio.
These are called "tri-band" routers (even though two of the radios work in the 5GHz band).
