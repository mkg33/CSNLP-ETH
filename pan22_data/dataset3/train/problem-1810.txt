From your question it sounds like you're not aware that you can change the Screen Buffer Size for the command window in Windows?
From the Network and Sharing Center, click "Manage network Adapters" or similar - this will show the network connections folder.
If you double click on a connection, you'll see the same output as ipconfig in a gui.
This gives you a scroll bar at the side of the window that you can use to scroll back up to view info that's scrolled off the top of the window.
You can also view that information in the Network and Sharing Center.
When I tried this solution to check the dhcp address, it wouldn't update the status until ipconfig was issued.
On the console window click the icon at the left of the title bar (or just right-click the title bar) select Defaults, click the Layout tab, change the Screen Buffer Size Height to something quite a few times larger than the Window Size Height (mine are currently 25 lines height for the window, but 300 lines for the screen buffer height).
Replace "ip" in the command by "ipv6" to get IPv6 information.
just a sidenote: This doesn't reflect the current state.
This lets you select text in the command window with the mouse, then just hit Enter to send it to the clipboard, and just right click on the console window to paste (obviously don't switch this on if you use any console apps that use the mouse).
I have a TON of adapters so ipconfig by itself was a pain.
I installed Gnu Grep for windows and then modified my path so I could run grep from anywhere
The other very useful option that I always change on a new install are switching on QuickEdit Mode on the first tab.
It's not as short as ipconfig, but you can use netsh to do this:
Can't remember if this was on by default for Vista or not, but for XP and prior you definitely had to go in and manually change it to something sensible yourself.
