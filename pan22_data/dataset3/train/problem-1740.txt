The best approach is to collect daily metrics from all your production instances and compare the numbers.
For example, if you had an email server, you could determine if it was fielding any requests from the email application on it.
Things of course get more complicated with collocated services on a single node.
If it isn't, and that's the only thing on there, then it's idle.
I don't think any of the metrics you've listed are really good indicators of activity or inactivity since there are so many ways to get 'false positives', depending on what you're looking for.
A machine is idle when it's not performing the task it's supposed to perform for lack of requests.
You want all your servers to be operating in the sweet spot of not to high, yet not too low thus to maximize your overall perforamnce.
If I had no other information and I needed to determine is a server was idle I would check to see which services were installed/running and then log some network activity specifically targeting those services.
What operating system is it and what is/was the server's purpose?
You may have some workloads that you can distribute across your server farm more evenly thus, giving you a overall lower load average.
If you can remove it from you infrastructure / network with no impact on any services then I would consider that server as idle.
If you want to tell me which OS you're using and what the purpose of the server is/was (if you know) I can edit my answer and provide you with more information.
For a file server you can check for recently modified/accessed files.
an antivirus program could use CPU cycles or the disk could be full of unused files.
Windows has the performance monitor for monitoring general network activity, and many built in counters of active sessions for various services.
In general, if you can pull the power and nobody cares then it's idle.
