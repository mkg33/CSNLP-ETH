Games that load levels completely may initially load a bit faster but I would expect them to have no real benefit after that.
The amount of ram won't help as much, what sort of games are you playing?
If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, you can add as much RAM as your machine can hold.
8gb are enough, and I don't think you will see any improvement over this quantity (modern games usually use 2/3 gb of ram).
Windows is very cache happy and will expand the disk cache to use all the available (free) RAM if there is no pressing need from applications, up to the amount that your edition of Windows can use.
For typical users, there is essentially no benefit for amounts over 8GB.
Windows 7 Home Premium can use up to 16GB, Ultimate can use up to 128GB.
I have 12GB of RAM and I do notice a difference in loading times from 6GB on large "open world" games like Skyrim.
Windows will use all RAM that's not being used for something more important as a disk cache.
Remember that it's an huge quantity of memory, and you (probably) won't need it unless you use  some specific software (video render, server applications).
Traveling between areas is noticeably faster as it is already in the cache though with a fast hard disk the differences in speed is quite small.
I would strongly suggest upgrading to a dedicated graphics card.
For playing video games all you need is a good graphics card (basically).
On a 12GB system with Windows 8 I have seen the disk cache get up to 9.8GB, the remainder being apps I was using.
If you're running a x64 version of Windows7, you can use 16gb of ram.
