As the console would become sluggish when the machine was very busy the main use of the speaker was to allow the operator to check whether a job was progressing (the sound would usually vary) or stuck.
While this research used jungle sounds instead of white noise, the idea is the same.
I first heard this story in 1985 from a couple of sysadmins.

When this was turned up the audio output was indicative of the work the CPU was doing.
Solaris has an option to snoop ( the equivalent of tcpdump ) which produced some audio when a packet was sent or received.
I played with this a while back to "listen" to my mysql servers pagecache utilization : )
The console (a Teletype, if you have ever seen such a thing) had a small speaker and a volume control.
During the LISA 2000 (Large Installations System Administration) conference, Michael Gilfix and Alva Couch presented a paper: Peep (The Network Auralizer): Monitoring Your Network With Sound (PDF).
Slightly different details, but still the same story.
This was certainly possible, and used, on at least some makes of older mainframes (1970s, early 1980s).
Much of the work was off-line batch work and with practice it was possible to recognise certain distinctive 'signatures' of some jobs in normal mode and the shrill whine of a job in a loop.
I guess if you are alive long enough, all things will be new again.
On the lighter side, it also allowed jobs to be written to create certain signatures, for example a, somewhat atonal but recognisable, "Jingle Bells".
