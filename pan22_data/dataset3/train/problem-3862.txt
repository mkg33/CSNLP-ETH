And if you need to do the same thing on a Windows host, you can follow the instructions found in this post: https://www.pingzic.net/how-to-enable-loopback-adapter-in-windows-10/
On Server 2, I have tried this policy to rewrite the destination IP of the incoming packets:
Server 1 and Server 2 (Centos 7) both host the same application, which listens on UDP port 1514.
After you have added the adapter, you can select the adapter in the typical network adapter control panel and apply a static IP of your choice to make the IP a live, active IP on the server, but not actually respond to traffic at that IP on a live network outside of this server.
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp -d 10.88.72.41 --dport 1514 -j NETMAP --10.88.72.40
The goal is for the application on Server 2 to receive a copy of this traffic.
A tcpdump on Server 2 reveals all of the traffic coming in; HOWEVER, the destination IP is still 10.88.72.41, so the listening application does not detect the traffic.
On Server 1 I have tried similar commands to rewrite (or DNAT) the destination IP of the outgoing packets.
I have been working on this for days - if you can solve it I will be eternally grateful!
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i ens160 -p udp --dport 1514 -j TEE --gateway 10.88.72.40 [server 2]
Please help me find a solution so that the application on the second server can detect this traffic.
Server 1 uses iptables to duplicate traffic on UDP 1514 and send it to Server 2:
