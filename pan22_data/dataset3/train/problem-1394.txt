The settings from that file should have been restored successfully.
For this we will create a rule file of our liking that matches the camera.
The file can be called /etc/udev/rules.d/99-v4l2-default-settings.rules and contain something like this:
Once you get it working like that, it's time to automate it with udev.
Move camera-settings.txt to the specified directory, unplug and plug again.
First, we need a programatic (script-friendly) way to set these settings.
First the bad news: There is currently no built-in solution to do that in any distro I know.
The above will run as root the script /etc/camera-defaults/udev-hook.sh  that we will soon create whenever a device of subsystem video4linux whose manufacturer name is "HD Pro Webcam C920" is detected or unplugged.
Any time in the future you need to save your settings permanently, use your favorite program to tweak them and then run:
The good news is that such a solution is very easy to implement and can be adapted for many similar problems: we only need to use a bit of udev and bash.
My favorite is v4l2ctrl, as it can save V4L2 configurations and then restore them on demand.
You can use udevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/video0) to get all possible variables for the device, as well as for its parent devices.
