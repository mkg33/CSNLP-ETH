my PSU is rated at 36A on 12V, so it will be fine at least up to 480W when measured at the wall socket (36A*12V*0.90).
when you only use the browser or watch a movie which should translate to 50..80W for your hardware).
With full CPU load alone it needs approximately 280W.
The power rating of a PSU refers to a combined power scenario of all voltages it can deliver.
Not only are lower rated PSUs typically less expensive but they are actually more efficient at typical idle loads since the 80+ rating doesn't require a minimum efficiency below 20% load and thus the efficiency far below 20% is usually much worse than what you would expect with the given 80+ rating even for high quality PSUs.
The 0.90 factor accounts for the 90% efficiency at full load.
Some PSUs still use a multi-rail 12V design which can be problematic as it drastically limits the 12V supply to individual components, and I would recommend to look for a single rail PSU instead.
You should calculate with at least 10W per mechanical hard disk or optical drive and at least 5W for every extra SSD or fan.
I have recently built a very similar setup with a i7-4790k, a GTX-970, 32 GB DDR-3 2400 RAM, a m2 SSD and 6 fans on a ASUS Z97-Deluxe Board.
This means that a comparatively cheap 450W 80+ Bronze PSU may well draw less power from the wall socket than a much more expensive 750W Gold PSU whenever the computer is not really busy (i.e.
Single rail PSUs have only one 12V power rating, i.e.
I actually tried to set up this board and the CPU with a older 750W quad-rail PSU (4x14A) at first and I didn't get it stable with overclocking while it was no problem when I connected it to the 450W single rail PSU.
I would recommend not to use a much more powerful than needed PSU if you already know that you will not even need that much power in the future.
36A, while multi-rail PSUs are usually rated as 18A+18A or 2x18A or similar.
The CPU is overclocked to 4x 4.5 GHz (~1.25V) and I run it with a 450W 80+ Gold PSU (the cute little SFX device from Silverstone).
This may not be the combination that your system needs.
450W is plenty for this combination if you don't plan to add another GPU or a large RAID-Array in the future.
A typical system with current components consumes almost all it's power from the 12V supply, so you should look for a PSU that can deliver a sufficiently high output at 12V alone already.
I think a non overclocked CPU might need at least 70W less.
I measured the system with a power meter and it draws up to 430W from the wall socket when I run Prime64 and Furmark simultaneously.
