To answer your question - without fine tuning it is safe to assume that yes, you will get these 12% performance in the same single-threaded benchmark at (approximately) no additional power cost.
As a matter of fact, the typical power consunmption of the 6920HQ is 36.56W, same as the 6820HQ.
The reason is that when supplied with the same amount of power and same current, the better chip of the bin (branded the 6920HQ) runs stable at a higher clock speed.
Intel and AMD have different actual definitions as to TDP.
The TDP means Thermal Design Power (or sometimes seen as Thermal Dissipation Power, but rarely in computers) and does not specify the consumption of the processor, but the cooler's capacity to dissipate heat away from the chip/surface it cools.
Although it provides a rough estimate about the power draw of the processor, it doesn't necessarily mean so.
Generally, this is the same chip but a different bin - the better chip runs at a higher frequency while fitting in the same power envelope (36.56W typical).
