You can even run a Windows or other OS on the appliance while it is doing teh WAN acceleration task
It's an etl tool with job level scheduling functionality and a remote server agent.
Also allows AV at gateway and management of data "leakage"  Downside is the license fees but they work great
Pentaho Data Integration is probably my favorite tool ever.
I didn't use that many appliances, but of the few I used I liked pfSense.
I really like mailcleaner - great spam filtering "appliance" that is easy to configure and opensource.
esva / global domination anti spam filter, works really great, but project is not so much alive as one could hope for.
Oh, and because it's open source and extremely well coded, it's pretty trivial to add new features that can do just about anything.
For WAN acceleration Riverbed Steelhead appliance are great.
Also provide a platform for branch servcies like print, DNS, DHCP and other more advanced applications.
I've used it to move data, manage processes, schedule regular running jobs, send myself reminder emails.
