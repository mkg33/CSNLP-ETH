a top down map or an isometric map is a grid with small square images placed into position.
Throughout the internet there are a ton of tutorials on isometric map development and top down map development.
I recently bought the book from Apress and have worked my way through it, unfortunately, it seems to just be dealing with side scrolling games and not Zelda-like top down games.
you could also wander about and find this post on dreamincode
private int map[][] = {{1,1,1,1},{0,0,0,0},{1,1,0,0},{1,1,1,1}};

Using the engine in their book, how can I make a tile map easily that has walls and things like that?
I was wondering if anyone out there can tell me if it's possible to use their engine to create such a game?
to create a 2d data structure, assign the numeric value in the 2d array with an associated image, by looping through the 2d array and saying if the current position in the 2d array is a 1 or a 0 or any number or a character or a string or an object type (that also includes using Rectangle, for the use of defining square boundaries (useful in basic collision detection))
It doesn't go into how to build a top down tile map.
