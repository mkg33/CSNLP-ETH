If you don't mind all traffic to a set of addresses going over that particular network card then you can create a static route using the route command to do this.
I had this issue with two disparit networks and I was connected to both of them, but needed certain websites to use certain NICs (it was a stupid setup).
Windows are not really meant to have two default gateways.
If you've got some weird requirement to ping the website or upload files to it via FTP or SMB from one network card while accessing it via HTTP with the other network card then 1) You're boned and 2) I feel very sorry for you.
This is not a feature available to web browsers (not in Windows or, afaik, OSX anyway).
You need to make sure only one of your network cards has a default gateway.
Basically, find out the IP address of the website you want to resolve over each nic, then in the command prompt, enter:
Since that defies the nature of default gateway (aka the place you go to get routed if the resource you want isn't on your local network.
To make it persistant, put a -p on the end of the command.
You should familiriaze yourself with the notion of routing and use the route command.
Worth noting with this method though the route will be deleted next time you restart.
This is not really a question for Stack Overflow, but.. one way I can think of doing this is adding a route specific to the IP that site is hosted on.
You then need to set up your subnet masking on each of the two networks correctly, so that you can see the resources local to each that you need.
