It's a weird oversight but nonetheless, hope this helps.
As suggested in some similar technet forums you might be having this issue because the administrators group is the only group that has permissions on the folder of those applications.
I need to remove some junkware and install some useful programs for the user.
So, basically, he was never able to add or remove software.
Make sure that the "Domain Admins" group is present in the local Administrators group.
I went into active directory and I didn't notice anything different between this PC and the others.
It has the same security options checked and it is in the same group as the others.
When I try to run a program as an admin, it asks for my username and password.
You could try turning off UAC temporarily, or using the work-around that involves creating a second group, granting  it permissions to the folders affected and adding your users to that group.
After I hit enter, I get the same message: "The requested operation requires elevation"
I have worked here for a couple years but I just took over this role last month.
I started a remote session with the local admin account domain\administrator, then went to "manage user accounts," where my domain admin account was set to "remote user" and so I changed it to "administrators" instead.
The PC is running windows 8 just like the other ones.
How come this one PC is not recognizing me as an admin?
I had the same problem on a server of mine, do you know the local admin password?
Now, when I remote in using my domain admin account I have admin privileges.
I keep getting the message "The requested operation requires elevation".
