I don't think tasklist.exe is going to give you the output you want so you will need to use sysinternals pslist.exe as another commenter suggested.
I specifically do not want to logon via RDP or such like and preferably using tools that come with WinXP.
The thing I found helpful was being able to remotely restart the device, and get CPU usage alerts and emails when certain CPU threshold or peak is reached.
Apart from that i would really consider this program.
The best functionality i saw was the ability to log off and shut computers down.
Ive been now trying the Remote Process Explorer that Roy posted and i have to say that im impressed.
Is it possible to view a remote computers "Task Manager" information locally?
I'd like to be able to see the process list of a remote XP computer in the same sort of format as "Windows Task Manager" gives, so that it's possible to see which process specifically is taking up what percentage of processor time.
Although not meant for monitoring remote Windows PCs, but if anyone is interested in monitoring Windows Embedded Compact devices (or WinCE devices) from their PC remotely, the Remote Task Monitor is a good option.
It's also be useful to be able to kill a process remotely without having to sue PSKill or such like.
The only thing that i couldt really manage to do was to run a process, the process run but for some reason it doesnt pop on the users screen.
You can use tasklist that comes with Windows (I think not available in home edition).
I understand that "tasklist" can show processes, performance manager can show cpu %, but they don't really marry up.
You can also use pskill.exe instead of taskkill.exe.
You can use taskkill.exe to kill a process on a remote Windows system.
Tubs commented that is not realtime view, but its very very close to it, you can choose the refresh time according to the priority of the process (high, every 2 secs, etc.)
