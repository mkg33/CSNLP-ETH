This electricity is connected to several things - one of them is the computer's power switch.
My reasoning is that under hibernation, the essential hardware (CPU and RAM, but also expansions such as network and TV tuners) are actually powered off, so there is no way to trigger a power-on.
If you notice, the power switch is connected NOT to your power supply, but to your mainboard, so obviously there has to be power there.
The only way to really power off a computer is to turn off the switch on the back - that is the power supply's ON?OFF switch - that or pull the power cord.
The system wakes from hibernate up to record shows, execute scheduled tasks and performs backups just as my other hosts which use standby instead.
I would expect that it can wake from Standby (ACPI S3) but not from Hibernate (ACPI S4).
I have confirmed Media Center in Windows 7 does wake-up to record shows from hibernate (S4) if your motherboard supports it.
Even in S5 ("powered off") - if you open your PC case, most mainboards have a small LED to show you that they are still receiving power.
Besides, the extra power saved between standby and hibernate would be negligible, likely no more than 2 Watts difference.
The power isn't coming from the clock's battery - it only powers the RTC - Real Time Clock.
You'd be doing just as well using standby, and your machine will resume faster as well.
(2 Watt can amount to something over a year, but consider if it's worth it to you.)
My motherboard doesn't support S3 (suspend-to-RAM) so got stuck using hibernate instead.
When we say we "power off" the computer, this isn't technically true.
The short answer is that the mainboard (motherboard for women, fatherboard of men) still receives power.
Whether it works or not seems to be a function of the motherboard, but in general it should wake up.
According to this thread it works for some people and not for others.
