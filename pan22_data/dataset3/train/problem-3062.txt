If you don't have the RDS role installed and don't have valid/activated RDS client access licenses and these users are connecting to the server for anything other than remote administration of the server then you are in violation of the EULA.
Is there a way to configure the remote server to invoke local email default client?
In a local environment, when sending an email, it opens a new email from Outlook, with some pre-filled text and attachments.
As such, you can install Outlook on the server and each user will have their own Outlook profile and will be able to use their own individual email address.
I have a cloud server on Azure and I connect via Remote Desktop (with gateway).
If this server has the RDS role installed and you have valid/activated RDS client access licenses then each user will have their own session on the server when they launch the RemoteApp.
I have no mail client on the server, and I don't want to have any, since many different users should be able to use the same server (each one has a different email address and email configuration).
