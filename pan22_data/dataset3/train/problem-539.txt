In the photograph it looks like there might be some slack inside the wall.
Can you pull out a little more and read what's printed on the cable jacket?
Cat5 -  five twists per inch.supports 10/100 ethernet.
You won't be able to tell the type of cable by its physical properties without extracting a sample and measuring things like wire gauge and twist lengths.
It may be possible to physically examine the cable without disconnecting the phone line by unscrewing the jack plate from the wall and pulling it out.
You may be interested to know that only two pairs are used for data transfer, the others are POE.
The phone line should be able to stay plugged in the whole time.
Cat5e-  five twists per inch; pairs are also twisted around each other.support 10/100/1000 ethernet**
I've never tried it, but apparently you can network two computers over a single cable using only pins 1-3 and 6 on your plugs.
Easiest way to tell cat5 and cat 5e apart is to look at the number of twists in the green pair.
Whoever installed it probably had some slack leftover (~6 inches), which will be stuffed into the wall behind the plate.
You should be able to carefully extract some of the slack to see whether or not you can find the manufacturer's markings on it.
If the green pair has the same number of twists as the orange and blue pairs, then it's cat5e, if it has the same number of twists as the brown pair, then it's cat5.
Are there multiple runs terminated at one end in a common box?
