Are other people kicking your job out of the queue?
The status of the printer will be shown as either "Printer: Ready" or "Printer: Offline".
This action will change the printer from online to offline.
To set the printer offline, double-click the icon of the printer in Devices & Printers.
I have looked through all of the Printer Properties and Properties (right-clicked on printer in Devices and Printers) to no avail.
Then select 'Pause Printing' from the Printer menu.
That is when the printer and PC have lost communication with each other due to a network error, a sharing error or the printer simply being off.
Click on "Printer: Ready" and the Printer menu will appear.
I am working on an application that prints large reports.
A dropdown menu will open with a list of several items.
From the same menu you can also pause and restart individual documents.
This is a setting that allows you to hold print jobs in your local PC print queue until you decide to release them.
Is there a way to set a printer offline so the report pages remain in the print-spool?
Click the Advanced tab and tick "Keep printed document"
Right click on the printer and select 'See what's printing'
Right click on the printer you want to use offline and select 'See what's printing'
If you open that menu again it will have a check beside "use printer offline".
The spool should give you priority until the job is complete.
Note: This is not the same as the printer being offline.
Click the Printer menu, and then click Pause Printing.
To stop printing, select the printer in Devices & Printers, then click See what's printing on the command bar.
To keep the job in the queue listing after it's been printed, go to Printer Properties.
Click on "Printer" in the menu bar and tick "Use Printer Offline."
