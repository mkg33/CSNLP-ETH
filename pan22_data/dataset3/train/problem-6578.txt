From what I can gather, the SD card consists of a single FAT partition, which is synced with the cloud when you take a photo, ie you can't flash a OS onto it and it doesn't allow arbitrary WiFi traffic.
There are now less restrictive WiFi SD cards like Toshiba's FlashAir.
At best it falls in the category of things to try if you already have one of these cards, or plan on buying one for the intended use in a camera.
That "memory" controller probably boot up wifi chip since it got access to flash and I'm sure there is some part of flash which is not used for FAT data partition
However what you could do with it would be limited, and there is a lack of documentation.
Ironically, the SDIO specification would allow the type of device you're looking for, but I don't know of any company that's bothered to produce such a device.
You probably could make a distribution which would run atop a FAT filesystem and store data of interest in what look like new camera images.
My guess would be that the Wifi part of the card is controlled by its own microchip and isn't accessible from a card reader/computer.
They are designed to provide an ftp server type function for digital cameras and use embedded technology to achieve this.
However, as far as I know, none of them provide a direct interface to the SD host device.
SDIO devices are scarce in general as USB has taken over that function.
If there are issues getting this to work as the root device, a simplification might be to connect it as a secondary one with a usb-sd adapter.
I believe wifi adapters are available quite inexpensively.
It probably reads a settings file configured by the windows application, which automatically does the Wifi bit as a stand-alone process, not interfaced against the SD card pinout at all.
