Placing your cursor to the left of the actual numerical data and pressing 'backspace' about 4 times deletes those unwanted characters.
By doing that for each cell in a row, the row will be reduced back to just one line as would normally be expected (i.e.
this appears to eliminate all the non-visible characters reducing the row height and properly left-align the numbers.
I assume that the problem could also be described as there are non-visible characters in each cell prior to the actual numerical data and that results in the cell being 2 rows high instead of just one.
I have found a quicker method is to simply select all the numerical cells in the table that was pasted into the email message and click on the text center button (or type Ctrl-E) followed by the text right button (or type Ctrl-R).
the method I just described is the way in which I used to resolve this problem, but when there are many numerical cells in the table, this becomes quite tedious.
I had the same problem: when I copy & paste Excel tables into Outlook emails it sometimes keeps formats but sometimes (on a random basis?)
Sometimes I copy a part of an microsoft excel file to microsoft outlook, the format is ok, but sometimes it's wrong -- there are extra white spaces before the content of each cell so that it looks like for each row in excel, after pasting to outlook there's an extra row.
Yes, for this you need outlook client on your local machine.
I usually copy the table from excel and paste into outlook client and then copy from the client and paste into the web outlook.
I realized pasting the Excel table in a brand new e-mail works fine (i.e.
then only I copy the whole thing again and paste it into my Outlook.
