I am very much afraid that, "There are many possibilities that mac will crash"
"I want to back up entire mac os partition in which mac os is installed."
This detailed step-by-step process will give you a perfect byte-for-byte copy of your hard drive.
( Just because I want to perform R & D and many experiments with os, yes I also want to learn mac os application development & iPhone application development - the main reason is I can't afford the original mac, right now.)
Right now, my AMD PC is perfectly on going with iDeneb & windows.
Best of all it's 100% FREE and uses tools that come pre-installed on your mac
I am accepting that - I have installed iDeneb to my personal pc at home.
I'm not sure if these tools will recognize the Mac HFS+J format and do what I guess you'd call a "thin" or "sparse" image, but at the very least you could perform a block-level/"raw" backup, though it will be bigger.
But, like fideli recommends, try CCC or SuperDuper!
But, I still want to continue with - patched system - just because I am making experiments & I am learning not earning.
Please inform me by comments if any information is missing or needed.
The rest of the details here just explain the process and help you gain some confidence you're making the right moves.
( Multiple hardDisk & Multiple boots - while booting - I just give more priority to the hardDisk - to which I want to launch).
It may look like a bit of work, but it actually comes down to one command that does the copy.
If all else fails, you could use a PC disk cloning tool like Ghost, CloneZilla (free), or TrueImage (my favorite) to back up the Mac partition, or even the whole disk.
You can then use the same tool to restore the image back to the disk if something goes sideways in the future.
