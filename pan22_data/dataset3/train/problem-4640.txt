The task scheduler can start an app based various types of triggers, including Event Log entries.
When specifying the path for Notepad.exe, the Task was created successfully; when I changed the path to the one of the program I was intending to use, I always got An event filter for a trigger is not valid error when pressing OK at the end of the task creation.
Also, I want it to start when I click a link in my browser that starts a program (like "view in iTunes on the iTune website).
Now you just need to add the application you want to cause the trigger.
Consider that the event filter looks exactly like Paul's (I generated it myself following his procedure) with the exception that my program sitted in the Program Files (x86) folder.
Now, if you start any application, if you look in Event Viewer / Security Log you will see a Process Creation event 4688 each time an application is started.
Click Ok for this, then Ok to close the trigger dialog box.
For example, this one uses notepad.exe as the trigger:
Now Switch to the XML tab, and enable edit query manually
Now choose the Action tab, and create a new action, that is Start a Program, and browse to the app you want to start along with the trigger application.
So all we need is to ensure an event is created whenever an application starts, and then create a scheduled task to start whenever the event is logged.
I want a program to start each time another one is starting.
I am sure that Paul's answer above might work for most of people, however for some reason I could not get it to work with my program.
Here's an example: Each time I start Google Chrome, I would like iTunes to start at the same time.
However another more generic way, and far more complex, is to use the Task Scheduler.
You could probably set up specific pairs of apps to run using the registry, and altering what deals with mimetypes.
I eventually solved my problem by installing an external software, Bill's Process Manager.
