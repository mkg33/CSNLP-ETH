Make another admin account on your mac, and use it's terminal to delete or mv your broken .bash_profile file.
open any Graphical editor and open your .bash_profile file and delete out your alias or whatever is causing the terminal process to exit.
Open terminal preferences, and in the general tab set "shells open with" to /bin/csh.
Or If you don't want to use any of the graphical methods then try remote login on that system from another system and specify login shell other than bash and edit your .bash_profile(e.g use ssh -t).
I added an alias to my ~/.bash_profile file, and now every time I open terminal, it displays the following:
You can create a new user and login from that user and edit your .bash_profile , (/user/your_username/.bash_profile).
You should now be able to open a new terminal window, rm ~/.bash_profile, and switch back to bash.
And then I am not allowed to type anything into terminal.
How can I restore the previous terminal functionality?
Or boot in single user mode and do it from there (after mount -uw / of course).
I would like to take the alias out of my ~/.bash_profile file, but don't know how because I can't get to the file through terminal.
