You can, however, export these ratings to an XML file in the MediaMonkey format which looks like this:
now as you can see there are a few folders (with dates as names) where the music files are stored.
Inside playerpro you can have playlists spanning multiple folders and PlayerPro uses files to save this information.
Now I would like to move the songs from each playlist to it's own folder, with the name of the playlist being the name of the folder.
I'd like to apply these rating values to the windows rating system for mp3's (the ones which show up in windows media player).
I'm looking ti import my music library which is on my phone on to my computer.
These ratings are not stored in a file however but in an "internal Database" which can't be accessed through the filesystem on android.
A major problem is that there is no filename stored here but only an artist and title entry.
On my phone I use playerpro as my musicplayer and I've rated/sorted my music via there.
I've tried importing this file into MediaMonkey however it's unable to import any information for any song.
Also the ablum entry is actually the folder in which the file is.
Are there any scripts/programs to automate the process for adding ratings to the files and then making the folders from the playlist files?
