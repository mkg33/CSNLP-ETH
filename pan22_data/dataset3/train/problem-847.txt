There are plenty of other light-weight web servers around.
Unfortunately, if I am not able to run java/Tomcat on it until I increase the memory.
Install and configure the Rails apps first, because thats where most of your memory will go.
You'd have to make sure you limited your rails apps to about one instance each and ran Php as fcgi ... then it might just work.
Manually configuring a small VPS isn't really too hard or time-consuming, especially if you use Google Apps to host your email and use your registrar's name servers.
If the provider uses OpenVZ/VServer, you will be able to save several tens of MB of memory from running the Linux kernel.
With 256Mb I can comfortably run Apache on CentOS with PHP.
Just cPanel alone will probably eat more memory than everything else combined.
However, if it uses something like Xen, you will need to spend some memory on the Linux kernel.
I'd go out on a limb and say you'd be pushing the limits of that vps, but its doable.
But I'm with alberge ... just go to linode.com and rent a 360MB linode ($20/month) and start setting up stuff to see how it goes ...
You can also try lighttpd and I think that many RoR sites use it.
