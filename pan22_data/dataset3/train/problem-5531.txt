As the data pins of the micro USB port are not connected to the SoC's USB PHY you cannot use this port for data (in either host or slave mode).
Pulse Audio is a Sound Server which offers network transparency.
A lot of work has been done since the time the question was asked.
Using some Rasberry Pi models as a USB peripheral device (e.g.
mass storage, serial, ethernet, keyboard, mouse) is now possible.
The least-expensive solution is to use the Pi Zero.
As the Model A has a female host USB port, a HOST to HOST conversion cable will be needed.
So you can play sound files on your PC and hear them with speakers connected to your Raspberry Pi.
You could do a simple network connection from your PC to the Raspberry Pi and use Pulse Audio to transfer sound over the network.
Keyboard, mouse, flash drive, camera, whatever you can think of.
It should be possible however to use the USB Type A port on the Model A in slave mode.
However, as the Model A does not have this IC present and instead just has a single USB port connected directly to the SoC's OTG port it should be possible to configure it to act in slave mode through software.
Yes you can if you use some USB Peripheral Controller with SPI Interface like MAX3420E and write driver for it if it is not yet supported in Linux and handle specific USB class you want to implement.
The presence of this hub IC prevents the USB ports from being used in slave mode.

The text of this link is way too long to post here, but the Zero can be any kind of HID.
The Model B uses a SMSC LAN9512 USB 2.0 Hub and 10/100 Ethernet Controller IC to provide multiple physical USB host ports from the single USB OTG port available on the Broadcom SoC.
