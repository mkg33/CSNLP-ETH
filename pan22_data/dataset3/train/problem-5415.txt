or you can download the ddeb package here and install it by sudo dpkg -i linux-image-3.2.0-60-virtual-dbgsym_3.2.0-60.91_amd64.ddeb
The thing is that the vmlinuz file is compressed - and for debugging purposes, you need an uncompressed vmlinux one (and preferably one built with debugging symbols - which the default vmlinuz-es coming with Ubuntu do not have, as they are stripped of symbols).
Now, it is possible to unpack a vmlinuz into a vmlinux file - however, that is not trivial; first you have to find a byte offset in vmlinuz where the compressed file starts, and then use dd and zcat to unpack only the necessary part.
Notice that l is lowercase in first command and uppercase in second.
In ubuntu 8.10 it is a link pointing to /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.28-16-generic
dpkg -L linux-image-2.6.31-17-386 for a recent Karmic install.
Packages that contain linux kernel (the vmlinuz file) are called linux-image-VERSION-ARCH in Debian/Ubuntu.
Hm, just wanted to put this as a comment to the above answer by @paxdiablo, but cannot find the comment button?
you can download source and compile your own using the following command:
usually the vmlinux locates in /usr/lib/debug/ after installation
In detail, this is explained in: "[ubuntu] How to trace this bug?
You can list them with command dpkg -l linux-image-*, and for installed package (it has ii mark in first column) you can get a list of files in it with dpkg -L linux-image-VERSION-ARCH, e.g.
- Ubuntu Forums - post #4"; in brief, below is my example terminal command log, based on that post:
