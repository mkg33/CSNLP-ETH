Likely what they are speaking of is the speed cap of the internet- if it costs "20.00 dollars per megabyte" this means that they charge 20 dollars if you have a 1 MB/S Download speed.
This would mean that to download an average sized HD movie one would have to spend 60,000 dollars for that alone- which is simply outrageous.
Add in their service charge which I assume is about 30 dollars a month on top of your 60 for speed... and you have 90 dollars a month.
Considering that 1 Megabyte is 8 MegaBits, if you are paying for 20 MegaBits per second, then you are getting a 2.5 MegaByte per second connection speed.
If you pay for 2.5 MegaBytes per second they should logically charge you around 60 dollars a month for this connection.
I Would like to note, though, that ISPs tend to round the numbers a bit when it comes to internet speed- what they advertise as a 20 MegaBit per second connection is likely actually a 24 MegaBit per second connection, which is 3 MegaBytes per second.
There is MOST CERTAINLY no way that their service costs 20 Dollars per megabyte downloaded.
This would mean that you are technically paying about 60 dollars for a 20 megabit per second connection- Which is generally reasonable by today's standards.
