I have 15-20 virtual machines running, all attached to a single NAT network (named vmnet8).
This works great, I can reach the web server on the VM at 192.168.100.100 by connecting to the host's IP address.
Sometimes, I need to add port redirections to this NAT configuration.
Clearly, restarting the host machine does take it into account, and the newly added port is forwarded.
it looks like the only way to apply VMWare NAT's new config is to kill the running vmware-natd process and restart it, but i may be wrong (source)
I did this via the file /etc/vmware/vmnet8/nat/nat.conf by adding lines like the following:
How do I make the natd process take this new configuration into account?
I have configured VMWare's NAT (the vmnet-natd daemon) to forward some incoming to ports to one of the VMs, since it hosts some publicly accessible services.
However, this is not an option on this server, so how should one do this without restarting the whole host?
I am working at workstation 10.0.4 , I use the following instructions to make nat.conf to take effect after every change,wihtout rebooting computer.
