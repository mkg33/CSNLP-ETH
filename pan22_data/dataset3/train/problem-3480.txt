Having said that, I just wiped my VPS due to a crytomining malware infection.
You can also analyze the source IP addresses and block them if they come from a country you do not do business with.
These providers may then be able to do something, such as temporarily or permanently suspending the domain.
But I'm never a fan of blocking IP addresses or address ranges.
If the other domain is actually the domain responsible for serving malware, you can contact the abuse contact at their DNS provider and their domain registrar, if different, to report the domain as a malware source (and include evidence thereof).
It seems like this is probably something very basic that I'm just missing, but am having trouble in troubleshooting it.
Further inspection shows the A record for this domain points to my IP.
I can understand there would be nothing to prevent someone from setting an A record to point wherever.
I've used BIND for about ten years but am by no means an expert, at all.
You can also attempt to get a new IP address from your own service provider.
While I was getting BIND set back up I noticed that a domain (TLD) I do not own was coming up as being hosted by my IP address.
