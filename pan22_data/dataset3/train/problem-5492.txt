This allows you to do things like lazy scrolling (don't scroll until the player gets close to the screen border), smooth scrolling (dampen the camera movement so erratic player movements do not translate to camera shaking) or temporarily take control of the camera and have it focus on something else.
Set the targetTransform in the inspector to the player object.
Following the player on just one axis is another use-case for such a script.
Instead of that I write a CameraController script which references the player and corrects the position of the camera in its Update method.
I personally like to not attach the camera object to the player directly.
It's using LateUpdate so that the position is updated after the player position has been updated.
I need a script to make the camera follow the player but only on the x axis so its like mario  where when I jump the camera doesnt go up.
Attach a new script to the camera and add something like this:
And it's using a local tempVec3 variable so you're not creating a new Vector3 every frame.
