.diz is a scene convention for archive/package descriptions.
For a bunch of zipfiles... get winzip/winrar/7-zip installed... Open the directory in question.. highlight all the zips files, right-click, extract.
will also do if you have those installed already, but if not, 7-Zip if an excellent free alternative.
if you get a huge list of folders that are offered to be opened by winrar (r00 files), try using winzip to extract them to a seperate folder.
As for the split RAR/ZIP archives, just use 7-Zip to open and extract the main .RAR/.ZIP archive (it will extract all the other parts as well).
This way, you can view these files properly without needing to mess around with fonts in Notepad (besides of course having to first locate fonts that can display all the extended ASCII characters properly).
I downloaded a torrent that contains a bunch of .zip files and a .diz file.
Since .DIZ and .NFO files often contain nice old-school ASCII art, if you're interested you can install GetDiz and associate it with these two extensions.
.nfo is now more much more common, and is used for the same purpose.
I'm guessing it all should get pieced back into 1 bigger zip file.
A .diz file is nothing more then a text description of what was included in the archive.
Note that sometimes the multiple archives may actually be separate non-linked archives, or even contain the split archive pieces inside (I've seen all sorts of weird multi-layer packaging schemes).
After you do this open the first file (which usually contains the install/setup) and run it :D
They are just plain text, and contain info about the package they're contained in.
