If I load a phpinfo() file through my localhost I get PHP 5.3.26.
But after I tried the failed way from the first post, I was able to sync the php version on both environments.
I just installed PHP 5.4.19 on my os X 10.6.8 Mac using homebrew.
How do instruct Apache to load my new installation of PHP?
After restart your apache by running sudo apachectl graceful, localhost will recognize PHP 5.4 as default version.
I have tried changing the LoadModule in my httpd.conf file to:
My PHP version running in terminal was 5.3 and localhost shows 5.4.
httpd: Syntax error on line 118 of /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf: Cannot load /usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.19/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so into server: dlopen(/usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.19/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so, 10): Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/curl/lib/libcurl.4.dylib\n  Referenced from: /usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.19/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so\n  Reason: Incompatible library version: libphp5.so requires version 8.0.0 or later, but libcurl.4.dylib provides version 6.0.0
I am not sure how well brew and ports play together, but perhaps you should be using brew install of both apache2 and PHP.
I was previously using PHP 5.3.26 probably installed with MacPorts.
