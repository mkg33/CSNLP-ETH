Like the others have said Dropbox is probably the best option but you will have to pay for the kind of amount of data you likely to need to use.
If spread out across the internet, take a look at Microsoft Live Mesh and Dropbox
I know Windows can do this, but i'm not sure about Macs.
One service that you can use is, for example, Live Mesh or DropBox.
There is a new player in this field that might help you: cubby
Cubby allows you to share folders of any size by doing a computer to computer sync without syncing to the cloud.
You can use them with Microsoft Systems or Mac Os.
You can use online-sync approach without resolution loss.
You may want to have a look at Microsoft Sync toy using UNC shares (if on same network)
But I think they both have some pretty small (relatively for raw photos) limits on total size you're allowed to have on the cloud.
Perhaps consider creating an ftp server that can be set up on other computers as an accessible ftp folder.
Unless you just have them put in a temporary copy that you move out of the folder.
Try sharing a private Picasa web album with sync to web enabled.
Your are exchanging raw files, not modified files.
Create a logmein.com account and then download cubby from cubby.com/download and you should be able to get it working today rather than having to wait through the invite process.
