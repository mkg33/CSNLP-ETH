As I understand it, Powerpoint will embed and play quite a wide range of video formats, if the relevant codecs are installed on the PC.
Because we don't control the PC we need to assume that it has nothing installed that doesn't come automatically with Windows or Powerpoint - but which formats are these?
Your best bet is going to be to use a Windows native codec, the primary ones being Windows Media Video v9 or v10 in a .avi/wmv packaging.
I'm helping a colleague prepare a Powerpoint presentation.
This codec and packaging will be able to play on virtually any Windows based PC.
To put it another way: What video format can we embed in Powerpoint and be confident that it will play on any Windows 7 PC?
This will convert the video to something that any copy of PPT 2010 should be able to play out of the box.
I am making an assumption that it will be running Windows 7 & Powerpoint 2010, as we are.
Apologies if this question has been asked many times before... but I can't find a duplicate.
Insert your video in PPT 2010 on any computer that will allow it (ie, that has the necessary codecs installed), then use File | Info | Optimize Compatibility
We have no control over the computer that it will be delivered from (we simply hand the PPT file over beforehand).
