Take an application that's 64-bit, running on a 64-bit OS, with hardware that can support 64-bit computing, and add some really gigantic data files.
I remember that I did several projects on the university that could eat all the RAM i could throw at them.
Off the top of my head scientific computing (statistical analysis, biological modeling, physics simulations...) are some of the most common programs that regularly use over 4GB.
Some school programming projects will need lot of hardware power.
The only reason I'd get more would be to remove that "almost", and be safe in the knowledge my PC can take pretty much whatever I throw at it.
Personally, I have 2GB of RAM, and almost never fill it.
Databases can eat up huge amounts of memory both RAM and on-disk.
Probably not tremendously unless you just really like to have EVERY APP ON YOUR COMPUTER open at the same time... ;-)
Any application that has to deal with an awful lot of information quickly will thank you.
Make sure your OS can use more than 4GB (needs to be 64-bit).
