2) Check Serverfaults canonical question about RAID.
(5 drives, size of smallest drive, minus one drive for parity).
You might even get away with partitioning the 2TB drive in a ½TB and a 1½TB partition and use the first part for the RAID and the second part as just a simple partition.
Specifically the disadvantage of RAID5 and large disks.
(Rebuilding if a drive fails is going to take a very long time.
I hope someone can answer me, it would help a lot!
I'm thinking about purchasing a 2TB drive and can't figure out if it is possible to add it to this RAID (4*0,5TB + 1*2TB HDD) and how much space will I gain.
If you use a hardware RAID controller then it depends on the card if it is possible or not.
But as I wrote before, a lot of that depends on how you set up your RAID.
However many HW cards as well as Linux software will allow you to use the 2TB drive as a fifth ½TB drive, resulting in a RAID 5 configuration with 2TB available space.
I have 4 0,5TB drives and in RAID5 I have about 1,36TB usable.
And during that time disks will be stressed and much more likely to fail).
I decided to use RAID5, because I want as much space as possible, but I'm to afraid to use RAID0 because of possible data loss.
