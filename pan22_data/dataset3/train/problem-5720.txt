If that's not possible in your case, you can either create a limited one and use runas to start the browser under it or use DropMyRights or a similar application.
For any operating system, you can update your hosts file to block a list of undesirable sites:
So, my main advice is that you should try to avoid downloading and executing files downloaded from website that you don't know/trust.
Combine that with having the VM not save state on shutdown (so it always started up 'clean') and he could browse with no worries.
I had a friend who use the virtual-machine-desktop-integration feature to set it up so that when he launched his 'browser' it really launched his browser within a VM so that any compromises or etc were of the virtual machine.
You will be generally infected when executing exe/bat/zip/ppt files download from not very clean web site...
If you need to go to the "underground web", I suggest you to use a Virtal Machine (like VMWare, Virtual PC, VirtualBox and so on) that you may delete if you think it's not clean anymore (or revert via use of snapshots).
Granted, there are many legit sites in this list that support click-through advertising and such, and you need to go in and comment-out those sites, but I have found that a hosts file works very well at blocking ads as well as malware
I think the primary rule is to browse on an non-administrator account.
Oh, and for true safety, browse on a non-Windows OS.
Update: For my work, I use Internet Explorer on Windows and regularly have to browse through some links returned through google search results.
If you want to use windows anyway, you could browse from a virtual machine.
(And no history, which I would find annoying but he didn't mind).
What are the best practices and tools you use for safe Internet browsing?
Disable Flash for that configuration, since this plugin seems to be a major security hole, considering as recent as yesterday's zero-day flaw news.
