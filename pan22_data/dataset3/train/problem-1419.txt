But exactly what can be moved depends on what kind of data it is, and what applications access it.
If you can provide more details on what directories are using up that space, we can provide better ideas about what can be relocated.
Even if the copy succeeds, you would not be able to Delete "Everything" from C: partition, as Windows will complain when System files start getting trashed...
(P.S I have not had this desktop for more than a month and my 118GB are already almost gone.)

Can I copy everything from my C: to my D: and delete everything from my C: to free up space and it'll still function normally?
If you are booting off of the C: then you CANNOT copy everything to D: and then delete the contents of C:.
A lot of things on C: are crucial to the functioning of the Windows operating system.
If the C: and D: are both partitions on the same drive, you might be able to Extend C: if you shrink D:, but we need more information to know if that is even a possibility.
