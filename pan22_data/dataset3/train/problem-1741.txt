that looks like it just snaps together with a cable like this:
Here is a photo:  Would it be possible to buy the necessary connectors or computer hardware necessary to create my own camera module?
Currently I have a 20MP interpolated camera module from UUGear, which is absolutely phenomenal, and may just end up getting those, but I don't mind doing the extra work necessary to build my own modules.
I have three old iPhones (iPhone 3GS, iPhone 3G and an iPhone 4) that I recovered from family members that were going to throw away.
I have done a good amount of C coding so I'm not too worried about having to custom write drivers, but I want to build a 3d modeling system using multiple pis and multiple camera modules so I was just wondering if I could build my own as a learning exercise and if so, where could I further look into assembling a working camera module...
I had the 3GS so out of curiosity I disassembled it and recovered a camera module with the code cap37-0501-00, which is shown here.
The quality of the iPhone cameras has also been very high so that is what prompted me to try and recover the phones to build custom Pi cameras.
I assume that given that iOS is proprietary this task may prove to be impossible but I want to reduce costs as much as possible and if I could somehow use these 3 extra cameras that are being unused, that would be really cool.
