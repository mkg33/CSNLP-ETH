Very simple, and much easier than figuring that part out with DSADD.
Make sure your internal domain is CONTOSO.COM, or else change the script.
You can basically make it set any user properties that you want.
(There might be a better way to display this, but I haven't had coffee yet.)
You can use excel or notepad etc to prepare a list of commands to paste into a command prompt, or make a batch file.
I have tried to get this to create email addresses automatically, but I have had inconsistent results.
It is easy enough to just select all the users at once in Active Directory Users and Computers and setup Exchange Mailbox from there.
This is better if you want to have specific names for each user, different than user1, user2, etc.
We occasionally have students with names like James Smith and Jonathon Smith.
I have a one line batch file that imports all of my new users every year:
You will have to create mailboxes for all the users afterwards, but that is pretty easy to do in bulk.
If you have a system to prevent collisions ahead of time, perfect.

(There is likely a much better way to do this part...)
One failure: Username collisions need to be handled manually.
If not, I recommend redirecting the output of the bat file to a text file and just search for "Fail" in the results.
