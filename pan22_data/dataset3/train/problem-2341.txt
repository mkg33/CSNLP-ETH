Here is the result, we can find the VHD leased (in use) or not:
You can safely delete these disks if they are not in use and you know it's not from any previous VM you want to recover.
When you delete a VM, it's vhd remains in the storage.
I have some virtual machines in the Azure cloud, and I've just found that there are several .vhd files (all 127GB) on one of my premium storage accounts.
Disks in use (attached to VMs) are not allowed to be deleted.
Azure premium storage is a little pricey, so I'm keen to try and understand what is going on here and cut down on the storage spending where necessary.
Theses are probably leftovers from previously created Virtual Machines that does not exist anymore.
I don't ever recall creating these by snap-shotting my machines, so I'm wondering why there are multiple files with different dates on.
Agree with Bruno, by the way, we can use PowerShell to list the VHD and VHD's status:
Can old ones just be deleted safely, and also, how can I stop these from being created autmatically, if indeed they are being automatically created?
