The game has a global high score list, and there has been some fierce battles among the players for the top positions.
So the question is, what do I do with the current high scores when I release the update?
I also don't think I can adjust the current score values because they are a sum of many small games, and the user can replay those to get an increase to the total.
I should also note that this game has no logical, absolute maximum score because it is based on things like time and resources used as well as kills.
I don't think I should wipe it because a lot of people worked really hard to get there.
I now want to make a major update to the game, but the changes I have in mind will bring the maximum theoretical score down to about 80% of what it currently is.
It doesn't seem right to leave it because no one will ever be able to take the high spots, and new scores won't really compare to old ones.
I have a game that people have been playing for several years now.
This is just an estimate, of course, I haven't gotten very far into the update, but it will definitely come down.
