here are some zabbix templates to get started - http://www.zabbix.com/wiki/doku.php?id=contrib:templates
Personally I'd reconsider Zabbix (we are dropping it right now after some evaluation) and use a combination of munin (or cacti) and icinga (well Nagios since icinga isn't quite ready yet) with IDOUtils (NDOUtils in Nagios)
For true service monitoring and alerting, you'll want a tool like Nagios.
I don't have any experience with Zabbix, but if you 're not already committed to a tool, Zenoss has all the monitoring plugins you're looking for as well as RRD generated performance graphs.
also it is not very difficult to write your own script and include results into zabbix - give it a try!
It sounds like you have monitoring and metrics confused.
The monitoring and alerting tools are very nice as well.
Use Cacti to spot trends and know when you need to upgrade or add systems, or to implement load balancing.
The graphs aren't quite as nice as Cacti's but they're easy to set up.
As for apache I'm afraid you'll have to come up with your own scripts to get it right.
Zabbix provides very few scripts out of the box, check out the documentation on "16.2.2.MySQL" for a few examples.
Cacti is a tool for tracking metrics (CPU or memory use over time, hits per second on Apache, etc.).
