I understand what active FTP is, basically my machine connects to the FTP Server and then the FTP Server connects to my machine.
The pair of tuples is then discarded, as it is valid only once.
When the FTP server connects back to this IP and port, the tuple is looked up and if not expired connected back to your PC and thus FTP client.
How is it able to connect to my PC when I'm behind a firewall?
Remember: NAT is rather a new concept, that was not anticipated when the IP protocol suite was invented.
This pair of tuples is stored together with an expiration time.
In your case, the IP and port in the PORT segment of the FTP command channel is read, parsed and manipulated by the firewall: The Internal IP of your PC (as sent by your FTP client) and port are replaced by the external IP of the firewall and most possibly a different port.
While this behaviour is not strictly necessary for FTP (just use passive mode), it is very usefull for other protocols which need a connect-back feature.
To allow exactly this behaviour, there are "connection tracker" modules in most firewall implementations, they work along the lines of:
I am behind a firewall, and I do not have any port forwarding set (Though I do have ports opened on my pc).
