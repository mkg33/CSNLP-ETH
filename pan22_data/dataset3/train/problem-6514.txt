its safe to use any other drive as long as its to same or better spec than the old drive, that means same spindle RPM (or better), same interface spec (eg SataII) and same capacity or higher.
I would always try to stay as similar as possible, so I suggest you to buy from the same manufacturer and hard drive family if possible.
That's why it's recommended while creating a RAID array not to use the whole disc size, but leave some percentage unused, then it's simpler to use different disc with "same" size which have not exact equal sector count.
So work your way backwards from this configuration when replacing a drive.
You "can" use a different HD as mentioned by many above, but let's not just talk about what is acceptable, but instead give best practices answers....
You can also usually replace a failed RAID member with a drive that runs at a different speed than the other array members.
I have myself some mixed RAID6, Seagate and Hitachi, no problems.
If not possible, then sure another manufacturer would do it, as long as the disc is exact the same size or bigger, never smaller!
Can't find same batch number, same model number, same size, same manufacturer, etc...
RAID 5 will work with variables, yet best practices have shown that marriaging the exact specifications right down to the batch in Hard Drives seems to offer the highest quality RAID.
i would actually recommend different drive manufacturers as well as different batch numbers of the same drive make/model this just reduces the odds of multiple drive failure at the same time even further
Be careful, just being one sector smaller than your old discs will make it not work if your RAID uses the full old disc size.
From both a "performance" standpoint and "quality" RAID configuration.
You can usually replace a failed RAID member with a larger drive, but not a smaller drive.
The RAID will only use the space equivalent to the smallest drive in the array.
