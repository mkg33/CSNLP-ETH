You can set up to 3 distinct conditions for a cell or range of cells and when one of the conditions matches the cell gets the formatting applied by that conditions.
You could do a multiple condition sum using sumproduct.
I realise that this may be a bit of a nasty way of doing it but it is easy and as long as the data is in order, should give you what you want.
I have a set of date ranges in Excel, each of which has some kind of label.
To me this sounds exactly what Conditional Formatting was created for.
This will give you the row number, since this multiple condition sum is only true when E1 is >= B and <= C, and will sum up the row number of all rows where this is true (which you said is at most 1).
If I have another date, I would like to look up the label relating to the date range within which this date falls.
and apologies if this is a duplicate - if you could point me in the direction of any existing answers, that would be great.
Also if you think your number might be in one of the Gaps you could do:
Can you add a (maybe hidden) duplicate of columnA on the right hand side (or move column A) and are the dates in order?
I know that the date ranges will not overlap, although there could be a gap between the end date of one, and the start date of the next.
It looks up a value in the first column, and looks across a number of columns.
It's how a lot of the "traffic light" type spreadsheets are made.
You would use (lets say Date1 is B:B, Date2 is C:C, E1 is the date you want to find)
