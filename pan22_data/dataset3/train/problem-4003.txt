I experienced the same problem on my Windows 7 machine.
"If you are having a problem with your wireless connection after resuming from hibernate or sleep, or are having intermittent connectivity issues, try to adjust your Power Management profile to change your Wireless Adapter Settings to Maximum Performance.
Have a look in the properties of the wireless connection and see whether the encryption method has changed from TKIP to AES or vice versa - XP and Vista, at least, have an annoying habit of flipping this occasionally and it causes the kind of symptoms you describe.
It could be a power issue see this link (Microsoft forum)
To do this click “Change Plan Settings” next to your Power Profile, and choose “Wireless Adapter Settings” and set it to Maximum Performance.
Note bot while being able to connect I was still able to connect with Vista.
I restarted the machine and it still would not connect.
You should do this with all of your power profiles.
Later I turned it back on but then it would not connect.
Sounds like windows 7 was "being clever" and turned off something to save power.
I then powered it off, left it for a few minutes and powered it back on.
