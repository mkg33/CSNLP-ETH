By the way if you choose to subsequently use 5V as Vcc make sure you use a voltage divider to drop the ADC output line (MISO) to a Pi safe 3V3.
There may be other issues but I will only mention the one which is immediately apparent.
For testing tie the inputs to ground or Vcc to get a fixed reading of 0 or 1023.
I can see no evidence that you are feeding any signal into the ADC's input channels.
gpiozero gives you normalised values 0-1 which are easier to deal with than the raw data.
Also see the gpiozero docs on MCP3008: https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_spi.html#gpiozero.MCP3008
strange values are observed even I did not connect anything to channels.
I'm using MCP3008 ADC to get Analog signal from sensor.
Here's a guide which includes a good wiring diagram, enabling hardware SPI and reading analog input signals with the gpiozero python library: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing/15
That means they will all be floating and will return random values.
