You should boot from a WinPE disk and restore from a known good version if possible.
It could be a weird ACPI issue which having the latest BIOS could help resolve.
I imagine a problem with one of these might cause tcpip.sys to panic.
My first suspicion is that malware has modified this file.
Another thing to check: If you look under Device Manager, you may notice, under "Network adapters", the presence of one or more "miniport" drivers.
I've not heard of a "media server" type program installing a miniport driver but it could be possible.
It's likely not compatible with Windows 8 and you should roll it back if you did this.
You also might try updating or reinstalling your Wifi drivers and supporting software.
You also may have an issue with McAfee firewall miniport drivers or similar.
As it is central to network communication most of the time, there's a number of other drivers interacting with this that could be a cause of the problem.
Security software (such as an antivirus suite) and VPN software might install these, and these may be causing an issue or conflict.
These drivers filter stuff going in and out of a real network adapter.
Issues from this driver directly are really very rare.
Something off the top of my head for a moment though: Did you try to apply a well-known utility that modifies tcpip.sys to allow more than 10 half-open TCP connections in order to improve Bittorrent performance?
