I wrote a simple Windows program and put it in my "Start up" folder on the start menu.
But when Windows starts up, it always launches it twice.
I get two instances of my program and I always have to manually exit one of them.
It is only in the All Users start up profile, not any of the other User profiles.
I've found out that the following value was present under that path:
It turned out that the registry keys that point to the "Startup" folder got messed up (due to some drag and dropping and copying a startup folder to/from different location).
On regedit you can see that there's a path with your sid under the HKEY_USERS\ path.
Download "pstool" from Sysinternals, run the following command to get your sid:
This actually happens on both 7 and xp for me for this particular program.
%USERPROFILE%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\
If I remove the program from "Start up", then it doesn't start at all.
HKEY_USERS\{{your sid here}}\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders key.
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\
