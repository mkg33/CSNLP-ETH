I made the new screen primary, and laptop screen secondary.
What happens is the game froze, I wait a bit and then I can alt tab for a short period.
So I waited this time instead of restarting the computer and got dpc_watchdog_violation BSOD.
I ran online crash analysis and the culprit seemed to be csrss.exe.
I expected it to be about graphics drivers but it appears to be about remote access.
Later I was playing but there was nothing on my other screen and the game froze.
My anti virus is on, my display drivers (or any other) are up to date.
After checking it a bit, I see that the nVIDIA GPU driver is involved:
So what causes this and how can I mitigate the further occurrences of this BSOD?
No unusual activity was going on on my laptop today, except for the new screen.
Symptom: This happened 3 times today while I was playing Heroes of the Storm and it never happened before.
I googled this process, some say it's system process, some say it's virus.
I bought a new ASUS screen (VN247) today and I'm using it together with my laptop ASUS N550JV.
On the first two occurrences, I was also watching twitch while playing the game so I thought it may be the cause because it happened in 2 games out of 3 games (~30 min each).
