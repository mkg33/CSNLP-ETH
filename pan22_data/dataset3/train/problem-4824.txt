This will have to be repeated for each new network flow originating from Amy's machine.
Only one, or a handful, of packets for each network flow should reach C_1.
The flow entries may be slightly different for each router too.
It's not really a multicast, the controller has a separate connection to each switch/router.
The path P_0, from R to C_1, is often (but not always) implemented 'out-of-band', as a separate network.
It wouldn't make sense to create a path from R to X and then send packets destined for Y along it.
AmyOSPF computes the best path P_1 from R to the destination of the packets, wherever that may be.
As soon as the flows are inserted by the AmyOSPF controller, they are simply forwarded according to that routing logic.
The flow entries that make up the path P_1 is then sent to the routers on P_1, so that all traffic coming from Amy's machine to a particular destination are sent along that path, without having to go to the controller.
The point is that it doesn't matter what 'view' the router has, as all of the routing is done in the controller.
In the case of R, this new flow entry must have higher priority than the one that says to send all traffic from that port to the controller.
