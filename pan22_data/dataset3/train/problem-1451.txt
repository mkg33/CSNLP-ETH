But as surfasb says, it is not really anything to worry about.
Perhaps someone has a compromised the machine and is using it for anonymous P2P or F2F networking with obfuscated and encrypted filesystems?
After analyzing logs of writes as well as thinking about things I realized that it is Firefox's crash recovery.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(file_sharing)
I removed it and disk writes went down to 0 to a few kb/s.
In order to be able to recover from a crash Firefox has to write the session to disk.
Your usr directory (I assume that is where Firefox stores those things) shouldn't be located on an SSD to begin with, move it to an HDD.
I did an investigation of where writes to my SSD come from.
With lots of tabs in a big session this adds up to a few GB per day.
It is perfectly normal for a browser to store changes to cookies and sessions to the disk.
The session information is stored in the four files you listed.
I ran sudo iosnoop -p PID and found that the Evernote Web Clipper was doing all the writing.
The data about which tabs you had open has to be kept somewhere.
There is a setting in Firefox that controls how often the session restore saves files.
