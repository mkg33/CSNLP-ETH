If this sever won't ever have much traffic, a Pi can be run 24x777x365 with a negligible impact on your electric bill.
In general, unless you're wanting to run ARM assembly code, your full-sized PC will be better.
If you have a small home/office that needs a print server and/or a low-traffic file server, a full fledged PC is kinda overkill.
It runs a specialized version of Debian which is the Linux distro Ubuntu is based off of so there's a lot of similarities.
A full-sized PC will normally have a noisy fan, put off a noticeable amount of heat and consumes (when sleep is disabled for server use) a noticeable amount of power.
There's not much "special" about it other than the price.
For the most part, the Pi is just an ultra cheap, ultra small, ultra low-powered system.
Apart from the GPIO ports and the nifty ability to use an old TV as a display, the big thing the Pi has going for it is that it is totally quiet and consumes very little energy.
The Pi was designed with the intent of providing a cheap computer for teens to learn to code and use Linux on.
