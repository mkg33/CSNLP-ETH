Task scheduler is your friend (Basic Task - Start Program at Log On - check Highest privileges).
Task scheduler is an ok solution for something that runs on startup.
It enables you to directly disable UAC for any application you decide to trust.
But the most flexible way to do this is to use the Microsoft Application Compatibility Toolkit.
You have to run, as administrator, the correct "Compatibility Administrator" program.
The service will run in the background to allow easy access to any of your account restricted links.
A third party program you might want to take a look at is called UAC Trust Shortcut 1.0
The compatibility fix you need to select is RunAsInvoker.
To disable UAC prompts for one application only you have to use the Microsoft Application Compatibility Toolkit:
Basically you just download the program and enter in the .exe location and a name for the file and the icon will be placed on your desktop.
There are two of them, one for 32bit applications and one for 64bit applications.

Don't forget to remove (or move) your current startup icon or registry entry afterwards.
