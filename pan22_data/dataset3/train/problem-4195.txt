This allows you to do a new install without having to back up all your stuff.
Also since you cant even do an in-place upgrade from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 8 Enterprise what i recommend doing is doing a "custom" install without formatting which will take your entire drive and place it in a Windows.old folder then Windows will expand the install.wim onto your drive.
When you are done run the Disk Cleanup tool which will get rid of your Windows.old folder properly.
A clean install would be best, but if you wish to keep whats left or your entire OS as is aswell, you can simply use software like gparted to make a partition on your hard drive of the empty space you may have and then install 8 on that partition as well.
I will admit i always do a clean install on my personal machines, however the upgrade process has greatly improved, however you will still sometimes be left with incompatible programs and lingering files despite using the App Compatibility tool.
While you will have to install your programs again, you can go into the Windows.old folder and locate the files that you had on your PC and move them to your new Documents, Music etc folders.
I'll advise you think, 8 isn't the best in many regards for example if you don't like using IE for everything, you may want to turn back.
