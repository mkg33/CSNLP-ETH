I tried "Create a GPO in this domain, and link it here" directly on the OU, but it look like the GPO is not overriding the default one.
They apply only to users or groups - so you have to create a group with all the people you want it to apply to.
The GPO I want to create is pretty simple, it just set the minimal password length.
This page  has an example powershell script that will run as a scheduled task and update the members of a group to include only the members of an OU.
So Ideally only the OU, where you have applied the GP will b linked.
How can you create a GPO for only one Organizational Unit ?
Secondly, if you want more than one OU To have the GP applied, you can select the OU and link existing GP fro the console.

Even then, you can't directly apply them to an OU.
Hoping that you have created the Fine grained password policy, In the GPMC console, you have to create a new GP under the OU where you want to apply the GP.
That will keep the group and OU in sync as you add/remove people from the OU.
As of Server 2008, there are Fine-Grained Password Policies that can be used to set password requirements only for specific parts of the domain:
Once you have defined he GP, select Link Enabled, if there are any Sub-OU's, you can select "Block Inheritance".
The regular password policy is special - there can only be one for the whole domain.
Given that I don't want all the users to have the same password policy, I want to apply the GPO to only users that are inside a specific OU.
