There's a full blog post on it by Edwin Sarmiento.
I haven't used it before but there is an object in SSIS called Transfer SQL Server Objects.
The blog post should provide you full details and code that you can use to support your schema copies.
For example, here's how you can script out your CREATE DATABASE with options(extracted from the linked blog post):
You could also look into doing replication but blocking the data portion of it.
You can use Powershell to script out database objects as a .sql script that can be used both as a schema backup and for the transfer you're talking about.
I think the SSIS option is probably your best bet though.
It has an option to copy data or not and you can select copy all objects or just specific types of objects, permissions etc.
In fact if you set up a snapshot replication that just pushed schema for each of your servers you could potentially have an automated process to do the push.
This is done by using the .Script() method in the SQL Server SMO.
