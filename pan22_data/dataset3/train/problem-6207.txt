If you consider IOS to be firmware, then why not Windows or similar.
Firmware is typically specific instructions (software) that are loaded in/on to hardware in order for them to perform their function.
Again, I do not think there is a definitive guide as to where one starts and stops - all what firmware is, is software which is compiled for whatever chip is in the device.
As for your second question about what is firmware, I would say that bootloaders are not but the BIOS is and grub isn't.
Software typically is any instructions or routine that a computer can do.
So, the bootloader/grub is pure software - it may do tasks with the hard drive, but it is not directly actually controlling any hardware.
I would say that pretty much every piece of hardware has some sort of firmware included in it.
To me, this shows that the boundaries are where the manufacturers or vendors of any device allow you to take control and it is not actually a fixed thing/exact science.
If you take an embedded device such as an Iphone/Ipad, where does the firmware end and software begin!?
This is very hard to draw the line but... the way I look at it is that the BIOS (now EFI) is the firmware of the motherboard, and the Hard drive has it's own firmware.
Now, an Ipad, or an Iphone, or any other embedded device...
For me, I would say that firmware = the software that comes on devices where as pure software is purchased as data, but I am sure others may say different!
To complicate further - when I say upon request, this can be from a driver within other software
