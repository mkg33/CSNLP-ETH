Commercially, Novell has a product called Zenworks Orchestrator 2.0 that you might find interesting.
Then you can just copy the VM files to clone the VM and then automate the build process within the VM.
Not exactly what you were asking for, but thought I would give my KISS principle answer :-)  You could also just use the snapshot feature within VMWare workstation.
Pretty cool, but commercial, and may be more than you are looking for.
Granted, you have to pay for both vSphere and Lab Manager licenses, but if you're already in a VMware environment and you plan on doing a lot of automated testing, the cost will likely be worth the benefit.
It is admittedly aimed probably a bit higher than you are looking for, alas.
VMware's vCenter Lab Manager product is designed for exactly this purpose.
More of a focus on big data centers, with workloads that change rapidly,  such as a large SAP system, that might need to spin up some VM's to do work over night, then spin them down during the day, or really at any point.
I would create a barbones VM with just the OS etc.
if you are using Linux, you can user lvm or vmware snapshot feature, both of them works perfectly.
Since they bought PlateSpin they have been integrating functionality from PlateSpin's portfolio into the Orchestrator product.
this way you can clone your barbones VM in a few seconds and destroy it after all your test are done.
