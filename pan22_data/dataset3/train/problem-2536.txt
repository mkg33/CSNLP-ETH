What I'd recommend is picking a single blade and adding an Intel based adapter to that one machine, you'll obviously have to add a interconnect or whatever IBM call them to get the signal out but try the same software setup but with this other NIC (probably disable the Broadcom if you can).
Test this and see how you get on, I know what I've described needs a couple of bits of extra hardware but I'm imagine your IBM rep will happily loan you them.
Ever the SE sites themselves had some problems with this kind of inconsistency and swapping to Intel NICs absolutely helped.
Obviously you have a fixed configuration (I use HP's blades which are pretty similar) so swapping out NICs for Intels is now an easy option but what I would say is that I'm starting to spot a number of similar problems around this forum and elsewhere with that particular Broadcom NIC.
As an aside I'm meeting with Intel and Broadcom next week to discuss something entirely unrelated but I'll certainly discuss it with them and let you know if I find anything of interest.
We have multiple RHEL 5.3 64-bit machines with 10Gbps NICs and their interrupts aren't too bad at all, this is 100 times less.
Certainly given the CPU, chipset and bus capabilities in comparison to such a low amount of traffic you have there's no reason whatsoever for you to NEED any form of interrupt management.
Please let us know what you find out, I'm genuinely interested if there's a problem with these NICs, even if it's an odd edge-case.
