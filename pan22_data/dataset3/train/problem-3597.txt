The main disadvantage, compared to the angular coordinate system suggested by Marqin, is that you'll need to use this formula even for distance from the galactic center, instead of just getting it directly from the first coordinate.
(Other possibilities could include a hybrid "cylindrical" (r, θ, z) coordinate system, where position within the galactic plane is given by distance r from the center and an angle θ, but distance from the galactic plane is simply given as in the cartesian system.
An advantage of this system is that you can calculate distances simply using the Pythagorean formula dist(a, b) = sqrt( (xa − xb)2 + (ya − yb)2 + (za − zb)2 ).
Alternatively, if you don't like spherical coordinates, you could use a simple cartesian (x, y, z) coordinate system.
Of course, if precise distance from the galactic center doesn't matter much in your game, this might not really be a disadvantage anyway.
Just put the origin at the galactic center, have the z-axis point out of the galactic plane, and arbitrarily choose a direction in the galactic plane as the x-axis (with the y-axis also in the galactic plane, 90° away from the x-axis).
Given that the galaxy is mostly a flat disc, this might make some sense.)
