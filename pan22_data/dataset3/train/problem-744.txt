Sorry, I haven't done any quantitative measurements.
It isn't supported by dd-wrt yet, but I think support will be here soon.
Also, I've noticed significant speed increases due to the 802.11n and the gigabit switch.
Got them refurbished & I've been punishing both of them ever since I brought them home & loaded them with DD-WRT.
The latest US firmware is supposedly quite good, but EU firmware is behind and there is a bug in the old (and current EU) versions that forces you to disable upnp, or your throughput will tank in a day or two.
There's a complete list of dd-wrt supported 802.11n devices here:
There is a very good thread regarding DD-WRT & the WRT320N, if you go this route be sure to read it.
If you got a 100Mbit Internet connection you need newer gear.
Finally, here's a chart just to show you what the stock firmware/hardware is capable of: http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/component/option,com_chart/Itemid,189/.
If throughput is important, remember that DD-WRT does not increase speed, just adds a lot more functionality.
I've had very good luck with a pair of WRT320N routers running DD-WRT.
The reason I picked it is because it got a gigabit ethernet switch and around 100Mbit wan-lan throughput.
wrt320n is now supported and seems to be a good choice.

Although I do think N is a waste of time the WRT54GL suffers from mediocre throughput (max 30 Mbit wan-lan).
Also the fact that I expect dd-wrt to work on it real soon now is important :)
I realize this question was asked quite a while ago...
