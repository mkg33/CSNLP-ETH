An Ubuntu install is not going to change any thermal variables in your BIOS... if you think that it's something in the BIOS settings... restore to default and test things out.
If you're sitting in the BIOS, your CPU isn't really doing much and may not shutdown after 1-2 minutes...
Generally I use Super OS, which tries to prompt me to 'upgrade' to the buggy 11.04.
Should be able to boot into Dell's Hardware Diagnostics by hitting F12 at the bios screen.
and other GPU demanding stuff won't work with my notebook's Intel I3 CPU.
Wait a wee or two, & the debugged version should be released.
Unbuntu is for bypassing Win7 faults (crashes, undeletable files, folders), removing anti-virus or malware stuff.
I did try the UNITY stuff on 10.10 - not impressed.
If you spits out an error with one of the tests and your laptop is still under warrenty, should be able to call Dell and get it replaced.
My problem has been gone and now ubuntu run quite good.
Very few of the Ubuntu derivatives dare use Ubuntu 11.04 yet.
I cannot sure those steps could solve the problem.
From there you can run all sorts of hardware tests.
I would suspect that you have an issue with the cooling system, either a fan is out or the thermal compound needs to be re-applied.
