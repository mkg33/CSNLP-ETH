Yes, you should definitely turn off sshd as others have recommended, but even with the default setup, it shouldn't be possible for the average Joe User to SSH into your box.
(for example, read here - http://techie-buzz.com/foss/change-default-ssh-port-in-linux.html)
So, I believe your question is pretty much self answered, dont give anybody such access.
another trick could be to change the port of your ssh daemon, which will basically make it harder for your system to be addressed by someone unknown.
further, like many have suggested here, you can stop running the ssh daemon itself, which would mean that you yourself wont be able to ssh-in to your system, if you need to.
anybody who wants to ssh "in" to your system would need to have appropriate authentication to come in, which would be in your control.
so really, you need to figure out, what exactly do you want to achieve, block others but not yourself, or block everybody (including yourself), and there goes your response.
"I want to be able to stop people from been able to SSH onto my machine" - even with SSHd (the SSH daemon) turned on, this should in general not be possible unless:
