First of all /etc is really a rather unorthodox location for regular services to have write access.
This applies in addition to filesystem permissions.
So what I suggest to do is store your slave zone fiels to a more sane directory which is defined in your named.conf.local file, and give the ownership of the directory to bind group or give the write permission to bind group,
What's happening is that the named process is unable to create a file in the /etc/bind/slave/ directory.
Regarding why your extremely liberal permissions (not at all a good idea) do not help, I would guess Apparmor (more likely for Ubuntu) or SELinux has a profile for BIND which is based around reasonable assumptions (see above) for which file paths need to be writable by named.
I would suggest that you simply move the writable files to a more sane location.
/etc/bind/named.conf.options, which is directory "/var/cache/bind.
Normally you would use a directory under /var/lib or /var/cache depending on the type of data.
