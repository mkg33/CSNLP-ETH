Nevermind that entire Netbooks can be had for $200 these days.
It's a multi-language GUI IDE that has all the debugging tools you'd need, lets you run your code locally (when the LAMP stack is installed), and has a built-in web browser to view your output and read the PHP documentation online.
The optimal setup would be a VM which replicates your remote environment however in that way you can aim to ensure that you have the same versions of MySQL and PHP etc.
Umm, why don't you edit the files locally rather than building a server?
If you're using Ubuntu as the Host operating system, you can easily create lightweight Ubuntu Server virtual machines running jeOS (Juice) easily with vmbuilder.
Personally if you are keen to learn about the stack I would use ubuntu server there are plenty of tutorials so you don't have to worry too much about the GUI.
I don't know why your requirements are so constrained.
If you're even more astoundingly broke than that, you can pick up a 2 gig SD drive for less than $10 at the same store.
These days, you can get 500 GB hard drives for less than $70, or 8 GB SD drives for less than $30.
There are a bunch of other LAMP (Linux, apache, mysql, php) server appliances where I found that one:

With Ubuntu, you don't really have to know much about Linux.
Kdevelop is the cat's pajamas for PHP development as far as I'm concerned.
But here's the solution I use at work (with a desktop machine dedicated to Ubuntu, which is pretty old actually), and it's ideal:
Just tick off a box and wait for your software to download, basically.
Official documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/9.10/serverguide/C/jeos-and-vmbuilder.html
The learning curve is pretty shallow - it's like learning a new version of windows at worst, and all that software is available through its internal package manager.
I know this will use more resources than you intend however something you might find worthwhile.
