Secondly I would suggest you put all your options into one string, and put the username and password into a credentials file.
I have a Windows share mounted on a Linux server (RHEL4) using a mount command like this:
That file can be made to have read/write permissions only for the user accounts that need it.
As far as the automatic remounting is concerned, you could write yourself a little shell script that checks whether it can see a specific file in the mounted location, and then use that to unmount/remount the partition.
As far as I know, any ongoing development work is now focused on this protocol instead of the smbfs type.
For starters I would suggest you use "mount -t cifs", if a cifs mount driver is available in RHEL4.
Is there some way that the share can be automatically remounted when it fails?
This works but the share would have been unavailable for some time before I noticed it in log files.
It stays working for weeks at a time but sometimes stops working, at which time I unmount it and mount it again.
