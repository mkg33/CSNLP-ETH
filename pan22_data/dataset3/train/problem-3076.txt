My setup consists of several servers including production, production fail-over, developer instances, etc.
I would like all of the servers to have consistent environments.
Longer answer: In Nginx each server or website is typically defined in an external file, often in the "enabled-sites" or "sites-enabled" subdirectory of the nginx configuration directory - I called mine enabled-sites as it makes changing to it quicker with tab completion.
I'm currently leaning towards having an events-[subdomain].conf file for each server and creating a symbolic link to it named events.conf.
The main Nginx configuration file typically includes everything in this directory.
Short answer: yes, but there might be a slightly better way.
The nginx.conf for each server could include only the files required by that server at that time.
The production and production fail-over servers periodically swap roles.
I could use the appropriate file merely by changing the symbolic link.
If you can define your configuration files so they work on all servers in that role you may be able to avoid manual changes, and it might work better behind a load balancer.
An issue that I've run into is that the NGINX main configuration file has settings that are tuned to the server hardware, particularly the events context.
You could put all configuration files for all servers into this subdirectory and synchronise the directory, or refer to a directory in a shared location.
The nginx.conf might be different but the server configs the same.
I accomplish this in Apache by using virtual hosts, and enabling/disabling them as necessary.
