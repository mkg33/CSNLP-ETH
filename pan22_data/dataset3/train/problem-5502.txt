The main advantage of it is that it's so easy to get running and so incredibly widely supported.
I have been looking at getting them a static IP as my understanding is if you do so, this particular ISP then bridges you directly instead of being in that private WAN network.
I have a client located in a rural area where they are using the ISP Xplornet, it's a wireless/satellite type of internet connection.
The question is, is there a way around this without them paying extra monthly for this static IP (and bridging)
*Please let me know if the question isn't clear or missing info.
So if you do go down the PPTP route, just remember that it's no more secure than sending your stuff over the internet in plain text.
The only thing you could do would be to tunnel through their network to a server somewhere else, and set up routing rules to route everything through the tunnel instead.
So the client upgraded their service with them and now we cannot access it anymore.
But that said, there's a lot of new equipment that does not support PPTP at all because of how easily it is snooped upon.
For example, if you created an IPSec tunnel (which might not even be possible with the double-NAT, but you might be able to get away with L2TP or, dare I even suggest it, PPTP1) originating at the site and connecting to something under your control, you could then assign it an IP address using 1:1 NAT or something gross like that.
We have gone back to site, but we just cannot seem to get through remotely.
After initial setup, We where able to have access to the site remotely, but it was extremely slow.
After doing some digging, it looks like the upgraded connection is using the 4G/LTE network and that they have created a private network for their WAN before it goes wild on the internet, so a double NAT.
