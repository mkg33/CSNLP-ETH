I followed advice for some time to simply using 20MHz channel bandwidth exclusively, but later was able to once again use the 20/40Mhz auto setting by being extremely particular about my control channel choice and the direction of channel extension.
I recently resolved issues (dropouts, slow speed, etc) with my 802.11n wireless network by switching to one of the newer 'beamforming' routers.
Switching to a beamforming router might be worth a try if nothing else works.
Since switching, everything is stable and fast now.
Sometimes you may have other devices using 2.4Ghz causing interference.
This sounds like an RF issue, whose only solutions are (choose 1):
Not sure if you have tried using a scanner to see if some other device is interfering.
If your wireless router is set to both 20/40MHz auto selection for Channel Bandwidth and there are a number of other Access Points in the area it may be having trouble using enough channels to actually support the 40MHz option.
I've found this to be the case at my job where I had a similar situation and there was a telephone using 2.4Ghz that caused slowdowns.
I used the following application on my Android phone to check the impact of other Access Points on the channels I attempted to use:
I was previously using a good quality Linksys router, but it couldn't handle the interference from multiple nearby devices and walls, etc.
When using the 20MHz option only one channel is used in the transmission of data, and makes it very obvious if you use any channel scanning utility on a computer or phone that it is overlapping with other Access Points in close proximity.
When attempting to work at 40MHz the router is actually extending from the base channel either up or down (normally this can be configured).
