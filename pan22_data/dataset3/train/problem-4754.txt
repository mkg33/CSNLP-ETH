If you don't have the icon / short cut you can find it (on windows 7) searching for "Language" or "Region" in the application menu thingy formerly known as start menu.
On this layout use Shift+" then type the letter that needs double dots to be added.
It's a (yet another ;) "programmer's layout" (same idea as for Polish/Czech Programmer's Keyboard) created by me in M$ Keyboard Layout Creator that allows typing umlauts by AltGr + appropriate Latin letter key combinations (+ some useful symbols as extras).
For caps, don't release Shift+" when typing the letter.
You should have a little DE or EN in the lower right corner, where the volumne indicator and various other status icons are.
If you are looking for German QWERTY Keyboard Layout driver for Windows check this project out :)
Click on it, and you'll see a menue to choose between the configured language settings.
If you want to type umlauts on a keyboard fast, use US-International keyboard layout (LAnguage Bar>Settings>Keyboard).
By default pressing Alt-Shift will toggle between the configured language as well.
