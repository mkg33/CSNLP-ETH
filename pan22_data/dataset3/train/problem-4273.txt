It works pretty fine on the ADSL modem's side, but I've spent one night trying to figure out how to connect to the Internet through this modem.
I've been trying to use the br2684ctl utility with brctl on my Gentoo, first I've configured my kernel in that way :
I only have a Fonera 2.0n and a computer running Gentoo Linux.
So, I'm asking you if there's something huge I've been missing since the beginning !
I've been following this README carefully and this tutorial on setting up a PPPoE connection with Gentoo, but the PPPoE interface just tries to start, and nothing special related to PPP happens, I can't see the interface when I do ifconfig.
The brctl utility keeps telling me "Invalid argument" each time I try to add the nas0 interface into my bridge, I'm honestly hoping I'm doing wrong.
My ISP has told me a big surprise : I don't need to use a login and a password to connect to the Internet, then I must use the RFC 2684 bridging mode.
Maybe I should wait to buy a new router fully supporting the RFC2684 bridging mode, but I'm more interested in setting up this mode on my Fonera 2.0n and even my Raspberry Pi !
My new ADSL line is now enabled, I can finally use my Netgear DM111Pv2 to use to the Internet.
