I had the same problem and it was caused by the Firewall service.
I ran into this error this week and was able to get past it without having to reinstall the OS, which is apparently a feat.
I had a warning message stating the firewall was enabled.
Then, I copied the following two files from a known good SQL installation:
I clicked through all the dialog boxes up until the point that it was about to start the install.
in my opinion there are only two reasons of failed installtion of sql server.
After that, I uninstalled SQL following the steps outlined here (with the exception of step 8, which is a utility for Windows XP and is deprecated):
I'm not sure if this was related or not, but after doing the clean uninstall, copying all 8 of the files listed above, then re-starting the install, it worked.

... not sure if it's completely fixed the issue though.
A review of several internet sites indicated it was an issue so I continued.
I stopped the firewall and reinstalled successfully.
installation setup files.Then get another new copy of sqlserver to install.
After that, I got past the MOF Compiler error in the SQL install.
First you have a virus infected windows.so first scan windows drive with some best antivirus like 360security or panda global protection etc.
if your windows is not infected by any virus then there is problem of sqlserver
I did get another error that caused me to have to copy the following files as well:
The MOF compiler error message did not indicate it had anything to do with the firewall.
