We have numerous laptops here which have two adjacent DHCP reservations, one for the wired interface, and the next for the wireless.
I'm looking for a single ping command that will try both NICs to see which one is connected.
/28 subnets for all NICs on all laptops in given department.
Obviously, I could do the NSLOOKUP first, and then try pinging both addresses, but this is what I am trying to avoid: I want to simply ping a name to see how a specific machine is attached.
PS: I do know how to write a script to do this, but I'd have to drag the script around to every machine I might be using (or put it on a share), which is more trouble than it's worth.
However, if I ping by name, it only tries one of the machine's NICs, which only works half the time (depending on which way the user is currently connected).
NSLOOKUP properly returns both interfaces when querying a machine:
This allows simpler firewall rules by using (e.g.)
Is there a ping (or dig, or anything else, for that matter) option that will automatically try all a host's NICs as found by a DNS lookup?
