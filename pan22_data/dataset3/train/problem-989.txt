I am working at a localization agency and we have been approached by a client about testing their games on iOS as well as Android.
So even if you spoof, say, all the hardware of a Samsung Galaxy SII with the emulator, you may still get bugs specific to the Samsung implementation of Android.
The only valid solution I can imagine is buying as wide a range of the most popular Android devices you can afford (in dollars) for your functional testing, and then use the emulator to test as many other specifications of phones as you can afford (in man hours).
Proper "functional" testing as you describe is probably completely invalid using emulators only.
The Android emulator provided by the SDK has serious performance issues on all systems.
With the vast amount of Android devices out there and the rate at which new devices are released it seems impossible to keep up.
Fortunately the Android platform is robust enough this usually covers the majority of issues, but weird edge bugs still occur on some specific devices.
Lastly, you simply can't multi-touch with a mouse...
Also as far as I know, the emulator doesn't cover manufacturer-specific implementations of the Android OS.
Testing on iOS seems fairly easy as we can just buy a couple of devices and we should be covered.
From what i found, the emulator can cover all API levels, screen sizes and such, but i hear it's buggy and nothing could replace testing on real devices.
In our company we prefer not to use emulators as they don't show real picture especially in terms of performance, instead we select several real devices to cover most popular screen size / gpu vendor / form factor combinations, more about how we select test devices on our blog http://developers.nravo.com/best-test-devices-for-game-development/
How can i test games (localization and functional) on Android covering all compatible devices?
