Tech Smith has a new version of Snagit that is outstanding.
Their revisions and improvements are fantastic (like auto saving to a library, all in one capture, video capture, etc).
Use your current screenshot package to take your screenshots, and then use imagemagick to crop to the specified aspect ratio.
A second option would be to ask for this as a feature (or make the change yourself) in an open source piece of software like greenshot.
How about just opening Paint to paste your screen shot and crop it?
It runs in the background, does not consume much memory and I assigned a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl, shift + A), so at any time with my left hand I can capture anything in an instant.
Cropper & Snipping Tool (available natively in the Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows 7) are free screen capture utilities that you can try.
You'd need to write some kind of program around the imagemagick as I can't see an easy way of cropping to a specific aspect ratio whilst keeping the width constant.
Also, if you have Office OneNote it has a lightweight companion utility that can do exactly what you want.
