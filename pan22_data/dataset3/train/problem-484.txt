This is the decision version of what is sometimes called "Approximate Graph Isomorphism."
While I won't say it's been studied a lot, it has been studied.
They also show that in the weighted case, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard if either weighted adjacency matrix has unbounded rank or negative eigenvalues (so the easy cases are a subset of PSD matrices of bounded rank).
[GRW] show that computing the minimum number of mismatches is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard even on trees.
This problem is also sometimes called "graph similarity" (which I consider a much more general term) or "graph matching" (which you'll have a hard time Googling because you'll get a lot of stuff about matchings), and has apparentely been studied more in the ML and data mining literature.
In particular, [AKKV] show that one can approximate the maximum (over bijections $V(G) \to V(H)$) of the number of matches to any constant factor in $n^{O(\log n)}$ time, but that any constant-factor approximation to the minimum number of mismatches is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard.
