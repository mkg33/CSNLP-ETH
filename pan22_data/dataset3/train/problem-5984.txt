xcopy /I srcdir\dir1\dir2\file1.txt* destdir\dir1\dir2\file1.txt results in destdir\dir1\dir2\file1.txt\file1.txt
Included in Vista and beyond, optional (from resource kit tools) in earlier versions.
The copy line copies the file called file in directory locationA to locationB and names the file the same thing.
If you want the ability to synchronise the copy and other advanced features (ignore certain folders, only include certain wildcards) then look at robocopy.
xcopy has been deprecated and will likely be phased out of use in the near future.
Trick is to use the /I option and throw an asterisk at the end of the file name so xcopy thinks you're copying multiple files, otherwise it asks you if the target name is the file name you want, or the directory name you want.
xcopy will create the directory structure for you.
if not exists checks the parameter to see if it exists, but it only works on files.
The above command creates an additional directory level with the name of the source file.
If you want to rename the file at the same time, you can do that too:
I'd also look at RoboCopy, but you need to get it from the resource kit as it's not in Windows until Vista.
Creating scripts with robocopy will future-proof them.
To check for existence of a directory, you need to look for a 'pseudo-file' called "nul" - checking for existence of this file will always return true if the directory exists.
