So during the grid search, for each permutation of hyperparameters, the custom score value is computed on each of the 5 left-out folds after training on the other 4 folds.
If I have only $y$ and $y_{pred}$ (again: the ground truths and predicted probabilities for the left-out fold, respectively) when the custom_scorer method is called, I don't know which rows belong to this fold.
I'm doing a GridSearchCV, and I've defined a custom function (called custom_scorer below) to optimize for.
But suppose the scaler_value returned by custom_scorer depends not only on $y$ and $y_{pred}$, but also knowledge of which observations were assigned to the left-out fold.
I need a way to track which rows of training_data get assigned to the left-out fold at the point when custom_scorer is called, e.g.
custom_scorer is a scaler-valued function with 2 inputs: an array $y$ containing ground truths (i.e., 0's and 1's), and an array $y_{pred}$ containing predicted probabilities (of being 1, the "positive" class):
