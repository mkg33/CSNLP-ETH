By adding the IP helper-address command at the gateway the layer 3 device can forward the UDP request from the computer for DHCP to the server (and other protocols such as TFTP(port 69), DNS (port 53), BOOTP (port 67, 68), TACACS (port 49), the older Time service (port 37, not NTP), NetBIOS (port 137, 138).
HP Procurve uses the same command, IP helper-address 111.222.333.444 as Ron mentioned is used for Cisco IoS.
Each VLAN is a broadcast domain, so essentially you have to put a DHCP server on each VLAN.
Broadcast, as you may know, can't traverse a layer 3 boundary (a router or layer 3 switches).
I just wanted to add the "why" you need to use this command if you want to use one DHCP server for multiple VLANs/subnets.
If you're using Cisco devices, you can configure a single DHCP server for all vlans.
Cisco SMB switches like the SG300 use ip dhcp relay address 111.222.333.444.
Since a layer 2 network is broadcast domain the DHCP request from a computer normally will stay within its VLAN because it's a UDP broadcast.
Good afternoon, I'm learning how to build a network, and I'm trying to add a DHCP server for all VLAN's, but I donÂ´t understand how to make it work for all hosts regardless of whether they are on the other router.
