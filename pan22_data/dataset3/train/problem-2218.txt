Thus, either $(u,1)$ or $(v,1)$ must be in $S'$ and as a result at least one vertex of the $n$-trail or $n$-path is in $S'$.
vertex cover of $n$-walks is NP-complete for any constant $n \ge 1$
vertex cover of $n$-trails and vertex cover of $n$-paths are NP-complete for any constant $n \ge 1$
Take as input the vertex cover instance $(G, k)$ and output $(G_n, k)$ where directed graph $G_n$ is defined as follows:
I'm not talking about the length of the list of vertices comprising the trail/path/walk).
For example, a vertex cover of 1-trails in $G$ is just a vertex cover of the undirected version of $G$.
The decision version of your problem, which I will refer to as the vertex cover of $X$s problem (for various $X$) takes as input a directed graph $G$ and a value $k$ and asks whether there exists a vertex cover of $X$s in $G$ of size at most $k$.
It is know that the problem is hard even for very special graph classes.
We construct directed graph $G'$ by including each edge from $G$ twice: once in each direction.
Then the output instance of vertex cover of $n$-walks is $(G', k)$
For every edge $(u,v)$ in $G$, there exists an $n$-walk in $G'$ that just goes back and forth between $u$ and $v$.
Since $|S'| = |S| \le k$, this proves one direction of our proof.
Define an $n$-trail, $n$-path, and an $n$-walk to be a trail, path, or walk respectively, of length $n$.
Therefore this $n$-walk includes at least one vertex in $S$.
Since $n \ge 1$, this walk includes both endpoints of some edge.
$S'$ must contain a vertex from this $n$-walk, so $S'$ must contain a vertex in $(u,v)$.
Next suppose that $G$ contains some vertex cover $S$ with $|S| \le k$.
Furthermore, $|S| \le |S'| \le k$, so this concludes the proof.
Note that the existence of this edge in $G_n$ implies that $(u,v)$ is an edge in $G$.
Let $S = \{x~|~(x, i) \in S'\text{ for some }i\}$.
Thus $G$ contains a vertex cover of size at most $k$ ($S'$ in particular).
Next suppose that $G_n$ has a vertex cover of $n$-trails or a vertex cover of $n$-paths $S'$ of size at most $k$.
I'm going to use the term length for a trail/path/walk to mean the number of edges in it.
First suppose that $G$ has a vertex cover $S$ of size at most $k$.
We have shown that $S'$ contains at least one endpoint of every edge of $G$ and has size $\le k$.
This $n$-trail or $n$-path must include some edge of the form $((u, 1), (v, 1))$ (this is because all of the other edges together form a set of disjoint $(n-1)$-paths, and it is therefore impossible to select an $n$-trail or $n$-path using just the other edges).
For example, in the case $n = 3$, it is NP-hard for cubic planar graphs of girth 3.
The problem is NP-complete for any $n \geq 2$ (see for example this).
We claim that $S'$ is both a vertex cover of $n$-trails and a vertex cover of $n$-paths in $G_n$.
As desired, $S'$ is both a vertex cover of $n$-trails and a vertex cover of $n$-paths.
The vertex cover instance is an undirected graph $G$ with a value $k$ such that the answer is "yes" if and only if there exists a vertex cover of size $\le k$.
On the positive side, there are constant-factor approximations algorithms, at least for some special cases.
Thus $G'$ contains a vertex cover of $n$-walks of size at most $k$ ($S$ in particular).
First suppose that $G'$ contains some vertex cover of $n$-walks $S'$ with $|S'| \le k$.
Define a vertex cover of $X$s in some directed graph $G$ to be a set of vertices such that every $X$ in $G$ contains at least one vertex in the set.
The path $(u, 1), (v, 1), (v, 2), ..., (v, n)$ is both an $n$-trail and an $n$-path.
First some definitions in order to make the ideas in my proofs more concise:
