I went from 130KB/s scan i/o speed in testdisk to 11-13MB/s after the fix, and I was able to recover data at +100MB/s from as far back as the very first time I used my similar drive.
Looking a little deeper, most of my harddrives have not only been rescued thanks to seemingly arcane methods, but most are actually still in service today!
It really grinds my gears seeing people just agree with the status quo on electronics hardware, especially harddrives, along the lines of "it's bad, replace it."
and perform entries 1 & 2 again (reading mod, patching, and writing back)
The re-lo list contains info about which sectors need to be relocated, which in WD's case happens quite nearly every time on a failed read.
Note: It may tell you it's failed on the final step.
Clear the damn table and see how things go (AKA do a non-destructive sector scan AFTER this procedure):
What you've just done: You've cleared the SMART status, and the file relocation list.
Step 2) Get yourself hddsupertool (Unless you follow the manual method) here.
Key notes: Back your stuff up, c'mon, you should no matter what.
Western Digital have been very naughty in their fast-and-loose determination of which sectors make it to the re-lo table.
If you've done this, then you really have nothing to lose by trying this.
You have a warning about Reallocated Sectors Count:
Run as root, select the device, and select the VSC entry.
Step 1) Make sure the drive can be seen on the bus:

This means the tiniest vibration, a slight cord stretch, or fairies bangin' on the platters.
