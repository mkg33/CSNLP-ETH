Hopefully one of these will get the functionality you're looking for.
If you're looking to make the file such that your co-workers can edit within Word when Visio is installed, you may need to create a new Visio embedded object within Word.
However, for any Visio diagrams that I paste into my document, I do not see an Insert Caption option in the right click context menu.
I do not seem to have this issue if I do a paste special (CTRL+E, S) and choose bitmap or any other option.
Next, I would try to embed the existing Visio diagram into your document.
First off, instead of copying and pasting the Visio diagram from Visio into Word, have you tried dragging and dropping the Visio diagram file itself into the Word document?
I would like the Visio diagrams to be editable by anyone who has Visio installed on their PC from within the Word document itself.
I am trying to add a figure caption to a Visio diagram that I have inserted into a word document and I am having some trouble.
Unfortunately, I only have Visio 2010 and Word 2010, but I hope some of this translates to Word 2013 decently.
Try going to Insert > Object > Create New > Microsoft Visio Drawing > "OK".
Then you will need to copy and paste your existing Visio diagrams into the newly created embedded object.
For example, if I right click on any inserted image in my word document, I get an option in the context menu to Insert Caption
