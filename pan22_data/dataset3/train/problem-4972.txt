I use the following configuration and it logs config commands, as well as a few others like 'enable':
Have a look at this IOSHints post: CLI command logging without TACACS+.
Since your question is not restricted to IOS: on Cisco ASA devices you can see executed commands in the syslog.
Is there a way to monitor a user's input on a cisco device?
And the title seems to imply it can also be done with TACACS+.
Configuration mode can be done with "show history").
Clarification: the commands a user have entered as in configuration mode AND normal mode.
I did this because I already had splunk in place for monitoring and reporting.
Also include a line for any other enable levels that you may use.
So you could filter for such messages, for example using grep and a cron job.
Of course you need to have the required severity level set, here 5 for notification.
I used splunk for directly receiving and storing firewall syslog messages, programmed a daily running alert which sends me all ASA syslog lines containing "executed" as a summary email.
