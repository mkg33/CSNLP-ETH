I also heard that editing the hosts file won't let me see the site on every PC because the virus protection someone has could prevent the PC using the hosts file (or something along that line).
The problem is that my IP address can change and each time the hosts file needs to be edited.
As it stands, if I do not edit the hosts file and try to get to the website, Internet Explorer will just display "The page can't be displayed".
That is not a problem for me, but I have users without admin rights who can't edit that file.
1- On your your VirtualBox system install and configure dnsmasq
This makes me think that it gets to the server but can't show the page?
What could be a clue is that even when I delete all the memory for the browser, the IP address will still redirect to myIP.myWebsite.com.
Until recently I had always accessed it by typing the ip address into the browser.
I would like an alternative to editing the hosts file.
In case it wasn't clear my question is: What is an alternative to editing the hosts file on the users PC?
Use an DNS server , if you have admin right on your server inside virtualbox ?
Now I have given it a domain name myIP.myWebsite.com and am trying to access it by typing that domain name into my browser.
I you want more informations about this ,let me know.
For the other DNS requests... probably, the most simply solution is to upstream all other domains with dnsmasq and with your 'default' dns server ...
then this will work and my website will load by entering either the IP address or the domain name.
2- Add a type A DNS entry into dnsmasq conf: address=\www.myWebsite.lan
NOTE: This solution is for IPv4 only and must be repeated for IPv6
(If I enter the IP address it will redirect to the domain name.)
If you need any more information, please let me know.
This server is either on VirtualBox or on a standalone box that I run an Ethernet cable to.
