If the bucket is in the Standard US region, then you must use the s3.amazonaws.com endpoint.
Is it actually possible to allow such thing, or are s3 buckets locked up to one region?
Instead, you would need to connect via the public internet to the bucket in region B from your VPC in region A.
When you use this endpoint, if the bucket is in a non-Standard US region, then you will be redirected to the correct endpoint.
Every time I try I get a "The Bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint.
Please see http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region for full S3 Region explainations.
And https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpce-gateway.html#vpc-endpoints-limitations
This is the only region/endpoint where this trick works.
If you want to connect from a VPC in region A to a bucket in region B, it is not sufficient to connect an S3 endpoint to your VPC, as you can only access buckets from Region A via this endpoint.
If you use the correct endpoint for your bucket, you can access the bucket from any region.
All buckets are reachable by using the s3.amazonaws.com endpoint.
I would like to allow EC2 servers based in us-east-1 to read content from a bucket in us-west-2.
