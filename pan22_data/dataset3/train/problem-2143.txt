You can also then clean up the folder "Spotlight-V100-old" that will now appear on your hard drive.
This will force a reindex of your data, since the above just removed all references to the spotlight index.

To completely rebuild the index, run the following from Terminal.app:
I solved the same problem by adding /Applications to Spotlight's Privacy tab (this forces Spotlight to delete any index for the folder), waiting a few minutes, then removing /Applications from the Privacy settings.
The solution was to type the following in the Terminal:
There's an Applications checkmark in the list of things to include in Spotlight (System Preferecens, Spotlight).
Did you make sure that in System Preferences - Spotlight, the Applications category is still checked ?
In my case, the 'Privacy settings' tricked failed, with an error message when trying to remove the hard drive from the privacy list, indicating my whole index was really messed up.
If it still is, try unchecking and then rechecking it.
