In many curricula, binary representation of integers is covered quite early, and if that's the case, explaining why int types can't hold extremely long integers is straightforward.
In other words, if $\mathbb{F}$ is the set of values representable by a floating point number, $\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{F}$ (the integers are a subset of the values represented by floats).
The issue of large integers not being represented by integers in some languages is more difficult to explain without stating the way that integers are stored.
Whether this explanation is useful would depend on your students' proficiency with mathematics and set theory.
If your students are mathematically inclined, you could simply think of the variable type as a constraint on the value contained inside of it.
For younger years, you could simply skip the subset discussion and show a Venn diagram to represent the idea that a float can be an integer, but an integer type can only represent an integerâ€”not all floats are whole numbers, but all whole numbers can be floats.
