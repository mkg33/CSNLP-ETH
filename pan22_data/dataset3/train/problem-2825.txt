in Windows you can use ping -f -l 1472 <destination IP> to check for 1500 byte MTU all the way to the .
Ping uses ICMP echo requests, the ICMP packet and the encapsulating IPv4 packet cause 28 bytes of overhead.
-l 1472 adds 1472 bytes of test data to the packet headers for a total size of 1500 bytes.
Obviously, to test for other MTU sizes you subtract 28 from the desired MTU and use that with -l.
Here's a sample of tracepath output from the lab pictured above, with the MTU of F0/1 reduced to 1400 bytes using the ip mtu command:
You can test path MTU discovery across a live network with a tool like tracepath (part of the Linux IPutils package) or mturoute (Windows only).
The -f option sets the 'Don't Fragment' bit to avoid fragmentation (which would hide the inability to transport the requested packet in whole).
The easiest way to check supported MTU sizes is ping - provided your routing nodes support echo requests/replies.
If you get a fragmentation error or no reply at all the destination path does not support the tested MTU.
