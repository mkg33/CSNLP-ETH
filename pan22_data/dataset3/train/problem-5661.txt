Try to configure with out cloning the MAC and see what happens.
If you are be sure to add the needed MAC addresses of your local systems.
It may be an ISP problem, or it may be DNS issues.
Turns out there was a problem with my ISP and the modem wasn't getting any connection to the internet (though I did have connection to the router).
But it has been a long time since I needed to use PPPoE.
As Pulse stated, make sure you check if you can even connect to the internet at all.
Also verify that you are not using some sort of MAC filtering on your router.
Thank you to all but I find the solution (and the problem).
My ISP has set the TTL to 1...so I have to change the router :)
You might not have to clone your MAC at all if I remember correctly.
If this is a DNS related problem, as the error message suggests, it's worth checking to see if you have any connectivity at all.
For more things to check, see 10 Ways to Troubleshoot DNS Resolution Issues.
Check If both the PC and laptop are set to automatically obtain the DNS server.
If the former fails and the latter works, it means you're not correctly configured to resolve DNS addresses.
