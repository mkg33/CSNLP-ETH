Of course, you can also recreate the 'default' network via the virt-manager or other GUI ..
It doesnâ€™t seem to be a dependency of the main packages you need to install to get KVM running.
Maybe RDO has different approach on libvirt networking?
Question is which networking devices are available?
By default I don't have any pre-configured network devices for libvirt.
You probably can work around this if you are willing to poke around the innards of libvirt config files, and modify all relevant configuration file defaults.

You may be missing the libvirt-daemon-config-network RPM.
The error message can also be made more useful and explanatory ..
This is actually expected behaviour it seems .. something to do with how NAT forwarding is set-up by default.
Although I did directly with kvm, still wondering about error.
My original purpose is to create centos image for openstack.
This will populate the files required... then execute the command:
So, if you delete that network, virt-install would no longer run as expected.
The system expects a 'default' network, bound to virbr0.
To recreate the network, first move off the network currently assigned to virbr0, and then:
