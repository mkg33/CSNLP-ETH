At worst an XML file (like any text file) could be used to store information harvested by spyware.
XML files are just used to store information in a particular format.
Googling octalforty Exile 1.7 shows that it is a Password Manager.
You appear to have last used Exile to open the file C:\Users\me\Desktop\OctilePasswordfile.pws, presumably a password file.
This file looks like a configuration file for some program named octalforty Exile 1.7.
XML files are used by a lot of programs to store data that applies to things like configuration and database type information.
I don't think an XML file can be spyware on its own.
This file appears to be a general configuration file (probably in the AppData folder or the program folder).
Octalforty Exile is an open-source (free) password manager available from The Code Project.
It's possible that this Exile app is spyware, but there's really not enough to make a decision here.
I can't think of any instance where an XML file itself could be spyware; it's just a text file.
