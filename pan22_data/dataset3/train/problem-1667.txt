They are both officially supported in ESX4 Update 1:
you can search here - Select the Guest/Host tab - for supported guest operating Systems.
Has anyone heard any announcements from vmware as to when these will be officially supported?
They are also both officially supported in ESX 3.5 Update 5:
You can install 2008 R2 on an ESX4 RTM host, as long as you do a custom tools installation and don't install the SVGA driver or the Shared Folders driver since both have compatibility issues.
Googling around only provides info about installing the RC version of windows 7, we already have the release version from our MAPS subscription.
I see that it seems fully supported in ESXi 4.01, maybe I should give the update a run see if it fixed some of these issues.
Windows 7 is supported under ESX 4 windows 2008 up to sp2 is supported under ESX 3.5U4 and 4
This being said there are a few rough edges that gan throw you in a spin if you are not carefull :
These issues have been fixed in u1 and u5 for 4 and 3.5 respectively.

Windows 2008 R2 will probably be supported in the next minor release.
I wouldn't expect to much official support in ESX 3.5.
They are usually pretty tight lipped about stuff until it comes out.

I'm wondering if ESXi 3.5 will support them or ESXi4 ?
