I was offended at first but I gave it a try and it is fun it takes effort but it is worth it.
I would suggest you spend some time learning the file tree, how it works and what the files and folders are used for.
There may be a series of commands that could potentially save the day and undo what has been done, but if you are just planning on typing in commands that you never understand you will always have problems.
After you reinstall do not make,remove, or delete files and folders before you check simple things like spelling, punctuation and spacing as you type them in the terminal.
You can mess up and just burn a new image to reinstall and keep going a million times.
If you always have problems you are not having fun, and if you are not having fun what is the point.
Make sure you use sudo or have permission to do what are trying to do.
This is not the answer you are looking for, but they way you asked the question and what you are asking for I believe this is the answer you need.
By taking time to learn about your system and how it works you wont need to reinstall a million times.
You stated you did not think you had a boot folder, and also you made a boot folder to create a config.txt file.
If you have started making or building files and directories and moving things or deleting things you are going to spend a lot of time trying to fix things that never should have been messed with.
I will tell you this..you may have deleted, moved or renamed it but at one time you did.
I personally do NOT mess around with folders like boot without caution and backing up my system.
Burn Raspbian or NOOBS from Raspberrypi.org according to the instructions given on the downloads page.
