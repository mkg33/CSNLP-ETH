I usually use a sparse bundle; There was a reason I wanted a case sensitive host fs.
I would highly recommend that you perform a total system backup using Carbon Copy Cloner.
Can't install Photoshop on case-sensitive hard drive?
You can create a case insensitive disk image in the disk utility (i use a sparse bundle), then drag the application in that disk image and run it.
I haven't used it, but iPartition claims to be able to do nondestructive conversion between case-sensitive and case-insensitive HFS+.
In fact, I would recommend CCC over TM, but you should use what you feel comfortable with.
Carbon Copy Cloner does support restoring to a case-insensitive system from a case-sensitive one - see this.
It looks like you can restore from time machine to a case-insensitive file system from a case-sensitive one.
I use Photoshop on Mac all the time and the default filesystem has never been a problem.
The only OS that has ever done this is DOS, and of course Windows is backwards compatible to its DOS roots.
Maybe there's no need to reformat your case sensitive fs to run apps that require a case sensitive fs;
I would also boot to the CCC image and make sure all my stuff was there before I wiped my internal drive and did the restore.
There isn't a good reason to have case insensitive filesystems by default.
CCC makes a bootable back up (which is another reason it's awesome).
