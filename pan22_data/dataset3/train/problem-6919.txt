[7] Determining dynamical equations is hard / Cubitt, Eisert, Wolf
[5][6] are overviews of phase transition behavior across NP complete problems by Moore, Walsh.
Observed Universality of Phase Transitions in High-Dimensional Geometry, with Implications for Modern Data Analysis and Signal Processing
there is a general connection found in [7] possibly explaining some of the underlying reasons for frequent "overlap".
I advice you to start with this PhD thesis, there you'll find more references
There is a relatively recent research trend (15 years or so) of mixing statistical physics of disordered systems and discrete, combinatoric, optimization problems.
[4] is a survey/ video lecture on phase transitions and computational complexity by Moshe Vardi.
The link is through the Boltzmann probabilities, and the computational hardness is related to the multiplication of metastable states of the physical system.
Here is an example of the type of literature I am seeking:
the exact same transition point does turn up in very theoretical analyses of computational complexity/ hardness eg [3] that also relate to early studies of transition point behavior in clique problems by Erdos.
[9] Predecessor and Permutation Existence Problems for Sequential Dynamical Systems / Barret, Hunt III, Marathe, Ravi, Rosenkrantz, Stearns.
the connection to statistical physics and spin glasses was uncovered mainly via "phase transitions" in the mid 1990s and that has led to a large body of work, see Gogioso[1] for a 56p survey.
[8] The steady state system problem is NP-hard even for monotone quadratic Boolean dynamical systems / Just
chaotic behavior in NP complete systems is analyzed in [11].
Spin glasses models are provable isomorphic to most discrete optimization problems.
[3] The Monotone Complexity of k-Clique on Random Graphs / Rossman
[12] New quantum algorithm for studying NP-complete problems / Ohya, Volovich
[1] Aspects of Statistical Physics in Computational Complexity / Gogioso
(also goes by Analysis Problems for Graphical Dynamical Systems: A Unified Approach Through Graph Predicates)
[11] On chaotic behaviour of some np-complete problems / Perl
then there is scattered but maybe increasing study of the diverse connections of dynamical systems with computational complexity and hardness in a variety of contexts.
refs [8][9][10][11] are diverse but show a reoccuring theme/ crosscutting appearance between NP complete problems and various dynamical systems.
[10] A Dynamical Systems Approach to Weighted Graph Matching / Zavlanos, Pappas
the phase transition coincides with what is known as "the constrainedness knife edge" in [2].
One classical paper, which, to be sincere I donÂ´t understand that well is:
in these papers there is some concept/ examples of a hybrid link between discrete and continuous systems.
[4] Phase transitions and computational complexity / Moshe Vardi
the paper you cite by Ercsey-Ravasz, Toroczkai is very crosscutting; it fits in with/ touches on several lines of NP complete problem/ complexity/ hardness research.
Has anyone written a survey, or made a bibliographic compendium?
A somewhat similar ref to Ercsey-Ravasz/ Toroczkai in the area of quantum algorithms in that the dynamical system is found to run "apparently" in P-time [12]
I am interested in learning connections between "chaos," or more broadly, dynamical systems, and
