We recently had to rebuild one of our cloud servers (we use Rackspace).
Also, if I run Unison manually from the command line, I see no errors.
It appears the sync is working but I'm getting several emails each time it runs with that error.
Once live again, I allowed a cron job to run which syncs a couple of files outside source control from the original server to the newly rebuilt server, using Unison.
I have checked permissions and content of the id_rsa/id_rsa.pub keys, authorized_keys, etc, and they seem fine.
Can anyone suggest why this might have suddenly started happening?
However, since the rebuild, I'm getting emails from Cron Daemon giving me the following error:
All servers are almost identical, and a snapshot of another server was used.
Essentially this SSH's and compares files between the two then copies across/deletes/whatever files between the two machines.
The weird thing here is that if I login as the same user that the cron job runs under and SSH to the same server (using the same keys for auth) I don't see any errors.
What's more, if I turn off Unison's silent mode then the output from a successful Unison batch job is shown in the console, and this same output is shown in an email, but I still get several others with the errors as above whenever the cron job runs.
