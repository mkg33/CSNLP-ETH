If you just want the text, there are various tools to extract text from a PDF.
Note that you do not necessarily need Adobe Acrobat to do this, there are other PDF slicing programs out there (see other SU questions).
I don't know if you have a requirement that the document you're working on be completed in a Word-compatible format, but if you have a PDF editor I would complete the document (possibly using blank spacer pages if you need accurate page numbering), use a PDF printer to turn it into a PDF, and then splice in the extra pages afterwards.
While you can create an image and then insert it, it will likely look of poor quality (pixelation).
I always use Powerpoint in these situations because it has this "Save as picture" feature.
Easiest would probably be to open the PDF, hit PrntScrn, paste into Paint, crop borders, then copy+paste from paint to Word.
If you want to retain formatting, the route of splicing the PDF file is probably easiest, as in the other answers.
I don't know about the easiest but the highest fidelity would probably be to load the PDF file into Adobe Illustrator, save the page as an EPS file, and insert that ("Insert" -> "Picture" -> "From file...") onto a blank Word page.
(Export to HTML and then insert a whole image is the only way I could think of.
Let me explain; I have a PDF document (some legal stuff), not made by me.
You may also use Paint.NET for the "crop and merge"
Advantage: You dont need need "new" tools or software (Since you have MS Word, I assume you have Powerpoint also)
The author of the document has no objections, and I need to insert a few pages of that document in a Word file I'm writing (in an Appendix).
That would allow (and force) you to reformat the text as you like.
I donot recommend MS Paint, the pictures can turn out to be low fidelity or of vary large size.
Not sure about easiest, but it'll probably have the highest quality.
