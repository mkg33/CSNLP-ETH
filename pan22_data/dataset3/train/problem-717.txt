Additional reduction in memory footprint can be achieved by REMOVING from your my.cnf the following to allow defaults to serve your system.
You have over done your setup and the sql database is set for a possible overload,  also you have a duplicate max-connection.
My innodb_buffer_pool_size is at 16Go, for 32Go RAM that should be ok, I don't know what to do for optimize this.
This will reduce high cpu utilization for creating/breaking down connections.
Keeping your innodb_buffer_pool_size at 16G for now is fine since you only have 2.4G of data per MySQLTuner.
Use mysqlcalculator.com  for a quick check on approximate RAM utilization
Consider changing or adding the following in my.cnf
For a 32gb server the my.cnf should look more like this.
The thing is, my memory general usage in the server is always under 89% (plus for caching).
There were 141 threads created to serve 196K connections in your 1 day 16 hrs uptime.
This the principal variables in my.cnf I adjusted which could have an effect on this:
My mysqltuner seems to indicate as MariaDB can use 142% of RAM :
