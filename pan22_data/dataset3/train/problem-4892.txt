Loose cables are the most common cause of problems like this.
If so, back then the Intel coolers weren't really up to running anything more than standard desktop applications.
Try removing the motherboard from the case and power it up.
The PSU seemed to work okay in every other way, even in another machine.
I had a Seasonic 430W PSU which did the same thing when I tried booting with a second HDD attached.
I assume you removed the RAM when doing your minimal-system test?
I also suggest unplugging all cables from the motherboard and PSU, then reattaching them.
Perhaps thermal cycling caused some piece of lead-free solder to crack, somewhere on the underside of the board, for instance.
If you wanted to run anything really CPU intensive, you had to get an aftermarket cooler to keep the system running at spec.
Perhaps your motherboard turns off automatically if the detected fan speed is zero?
Speck of dust got between and is now shorting two contacts?
If you have to connect the liquid cooler to the fan pins on the motherboard so it can present a "virtual" fan to the motherboard (I have absolutely no idea if this is the case, just an idea off of left field), maybe something with the cooler is defective.
Even though you know that the PSU is good, try using another one.
It could be a shortcut between the case and the motherboard standoff (the brass cilinders).
Do a detailed visual inspection, ideally with a magnifier.
If it is the motherboard, it could be any number of things.
If you see broken solder or a leaking capacitor, well ....
I also agree with the other answer, and I would suggest checking your case cooling and temperatures as a good idea.
