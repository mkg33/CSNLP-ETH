Just about all Linux setups have both command line support and GUI support (enter sftp://server.domain.tld/ or similar into the default file manager on Ubuntu for instance) out of the box and there are several good clients for Windows (I use WinSCP for GUI use and Cygwin's OpenSSH package for command line use, though WinSCP supports command line use too).
If that is NOT enabled, that means that means that vsFTP is set to passive mode, which will require that you open up a range of ports in the firewall above 1024.
I square it with my users by explaining the better security and efficiency, and if that fails I go with "if you really want to use FTP then please consider using a different service".
That sets vsFTP to active mode and thus will connect back to the client via port 20.
Though my general recommendation, assuming you can square it with your users is to use SFPT/SCP via SSH instead of FTP.
By default, vsftp.conf should have the following line:
I've taken to just not using it at all (replacing it the the more secure and efficient SCP or SFTP as provided by most SSH packages, or (better still) rsync over ssh where available).
