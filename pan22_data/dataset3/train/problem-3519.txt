Anyone can share with anyone, but they need to have a Google account (the only downside I have found).
Basically, you create an event/meeting, and then put all your invitees on a list, then they indicate through the site what time is good for them.
You can set up multiple calendars, and then choose to share it with other contacts, either just busy/free time or more information.
I have been looking for a similar service for a while, it is not perfect but I found that Google Calendar Seems to work.
I've never used it, but it looks like it does exactly what you want, and they don't require a sign up/account.
Meeting Wizard isn't the same as Outlook, but it might meet your needs:
You can share events with anyone and other websites, but I have not found a way to share or put the calendar on another site (but this wasn't one of your requirements!)
I tested this for a group I'm involved with, but they preferred to continue sending emails!
You can select which calendars to show events from and then switch to day / week e.t.c.
