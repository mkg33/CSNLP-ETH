Just to be sure: changing the interval won't change what Time Machine keeps.
(I don't know what happens if you set the interval to value less than an hour.)
Open it with your text editor of choice and find these lines:
The following commands will cause Time Machine to run every 3 hours on average, up from the standard 1 hour:
I haven't yet found a way to make the changes apply without a reboot, though.
So, for example: tweaking will not save you any disk space.
Between the integer tags is the backup interval in seconds.
(You'll only notice when you change the same files a lot, and then you'll still only see the change in the hourly backups which are expired soon anyhow.)
Under /System/Library/LaunchDaemons there is an XML file called com.apple.backupd-auto.plist.
It will still only keep hourly backups for the last 24 hours, all first dailies for the last month, and all first weeklies until the disk is full.
After running these commands and rebooting, the next backup had changed to 4:19.
(But then: if you're changing the very same files a lot, then an hourly backup might be very welcome?)
Is it possible to change the frequency of when Time Machine performs its backup?
With OS X Mavericks, Apple changed the scheduling of background tasks to be managed by XPC Services, so instructions for earlier versions of OS X no longer work.
In my testing, Time Machine originally said the latest backup was at 1:39 and the next was to run at 2:38.
And unless you're changing the same huge files a lot, you probably won't notice a huge performance increase either, as it will simply need to backup more during each run, if you increase the interval.
Just remember it's an integer, so it has a maximum (2,147,483,647 signed I believe), in case you're trying to set it obnoxiously high to avoid backups.
