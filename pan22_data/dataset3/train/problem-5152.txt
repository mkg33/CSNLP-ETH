Furthermore, the data directory for this Arbiter shows bunch of files of total size >10GB.
If you try to manually reconfigure the arbiter as a regular node via rs.reconfig() you should get an exception similar to:
Is there option to prevent  arbiterOnly from becoming secondary?
I have a replica set consisting of two data replicas and one arbiterOnly.
A MongoDB arbiter cannot automatically become a secondary or a primary node, as it does not have a copy of the data set.
What is going to happen to these files when Recovery completes?
Some time ago my one of my data replicas which was secondary at a time crushed due to hard drive failure.
After I fixed that problem and restarted secondary it went into “Recovering” state.
The MongoDB documentation says that when a replica is added to the set as arbiterOnly=true it will not become Primary.
But can Arbiter become a secondary and what does it when it does?
You can always log into the arbiter mongod directly to see what data it appears to have.
If Arbiter can become truly a data node (even secondary) that opens up the whole new bag of worms: I need to have enough free disks available to Arbiter, right now I don't.
I would expect those files are unused (check the timestamps?)
