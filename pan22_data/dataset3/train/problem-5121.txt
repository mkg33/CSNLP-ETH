However, it will not break down the traffic per vitualhost.
Personally instead of using that, I wrote something that just scrapes the apache status page (you'd have to enable mod_status), something that's easily replicatable with an hour or three of scripting.
I've seen solutions that use apache mod_watch, but that package is pretty old and doesn't seem to be well maintained.
I use chartbeat.com to see realtime stats such as number of visitors, etc.
I think apachetop may be something you can use to satisfy the first two points:
You drop in their javascript code similar to how you drop in google analytics.
As external solution goes, I recommend using ntop which is a realtime network traffic analyzer.
As the real time logs can be very useful for the stuff that you need, you can pipe them to a database or some real time log analyzer and do the analysis yourself - but I'm not familiar with a specific software solution that does this and writing such a thing would take some serious development.
It has tons of features so it can take some time to figure out how to work this thing, but it does do full HTTP protocol analysis so it can show you what virtual hosts people are using to hit your site with - both in (near) real time and with history.
The free version will analyze up to 500MB of logfiles each day, which is a pretty busy website.
It isn't real time, but I believe it can be pretty darn close.
It is very not real time though - you're supposed to run it daily on your logs (using cron or something).
The last point it likely best done through log analysis, rather than through polling the apache status page repeatedly.
I often use munin for stuff like this, and there is an apache plugin.
Webalizer is a very good analysis tool that works on the apache logs - it will give you post-mortem per virtual host with client IPs and a lot of other useful information.
I'd recommend shipping your logs off to a splunk instance for analysis.
