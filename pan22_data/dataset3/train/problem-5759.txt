I changed speaker properties from 16 bit-48000 Hz to 24 bit-48000 Hz.
I had the same problem (Windows 7 x64) sound on the right speaker only.
I reinstalled Windows and get everything working out of the box.
Note that older Windows had problem with restarting such as when you have a problem with a driver, it may exist after resetting but shutting down since it was not like hibernation.
The motherboard card is a Realtek god-knows-whatever, and I have an extra Creative Fatal1ty PCI-E.
select 16bit,44100HZ(CD Quality) - This is the only option worked for me
If your problem still exist and everything is ok in the device manager, your motherboard could be the problem.
When you see booting screen, which says press F1 or other keys for entering boot up setting, press turn off button on your PC.
I had S/PDIF out from my tv to an optic to phono adaptor and one of the phono cables had broken.
MS changed how your PC is shut down in windows-8, in other words it is just like hibernation now.
Even though they are not connected to the Realtek card.
Therefore when you face with hardware related problem, you have to use restart since shutting down will not solve it.
After searching for a solution for a long long time, now I can not believe it was such an easy one...
You had this problem with 2 different sound cards and 2 different speakers so it seems it is because of OS or motherboard.
I had a "kind-of similar" issue with my 5.1 system under Windows 10.
I had this exact same issue, I ended up replacing the audio cables and its now working through both speakers.
I lost the sound from every speaker but the front ones!
My advice, if you have a Realtek driver installed, uninstall it, reboot and try again.
Installed the specific drivers from Creative, no problem.
