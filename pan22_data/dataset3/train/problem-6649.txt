You can also execute backups using the mysqldump command locally, and piping the output to a file.
then all you need is to scp them off nightly, unless of couyrse they are enormous and you are looking to do differential backups, which is a bit tougher with SQL.
I've got a cron job that dumps the databases with mysqldump into a directory that is backed up by TSM.
If it goes thru a public link either go thru ssh (with public key authentication) or OpenVPN with the remote rsync server listening only on secure IPs
Smart move - if you have a local linux server, ssh/scp, shared keys, and mysqldump are an obvious way to go.
If it's an internal network simple rsync with a password option should be enough
It's not a true binary copy of the data, but it's a copy of all the data in the table.
If you can you could install backupninja it will dump and can send it
You can set up mysqldump to dump to a directory, and then run rsync to move the dump over to the other server.
Even if your local backup server is a windows box, it shouldn't be too tough.
If you've already got a good network backup system I'd say to tie into that somehow.
