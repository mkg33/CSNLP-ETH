I need to protect only this one workstation so there is no need to have tons of features that support managing other clients.
It's almost the same thing as Forefront Client Security, only it's better suited for just one client; FCS would be a bit overkill.
Can Forefront Client Security be installed in a way it is client that protects one local machine without installing all server infrastructure?
Considering you're only using FCS for only one machine, you don't really need the extra features, so MSE is more than enough.
What security software do you recommend for workstation with Win2008R2 ?
The Forefront Security Team recently announced in September that Forefront Client Security is compatible with Windows Server 2008 R2.
Of course I can try with some other vendors solution for Win7 security product or even something like Comodo Internet Security (free version) but since I have MSDN subscription I would like to take advantage of that.
