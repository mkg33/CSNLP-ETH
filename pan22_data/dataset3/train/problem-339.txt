DOMAIN\Administrator is a domain account, not a local account.
Since the "DOMAIN\Domain Admins" group gets joined to the "Administrators" group on each computer you join to the domain, the effect is that the "DOMAIN\Administrtor" user becomes a member of the "Administrators" group on each computer joined to the domain.
No, Domain accounts are not explicitly added by default.
(An aside: You can override this behaviour with a "Restricted Groups" policy if you want, but that's a different question and another can of worms.)
As such it should be listed in the GROUPS section (implicitly or explicitly) in the Administrators group.
TheCleaner's answer is a bit unclear sounding to me, so I'm going to give it a go.
You will need to use Active Directory Users and Computers to check which groups the Administrator account for the domain is a part of in the domain itself (like Domain Administrators)
This assumes that either of those is in that group.
Best practice would be to never add individual accounts to a server.
As previously mentioned the domain admins group gets added by default not an account.
Take a look at this webcast on best practices for managing groups
The "DOMAIN\Domain Users" is joined to the joining computer's "Users" group.
By default, when you join a Windows machine to a domain the "DOMAIN\Domain Admins" group from the domain is joined to the joining computer's "Administrators" group.
So it will either show up as "DOMAIN\Administrator" in that group list, or it will be included in "DOMAIN ADMINISTRATORS" in that group list.

By default, the "DOMAIN\Administrator" account is a member of "DOMAIN\Domain Admins".
Always create a domain level group and add that to the local group on the server.
