Know the format and meaning of each field in the IP header.
Not unless you really want to get into lower-level stuff about how the Internet and TCP/IP works.
You'll probably want to eventually do your own DNS so be prepared to get into that.
Tools like iptables and tc are complex and will take you a long time to learn.
Basic knowledge of how TCP/IP works and how TCP/IP routing works, including the OSI model, and subnets.
I have learned a lot and like the level of control I have.
It's convenient to run your webserver on your router but sort of bad from a security perspective.
Knowledge of routing protocols such as RIP, OSPF, BGP isn't needed unless you want to do multi-site setups with multiple routers in your LAN (really complex stuff).
Never going back to a plastic router if I can help it.
You'll likely be dealing with getting an IP from your ISP via DHCP, as well as handing them out to hosts on the rest of your network via DHCP, so knowing about Linux DHCP client and server tools is as must.
