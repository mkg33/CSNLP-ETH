Second, how can I make sure these really are PowerPC disks, and aren't just Intel disks that are screwing it up (which I somewhat doubt)?
When booted from the startup disk and not the install disk, the computer boots and runs perfectly.
Thanks so much for the help, this is really weird.
I'm not entirely sure about this, but I think both of these disks are PowerPC versions.
First of all, is there any way I could avoid this and finally repair the disk (well I might be able to boot from another computer or something, but I doubt this is a normal problem)?
I tried again with a disk I burned of a disk image I got online (this is legal because I already legally own Tiger) and got the same exact problem.
I've ran disk utility's disk verify on Mac OS 10.4 on a PowerPC G4, and it told me the computer's volume should be repaired.
I lost the install disks for now, so I booted it off a Tiger installation disk from another computer, only to get a kernel panic (white text with a black background on top of the Apple logo while booting).
