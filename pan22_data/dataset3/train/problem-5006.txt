Can anyone recommend a good tool/framework to use for this, or any other method that they have found useful (i.e.
I'm partial to the Windows Installer XML toolset (WiX-- see http://wix.sourceforge.net/) because it's very easy to version the WiX source-code files in a version control repository, create and manipulate them with scripts, etc.
There are a boatload of tools to build MSI files out there (since some software manufacturers still don't understand that using the OS built-in installer is a good thing... >sigh<).
I am looking at using a software installation and configuration management framework/tool to automate building virtual images (based on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003/2008) for developers.
Chef runs on Windows, and is gaining support for managing more aspects of the OS.
(Doug has done a tremendous amount of great work in making Chef run better on Windows)
Assuming you have Active Directory in production, group policy software installation policy and MSI files (either off-the-shelf or custom-built) are a cheap way to do automated installs of applications onto computers.
It is still in the early phases of support and development.
Group policy is also a great way to configure the computer and user environment with consistent settings (using security options, administrative templates, startup scripts, mainly).
On the other hand, a full automated suite can very quickly and easily get you into silly money territory.
You can get up and running reasonably well using the Windows AIK and something like Wininstall LE (Google for both) without spending anything, but you'll have to do some of the work yourself.
