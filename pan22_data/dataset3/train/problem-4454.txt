Exact number will depend on the make and width of the walls in your hostel and the kind of APs you use.
Lastly you will need QoS provisioning for you VoIP packets, it will ensure voice packets are prioritized over normal internet traffic and calls are not dropped.
An important thing to remember is that if you are not providing internet access on the same wifi network users will probably not be connected to it all the time.
See if you can install SIP server on you existing wifi network, that should save you from buying all the APs and you will have more users online.
You will need a SIP server (lookup http://www.asterisk.org/) to authenticate and manage users and then VoIP clients on the phone and laptop for the users to place call.
QoS provisioning will get messy because most APs in the market wont let you do it, so I will suggest not thinking about it initially.
I am presuming you will use your own wifi routers,
Which will mean users will show up offline on SIP server and no calls will be places.
