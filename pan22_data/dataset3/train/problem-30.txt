If you are selling kits this may be a concern that a user bulds it wrong and fries the pi but if you plan to sell assembled boards I hope you will test to ensure it was assembled right :)
I don't know for sure if this will work before I fry my PIs.
The over voltage diodes present on the PI are not very high power zeners so act as destructive fail safe and intended to suppress inductive spikes not supply deregulation, bigger zeners with current limit would be needed.
Do you brilliant folks think this MSOFET circuit is correct and would work?
Note that pi zero does not have the same nominal input protection and is pretty "naked" already .
Regulator ics, either library or switch mode are pretty good , unless someone puts the wrong feedback resistor when building the shield I would not worry about it being wonky for your design .
It is worthwhile to put something there , tying gate to ground is only good to "first order" design, the extra stuff is for corner cases which will inevitably come up.
The supply would regulated at 5V 4A (Would be sharing the same power supply with a Thermal printer as well.
So 1.5-2 A for pi and 1.5-2 A for thermal printer -- checked).
I'm designing a HAT and need to supply power to PI zero W and PI 3B+ through the GPIO headers[2&4].
The additional complexity (U4) in the pi3 circuit is to ensure the pfet turns on completely, the nominal configuration you have works, but may not be good in all situations.
So decided to make my own simpler protection circuit.
I was following this thread before: That's where I felt the urgency for over current and reverse polarity protection.
Hence asking here for help and support and suggestions.
