Now, this question is more about how I should hunt and destroy it.
It seems to pop up at intervals of perhaps fifteen minutes or so.
I also tried looking through the currently running programs(Won't help if it's not running, though).
I've tried looking in my startup, but everything was set to disabled.
Despite this, I'm still tagging this question as both Malware and Virus, because I'm at a loss for figuring out what it is.
I've noticed it when I'm coding in Visual Studio, and it has even been booting me to desktop while I play some games.
I can't seem to figure out where it's coming from, either.
Just recently I started having a console window pop up on my desktop, flash for a fraction of a second, then vanish.
But that's no surprise because I can't remember the last time I actually had malware on my computer.
And I even looked through my services to see if I could spot anything that's starting up.
You see, because it's lifetime is so short, it's almost impossible to pinpoint.
So can someone tell me how I can detect this console application, kill it, and stop it from annoying me?
And, yes, I have ran Avast, and Malwarebytes...they say I'm clean...
