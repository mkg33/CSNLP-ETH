www is the conventional prefix, but it is not mandatory.
I am a web developer myself, but do not know the answer to this question.
It is completely at the discretion of the owner of the domain whether or not www or any other sub domain is used.
This is not a programming question, but something I was curious for a long time.
I notice some websites have just http:// in their address, with no www.
The www is a convention from when the web was small and much less important than it is today.
It is entirely optional (although can be useful for a domain to organize its cookies)
There are many sites out there that prefer not to use www and even some that think it should be deprecated.
foo.acme.com rather than www.foo.acme.com reads better.
http-colon-//delicious) and other websites have www.

Particularly if you already have a subdomain, skipping the extra www prefix just leaves a shorter address:
The www is not required, so some sites dispense with it.
