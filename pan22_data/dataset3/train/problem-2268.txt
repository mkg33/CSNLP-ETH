You could build out a few beefy workstations that meet the requirements of the software vendor and have the developers use remote X to run the app on that machine while displaying it on whatever linux distribution each developer likes.
You'd probably have the best results with Xen (CentOS is a well-supported guest), but it's worth noting that the Xen dom0 kernels are fairly out of date, and the Ubuntu users may not like that so much.
If the software runs just fine on non-supported distributions, you could let the developers do that, and simply provide an machine for them to replicate bugs on before speaking with support.
All work with official support would use the supported machine to replicate and perform troubleshooting on.
Xen, VirtualBox or VMware would be recommended if you want local access (QEMU is lacking in performance, even with the kqemu kernel module).
I have found NX to be very easy to use and configure (as compared to XDMCP.
The easiest way might be to run KVM headless in the background and log in to it through the virtual 'network' from the host machine.
If you want something similar to KVM without the need for Intel-VT/AMD-V and still achieve near native speeds, look at QEMU, which KVM is based on.
