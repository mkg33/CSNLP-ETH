If SELinux is enabled you need to change the security settings for the web server.
Check you have an SMTP server installed and running on the Horde server.
Connect to one of these and type each of the below commands:
Many ISP's expect you to use their outgoing smtp server to send mail, and not your own server.
If an SMTP server isn't running you'll get "connection refused" - in this case install something like Sendmail from your package repository.
See the relayhost parameter in the postfix configuration.
By default the web server daemon and any scripts it runs can't make any network connections, and you need one to send e-mail.
Just noticed the excerpt of your postfix log files.
That way the machines of their customers can't be abused to send spam.
Use the command getenforce to determine whether or not SELinux is enabled.
Try sending a test email via telnet and see if it works.
Depending on the mechanism used by Horde enabling mail functionality may be sufficient:
Easiest way to check this is from an SSH session on the Horde server:
If it goes through okay, the problem is likely to be with Horde - if this is the webmail client I'm thinking of, check your HTTP error log
You firstly need to find the MX for the domain you're sending to; in the case of gmail.com they are as follows:
If your internet connection is of the residential kind, your internet provider is likely to have blocked outgoing smtp traffic.
