Vagrant gives an error, and upon investigation I found that the VirtualBox inside my Ubuntu instance is not starting.
The "HardwareVirtEx*" configurations you are looking at refer to the top level Virtualbox installation and if it can use the hardware virtualization features of the CPU.
I am trying a Microservices demo that uses Vagrant to start up a VM and deploys software to the started machine.
One possible workaround might be to use VMWare or another virtualization platform that does support nested virtualization.
Because the demo is set up for Linux and I am using Windows (8.1 Pro), I am running the demo in a VirtualBox container on my Desktop, I am using the latest Ubuntu Desktop - V15.04
What you're asking for is called nested virtualization.
You can follow the feature-request on the Virtualbox ticket here.
I have verified that my host machine does have a CPU capable of virtualisation, and it is enabled in my BIOS.
Unfortunately, Virtualbox does not support it right now.
The error message I get from the VirtualBox GUI inside my VM is "VERR_VMX_NO_VMX", i.e.
My question: What can I do to get VirtualBox inside my guest Ubuntu to work?
it is complaining that virtualisation is not available to it.
I also checked the Virtualbox file and it has virtualisation enabled:
My understanding is it has nothing to do with support for nested virtualization.
