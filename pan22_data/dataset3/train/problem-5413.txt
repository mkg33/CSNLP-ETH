In this case, column A contains static, numeric information.
Use the Find/Replace dialog to search for an equals sign.
Yes, you will get false-positives on any static text that happens to include an equals sign, but searching in this way will jump to the next cell with an equals sign, and it will be quick to look at the formula bar to determine whether the cell's contents are static or a formula.
This will change your spreadsheet to show the formulas, rather than the evaluated values.
Click on the Formulas menu option (on the green bar.)
Next, click the Show button (it's the fifth button from the left,) and select Show Formulas.
Way's of showing/hiding the formulas has been different, but this feature has been around since probably the beginning of Excel.
I had the same problem and tried all solutions on internet but did not help.
Multiply any cell by 1 in some other convenient cell and drag result for all the cells.
I have found an innovative but very simple way, just try it.
I don't have access to a Mac to verify which options on the Find/Replace dialog you want to select, but you can easily check that it's doing what you want by entering =1+1 in a cell, and verifying that searching for = finds that cell.
FYI, this option has been around in Excel for as long as I've used it (going back to Excel 97.)
do a ctrl-g, select special and then pick formulas
