When I try to install Adobe Flash player I get this error:
The installer you are trying to use is corrupted or incomplete.
although you could try installing it in Vista compatibility mode, it's worth a shot.
Invalid installers are often (but not always) corrupted because they a)didn't finish downloading, or b) have been modified by a rootkit or virus.
Although you should verify you are downloading the appropriate installer then check out the supported browsers.
I've seen this on a Windows XP machine while installing various antivirus programs to clean up a rootkit.
I've had that issue with other programs on machines with rootkits.
You may want to contact the author of this installer to obtain a new copy.
I don't want to sound like I'm parroting the error message that you got.
This could be the result of a damaged disk, a failed download or a virus.
Adobe does not officially support that combination of browser and OS.
(Incidentally, the end result was a reinstall anyways - the virus was just too much for the machine.)
You could try uninstalling flash then reinstalling.
I have Flash working in Google Chrome in Windows 7 (32 bit).
I downloaded to a disc on a another machine and it ran some of the installers that way.
It may be possible to skip this check using the /NCRC command line switch
