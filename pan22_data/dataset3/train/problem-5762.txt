This probably isn't the most elegant way, but it did what I wanted.
So from the command line, you could do something like this
I believe this only works if the source audio files all have the same number of channels, but I've not tested this.
Step 1: convert to ogg (uses mplayer, pacpl and ruby, all available from the free Debian repos.
This will use ffmpeg to convert all your .wma files into .mp3, and then merge all the .mp3 files into a single file.
This might not be exactly what you need, but it should help
As far as I know, SoX has zero support for .wma files, so converting at least those files with something like ffmpeg first is probably unavoidable.
SoX can handle a large number of audio formats, depending on what libraries it's compiled against, and can concatenate files with a simple command line
Won't work for .ogg files, but mp3wrap can concatenate multiple .mp3 files into a single file.
