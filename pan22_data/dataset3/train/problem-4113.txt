The more I used to hibernate my laptop the worst it's performance seems to be.
As for the effect on your battery, it depends entirely on the type of chemical composition used in the battery.
I've seen a detriment on the disk usage which eventually and with the time makes it harder for the OS to restart ( assuming Windows here )
Apart from the small amount of extra battery usage, no.
If you're just browsing the web, sleep mode is fine, but I prefer to either keep the computer running (which I do, generally, 365 days a year) or shut it down completely.
See:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechargeable_battery
All the RAM used by the system is serialized into large files chunks which, seems to me  like they never get purged.
That's why hibernating is better if this would be a problem.
In years and years of experimenting with audio apps on both Windows XP and OSX, I can assure you that no system wakes up from "sleep" mode with all of its marbles in place.
eg Lithium-Ion and Nickel MEtal Hydride have different charging, usage and lifetime recommendations.
Obviously, if your laptop is sleeping and you lose AC power (ie on a desktop computer) or the battery goes completely flat, your RAM cannot be refreshed and you lose all state.
If you forget that you have it on sleep instead of hibernate, and you for some reason take out the battery, then that could frag your hard drive and not play nice with the OS.
