Apparently the iGPU Multi-Monitor setting under advanced/system agent configuration/graphics configuration needs to be turned on.
In my experience, if your BIOS is set to use PCI devices for the display, it will ignore the onboard.
It's not possible to use the output from the motherboard and gpu at the same time.
Only the monitor plugged into the graphics card is working.
Windows cant detect the monitor plugged into the motherboard.
You might have to buy a converter to do this, but that's the only solution.
This is labelled for being for virtu but is necessary for the integrated GPU to be detectable by windows, even if you arn't running virtu.
This might changed with later boards - but it was made possible by on die GPUs not using up PCIe lanes, and newer version of windows playing nice with more than one video card driver at a time.
Obviously the location of this may vary with different motherboard brands and the name of the setting may be different.
You GPU should have more than one output header so use them.
One is plugged into my graphics card using an hdmi cord, the other is plugged into my motherboard using another hdmi cord.
And if you set it to onboard, it will ignore the video card.
My guess is since lucid logix uses both GPUs, it tells the motherboard to simply run both - independent of whether you're running more than one monitor (with lucid outputting what you're rendering on the dedicated GPU to the integrated GPU), or using a multi-monitor set up taking advantage of both the IGPU and Dedicated GPU as independant outputs without lucid.
