They use a monitoring system that also has task scheduling features.
Are you referencing any mapped network drives in your script or program?
Changing the path(s) to UNC paths solved it for me.
It ended up being the "Start In" option in the Task Scheduler.
Change T:\Apps\MyProgram.exe to \\MyServer\MyShare\Apps\MyProgram.exe
Sorry that I didn't get the chance to evaluate more suggestions here, but thanks for trying to help anyway.
The event log said the program completed normally, but not even the first line of code would write to the log for me.
I found that when the configuration files for the application, which were stored in the applications folder in C:\program files (x86) directory were copied to application folder on c:\programdata.
The application would run from the exe, via batch file or clicking on a shortcut, but would not run from the task scheduler.
They've set it up through that and it appears to work.
It occurred to me that the program ran fine from the command line when I was in the current directory.
I had a similar issue a while back where my scheduled task would not run, and I couldn't figure out why.
I'm responding to an old post in case it helps someone else.
There are manifest files and other dependencies in the same directory.
The guys of the company that runs the servers of our customers said that a GUI program would not run via scheduled tasks in any way whatsoever.
I was attempting to start and old VB6 program using the task scheduler on a Windows 2008 R2 server.
I hope that it may help others in the future, which I think it certainly will.
So if you tell the scheduled job to start in the same directory as the EXE, you may get favorable results.
it appears that cmd.exe applies the configuration from a different location to that used by the task scheduler.
If your application has configuration files, you could try moving them to the c:\programdata\application folder.
