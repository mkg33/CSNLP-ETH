I don't really agree with the idea of "wanting" a point to be an outlier and then massaging the algorithm to make it so.
Beyond that theres not much you can do beyond some sort of nonlinear transformation which you know to be true due to some deterministic knowledge you have about a particular phenomenon.
Anyways... here's the two outlier version in case you weren't standardizing your data first:
b=[0.0352,0.0992,0.1570,0.1431,0.1634,0.1629,0.1046,0.1655,0.1635,0.1642,0.1658,0.1666,0.15735]
Please note that I have tested mahalanobis distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two vectors but they were not so good and detects.
a=[1.3269   1.3354  1.3318  1.3282  1.34666 1.3460  1.36084 1.3526  1.3539  1.3510  1.3480  1.3479  1.34893]
I want to combine the following vectors in a way that just the red point (number 7) becomes inconsistent with other points( become an outlier and become distant from other points) and other points become consistent with each other.
You have 2 dimensions and its either an outlier or its not.
If one standardizes the data and then deciphers the Mahalanobis distances, point 6 is only one of two points that sit outside of a certain threshold (point 0 being the other point).
