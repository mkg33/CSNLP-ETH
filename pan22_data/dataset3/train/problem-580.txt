If your need is to allow people to download files and there is no need for authentication, then I would get a small board (like a Raspberry Pi) for 35 â‚¬.
If it is dynamic IP address, use one of the numerous DDNS services, those are DNS services that work with dynamic IP addresses, it is probably that your Linksys router offers DDNS settings.
I would install a Linux on it, run a web server like Nginx or Apache Web Server or Lighttpd, set the Linux firewall to only allow the port on which your web server is running, plug the board to your router and either do one of the following:
Note that some DDNS services might requires some charges.
Finally, the standard HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports are extremely rarely blocked by ISP.
Then installing a web server is also a no brainer (check this example to install nginx), configuring is a little bit more complex.
Finally, you should try to see if your ISP provides you with a static IP address or dynamic.
If you get the Raspberry Pi, simply install the Noobs installer, it is really easy to install a Linux that way (choose Raspbian when prompted).
If it is static, simply buy a domain name or just use the IP address to let people download your files.
It is much easier to secure properly a HTTP server than an FTP server, and you do not need to manage accounts for giving access to files.
In addition, it is much easier to setup good "jails" to simple HTTP server like that so that a malicious user cannot do much more than downloading the files you offered.
The firewall part is a bit more tricky if you've never done it, and if you use port forwarding (instead of the DMZ) it is a step you could skip for later, as your router would do most of the firewalling.
