Any one or two of these issues, and I'd just try to repair the server, but at this point; unless there's no way to safely migrate the AD users/permissions, I think I'm better off with a clean install.
Simply backing up System Data and Registry and reapplying it to reinstalled server may cause serious consequences and be pain in the a...
I need to re-build a Server 2008 R2 instance, but I don't want to lose all the current Active Directory info, what's the best way to go about it?
Also I would suggest using some imaging software to mirror drives to make sure you have a working copy (it's easy to forget some important thing).
Considering that you can't do much about upgrading forest functionality etc means you already have problems with AD that will require fixing (I really doubt that simply by reinstalling server and reimporting same AD data will fix the problems).
You should have more than one AD server; they'd replicate your information (except for specific roles.)
The reason I'm rebuilding over repairing is great, as the server has many issues (I inherited them from previous IT):
Fix Active Directory and all the problems and then migrate AD (and other things) as per @Bart suggestion to a temporary location (like setup a VM on your laptop, make it secondary AD and migrate everything to it using trial license).
That's supposed to protect from having an AD server crash or losing connectivity, so your network continues to function with most of the functionality.
Install another AD server, replicate AD information, then rebuild the original?
Then when you are sure AD migrated properly,  (most likely you will have to fix AD first anyway for that to succeed) databases are copied,  remove AD from main server (using dcpromo and Roles and Features - hence why you should have to fix your server first).
If you want to continue using this Active Directory on rebuild server you may as well go and fix the problems first.
