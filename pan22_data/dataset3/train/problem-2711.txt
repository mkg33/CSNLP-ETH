I'm having trouble publicly accessing a MediaWiki server that I have set up on my Raspberry Pi.
I am getting a "connection timed out" error when trying to visit the server remotely.
It is however accessible to all computers on my LAN.
Another possibility would be "tcpflow -c port 80", it shows you less info about packets and more about the actual HTTP stream.
Is there a way to log what exactly is going on with this request on the Pi?
I have made sure that ufw is inactive, and have used iptables to add rules allowing HTTP traffic.
Also, fire up "tcpdump port 80" on your Raspberry Pi.
It will show you all packets on port 80, even before iptables may drop them.
This doesn't seem to be an issue with my router or the port forwarding, as I can change the destination IP to that of my Macbook and publicly access an Apache server set up on it.
Both tcpdump and tcpflow are usually not installed by default, so you'll have to do that first.
You may try iptables with the -v option - it will show you the number of packets and bytes that have so far matched a specific rule, or the chains default action (as your INPUT DROP action).
