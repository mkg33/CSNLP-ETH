you might want to check if you can see any dirt or similiar items/small objects short circuit one of the port.
Was thinking that the problem may be driver-related, but I booted the pc from Linux CentOS 6.5 LiveCD and the same situation appeared.
for linux you could install and/or mount the usbfs to have debug info, but depending on the time you want to spend for "fixing" this it might be way cheaper to just buy a pci(X) USB card.
reads like either the USB chip itself (if there is a single one) is damaged somehow or there might be a short cicuit in one of the connectors.
Maybe you will be able to see a small crack on the chip and or the lines to your ports.
Strange thing is that when I plug my very basic USB mouse which in other PCs works just fine, the laser flashes (so the voltage is there) but it doesnt work, the cursor is not moving.
additionally you could debug the usb "hub" which provides these ports, usually called the root hub.
Do any other USB devices work in XP such as a usb drive?
Laser was flashing, but the mouse cursor wasnt able to move.
