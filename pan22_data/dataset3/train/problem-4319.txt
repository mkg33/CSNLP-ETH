I can see two possibilities, NTLM is not supported with URL rewrite + ARR.
Set an SPN for each domain you will need to authenticate to and for each server the applications are hosted on (if you have a web farm).
For Windows integrated authentication you may have to configure Kerberos to get it working properly.
From a deep dive in the article, you have to create Service Principal Names for the web applications and delegate control to the web application identity.
I'll do some testing, but you may have to make another page for errors that uses the referral URI's PathAndQuery to send it to the right place.
Set up the custom errors on the default site to use this page.
Open up the computer object for one of the web servers.
Change the radio button to "Trust this user for delegation to specified services only", make sure the next radio button is "Use any authentication protocol".
To create the SPN, use a command like this: (HTTP applies for both HTTP and HTTPS)
Alternatively, it may be easier to just make a default page on the root that will redirect traffic to the proper location, something like this:
click ok.  On add services, select all of them that this application pool identity is in charge of and click okay.
search for the application pool identities (if it's Network Service, you don't have to worry about this part).
Here's a page describing the general steps for sharepoint, but it's applicable elsewhere: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/echarran/archive/2010/02/11/howto-configure-sharepoint-2010-for-kerberos.aspx
Next, open up active directory and set the view to advanced mode.
