This can be arranged a number of ways but probably the easiest is to use hotcopy to make a new copy of the repository (the process respects subversions versioning/locking system so you get a consistent point-in-time copy of the repository even if people are actively using it) then backing that copy up to the remote site using rsync.
rsync supports syncing full directory structures, and if the remote end is contactable via SSH (or similar) you don't need to be running the rsync in daemon mode (it just needs to be installed so it can be called via ssh).
You might want to add the --compress option too as no doubt your repository's contents will compress well saving you some bandwidth.
The rsync command you need is probably of the form:
The -a option (short for --archive) includes a lot of options including the one that causes rsync to operate recursively over a whole directory structure.
This connects to remote.host via SSH as user, starts an rsync process, and arranges the transfer with it then closes it before closing the SSH session.
You need to make sure that the repository is not changed at all (i.e.
