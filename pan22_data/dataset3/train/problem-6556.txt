I'm not sure how big your databases are, but it'll help to keep disk usage down and avoid any space issues.
Personally I prefer to restrict find to a name pattern, too, to make sure you aren't deleting anything unexpectedly.
This way if your cron misses a day, you don't get older files missed by the delete.
The -delete option in find is helpful if you don't want to use xargs.
Have you ever looked into irsync by R-FX networks?
It's usually better to use -mtime +2 instead of -mtime 3 to affect anything older than two days rather than files exactly 3 days old.
Any help would be beneficial, even if it's a pointer on how to do it better.
I'm trying to get a little more usefulness out of my MySQL backups.
Both ways will work, but I  prefer to use fewer commands when possible.
I'm wanting to gzip my backup when it's completed from a cron job.
You can just add gzip /var/sqlbackup/sqlbackup-$date.sql to the end of your script.
A great little script that will allow you to take hot copies and gzips of your databases and send it to a remote server.
