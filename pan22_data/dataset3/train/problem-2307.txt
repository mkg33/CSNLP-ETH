You can turn off the bits you don't want so you can switch off all but the forum functionality, or you can add to it with plugins if you want to add something new or tweak whatever is there already.
I've been using Telligent's Community Server Evolution, which integrates with SharePoint and does discussion forums/blogs/wikis very well.
It isn't free, but IIRC you do get access to the source code and they are quite helpful when you have problems, so I'd regard it as a reasonable investment.
Microsoft themselves use Community Server quite a lot, if you know what to look for you'll see it crop up quite a lot where they need forum OR blogging tools.
Sorry, do you mean you're looking for a place to ask questions or a plug in to improve the forums aspect of MOSS 2007?
If the latter, the community server people talk a good game about sharepoint integration for their forum/CMS product, and it isn't a bad blog & forum platform to be honest, though I haven't personally tried integrating it with anything.
