First, I would recommend you go get Ola Hallengren's backup scripts.
Second, I would create SQL Agent jobs to call the backup stored procedures, with the following jobs:
This saves you a lot of effort of writing your own scripts from scratch and the solution is recommended by many notables in the community.
They are full featured and well documented, supporting exactly the type of operations you are looking to complete.
There are several ways to handle this, such as increasing the window between log backups and creating different backup jobs for different databases (so you can have them execute in parallel).
The largest area of adjustment will probably be how often you run your log backups.
Depending on the size, activity, the number of databases in FULL recovery mode, and the fact that this approach backs up your databases serially (one after the other), all log backups on your instance may not complete in 5 minutes.
