Recently, a version for Windows 8+ has been made available free.
Just bear in mind you will still need a 3rd party utility to access it from within Windows.
Just load Linux into a VM and mount the USB from there.
Then use whatever file sharing method (ftp, scp, samba, etc...) you want to transfer the files to your Windows system from there.
On a Mac, if you ever erase a flash drive with Disk Utility, it formats the drive with a GUID partition table by default and creates the hidden EFI partition in addition to the regular data partition.
This USB disk... is it a flash drive or an external hard drive?
Older tools like the one you tried might not support that.
If this is the case, the only way to resolve the issue would be to back up the data, re-format the USB stick with an MBR partition table, and then copy the data back over.
If it's a USB flash drive, then the issue is probably because the drive has a partition table on it.
Windows does not support multiple partitions on a flash drive.
Paragon offers a commercial filesystem driver called HFS for Windows for this.
Paragon has been in the filesystem business for a long time, so I guess their drivers are somewhat safe.
