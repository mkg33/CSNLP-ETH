I run VMware workstation in Debian Linux hosting a variety of VMs including Windows 7 x64 and it works fine for me, including digital audio.
BTW you need to add skype to DEP before it will work.
This, however, caused me pain because I couldn't get Skype video to work on neither the nost nor the guest...
I've used 2003 as a workstation for a while, and had only a few small problems with applications not wanting to install.
In my honest opinion, I'd recommend a Linux host OS.
You can spend as much (or little) time tuning it as you want, but the bottom line is - for something that's just going to be running VMs - you want the lightest weight host OS as possible.
More importantly, you can get the memory footprint of a basic installation (with a basic window manager for the GUI) to be much less than Windows, hence more resources for your client VMs.
The other point to make is that VMware workstation shouldn't run server's for any reason except testing.
If you want to host servers Citrix XENserver or VMware ESXi, both of which are free (cost) are much better options.
I want to run serveral virtual machine on a computer using VMWare Workstation.
The stability is amazing - I have no problem going over a year without a reboot on servers, and about the same on desktops if I don't ask way too much of them.
On my current computer I use Windows Server 2003 for its statbility.
The virutal machines will run Windows Server 2003/2008 and Windows 7 as guest OS.
