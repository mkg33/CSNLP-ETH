I have a couple of rackable systems that I don't use because they make way too much noise.
Had the same issue with a group of dl145g2's running in my basement lab.
There are products like this that are designed to keep things in the rack quiet.
You could always find a working old refrigerator to mount it in
I see such things on craigslist from time to time, usually from failed musician/geeks who wanted to run a home recording studio.
Popped the top disconnected all the fans (except the powersupplies).
That wouldn't be possible with your setup because the HP 1u servers have custom motherboards that wouldn't fit into anything else.
They've got something like 9 fans, all of them the little tiny noisy kind.
In short, there is a reason these things are cheap.
The one thing to remember is that everything that baffles sound almost always baffles in the heat.
You can't put much into these because you'll overwhelm their cooling capacity.
I've reused some of the kit by moving the motherboards to another case with larger fans.
The problem with 1u servers is they typically have tiny fans that have to spin at 9 billion rpm in order to move enough air to keep the thunderingly hot CPUs cool.
Mounted two cpu fans and replaced the hd's with ssd devices.
