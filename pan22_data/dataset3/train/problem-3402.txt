I've only managed to stop the character from going through the wall by seting the position to the last one in the past frame if the new position colllisions the bounding box.
You wrote "seting the position to the last one in the past frame if the new position colllisions the bounding box" will work, but you need to check and reset the X and Y coord separately.
But this just makes the player stop sharply and unrealisticly.
Now lets asume he walks into a wall, most of the games depending on character angle and the BB normal face will only stop the player in one axis, but will continue moving in the other along the wall axis.
The easiest solution (in terms of required work) is to check collisions in each axis separately.
For example, you control a character which can move in 2 dimensional directions (except up and down).
I would like to know how is the typical collision detection of most games.
Your question is a bit vague ("Typical collision detection"), but your concern about stopping the player in one axis can be answered.
