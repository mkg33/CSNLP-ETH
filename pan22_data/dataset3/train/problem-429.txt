I would like to get better control over my deployment environments, but I share the system administration responsibility with an IT department that has their own (not fully automated) processes for bootstrapping VM-instances, managing organization users and performing security updates.
As far as I can tell this goes against the idea of a fully controlled environment that is behind tools like Chef, and it will leave room for divergences between production environments and between them and my staging environment (a local VM that IT never touches).
I'm not in a position to introduce a different workflow at the IT department.
How would my workflow need to differ from that of a fully controlled environment?
Is using a tool like Chef still worth the "bother"?
Can I still benefit from using Chef (probably Chef-Solo), even though the systems will have an initial state that is outside my control, and will periodically change due to security updates outside of Chef (and possibly also other manual intervention)?
