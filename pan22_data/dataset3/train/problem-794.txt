I'm currently rebuilding index ever night which i never had to do in the old days.
I've noticed that over the last couple of years I'm spending way more time rebuilding indexes and doing general functional maintenance than I ever did back when we were running SQL Server 2000.

At my company we've been using SQL Server for quite a while and have followed the recommended upgrade path.
My question is if anyone can confirm or deny this opinion and if this is true what the is the reason for it.
If anything 2005 and newer are much better at "running themselves" but I would not really ever say that as all sql servers needs some maintenance.
I realize that much has changed about our application so it's possible that this difference is of my own making.
However, I feel fairly certain that, for us, SQL Server 2000 was much better at "just running" without much help than the newer versions of SQL Server.
