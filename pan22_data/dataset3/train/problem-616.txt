If you're running OneCare (which overrides the default Firewall), check to ensure that it isn't locking you down with its firewall.
Try turning off the firewall on your systems for a few minutes to see if they're blocking your communications (remember to turn it back on afterwards).
I've had it reset to a Public security configuration after it pulls down updates in the past, which blocks many network services.

For some reason, they boogered the handling of the password in the web-service protocol that the Connector uses to talk to the server.

So, change the WHS Administrator password to a (much less secure) one that doesn't have extended-characters in it.
