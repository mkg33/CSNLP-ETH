The VPN server has to be configured accordingly to assign virtual IPs and DNS servers to the clients.
if servers are received, or if there is perhaps an error during installation of the received DNS servers).
Similarly, if you use the NetworkManager plugin you'll have to check the "Request an inner IP address" option to request a virtual IP and DNS servers.
I'm connecting to an IPSec VPN with strongswan and swanctl.
My problem now seems to be that the DNS information is not updated.
I had some trouble getting it to work with the ipsec command, but after changing to swanctl instead, initiating the connection works fine.
Strongswan comes with the ResolvePlugin that should handle this, but I can not seem to get it to work.
DNS servers are only installed if they are received as configuration attributes, and these are only requested together with a virtual IP address (and, of course, the server must also be configured to send a DNS server back to the client).
Considering that the config you posted in your other question does not contain vips = 0.0.0.0 (see VirtualIP on the strongSwan wiki) no virtual IP address will be requested from the server and, thus, no DNS servers either.
I can connect to the remote servers by IP, and name resolution works if I add the name servers to resolv.conf by hand, but resolv.conf is not updated automatically when I connect.
swanctl --stats reports that the resolve plugin is loaded.
When I tried connecting with the ipsec command, the name servers got updated, so it seems that the gateway server is sending the information.
