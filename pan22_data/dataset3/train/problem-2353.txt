It's a recent project, so RStudio is still more powerful, including its focus on data-friendly environment (plots and data are always in sight).
It's not formally an IDE, though it has many, if not more of the features of RStudio, just in a different UI (code completion, inline help, object-aware autocomplete, debugging etc.
You can send lines and paragraphs of code from vim into a tmux session running R in a similar manner to R-Studio.
It requires installation of jupyter R kernel, IRkernel which will allow you to open a new jupyter notebook with option to choose R instead of default python kernel.
VisualStudio added syntax highlighting for R a few days ago: https://www.visualstudio.com/news/2015-mar-10-vso
The current RStudio preview is pretty cool as well - you can switch to a dark theme, code completion is working well, you can filter in the viewer, etc.
Of course I use all my other normal vim plugins - auto-complete, folding, etc.
What about ESS, the R (and other stats languages) package for the Emacs editor?
See https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer/jupyter-and-conda-r and https://irkernel.github.io/installation/ for installation steps.
It has these commands if you want to check out what functionality it adds to vim.
