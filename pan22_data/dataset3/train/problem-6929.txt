That can lead to problems if you have asymmetric routing.
Each router will actually have three NAPT pools and tables; one each for TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
Actually, you have four routers, each with different NAPT pools, and they cannot share the pools.
The yellow router will not have a NAT table entry, so the traffic originating from the host in the blue box will be destined for the address of the yellow router, and the yellow router, not a host in the yellow box.
"The nat translation works fine, i can ping from the pc on the blue square to the primary router of the yellow square, and vice versa but i cannot ping beetween pcs."
The TCP NAPT table and pool on the blue primary router is not shared with the TCP NAPT table and pool on the blue secondary router.
If you originate traffic from inside, say from a host in the blue box, the blue router through which the traffic passes will create a NAT table entry so that return traffic can come back to the originating host.
You have run across a weakness in NAPT, where it breaks the IP premise of end-to-end connectivity.
You will need to create a static NAT table entry for that to happen, but you can only create one per transport protocol and transport address.
