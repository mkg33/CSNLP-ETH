I plugged same cable in to my Laptop and it is working perfectly.
But When I plugged in WAN cable in to WAN (Blue) Port.
The image below shows the pins I am talking about.
I am trying to connect my internet through this router.
I configured it correctly (using quick configuration) as per my knowledge using static IP Address.
This could be 1 of 2 things to the best of my knowledge.
Check the pins in the jack where you plug your ethernet cables in.
Also, I tried with 2 routers (both are same make and model).
Sometimes these pins can get bent backwards or sideways, preventing a proper connection.
In Router configuration page, it shows me WAN Port unplugged when I try to Auto Detect IP Address.
Hopefully option 1 fixes the problem, but if not, it is time to move on and purchase a new one (unless it's still under warranty or from your ISP)
I Said I configured it correctly because it worked for me once and then when I switched off my modem and router then it never worked.
If they arent straight take some tweezers, or small needle nose pliers and gently straighten them out.
