That sounds like a bug in TB3, taking in account a non-existent folder.
To physically get rid of these messages, Compacting folders might solve the problem:
I believe that TB saves messages in a plain text format, and there's an index per text file.
I have just deleted a lot of old messages (about 3,000) from my Thunderbird 3.0 profile.
When I now use the new search feature (search all messages), TB still finds the deleted ones.
You could try to vacuum the Thunderbird Databases like it is done for Firefox.
So, it seems that Thunderbird does not notice the deletion of my messages, thus the index is not updated.
If compacting all folders in the account manually doesn't solve the problem, I would copy back the Archive file and delete it officially via the TB interface.
Then I stopped TB and moved the archive files and folders to a different place on my file system.
That way, it should take its disappearance into account and rebuild the index.
I deleted them this way: I moved the messages to an own "archive" folder (not the built-in archive feature).
If the above works, you might need to modify slightly your archiving method for TB3.
