The shopkeeper's making a lot of money selling rejected items this way (and demonstrating in front of customers that it can work, so that they can't come later and tell them that it doesn't work)
in what looks like /dev/sdb (since it's "dd") (though it really isn't).
So the shop was selling fake USBs (or at least the controller reports a fake capacity).

Another way of asking that question: Why can it write in Windows if it's spoilt?
I tried finding the capacity of the USB drive using
But, I can't change the format from FAT32 to NTFS (or any other file system), nor can I change the partition table to GPT, nor can I change the size of the FAT32 partition.
And, in Ubuntu, only /dev/sdb shows up in the devices, but /dev/sdb1 (which is the FAT32 partition) doesn't show up.
And it seems that it's from a rejected stock: My USB detects fine in Windows, and even writes and reads files and folders.
And the file is of 0 bytes (as shown in GHex, with root permission).
So I have to now look how to make it report its true capacityâ€¦
Well, it would've been okay if I only used Windows.
Then I also tried doing a dd of /dev/sdb and I got a really weird thing:
That's the attached output of dd, cut short to 1MB.
I can't change the partition) and I can read and write files.
The drive works well in Windows (well, as long as I use the FAT32 only..
Then I tried doing a hex read of /dev/sdb in Ubuntu (since it at least got detected).
