You can also manually cause I/O to the drive to force it to spin up if you know it'll soon be needed; hdparm's -z option might be useful for that:
Note that as stated in the hdparm man page, the spin-up process can take considerable time during which the I/O request will appear nonresponsive to the userland process.
Also, the man page for hdparm marks the similar power off mode (-s ) as VERY DANGEROUS but makes no mention about risks in the hd-idle section.
Spinup times shouldn't be a problem with modern drives, but you never know for certain before you test in your particular environment.
It is also mentioned on the Gentoo wiki and [H]ardforum threads.
I have been using it my backup machine with RAID-1 for about a year.
This also agrees with my personal experience; any disk I/O will make a spun-down drive spin up.
Both of these strongly indicate that spinning down disks is safe, as if any disk activity occurs that requires a particular disk to be spun up, it will be spun up automatically.
I suggest trying this beforehand to make sure your disks don't take excessive time to spin up, which might make mdraid kick them out of your array (which leads to Bad Things when you drop below your array's redundancy threshold).
