With VMware ESXi (at least), your iSCSI storage is abstracted to your guests in the form of VMFS datastores, so there's really not much more to it than assigning more storage to a guest through the VI Client.
While easier to administer and manage, this also gives you a layer of additional host security as your guests do not have direct access to the physical storage layer.
Attach the iSCSI target to the Hyper-V host, then make it a pass-through drive for the appropriate guest.
Giving direct iscsi access to storage can be helpful on VM, if you then do snapshot through the Storage, for example.
However if you have a legitimate reason to do this, I would think the best way for you to accomplish this would be to put your guest VM on the same VLAN as your iSCSI devices as described in #1.
So i wouldn't mix production network with data network (iscsi).
When it comes to iscsi, we often make special config:
(Equallogic provide then integration between SQL/Exchange and the equallogic snapshot).
