Define "schema_file" having .json format in above command.
There are two way we can modify the Schemas after creation both of these approaches need us to recreate the table.
Write a SQL query in Query editor to Select all the required columns except the ones you want to modify.
Run bq show --schema --format=prettyjson project_id:dataset.table > schema_file where you need to specify project, dataset and table path.
I made a mistake of specifying a field as integer instead of float.
Does anyone know of a better way to modify a field after a table is created?
This is an elegant way to modify the existing Schema.
I found that I am not able to make correction a field once the table is created.
Looks you can not change the schema after creation of the table, but you can rename the columns by looking at the suggestions at this SO post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42395612/update-big-query-table-schema
Update the existing table using bq update project_id:dataset.table schema
I have to delete and re-create the table again to make things right.
The BigQuery Doesn't allow us to modify the table schema directly.
Set Destination table having same as the Original one
