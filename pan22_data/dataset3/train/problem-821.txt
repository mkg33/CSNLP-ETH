Instead you should be looking at things like - Have you failed over before?
Straightforward this one - when failing over from one sql server 2008 node to another, should the browser service be running on the passive node ?
The browser is really used to handle incoming connections to a SQL instance.
That said the browser shouldn't prevent DLLs from being found or take any part in preventing or allowing a failover.
So if you have it running on the active node and it is being used to direct connections, I would make sure it is automatic and running on each node.
There really isn't a short answer because there are a few hidden questions in the question.
Have there been any required restarts missed on that node?
The Browser service is not cluster aware, so it generally would be just running on each node.
So the issue you are having with failing over is most likely not related to the browser but something else.
When you don't have a fixed port, are using named instances and in other situations the browser handles the "finding" of the instance a client desires to connect to.
The dlls are present, I just wondered whether this browser service was stopping access.
At the moment, on attempting to failover, a an error is produced saying that certain clustering related dlls can't be found.
