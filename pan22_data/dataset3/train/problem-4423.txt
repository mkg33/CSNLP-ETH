I've never used it, so I don't know if it has some productivity features that aren't available in Windows Vista/7, but I'd like to know, if only to quench my curiosity.
A MSDN Blog post -- Using Windows Server 2008 as a SUPER workstation OS, Feb 2008.
Another post -- Using Windows Server as a desktop, Aug 2008.
I would put it on my laptop, but I heard Hyper-V negates many of the power options, so I'm waiting for Win7 to come out.
I'm just about ready to ditch this and restore XP.
At work I have been running 2008/2008R2 with themes, so it looks very much like Vista (except no sidebar, which I don't miss).
I've been using it on my laptop for a year since I got it free from the Win2k8 launch event last year, just to get a feel for it.
OTOH I have yet to find a bluetooth dongle that works and some desktop programs refuse to run at all.
Theoretically, someone with Vista should be able to achieve the exact same performance as someone with 2k8, but unlike Vista, the default install is very responsive, if spartan.
Development, specifically SharePoint, which cannot run on Windows XP and requires major hacking to get it to install and run on Vista.
But where Vista starts with features activated and you pick which things to uninstall, 2k8 starts on the other end and you add what you'll need.
I've noticed quite a few people using Windows Server as their main desktop operating system.
B/c we're SuperUsers and we like to test stuff out.
