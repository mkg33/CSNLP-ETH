For me, the disable button is grayed out, so uninstalling the driver might be the only available option.
Download the driver program for your operating system.
It will say you are about to disable the only active pointing device, are you sure you want to disable?
You'd need to find the touchpad under Control Panel-->Hardware and Sound-->Device Manager-->Mice and other pointing devices, then double click it to open the properties dialog.
Maker sure you have an external or you will not be able to reverse if you wish.
Select disable (goes directly to this when box appears).

This would kind of be a hack and obviously isn't a great solution, but I suppose you could disable or uninstall the driver for your touchpad.
Hope that helps anyone that is using a USB mouse and have the problem of the cursor moving every time you type anything and accidentally touch the pad like I have had in the past.
It is the actual mouse settings dialog box with a new tab on it.
I haven't actually seen that exact model, but it's probably a marked Fn-F key combination built into the keyboard.
If all else fails you can disable it in the device manager.
For Acers it's often Fn+F6 to toggle it on and off.
Under the Driver tab, there are buttons to disable and uninstall the driver.
If you happen to have a Lenovo laptop with the UltraNav software installed, you can disable the touch pad by unchecking a checkbox in Control Panel-->Hardware and Sound-->Mouse-->UltraNav tab.
Anyone having a problem disabling/enabling the touchpad go here.
