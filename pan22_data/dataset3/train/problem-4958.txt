I'm confident that my DATA itself is healthy, but the hardware used to access it unreliable at best.
More often than not, the RAID controller reports one disc being down.
Alternately, can I just take one of my RAID rives (since they're mirrored), plug it into an eSATA drive housing and access the data normally for transfer to a NEW RAID?
I have a RAID 1 that's spordically healthy; I finally narrowed it down to a cracked SATA connector on the RAID board.
Before I jump into that project, though, I want to understand what I'm up against in the process.
Are these just standard NTFS volumes controlled and managed by my card?
Or am I looking at the prospect of holding the connector ~just~ right for hours while I copy everything to an external drive for re-copying to a new RAID once the hardware arrives?
Or is there something proprietary that the card does between the OS and the disks?
Apart from knowing the different RAID levels, my knowledge of RAID technology is weak.
Can I just replace a RAID card with any other RAID card and it'll work?
If I hold it ~just~ right, i get full contact on the connector and everything works fine.
