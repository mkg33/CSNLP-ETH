If the players grid is connected to the zombies grid(if I go with option two I would only need to check if leader zombies grid is connected to player, aka less checks) - if they are connected and there is more than 250ms since last check do a raytrace..
The problem is that the zombies, when they find their pray the have to follow it for some while.. And here is the problem, running the AI navcode seems to take for ever.
For LoS(zombie -> player) I have split the map into grids.
For navigation I have some kinda navmesh(since the game is not tile-based) that tells the zombies where they can walk etc.
This is my first time programming AI so input on any field is appreciated.
The game is multiplayer and while my net code could use some real work I have put that off for the time, so currently I'm trying to implement the AI.
The game is pretty simple; Players run around on a map filled with a X amount of zombies that try to eat their brains, classic and overused I know.
If anyone else got some ideas on how to do navigation I would love some input.
