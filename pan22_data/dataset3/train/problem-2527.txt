Basically we went through a GPO and disabled every single feature of the UI we could discover.
We used to have a TS with un-trusted users on it and the setup was similar.
We disabled the ability to map client devices over terminal services as well, along with the command prompt, everything.
Actually, if you can, I would strongly suggest moving to 2008 R2 if at all possible, as it's got even more security features for terminal services (or RDS as it's now called)
It's unfortunate that you're on Server 2003, as Server 2008's RemoteApp features would serve you brilliantly in this scenario.
We did have trouble disabling explorer though, but if you can enforce a single program launch on startup, feel free to disable that too.
Hell we even disabled the ability to right-click on their desktop.
However, what you've got there should pretty much cover it from a security standpoint.
Using GPO we locked down the accounts to remove everything - their start menu only had "log off", everything in the Windows Security screen was disabled (except Change Password and Log Off), if they were able to wrangle up a browse screen, access to every local disk was disabled, and they were members of a restricted group that actually had deny access on network resources.
