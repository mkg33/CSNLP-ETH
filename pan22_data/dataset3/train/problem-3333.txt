Additionally you could split up the assets of your site (e. g. static pages, images, CSS, etc.)
and have them served by a separate server with a high caching time out so that clients fetch them once and keep them for a longer period of time.
As soon as you have server side session data you'll need to synchronize that between your servers or use "sticky sessions" (always server a single user's requests from the same system).
i have a php search engine, running on apache, hosted on centos 5 vps, no mysql, nothing really, just a bunch of php files, i have in average 600 visitors, i need more bandwidth, i want to host my site on 4 vps to distribute the bandwidth, the question is how?
ahans already mentioned "Poor man's load-balancing" (a. k. a. DNS round robin) in the comments.
my vps is really cheap, so i don't want to change my provider, i just want to know how to host a website on many vps, that's all
This is the easiest possibility given your web site is stateless and doesn't rely on data (like user state) being preserved over requests.
