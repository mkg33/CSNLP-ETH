On the plus side, it's not in your face all the time like some of the others.
Anti-virus/malware software has to have a pretty intimate relationship with the operating system in order to function effectively.
I would think that, if you're going to use AV software, this is the one to go with.
It seems to be getting pretty good comments at DownloadSquad.com.
Who better to create that relationship than the creators of the OS?
Since I tested the pre-beta build, it is quite difficult to draw the final verdict.
The overall size of the software installer is only 4.8MB and takes around 6.6MB + 36MB(runs two different processes) when running on my system.
It's incredibly unobtrusive (adds nothing to the desktop other than a taskbar icon) and actually has a large number of options to configure.
But one thing that held out is it’s ease-of-use and small memory footprint.
It's as effective as any other anti-virus product.
No packaged product is ‘adequate’ protection for a PC, really; today's anti-malware products will not protect you from the mass of ever-evolving malware out there today.
I'm running it now on Windows 7 and although I cannot attest to it's security, I've been very happy with the UI and the footprint.
It's meant to be a successor to OneCare, which surprisingly provided pretty adequate protection.
It's much more about ensuring your net-facing software is up-to-date, reducing attack surface by removing net-facing software (like plugins) that you don't need, and not falling for social engineering attacks (like the fake codecs and scanners).
Which is quite impressive if you look at the fact that it detected and removed a Trojan downloader that NOD32 even failed to detect in the first place.
