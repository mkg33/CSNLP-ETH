Which is a bit more convenient compared to using ESC.
To find a link and follow it in a page in Google Chrome I now have to type:
This would allow you to type a '/' and then you start typing whatever you're looking for and it dynamically jumps you to the part of the page that matches.
You may just find that the rest of the Vim keybindings are helpful too - for scrolling, navigating tabs, opening new links, etc., all without taking your hands off the keyboard - but you could simply start with the search feature and safely ignore the rest of the functionality if you're not familiar with the other bindings.
Not being able to use forward slash to find in page has been a real show-stopper for me as I use it all the time in Firefox to browse documentation.
I mapped the âŒ˜/ shortcut to the Chrome "Find..." command
Just install the extension, and forward-slash search should start working.
Try checking out Vimium, an extension which gives you Vim keymappings.
Is it possible to let forward slash behave the same in Google Chrome as in Firefox?
(Not as good as having a simple '/',  but it will do for now...
Update: The Chromium Find As You Type Extension comes with the '/' key search functioning out of the box.
