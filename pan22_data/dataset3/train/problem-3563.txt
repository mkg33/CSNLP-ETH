4) Take a soft pencil (preferably 4B or 6B) and slowly, gently rub it on the CoA label which has the key.
I was trying to restore the laptop ( HP dv6 pavillion) and mistakenly set active drive to D. Now cannot boot the windows.
I could not download new iso for windows as last few digits of my key have faded.

This one is for everyone having a worn out CoA (Certificate of Authorization).
1) Try repairing your boot drive using a Linux live CD (you can also install grub, which will probably do everything for you)
If you get the CoA a bit dirty, gently rub it with your finger and keep trying.

Manufacturers or Microsoft will NEVER help you get back your CoA.
DON'T touch the label with any kind of cleaning solution or water.
