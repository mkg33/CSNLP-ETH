I'm currently running a Windows 2008 R2 print server.
As far as I can tell adding the person or group where I was should fix it, but nothing seems to be working when I try it.
It seems simple enough when I look online-- go to the print server, open up printer management, right click the server, properties, security and add the person or group you want to have rights.
Please contact your system administrator to verify that you have the privilege on the requested action.
This works across the 6 university campuses we have.
When I click "Cancel" or "Cancel All Docuements" I get the following error:
The error indicates that the action you chose requires a higher privilege than what you have with your account.
For normal staff, we tick "Print" and "Manage the documents".
Everything seems to work fine, except that i can't seem to cancel jobs stuck in the queue.
Anyone have any idea why I'm getting this and how to make it work?
I've tried adding our helpdesk there as a group, individually, even adding myself and giving myself full rights.
I've even tried giving a user full admin rights on that server, putting them in the administrator group...same results.
One of our helpdesk asked me to give them rights to do this, and upon inspection, I couldn't cancel the job either (although I'm sure I could bounce the spooler which would have the same effect).
We add the relevant users group to each printer's security tab.
