Personally, I'd never use it as my only anti-spam measure, but when included as part of a layered anti-spam system (including SpamAssassing, amavisd, clamav, RBLs, SPF/DKIM, etc), it provides a lot of benefit.
While I had greylisting set up on my server, it was annoying enough to have every (new) incoming email delayed.
I also know for certain that some incoming email was getting lost.
Spammers were persistent enough (and I think even back then they were starting to automatically do retries) that their spam got through anyway.
One important note, there are a few ISP's out there (major ones) that don't handle a greylisted destination gracefully (yahoo mailing lists have been a well known example).
I turned greylisting off years ago and haven't looked back.
One possible problem with greylisting is that users will not get mails immediatly.
In my experience, greylisting does not offer enough benefit to justify the drawbacks.
In my experience, the vast majority of e-mail that you get person-to-person (from a real person/user) flows through one of the major mail servers (postfix, qmail, exchange, sendmail), all of which handle greylisting properly.
Occasionally you might come across some mailing list software or automated e-mail program that doesn't handle it correctly, but my experience suggests this is very rare.
This is most frustrating for password reset mails.
I'd advise looking at some of the whitelists that people have put together to make sure that you don't end up blocking real e-mail.
These mails usually get caught in greylist because the sender/receipient/ip will be new.
