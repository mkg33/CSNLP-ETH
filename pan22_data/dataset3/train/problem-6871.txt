It will probably smell a little burny, but that is normal.
I had a card do the same to me years ago and I brought it back to life with the old bake in the oven trick.
The strongest power supply I tried with was a 700W Corsair which normally runs a stronger card.
When I check the heat on the card by hand (after disconnecting all power source ofc) it has got a normal temp.
I have recently bought a used XFX HD 7950 and the following things happen:
Make sure your oven doesn't under-report its temperature and turn the oven off immediately if you see any hint of smoke.
There are a variety of things that could be happening.
BIOS screen comes in, VGA fans go 100% and the display goes off saying "Check video cable"
Without a heatsink, a beefy gfx card could be instantly overheating.
First I would try removing the heatsink, applying paste, and re-seating it.
As its used, I assume it was shipped to you and rough enough handling could have broken the chip to heatsink "bond".
Risky of course, and be very careful, but if nothing else works: http://lifehacker.com/5823227/save-dying-video-cards-with-a-quick-bake-in-the-oven
Once its done and fully cooled off (couple hours - let it cool slowly so nothing cracks), make sure to use a quality thermal paste when putting the heatsink assembly back on.
