I don't believe you should have any problems whatsoever disconnecting and reconnecting the drive while your PC's hibernated.
While it sounds safe enough to do when the computer is hybernating, it puts a lot of faith that all the various software and drivers are 100% working together correctly.
Yes it is, because when you hibernate your system your usb connectors have no electricity and a complete image of your memory is inside your HDD.
When you sleep or hibernate a system any on-going I/O is quiesced.
This will ensure that TrueCrypt automatically and safely dismounts your encrypted volume when you hibernate your system, which is good from a security perspective as well.
A well-behaved device driver will assure that there are no on-going operations -- eg, any file move operations will be stopped in such a way that overall consistency is maintained, and file directories and free-space tables will be completely written.
You can disconnect that drive without any problem.
Since the drive is encrypted using TrueCrypt, for further peace of mind you can ensure that under Settings / Preferences / Auto-Dismount you have the "Dismount all when" User logs off and especially Entering power saving mode options selected:
Here is one case (you can find many more) that didn't end well: http://www.computerhope.com/forum/index.php?topic=122400.0 (Not exactly the same case, but it illustrates the point).
People will never use filesystems (or encrypted drives) if this may be dangerous in case of accidentally power loss or disconnect.
It may have worked out OK for you or others to do this 1000's of times, but it only takes one time, at just the right (wrong) time, and your data is gone, or at least requires involved recovery processes.
Of course, there's no guarantee that the TrueCrypt drivers are "well-behaved", but one would expect that they are.
