Not sure where to start - clusters, vmware, or they such solutions for huge file servers?
Right now you have a situation that you see to have little control of, let alone ability to influence within supportable time-frames.
I have 2 web servers (1 live and other backup), the issue I have is our storage is rapidly running out.
do you know how much it's growing per day/week/month/quarter etc.?
This is about control, you need to take it and keep it - everything else is just budget and a bit of technical work.
If not then how can you possibly size things correctly regardless of what you use?
Forget about the technology, this is a process issue for now, let technology fix the problem at the right point.
What you need to to is plan, set rules and ensure they're adhered to.
All you need in the host is a raid controller or a SAS/SCSI HBA with an external connector.
I'm seeking solutions or ideas for the best place to move the our data to.
All the data on the server is used by our customers and new documents are uploaded to the server daily.
Come back when you've got to that point and have far lower level questions to ask and we'll be happy to help.
Those can also usually be cascaded, to add more boxes.
The data has to be secure and needs to run on a linux environment.
There's always the option of an extendable DAS box.
