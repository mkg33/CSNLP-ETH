I have a bunch of images (screenshots), that I would like to sort automaticly in subfolders.
Just build a tree of your emblems (things that identify each type of screenshot) and search for them pixel by pixel in the image.
Do you know if each type of picture will have a certain image visible?
The "compare" process can be done with ImageMagick's compare tool, and make decisions based on the return value of the metric used to compare both images.
You're best of going to stackoverflow with that one.
It's actually a pretty intense program to run, but a naive implementation shouldn't be hard to write.
If you want, you can always install java and it's not too difficult to whip something up to do what you're asking.
Maybe you could create these "pattern images" (with any image editing software) and then iterate over all the images you want to sort "comparing" them against the "pattern images".
I presume, being screenshots, you don't have the issue of things being scaled up and down randomly or at different angles.
Since these are screenshots, I was thinking that I could program something that would read each jpg, check if such and such part of the image matches a specific set of pixels, and move the file accordingly.
Given the result of this operation (the similarity between the "pattern image" and the "actual image") you can put them in the specific subfolder.
