It will ask for login credentials --> Enter Admin Credentials
The simplest way is to create a shortcut on the desktop.
To use it, right click, runas, and select the desired user/password.
You will then be prompted to enter the password of that user.
after opening Command prompt type command --> taskmgr
Once all the Acrobat items have been stopped in Task manager, you can delete the odm.db
On Windows 7 (and possibly other versions), run task manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) then at the bottom of the window click Show processes from all users.
Change "Administrator" to whatever user you want to run it as.
Press Shift and Right Click on Command Prompt --> Click on Run as different user
This will run Task Manager with administrator privileges.
From the Run prompt (Win+r) type the following and run it:
Open Command Prompt in Admin Mode as Click on Start --> type "Command Prompt"
Besides the above, disable in startup - log out and back in to see if anything else comes up in startup via taskmgr.
Copy and paste to the desktop as a link, or drag and drop whilst holding down .
To Open Task Manager in Admin Mode, I suggest to open command prompt in admin mode first and then type the command for task manager
