This is conjecture, but after watching this for almost six months here's my theory;
This can be troublesome if you have one hour-long build that started before a 10-minute job.
In this case I would create an issue in the Jenkins bug tracker and discuss whether this is an issue and whether the developers should change the code that triggers this message.
I think the jobs have to post their logs in sequential order.
I wonder whether it is really an issue as I have seen a lot of logs and also weird messages while everything worked.
If you have multiple jobs, or even multiple runs of the same job that all push logs it will wait for them to complete in the order they were started.
There doesn't seem to be any fix for it, but we've learned to just ignore it and count the jobs as done if they're hanging at the logs phase.
What I do in such situation is talk with the developer of the code.
The shorter one started second even if it finishes first, so will wait for the hour long one to finish before finishing itself.
