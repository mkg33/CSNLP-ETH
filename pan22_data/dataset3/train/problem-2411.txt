That said, if the university is a Linux shop, they will not let you use a Windows Server regardless of what data you find on Windows server security.
I would investigate using Mono (www.mono-project.com) if you want to use the .Net framework.
I would say a greater factor in server security is the person running the server, and how careful they have been about locking things down.
All systems are capable of intrusion and getting infected.
If Linux ever really grows in the desktop space, then it will be attacked more as well.
However, once you open up a port and run a service on it - i.e.
There is one very important reason why Linux and OpenBSD have the potential to be more secure than windows.
The largest reasons that Linux distro's have less issues with viruses is that there are more Window boxes out there than there is Linux and Mac put together.
On linux, using IPTables or on OpenBSD using PF you can isolate rogue packets much earlier in the process of the OS receiving a new network packet - reducing the exposure.
Virus writers want to get the biggest bang for their buck, therefore they write for Windows.
Judging from security fixes on ALL software these days, I think the issue is not the software but the number of desktops running Windows.
On Windows, incoming network packets have been exposed to significant parts of the operating system long before a windows firewall can reject the packet.
Anyone who tells you different, be it your instructors or others, either are fools are have ocean front property in Utah to sell you.
Most of the previous posts have focused on intrusion, and a good job has been done covering that point, one of the points of your question was about viruses.
make a networked computer useful - you are only as secure as the code that runs that service.
That is the ability of the operating system to firewall itself from network attacks.
