So if johnnydoe was found browsing porn sites or bomb-making material online...anyone with that account information is suspect.
In our case we had minimum complexity requirements and aging requirements placed on us.
It was all set with Active Directory, where you can set it to force a password change at first login, and how long between password changes (for us three months).
Complexity for ours was something like not the same password as the last three used, can't have your name or username as part of the password, must have a number/punctuation/cap/lowercase mix (some mixture of the three).
We also have policies that are supposed to be followed; teachers aren't supposed to have the passwords (some have to for certain reasons I won't get into) but it's made clear...or we try to make clear...that if Johnny's account is used to get into a share or poke in places it's not supposed to be in, Johnny gets called to the principal.
I don't know the state you're in, but if you're talking about a public school, where we are we had the directive that we had to have changing passwords from the state auditors.
This way when users need a password changed, we just change it to something generic (Resetme54321, for example) and then the first time they log in with it, it prompts them to change the password.
If a teacher also has the password, they can potentially be in trouble as well, since they had access to that account.
Again...don't know your particular circumstances, but if you're with a public school system and your department of ed has auditors checking your systems you might want to check with them what their requirements are before you're audited, or check with your state's equivalent of an IU (intermediate unit...for PA, they do things like provide tech and state services to a region of schools.
Consultation, server maintenance, hosting...You can google for pennsylvania intermediate unit for examples of what different ones offer.)
