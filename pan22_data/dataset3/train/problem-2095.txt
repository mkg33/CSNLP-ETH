With the current prices of storage, I'd recommend getting a larger (and faster!)
I tried burning an Ubuntu 10.10 CD and re-booting, hoping that GParted would work then, so I could just graphically destroy Windows and re-size my root partition, but no dice.
I would try something like SysRescueCD or Trinity Rescue Kit to do the job.
disk and copying your Ubuntu partition on it, leaving Windows on the old one.
Same upgrade made changes to the partition tables on all my drives, linux could use them, windows could not boot from them, new partitions weren't enough, a clean install of windows to the empty drive didn't boot untill I killed the partition table.
And why did upgrading to Ubuntu 10.04 mess with my partition table?
My goal is to eliminate all my existing Windows partitions (I currently dual-boot between Ubuntu 10.04 and Windows Vista) to free up space for linux.
To be honest, I am not exactly a superuser (but I know some things), so I'm having trouble understanding just what all that means.
Or is there some way to get the graphical ones to work again?
As an added benefit you will have a real Windows to go back to in case you need it.
After upgrading to Ubuntu 10.04, none of my graphic partition utilities (GParted, KVPM) can detect any partition table.
Grub was displaying a number of errors before booting.
I had to rebuild the partition table to get windows working again.
I don't think your partition table is messed, OTOH I have no idea why the GUI tools don't work.
What's a good command-line based partition editor that can accomplish my goal of eliminating Windows from my life?
Judging from your disk, I don't think your PC has the power to run a virtualized guest, so having a native Windows environment could be useful in case you need to use something that just doesn't work with Wine.
Symptoms were windows booting to a blinking cursor.
I have also run sudo fdisk -l and gotten the following:
