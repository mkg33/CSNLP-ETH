Option3: Install 1 of the 2 2TB HDDs and mirror the RAID0 data onto the 2TB drive.
This will ensure you have one copy of info in the image, another in the RAID0 (old disks)
I bought a HTPC I plan on using as a NAS/HTPC combo, which has been working well for me for a while now.
Boot into BIOS or gparted if it can handle it, and change the Raid level from 0 to 1.
When I bought the machine from Dell, it came with 2 500GB HDDs in a RAID0 configuration as opposed to a single 1TB HDD as I expected.
Then, once it's mirrored, uninstall the 500GB HDDs, boot into the 2TB HDD and install the 2nd one, and mirror yet again.
Boot up to BIOS, and change the Raid level from 0 to 1.
Option1: Install 1 of the 2 2TB HDDS, and use Clonezilla to copy the RAID0 array to the new HDD.
Swap the RAID0 harddrives, for the blank, 2TB HDDs and boot up in system recovery.
Because I am not 100% sure about the way you plan let me try to define it step by step
(This would be RAID01 w/ 3 drives...is that even possible?)
I have become increasingly concerned about losing my system setup and files, and I want to "upgrade" to a RAID1 with 2 2TB HDDs.
Restart, boot into system recovery, and restore the disk image to the new HDDs.
Option2: Create a system image of the RAID0, and store it on an external harddrive.
I am assuming you can have more than one RAID array at the same time.
Create a second RAID array using the (2) 2TB drives in RAID1.
Frankly, I have doubts whether any of the options will work.
