Scripts with a .sh suffix are generally Bourne shell scripts (or bash, or ksh, or zsh -- all shells derived from the Bourne shell).
You can install Cygwin, which provides a Unix-like environment under Windows -- but it doesn't have a particularly "native" environment.
They use the same commands and syntax as the Windows interactive command prompt.
There's also the relatively new Windows PowerShell; I'm not familiar with it myself, but I've heard good things about it.
(Editorial comment: Cygwin is great for people like me who need to use Windows but would really rather be using Unix.)
There are other Unix-like subsystems that run under Windows, including MinGW and the Windows Services for UNIX package provided by Microsoft.
Or, instead of trying to write and run Unix-like shell scripts, you can write Windows batch files.
(Note that on Unix-like systems, including MacOS, the .sh suffix isn't necessary; the OS looks at the #!/bin/sh line at the top of the script to determine how to execute it.)
It is just giving you the Linux style - use BASH on Win.
You'll need CygWin, and then I believe you'll be able to just run:
A good source for the commands used in Windows shell is ss64 - for CMD and PowerShell.
