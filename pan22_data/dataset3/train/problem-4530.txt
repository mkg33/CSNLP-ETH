I personally haven't tried very hand to figure that one out; as it is, I manually edit wpa_supplicant.conf when I want to add a new secured network.
WPA supplicant is quite convenient to configure on debian/ubuntu, thanks to ifupdown integration.
I've found it useful lately to begin to use cnetworkmanager, a command line interface to NetworkManager, when I don't want to depend on a desktop environment but I want to control my wifi connections practically, or when I want to script wiki connections (especially when using WPA authentication).
Having to edit a config file every time if changing between many networks is quickly frustrating.
which is enough to get it to try and authenticate with most (all?)
The problem with NetworkManager is that controlling it requires mostly GUI programs which integrate very tightly with the desktop environment you're using.
I would like to know a distribution independent way to connect to WPA2 wireless networks.
Most distributions currently rely on NetworkManager to manage their network configuration, and wpa_supplicant takes care of the WPA/WPA2 authentication process.
I am aware of tools like wicd, but would like to know if there is a standard way to do this on all distributions without requiring third party software.
(I use autowifi to do the detection and switching.)
