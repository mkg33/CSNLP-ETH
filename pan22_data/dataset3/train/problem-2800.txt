This can also be done without modification by having a password verification script combined with the use of the ForceCommand configuration option.
The RHEL 6.3 release notes describe it, it's a matter of adding this to your sshd_config
One scheme I've always wanted to toy with is requiring that incoming connections only come from a whitelist of dyndns ip addresses.
Regarding your original question about requiring both a key and a password, if you're running RHEL or CentOS 6.3 this is now posible.
Finally, though no module exists for it, if you moved the public key authentication to PAM then you would  be able to require both steps to pass before PAM considered authentication successful.
I know some security heads would vomit at the thought of the idea, but the fact of the matter is it would add very significant complexity to exploit a box.
This is kinda hard to google for because everything about "ssh key password" is about sshing without a password.
Not sure why no one has mentioned it but - you should make sure to generate the keys longer than default 1024 bits which is no longer considered secure.
I don't have enough time/money/paranoia to set up a VPN -- what's a basic way I can increase the security of my system?
I have a small network of servers and I would like to increase the general security.
Patches related to enabling directly in SSH and lots of relevant discussion:
One thing could be to require that users both send their key and enter a password.
