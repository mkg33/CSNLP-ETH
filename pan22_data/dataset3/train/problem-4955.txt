If the data is owned by one particular user, then locating the files under that user's home directory is also appropriate.
However, this directory is not defined by the standard.
This standard says that they should be located beneath /srv.
The most appropriate place for web content under any server is under /srv.
I'm used to put them in /var/www or /home/www with a symlynk to /var/www when using apache.
I'm mostly using /home/$site-owning-user/foo.bar.com/(htdocs|logs), as the sites my servers host are user-controlled; or /home/$site-owning-group/... if multiple users are controlling a site.
Not sure why, but I read that it was a security matter.
If you are looking for a standard, then the standard would be defined by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.
This keeps all of a user's files together for easier backup and monitoring and such.
Since Nginx has the root directive to point to where files are, choosing the place to put them really is mostly a matter of taste and setup needs.
However it is common Practice to either put them in /www, /var/www, or /srv/www with the later a symlink to /var/www (depending on the distro)
For non-user-controlled sites (eg webapps installed by the sysadmin from packages), /srv probably makes more sense
