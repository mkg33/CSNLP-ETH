b) Use Active Directory - All servers connected remotely to a central Active Directory (Possibly installed on a server in a data-centre to ensure high availability)?
Their purpose is IIS Web hosting, SQL Server, Cache servers, File servers.
These servers are all Windows Servers and a spread out across different hosting companies / data-centres.
Since these Servers are not on the same network - What is the best way to manage this?
c) Came across Azure Active Directory - not sure if this will work?
What is the implications of this when all Servers are remote, in different data centres and not on the same network?
I would like each user to have his own credentials and possibly have the ability be able to centrally manage these user accounts.
Currently we have a single user account per server that all staff use to login when needing to perform management that box.
This will mean duplicating user accounts onto each box and having to manually revoke access individually on each box when needed.
My company has numerous remote servers which we manage.
a) Create a user account for each user separately on each box?
