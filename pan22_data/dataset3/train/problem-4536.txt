Are there any error messages in the event logs on the DC now or around the time this started occurring?
It doesnt prevent anything from working just like a domain connection most of the time however it is getting fustrating!
Just remove the TLD from domain name and reboot, it will add it back after the reboot and all should be good.No fuss, no muss
You should try removing the computer from the domain, and readding it.
I have seen various different questions for this problem floating around but either the circumstances arent the same or the solution doesnt work so thought i would post it to see if anybody has any suggestions.
ex: company.local remove the local and reboot, it will be added back after the reboot
This also appears to happen every time connecting via vpn.
I had this issue and the reason was there was a VLAN mismatch on a Riverbed Steelhead appliance.
The last option isn't really a fix, but it may help troubleshoot the issue.
The In-Path interface on the Riverbed connected to the LAN port of the router, and the In-Path interface was configured for "VLAN Tag ID" of "0".
If anybody has any thoughts on solutions i would appreciate it.
The router LAN interface is in a subinterface configuration (one for voice VLAN 40, and one for data/native VLAN 1), I was able to resolve this issue by assigning the VLAN Tag ID to "1" (data/native) and the issue resolved immediately.
Sounds like something messed up the trust between the computer and the domain.
I have tried removing all but AD server roles, resetting all of the systems and nothing.
Also dont know if it could have anything to do with it but the DHCP server seems to have quite a long lead time on issuing the IP address to the client.
Various domain PCs and laptops appear to randomly give the connection name of "lewis.local 2(Unauthenticated)" - lewis.local being our domain - and provides an exclamation mark where the network type logo is normally shown.
