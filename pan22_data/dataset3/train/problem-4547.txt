Finally, I have column F "Adjusted Portfolio Percent", =E2/SUM($E$2:$E$11).
in pseudocode the Adjusted Portfolio Percent column should be able to be calculated
I then have column E, with column B's values but capped at 30%, =MIN(D2, 0.3).
In which column B are raw scores, column C are normalized versions of column B, column D are clipped versions of column C, and column E is the normalized version of column D.
When it is limited and then re-normalized, its value still exceeds 30%.
Given the score data in column B, I have column D, "Unadjusted Portfolio Percent", where each row has the formula =B3/SUM($B$2:$B$11)
Maybe this data transformation is a lot to ask of something that's not a programming language?
Right now I have a spreadsheet with 10 assets in column A and some score in column B. I want to calculate the percent of a portfolio that I would allocate to each asset, based on its score, but capped so that no asset can have more than 30% of the portfolio.
=MIN(B2/SUM($B:$B), .3)/SUM(x -> MIN(x/SUM($B:$B), .3), $B:$B).
Factoring out the repeated logic into a local function would be cool, but maybe that's a lot to ask of something that's not a programming language.
I'm trying to transform a set of data and then use it in another formula, without using an intermediate column.
My first instinct is that there's probably some syntax for applying a transformation to a column before using it, lambda style.
I have no clue how to do this with excel, though I'd be stoked if I could write a formula with some sort of lambda syntax.
I'm having trouble figuring out how to impose this cap without using another column for score prime.
You may need to re-think you methodology slightly.
I'm an excel newbie so it's possible there's an answer to this already and I just didn't know the right terms.
