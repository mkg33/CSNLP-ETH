What I'm try to achieve it's pretty simple, and, after googling, its hard to believe I've been unable to find a solution.
What I want is to forward all current messages (already delivered) of an user (michael@mydomain.com) to another external and out of my control account (michael@hisdomain.com).
The source server (the ours) is an Ubuntu Server 14.04 with postfix/dovecot.
If you have IMAP access to michael@hisdomains.com you may consider the IMAP upload feature, available in all mail clients.
All messages passed from MTA to LDA (dovecot's deliver) will be stored in mailbox as well as redirected to another MTA.
Then just create script for specific user that contain the next code:
Thunderbird, Outlook, Windows Live Mail) and drag'n'drop messages from one inbox to another.
If you haven't IMAP access, you can use the "Forward" feature - available in Horde webmail or mutt command line mail client - that will preserve the original sender (mind the spam filter on the recipient)
Or there are plenty of automatic IMAP migration tools.
You can use sendmail with your messages files (Maildir) as input and parameter -i to not treat a line with only a . character as the end of the input.
The only thing that comes to mind is through a bash script, for example, iterating over every plaintext mailbox's message, manipulate their contents to erase headers, and forward them using sendmail, but I think there should be a simple tool or option of a very well-known tool to specify the destination account and the mail filepath to be forwarded.
