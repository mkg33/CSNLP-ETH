You can run this as a serial USB device (FTDI-based cable) to GPIO pins
The OTG solution is much more elegant and will impress your friends more in my opinion
GPIO and serial port is not enable for this facility.
The simplest, fastest, and probably most reliable connection would be a point-to-point Ethernet cable.
The raspberrypi zero fits this form factor very well and I think the design intent was to have folks using the zero as a USB peripheral.
or you can use the raspberry pi in OTG mode to run the PI as a USB peripheral.
on another note (being a medical device engineer myself) as regards to software and computer systems validations, please understand that if your "prototype" will be used to collect any sort of quality data (design, process monitoring, etc) it will need to undergo some sort of assessment based on the 21 CFR part 11 with regards to software validation.

There is no any in built facility in raspberry pi to place two way communication modem.
If you want a wireless approach write a nodejs socket app
The serial end could be on the Pi from the UART (pins 8/10) or on the PC end with a suitable RS232 adapter.
You can raspberry pi with mobile only using some adaptor which can work as two way communication.
