Examine your needs .. a shopping list to get started with is:
If your users are used to "webmail.example.org" just redirect it.
Some certificate vendors have specific instructions for Exchange servers -- there may be others / better deals out there; I haven't researched this recently.
See http://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-use-ssl-certificates-with-exchange-2007.html for more information.
Yes, you should be able get away with self-signing the internal certificates, especially as you can probably create a CA and install that CA certificate on your user's computers so they don't even get prompted.
Also depends in what -- if anything -- you're using for management; in some cases SCOMs requries a certificate (I don't know the details).
I set up a cert for a Exchange 2007 hosted at a IaaS site, and ended up with 5 names on the cert...
Without knowing more, I'd say you need two certificates -- one, which is signed by a third party, for webmail.example.org, and one, which can be self-signed, for the IMAP/SMTP/Exchange internal traffic.
Get a single 3rd party cert for "mail.example.org" and make it the cert for both by pointing OWA to "mail.example.org".
You'll want to get a Unified Communications certificate to do this.
At a minimum, you'll want to include your OWA name, your internal server name, and an autodiscover name (autodiscover.yourdomain.com) to enable Autodiscover in newer email clients.
