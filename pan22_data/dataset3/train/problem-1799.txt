There are 3rd party applications (mostly paid/not free) that will be able to traverse your registry and obtain any serial/license keys.
There's really no easy way to "copy" software in the Windows world from one computer to another.
It sounds like you want to maximize your money earned rather than spend money to sell the machine with a clean Windows XP install.
If not, getting an XP CD is one thing, but the license is quite another.
They might have some utilities that may work for this specific scenario.
Maybe this would be an opportunistic time to upgrade to Windows 7 OEM and add some of the cost onto the price?
If the computer is a brand name machine, hunt down the manufacturer's website for any hint of a recovery CD and see if that'll do the trick.
I'd say, your best bet is to look for a recovery disc from the manufacturer and try reinstalling Windows that way.
If not, it looks like your only option is to manually remove everything.
The key you have may be for retail or OEM version.
Google alone can point you to many utilities that might meet your requirements.
Your key if it's on the computer itself (like on a sticker or something) may not be usable if you use a different XP CD/DVD.
If this is a brand name computer like HP/Dell/Compaq/whatever, then there may be a recovery disc available for purchase online (usually pretty cheap - $5-$10).
If you can't find it, you may have to manually remove all the software.
But it's looking like that may or may not be an option.
XP has many different versions both for home and professional.
