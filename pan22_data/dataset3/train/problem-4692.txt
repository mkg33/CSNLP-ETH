Dev instance is the production database for developers.
Pretty simple question: is it standard/best practice to backup dev and QA instances of the database?
In this situation, if it was up to you, would you do transaction log backups at least every hour just in case?
That is 6400$ for one day of work on a DEV database.
Having said that, many development groups decide to use source code control like version manager or vss to backup and version development products, thereby getting rid of the database backup works on dev servers.
Assume that the schema information is kept in some form of source control.
Do not take the simple recovery model decision by yourself if you are not owner of the system, leave that to the one that gets paid to make decisions.
But help him by explaining the situation in $ language.
One of my customer faced that situation and chose simple recovery model before I explained it in the language they understand $$.
Say that you have 8 developers working daily with a dev database.
