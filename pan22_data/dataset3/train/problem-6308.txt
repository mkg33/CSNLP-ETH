P.S My mistake is that the image wasn't installed correctly and that I had a typo in my password.
9) Shutdown rapsberry pi or use ifconfig to re-connect using your raspberry pi's IP
After that input raspberry as the default password
The step-by-step process for someone that wants to take remote access from a Raspberry Pi Zero W using Windows and Putty is the following:
2) Create empty ssh file (that means ssh and not ssh.txt because that would be text)
1) Download and install the latest Raspbian using Etcher
5.5) Connect your microusb with raspberry's data port
6) Open Putty and as HOST input pi@raspberrypi.local.
4) Open cmdline.txt with wordpad or notepad++ and after the word rootwait press space and write modules-load=dwc2,g_ether.
For anyone new that reads this post I followed this video tutorial.
3) Open config.txt with wordpad or notepad++ and write dtoverlay=dwc2 at the very bottom of the file.
7) Once you are logged in type sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.confand then paste the following lines your router's SSID and Password :
5) Download and install Bonjour for windows and Putty
Now you will be able to use raspberry pi remotely without having to connect it to your PC everytime
