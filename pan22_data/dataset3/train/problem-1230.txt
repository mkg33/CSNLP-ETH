This is only an anecdote (as the sample size is one - me!)
Reliability should be no concern for either sleep, or hibernation.
I expect that you can find some people who've experienced problems, but I would have expected to read more about them if they were common.
Sleep is faster, nothing to save, nothing to load (mostly).
Many many people use it daily without problems, and only boot all the way down when Windows requires it, or if sloppy apps cause a crash.
Having a 4 GB file on your C: partition is not exactly the best thing, at times.
Hibernation is slower than sleep because the whole contents of the RAM must be saved on disk when entering this state.
That file must then be loaded back into RAM when exiting hibernation.
Well, to understand why sleep is preferred instead of hibernation, it's important to know what each of them is (source):
You'll know after the first few hibernates whether it works fine on your hardware.
but all the times I've used hibernate it's restored the system perfectly.
Hibernation uses disk space (obviously) and doesn't work on some (mostly older) hardware.
Also, how reliably does it bring back everything how you left it?
