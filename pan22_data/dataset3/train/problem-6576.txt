If you press both buttons together the tool will exit if you confirm the appearing dialog box.
I am using a Logitech G9 mouse and running VMWare Workstation 6.5.3 on Vista x64.
(I didn't really expect this to work since the guest OS doesn't actually see the mouse hardware as a Logitech G9 directly anyway.)
This will wait for a window including "VMware Workstation" in it's Title and if any of the Thumb Mouse buttons are pressed (Code 05 + 06) the KeyCombination of Alt+Left/Alt+Right is pressed.
Does anyone know if such a workaround exists, or is 5-button mouse functionality just not supported?
Because VMware only emulates 6 states with it's generic mouse.
I have tried installing the Logitech software inside the guest OS as well, but it still did not recognize the back / forward buttons.
I vaguely remember seeing something a while back about editing the virtual machine config file to specify a 5-button mouse rather than the default 3-button setup, but I can't seem to find any specifics on how to do so in the VMWare documentation.
But as a workaround you can use my tool I've just written in AutoIt for I really needed this function as well.
The guest OS is Win XP, and has the most current version of VMWare Tools installed.
(left, right and middle mouse button, scroll wheel up, down, pressed)
For Windows host use AutoHotKey to change mouse button mapping:
Left / right buttons and mouse wheel scrolling work fine in the guest OS, but the back / forward buttons are apparently not recognized.
Just compile this on your own with AutoIt or download the compiled executable from my webspace: http://jtmeyer.de/mousetool.exe
Your buttons should now work - no installation of logitech software or anything required.
