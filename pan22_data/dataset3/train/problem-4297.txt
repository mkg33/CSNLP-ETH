I need a guidance on how to approach this problem, I do not expect full solutions (though, I gotta admit, it would be helpful :D)
For the sake of simplicity I can make 2 compromises in the design, if you guys think that this is too complicated, or that the implementation of such behaviour is an obvious overkill:
On another spreadsheet I want to have a search box with autocomplete functions.
This has to be done in excel, I hope you can help-out.
For example I have two items in the database - item1 and house2.
In excel, I have certain names of items linked to certain barcode numbers (for example item1 00335578).
When the user starts typing "it", the possible matches (in the current scenario item1) should popup (just like in Google search) and the user can click on them.
Let's say these are stored in 2 columns in a spreadsheet.
Preferably this will also paste it into another program that is currently open (I would be happy for suggestions on that).
Next to this field there will be a button - "Copy".
By clicking on it will copy the barcode of the corresponding item that we searched for (NOT THE NAME).
