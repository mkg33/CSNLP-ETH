Situation: a client with an AIX machine can't connect properly to a Windows 2003 Server running FTP server Serv-U FTP Server v10.2.
It's not clear where the error is, whether this is an issue on the FTP client or server side.
As far as I know, none of the AIX versions up to 7.1 ship with a SSL capable FTP client (and there's no -s switch as you show in your example), so it sounds like they're using a non-standard client, which could be anything really.
Or maybe guidance on what to tell the client to do to give us something more diagnostic than "unable to authenticate."
Here's a curl command and the output error I get from a FreeBSD machine outside the network:
Maybe ask them to switch to LFTP, or Curl from IBM's RPM packages, both have FTP over SSL support
Using a FreeBSD machine, I was trying to see if I could evaluate what might be happening, so what I tried was running curl as below, and also using curl inside PHP, and I get a sense that it's possible there's an issue with SSL certificates on the Windows server.
We have faced a similar problem in our enterprise setup; it was caused by following line in configuration of the Cisco ASA on the way between the involved machines:
Any guidance on how to debug this and maybe see the certs that are being passed back and forth?
But then other folks have been able to connect from other machines using SFTP without issue, so it's hard to say where the problem is.
Again, when we open vanilla FTP to them, everything works fine, so it's definitely in the security of the connection.
They are connecting with an ftp binary that has a -s flag option.
