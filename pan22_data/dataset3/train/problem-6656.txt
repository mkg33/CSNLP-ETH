$d_description, $c_description, $jd, $prev_bl, p_debit, b_debit, and so on are very unclear.
The calling method has no idea why the code failed, only that it failed.
That doesn't necessarily mean that the code should be changed, especially not without discussion, but that's a bit off-topic here.
Don't shorten variable names, it makes code hard to read.
Returning false isn't a great way to handle errors.
For example, Save_X and Loan_X could either go in an X class, or in an XDao.
Their scope is narrow (most of them either load or save stuff), which is how it should be.
Also, sometimes you don't even return false, but just ignore errors, which makes it really difficult to find bugs.
You could further improve your code structure by putting these functions in appropriate classes.
It is 200 lines of spaghetti code; I have no idea what it does, it is impossible to reuse and extremely difficult to test, debug, or change.
By adding guard clauses to your functions and returning early, you can reduce the level of nesting, and make it more obvious when what values are returned.
