Since the app crashed on glTexImage2D, I felt like, it's running out of texture memory (as against virtual memory).
We're taking steps to minimize the texture allocation ( via compression, using fewer bits/channel and doing procedural shaders for VFX etc).
On iOS it seems that you are asking for trouble when the total memory usage for your app starts approaching half of the device's total memory (1gb for iPhone 5).
My team is running into an issue where the amount of texture memory allocated via the glTexImage2D is high enough that it crashes the app ( at about 400 MB for iPhone 5).
AFAIK on iOS devices ( and many Android devices) there's no dedicated VRAM and our app process is still well within the virtual memory limit.
Is there any documentation/guideline on the recommended texture memory usage by an app (not just optimize your texture memory) .
But there's not a completely hard limit and it's not totally predictable.
Anecdotally it seems that if your app has been ejected by the OS for using too much memory, it can be extra sensitive about ejecting you in the future (until reboot).
We have noticed that you get more leeway after a reboot of the device, for example.
My searches so far has resulted only in info on max texture size and tricks for optimizing texture usage and such.
Is this some how related to the size of physical RAM ?
