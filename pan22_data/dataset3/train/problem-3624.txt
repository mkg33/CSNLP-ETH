So the question is, how do I actually get the compiler to look in there?
This is despite the fact that MagickWand.h is already in the system in /usr/include/ImageMagick/wand/MagickWand.h.
In my Arch Linux I created these the two symbolic links:
Putting stuff directly in /usr is generally a bad idea for anything not provided by the system itself - if you segregate all of the things you add in /usr/local instead and leave /usr largely alone, you'll find the system much easier to administer as well since you'll be able to (long after you've forgotten about this) figure out what you added vs what came with the system.
Then runs bundle again and rmagick was corrected installed.
I installed ImageMagick through, (Using ImageMagick 6.7.3-7)
The key is in the configure output where it says "checking for wand/MagickWand.h" - clearly the ImageMagick directory is not expected in /usr/include, which means you need to either move the contents of that directory up a level or you need to install ImageMagick itself differently.
