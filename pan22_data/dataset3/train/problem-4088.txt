I'm hacking together a Pong-style game, and my problem is with the walls (box collider, no rigid body) not completely stopping movement of the player paddle (box collider, yes rigid body.)
Unity's CharacterController can handle this, it's a bit clunky to use at first (I thought) but it's how I addressed this exact same problem.
My problem objects are Player Paddle, Upper, and Lower https://www.dropbox.com/s/yx9svb51nywdvgg/pong-export.unitypackage?dl=0
There is initial resistance, but I would expect Player Paddle to stop moving abruptly at the wall.

Instead of transform.translate, you'll use the CharacterController's Move() or SimpleMove().
I exported an asset package that reproduces the problem.
My player paddle simply moves up and down (Z-axis) with up/down mouse movement:

Sufficiently fast mouse movement eventually moves the paddle through the wall.
I found this question, but I'm not sure if it applies to my problem.
