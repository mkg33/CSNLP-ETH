2) Do any of the other VMs on that host (or the host itself) display the same behavior when you ping them in an identical manner from an identical place on the network?
6) Is VMware tools installed on the VM and up to date?
It was solved by taking the offending vm to a different vmfs/storage.
Turned out to be a crappy driver + broken TCP offloading (in the driver).
Anyhow, could be a hardware or related problem (driver version etc.
Check the load on the VMware server (CPU, interrupts, network traffic).
High write queues can result in high latency which can have symptoms just like you described.
3) Are any of the other VMs running the same operating system as the VM displaying the behavior?
You have one of those VMs as a Windows 2003 server.
1) Does the packet loss occur when pinging from one of the other VMs running on that host?
You have an ESX host that is running multiple VMs, right?
Some of them are just really crappily implemented.
When I started using Hyper-V I got the same issue with some machines.
5) When you go into the vSphere console, do you see any kind of performance graph changes that match the timing of your ping loss?
You say you use VmWare - but not whether server or esx.
You say when you run pings from a "remote" machine to that VM, you see 10-20 seconds of packet loss.
