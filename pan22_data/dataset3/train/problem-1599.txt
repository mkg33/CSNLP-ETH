Especially if it has been a long time since you've taken a full backup and no longer have the relevant log entries.
It is possible to replicate from an older version 'master' to a new version master for the next higher major version (5.1 to 5.5 for example): http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-compatibility.html
I am assuming that bin log is portable between two machines (same OS, Architechture but different machines running same version of MySQL)
Of course bin logs are portable to the same architecture running on different machines, or replication would be almost useless (there are difficulties with running on different OSes, though).
Is it possible to apply MySQL 5.1 bin log to MySQL 5.5.
But at the heart of it, Binary Logs from an older major version to the next major version is supported.
Since your question only asked about applying a bin log to the second server, I might mention that if you don't have the 'master position' of when the second server should begin reading the binary log, you might have inconsistencies in data.
