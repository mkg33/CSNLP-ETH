If it doesn't immediately meet your needs, it's open-source, so you might be able to extend it.
IxChariot will transfer a block of your own definition between agents residing on any two hosts of your choice, up to and including the ability to embed agents in custom hardware for WiFi certification testing.
I have received no compoensation from the endorsement of this exceptionally cool network test tool.
This is also a nice testing app but its main use is to test a file server.
You should be able to find out how many send/receive errors and dropped packets occurred from the hosts involved by looking at the statistics from their NIC.
But it will do the job of testing the network connections as well.
However a managed switch should be able to show you the global picture of these sort of things.
However the error rate should be 0 as tcp will detect any problems and retransmit packets that fail to arrive or arrive with bad checksums.
It can simulate multiple clients and access patterns as well.
There are plenty of network load generators out there.
