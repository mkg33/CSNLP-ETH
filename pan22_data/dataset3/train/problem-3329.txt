I'm attempting to import a CSV file into a database via the "COPY" command; however, I get the (what seems common) error that I need to be a superuser and that I should use "\copy" instead.
But check userrights carefully, sometimes the rights are the problem.
The first giving me a superuser error the latter giving me that syntax error.
The only other question I have is concerning the importing of the columns via tablename(column2, column3 and so on.
Another method is to create a view for the sql query.
This is what \copy in psql actually does in the back-end.
You will need to use COPY instead (but that requires the file to be present on the database server)
See the docs at http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/sql-copy.html for more information.
You could then put the body of the copy into your query or at least that's how it works in psql.
If you read the hint again carefully it notes you can copy from stdin.
I'm executing the command via myPgAdmin's sql input field.
On my 9.1 system the error I get is quite informative:
