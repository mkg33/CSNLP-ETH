I tried uninstalling and reinstalling MariaDB, errors persist, because databases are still here...
2015-11-04 12:30:20 7000008b1000  InnoDB: Error: trying to access tablespace 893002339 page no.
All of my databases and log files reside in /usr/local/var/mysql if that if of any help.
I'm guessing my DB got corrupted at some point and MariaDB fails to perform integrity check.
If there's an easy fix I'll be glad to accept it, but if not I'm ready to drop all of my DBs (I've got backups) and start over with fresh brew install of MariaDB.
I have a MariaDB installed with brew in my macbook.
When in reality it simple wasn't created since DB never started.
InnoDB: Error: trying to access update undo rec field 48 in index "PRIMARY" of table... InnoDB: but index has only 25 fields
InnoDB: but the tablespace does not exist or is just being dropped.
also, if I issue mysql -uroot or any other mysql command I'm getting ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2 "No such file or directory") which was pretty confusing and I spent hours figuring out where mysql.sock went.
