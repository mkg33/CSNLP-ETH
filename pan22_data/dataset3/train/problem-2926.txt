Perhaps the only thing you should worry about is operating hard drives at high altitudes (non pressurized planes or high mountains).
Basically, I sometimes move mine in between 45 degrees and flat... Never had a problem.
However, now, most advanced laptop hard drive even automatically park the head when they reach a certain G-Force (I think the Seagate ones that end in AS).
That isn't necessarily bad, just takes time to shift out of that state of mind ...
Apart from others have said (the part about the hdd's being true for early models, not so much nowadays) I'll just add that  mine over the years has:
The optical drives aren't built to deal with motion the way hard drives are; introducing any kind of motion while a burn is in progress is a great way to make a coaster.
Earlier hard drives did have this sort of problem but I haven't seen it for many years - many of them are rated to a certain G-Force rating and as long as you don't excessively shake them, they should not have a problem
If the ambient pressure drops below a certain point, they get far more vulnerable to headcrashes.
He does know they can be pretty much used under water (tested it once!)
and it's not a Toughbook, but a regular HP medium grade one.
Have never thrown mine across the room ... try it and let me know how that goes :)
To prevent damage in the latter case, many laptops contain some kind of accelerometer built-in to halt the heads of the hard drive in case of free fall and quick movement.
So I'd say your friend is maybe just panicking a little (one of those who out of inexperience, or not knowing follows the manual to the letter).
Hard drive read/write-heads hover a very short distance above the platters on a tiny bit of pressurized air.
Hard drives can operate in any direction nowadays, and the only thing to worry about are sharp jolts and freefalls.
If you have ever taken a old music cd player and jogged, you would hear jumps as it lost its place...
