if you do not allow any network connection between you Pi and PC, the only viable transfer method would be an USB stick or any kind of flash memory you copy files from your PC to and subsequently copy from on your Raspberry Pi.
Once you have them connected via the serial cable you need a way to use it to transfer files.
For various reasons you need to get files from a PC to the Raspberry pi without a network connection.
Kermit is designed for sending files without errors over unreliable connections.
I haven't done this in quite a long time but my starting point would be Kermit which can run in server mode on the Raspberry Pi and have a scripted client on the PC.
Since the PC will initiate the communication this connection will be difficult to exploit.

As an alternative to using the serial port on the GPIO header you could just get 2 USB->serial cables with standard DB9 connectors like this and a standard DB9-DB9 null modem and use these to connect the computer to the RPi using the USB ports.
The protocol you want is SCP over SSH (which means that SSH must be enabled).
Given that constraint you could connect the PC to the Raspberry Pi using a USB->serial cable.
You will need to disable the serial console and serial login on the Raspberry Pi.
Transferring files using SCP via the command line is a pain but you can install programs like FileZilla that make this really easy.
