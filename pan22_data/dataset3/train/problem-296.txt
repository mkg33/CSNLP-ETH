If you can run it on Linux I would recommend that, however if you need to run on Windows you can use Cygwin which includes Rsync in it.
Also, the only "sync"-like thing that does what you're looking for are things like revision control software.
(A big bonus with this is that it will do incremental mirroring, i.e.
:) that I used when migrating large amounts of data from one share to another.
Storage level replication is also a very good option but will cost you big $$$
The single best tool for this work is RSync, which not only handles the scenarios you listed but handles delta copy very well.
Robocopy in mirroring mode will work as well, but it won't key off the fact that a file has changed.
Maybe in this case you may take a look at Easy2sync.
Here's a script that I shamelessly copied from somewhere, (why re-invent the wheel, eh?
I used this successfully over very slow WANS (512k wireless links were the norm) to sync almost 800Gb during the night.
I know Subversion can do things like that, and I suspect git and the other newer ones can as well.
run it once to replicate, then run it again and it will only copy over the files that have changed.
DFS folder replication will work, there's a tutorial here and here's the MS webpage.
Maybe it handles large file movements intelligently too.
Why don't you manually copy it on each end, then run syncback after that's all done?
Another product to consider is Vertias (Symantec) Replication Exec.
If you use HP in a large corporate setting and have a vendor agreement or something set up with them, check into HP StorageWorks Storage Mirroring, however it's a bit heavy-handed for two windows folders.
