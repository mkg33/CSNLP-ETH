To solve all three issues, this function should use an existing mysqli connection object.
Get rid of the conditional call to addslashes(), because it redundantly tries to do the same thing as real_escape_string(), but inaccurately.
If at all possible, I suggest that you consider replacing it all with a standard solution such as PDO.
Magic quotes was an ill-conceived idea that in fact has been deprecated in PHP 5.3 and will be removed altogether in 5.4.
PHP is not my area of expretise, so just some generic notes:
It's good that your application is using some kind of database abstraction layer, but I get the feeling that you are reinventing the wheel, poorly.
(Include the stripslashes() routine early in your script so that your entire program benefits.)
The only good reason for calling get_magic_quotes_gpc() would be to detect whether you are running on a server that has this unfortunate feature enabled, and undo its ill effects with stripslashes() if it is.
Your motivation is justified, but the revised code isn't quite right either.
Revising the function to use $conn->real_escape_string() protects you from SQL injection problems.
