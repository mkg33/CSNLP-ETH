Openvpn server's should (generally) not chew up the resources of even a somewhat old computer.
Without knowing your hardware I'd say yes, it might be worth a shot to let the PCs do the work of encrypting/compressing the packets.
You need to provide additional information about the hardware of your openvpn server.
The problem might not only be encryption but also compression.
Would it be better if i use client-to-client connections and access the fileserver in the one net from a pc in the other, because the openvpn-server does not have to decrypt the (whole) packets?
The routers en/decrypt all traffic that goes from one net to another.
Chances are the internet connection is the bottleneck and not the computer itself, but while we are at it, what internet connection do you use?
Maybe try deactivating the compression in the routers first and see if that removes enough bottleneck before you start to rebuild your whole vpn setup.
This works but performance is not as good as possible.
As for encryption/decryption, you'll get that even when you connect an openvpn client to another openvpn client.
In its well-meant try to save bandwith (which you perhaps have plenty of today) a small cpu might indeed crumble under the additional load.
I think the limiting factor is the cpu power of the router.
I wouldn't be surprised if each of your PCs is more powerful than your router, so it's a promising approach.
