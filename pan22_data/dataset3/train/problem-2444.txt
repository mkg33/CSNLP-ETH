(i would copy it either in /boot/EFI and /boot/EFI/boot for some reason).
One fallback/test option is to remove all the other drives from the system, and see if the bios/boot falls back to a optical drive boot when no other devices are found.
So, as i suggested, you should boot in with the Hiren Boot cd somewhere you can do it successfully.
because, what I usually find (and why I use the USB) is that many systems come with the boot-to-optical drive disabled.
It boots on my new system and works on all the computers I get in for repairs.
"Hiren's CD to Bootable USB" is a free to use tool to make bootable USB disk from Hiren's CD iso.
I suppose it has a builtin grub in it, so try grub2-install --target=x86_64-efi --> or i don't know what instruction set your laptop has, but read grub's man page for help (first make sure, you have a boot directory, if not, then make one:))
Hirens Boot CD uses ISOlinux (part of Syslinux) to create it's environment.
I was using 2014 without UEFI but this new 2015 is described to support UEFI.
I made one following this: https://ttcshelbyville.wordpress.com/2014/10/10/rufus-usb-boot-and-hirens-boot-iso/
The systems are designed to be reverse compatible with old boot disks, which makes "converting the Cd to EUFI" irrelevant.
So what you are most likely looking for is enabling the system to boot from a legacy optical drive which may not be an option from the bios.
I have made bootable HDD with small partition for DLCD and other partition with ghost images and other software tools...
After this has gone well, you're gonna find the .efi file in somewhere /boot/efi/.../.
some Toshiba's dont' even give the option to change that in the bios.
The OEM Windows has to be booted, and the drive order enabled and changed from there!
It's very similar to HBCD - something like HBCD upgrade.

If you are looking for a read only copy (CD/DVD), there are tools that can make a EUFI bootable CD and then copy the files over... but that probably won't work for you...

I used PXELinux (also part of Syslinux) to boot Hirens over PXE and had to basicly port some of hirens menu's en files and switch out the BIOS ISOLinux files for the UEFI ones.
Look in to their guides on how to make an image to change the the Files you need to UEFI-capable ones.
Its that "legacy optical boot" being automatically disabled is what is probably causing your problems.
Now you have the efi file, so you can modify the ISO content.
