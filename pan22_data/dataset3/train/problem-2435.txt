You can get a lot of that functionality from something like NSSM - the Non-Sucking Service Manager, SRVANY (from various Windows resource kits), or any other number of similiar projects out there.
We have an application that needs to be running all the time, and automatically restart when the server reboots.
Does anyone have any expereince with this product, or another product that accomplishs the same goal?
Then start up your app via the service on service startup & stop the app on service shutdown.
Does anyone have any expereince with getting a regualr windows application to run as a service?
That commercial offering you're referring to is "adding value" by being nice to applications it hosts-- trying to close them gracefully when the service control manager asks it to "stop", etc.
The only problem is that the company that created this software was not so thoughtful :-(
Perhaps a free, open source, or Microsoft solution?
What you won't get from those tools is obsessive attention to shutting down applications cleanly like that commercial tool you mentioned.
I have found a product from Eltima Network that appears to target this problem.
