It doesn't make any sense until it's clear there are two types of twisted-pair ethernet socket, and they are almost never labelled.
Obviously the same is the case for switch-to-switch connections, except that before auto-crossover was common, there was usually an "uplink" socket, which was MDI, for plugging into the upstream switch.
My thoughts are this: imagine a laptop with an ethernet port on its right side, and on the left hand side of the port is the TX+ pin.
One is found on laptops/desktops/etc and is called "MDI"; the other is found on hubs/switches/etc and is called "MDI-X", for "crossover".
I can understand from the image that the transmission wires are swapping with the receive wires, and I know why that is important, but I'm struggling to see why the right hand side shouldn't be vertically flipped from what it is in the image above.
I'm not sure how confusing that came across, but I've (badly) drawn a diagram to try and show what I'm trying to explain (L meaning left relative to the arrow, and R meaning right relative to the arrow, with the arrow just being the way the port is facing):
You can see that if you plug computer-to-computer (or switch to switch) you need either:
I'm trying to understand how crossover cables work, and am looking at this image:
Thus each transmitter is connected to the other's receiver.
100baseT is usually actually "100base-TX" and works the same, but more complexity applies to less-common variants and to 1000baseT.
Now imagine another laptop on the right of the first, with an ethernet port on its left side and, again, having the TX+ pin on the left side of the port.
The crossover in the image above would connect the RX+ to the right side of the rightmost laptop's port, so that rather than connecting to the TX+ it is connecting it to one of the unused wires.
