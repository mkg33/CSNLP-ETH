There would be about 50 users on one network, 20 on the second, and 5 on the third.
I plan on purchasing a 1U SuperMicro Atom box with an add-in card for a total of 6 physical network ports.
I do consulting work for three related non-profits in the same building.
Right now I am trying to figure out how to set up the software and would like some advice.
The three have decided to share the same internet pipe and have tasked me with building a new gateway box.
The internet pipe is a 50Mbit down/12Mbit up cable connection.
Any advice on the above or other options that anyone would recommend would be appreciated.
If I do option 3 are there any thoughts on running 3 separate Ubuntu VMs so that each non-profit would have its own DansGuadian instance instead of running one instance and using filter groups.
The gateway would be used to split the internet between the non-profits, provide some basic traffic shaping, and filter content using DansGuardian.
I am looking for some words of wisdom from the members of this forum.
