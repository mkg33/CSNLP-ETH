@Denis_CBL answered the question, but another tweak is needed before the archive to Glacier will work.
With the sunset of CrashPlan I'm exploring different options for backup; Cloudberry with Amazon Glacier seems like a good option.
These are the options that appear under cloud storage.
Please go to edit | lifecycle policy and set archive to Glacier transition to 0 days.
My "Lifecycle policy" dialog was blank and there was no way to set the transition to Glacier.
I've been able to set up my Windows machine to backup locally and to the Glacier without issues, but can't seem to find any way to add Glacier as a backup destination on the ubuntu machine (LAN backup works fine).
You need to click on the blank space marked with the yellow bar, then the Amazon S3 backup option will appear, after which you can set Lifecycle policy as described by @Denis_CBL.
Tried "S3 Compatible" but it asks me for an Endpoint which I'm not sure what to use.
I can use Amazon S3, but this is not the same as Glacier (I need to give the IAM user specific S3 permissions to use this).
In that case, your files will be transferred automatically from S3 to Glacier with no additional costs.
