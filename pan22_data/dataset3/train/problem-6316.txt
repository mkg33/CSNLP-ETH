Once that's working transfer the database and repoint the datasource to the new database.
I am a System admin assigned the task of migrating a couple of Cold Fusion websites from a 2003 Server(SQLSERVER 2005) to 2012 Server(SQLSERVER 2008).
Could anyone come up with a link or a doc for a scenario that suites this?
I have come across a doc that shows how to install CF on a Server 2008/2003, but not on how to move the websites or with the DB connection.
I have the least idea or even a list of precautions to be considered beforehand.
You shouldn't have too much issue, you main issue will be ensuring configurations are correct, any customized setting in coldfusion administrator, any stored procedures or special database configurations etc.
My recommendation is you move the website files first and establish a connection to the old database.
Coldfusion will let you package a CAR file to export it's settings, depending on your version of cf, compatability might be an issue.
I have'nt ever been on such a task- i have very little experience on IIS and SQL as well.
