I just upgraded my hp 1000 notebook PC from windows 8.1 to 10 and the sound quality has been extremely poor.
The sound quality is now as good as it was before updating to Windows 10.
Might try living with it briefly, to give Microsoft an opportunity to fix the problem, might revert to Windows 7.
Seems like a Windows 8/10 glitch from everything I've read this afternoon.
It seems quite nice that everything I had in windows 8.1 is completely saved with my settings, but no idea about this Sound Quality thingy.
I've tried disabling all Enhancements (Sound > Playback > Properties), I've tried setting the speakers to full range (Sound > Playback > Configure), I've tried toggling the bit depth (Sound > Playback > Properties > Advanced), and I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver, all to no avail.
But then I went to the Dell support site and they had an updated Realtek driver package which I downloaded and installed.
The sound quality was good with Windows 8.1, but after upgrading to Windows 10 I had no bass and it just sounded bad.
If your audio driver is Realtek then try the following, it worked for me:
I checked for driver updates via Windows and it didn't find anything.
Bass response is minimal using NVIDIA High Definition Audio driver and extant playback arrangement, which previously worked fine under Windows 7.
I am using the very same headphones and surprised to hear such bad sound.
There are no sound effects or enhancements options to disable with my driver.
Don't know why it worked, but sound is back to normal and it doesn't sound like a pirated copy of music from someone's flip phone anymore.
You might want to check HP's support site to see if they have updated drivers for your system.
I'm experiencing the same problem with a Dell XPS 12 laptop which has a Realtek audio system.
