The 50 full-use phones will get full external telephony, and about half of the common area phones will be strictly internal calls.
Ideally I could drop everything onto a single box, but I don't want to end up getting awful service because of it.
This document gives an example of hosting the four main compontents, FrontEnd, Edge, SQL, Monitor, and Archive on a single physical server, in 4 separate VMs.
I'm planning out a new Lync 2010 deployment (mixed with Office 365 E4, completely replacing a legacy PBX system), and am getting a bit confused with some of the docs that MS provides.
The single-box solution is approved for 2000 users, which is way more than what we are shooting for.
However, according to this article, collocating Mon/Arch and FE is only supported in a test environment.
Because of the very lightweight environment (and small budget), I'm trying to virtualize as many of the server roles onto a single box as I can.
That would mean that I need to get one incredibly beefy server for all of those roles, and then one additional lightweight server for the director.
Does that mean that I should be totally find to virtualize everything?
The company I'm building this for is very lightweight - only 50 full-use phones, and then about 15 common area phones.
