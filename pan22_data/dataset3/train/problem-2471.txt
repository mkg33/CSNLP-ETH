Urban legend and The Daily WTF have it that CD drives are all too often used for this purpose.
It's easy enough to find solenoids, servos etc with the power to push a button.
On the other hand a mechanical button pusher is likely to need to be held in a very precise location relative to the button for reliable operation.
In many cases the difficulty of building such a mount turns out to be more trouble than just soldering some wires to the back of the switch and hooking them up to a relay.
Where nessacery providing support for the thing the button is pressed on.
Solenoid yes but the best version I found was a car door unlock solenoid.
I would recommend that you put a soft tip on the front so that repeated presses do not damage the button.
I used a 12v power supply and a transistor controlled from the GPIO pin.
For a simple button pressing solenoid, something like this might work well.
I believe the most appropriate device would be a solenoid.
Humans are really very good at pressing buttons on arbitary things, compensating for slight changes in the position of the thing, compensating for the reaction force exerted on their own body.
