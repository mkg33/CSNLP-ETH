I'm happy with a Windows, macOS or Ubuntu solution!
I've done several Google searches, but nothing quite produces what I expect to see.
The folder I am using has over 2000 images which are named AyyMMddhhmmssff.jpg.
Yes, I know that will result in a 20/40min+ video!
We seem to get quite a few images, so I would like to make them into a video to ease viewing.
My preference would be Windows (since that is where the FTP server is).
I'm no expert when it comes to using FFMPEG, but I have used it for several tasks and found it to be a great utility to have around.
However, I have tried on my Mac (installed via brew) and Ubuntu and both grind performance of the relative system to a halt and after 20 minutes, still not finished.
I have a CCTV camera that uploads JPEG images (.jpg) to an FTP server when it detects movement.
If I need to rename, I can do that since I already find I need to for FFMPEG to work.
I'd like an image per second, or maybe 2 per second so the images are easy to view when playing the video back.
I tried tweaking the values and can get it better, but not exactly what I am after.
One attempt (setting -r 1 IIRC) resulted in a single image for the entire video!
The above command does produce a video, but the images display too quickly removing the point of the video.
I had to reboot the Mac as I couldn't do anything!
Its clear I don't understand the various arguments in the FFMPEG command even though I have looked at the manual!
