I have Microsoft Office 2010 and Visio, they work just fine in Ubuntu.
It can't be more cross-platform or easier than a web service.
(PS: wine version i use is 1.5.28 but I've been using office since version 1.5.25--it may work with earlier ones too like 1.4 I'm not sure.
I think many people forget that wine is no longer in an experimental/unstable phase (that was like over a decade ago!)
I had to make some flowcharts just recently, I used Lucidchart.
There is a free version and it is possible to make quite a complex flowchart before you hit the limit.
Compared to Dia, it has more features (like automatic layout), and a modern user interface (although it could be better).
It works on all platforms and is integrated with google drive.
and can more windows apps work with it than ones that don't, in my personal experience, 80% of all my windows apps work fine, some ever better, under Linux... and office is no exception :) Hope that helps and for the record, Dia and Draw are okay but they, like all programs you know nothing about, will be awkward to learn and cut into your precious time...this is why keeping your familiars around is so important.
