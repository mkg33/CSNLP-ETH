When you have the mother streaming netflix, the other two kids watching videos on their own laptops while the grandmother is trying to skype back to Germany.
Besides, the obvious, which is to make your cache ridiculously large (1GB here) there are a couple of settings you can set.
Session Saver has a cool option where it turns off reloading of tabs upon loading a session.
There is a setting to block everything from a domain address only if you are at this explicit page you are on.
Thankfully, last week they got a good deal for cable internet.
Use it liberally to block banners, images and crap.
Or you can tell it to load only a set number of tabs concurrently when you load a session.
I'd also heavily consider the following addons: NoScript, Adblocker, SessionSaver.
My cousins are on AT&T and the highest that DSL goes in their area is 6Mbps.
That way you aren't blocking images from sites when you are actually at said address.
I told them they should just cough up for another DSL connection.
That way the tabs are only loaded up upon actually navigating to them, rather than all at once.
