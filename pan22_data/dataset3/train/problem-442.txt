Whether or not the price is reasonable, is harder to answer.
You can expect a musician to push back on a clause that prevents him from selling the OST or using the tracks for promotional purposes, though exclusivity in the sense that the author cannot grant (or have granted) distribution rights to anyone else, is a fairly common condition.
Bottom line, $200 is not necessarily above or below the market price.
Then again, perhaps the same artist recorded a chip-tune at home the other week, unrelated to your game, just for fun, on consumer-grade equipment, and is willing to sell it to you for a few bucks.
There are musicians out there of all skill levels and the quality of their work is not a constant: you spend more to get more.
Examples include being credited and the ability to object to mutilation of a work.
A professional should be able to explain to your satisfaction what you can expect from him at a certain price point.
Even if they are, they may be of little value to anyone but the author.
You can hire a composer to play your game for a few hours, discuss some ideas with you in a musical brainstorm session, create several draft tracks, submit them for review and after the third revision, rent a studio, hire a sound engineer and some musicians to record and produce the track, but it might cost a lot more than $200.
Many intellectual property rights are applicable and even though this subject is covered by widely adopted international treaties, laws vary around the world.
Some can only be transfered by notarial deed and some rights are not legally transferable at all.
Obviously, it seemed high to you, and that's what's relevant.
Some rights are transfered automatically, some by contract.
You can definitely get the work done on a lower budget and end up with a high quality soundtrack for your game, but you may need to compromise.
