I've got GlassFish 3.1.2 installed on Linux CentOS 6.2, but it's fronted by Apache web server version 2.2.21 using mod_jk.
Now I need to support an HTTPS (domain name) with a certificate purchased from a third party (not sure who yet) for pages served by GlassFish.
The connection between apache and your glassfish app server is of no real interest to the client.
Is this a fairly standard operation to install the certificate?
From the customers perspective, your glassfish server is hidden, as is the mod_jk connection (and any database connections).
I haven't been able to find any straightforward documentation.
That is, all traffic to GlassFish passes through Apache port 80 via mod_jk.
Do I need to install the SSL certificate's in GlassFish, or Apache Web server, or both?
However you should take adequate precautions to physically protect the internals of your server, if you intend to store customer information or credit card details.
I just need a basic certificate installed to enable browsers to visit website without giving warning, or blocking, etc.
The certificate is issued in order that the customer can trust that the server is actually owned by you, and the public key in the certificate is used to encrypt a session key between your public internet facing server (apache) and the client browser.
