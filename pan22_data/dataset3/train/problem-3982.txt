However, I have seen switches being sold without "VLAN" appearing anywhere in the specs, but instead they list it as one of the standards it complies with.
On the Comapny website for this model, they are not mentioned about VLAN tagging.
That TPlink is a pretty good switch though, as far as unmanaged switches go.
I also looked at the specs for the model but it doesnt mention anything about VLAN tagging.
I'm actually typing this while being connected to its 8-port brother.
In most cases, what you want is support for VLAN tagging, which is 802.1Q
Meaning it doesn't have a way to configure the switch.
(I have encountered hundreds of different make/models/types of switches and I have never seen or even heard of a managed switch that couldn't do VLANs.)
If the vendor doesn't mention it, you can be sure that it doesn't support it.
It's a task that requires a fast backbone and dedicated RAM.
I doubt that the switch you have linked supports it, as it is very uncommon for consumer-oriented network gear to support vlan.
Only Enterprise / Midrange level switches support VLAN tagging.
Also for VLAN support, the switch should support more operation resources, but this model seems does not have.
As configuration is needed to implement VLAN tagging (how else are you going to assign VLANs to ports?)
