Resetting the profile has been the only way we've found to fix this.
The affected users don't get any system results (though they may get results if any of their own files contain those words.)
Some users experience a weird problem with Start Screen search in that some Windows programs are not returned in the results.
I've recently deployed some new PCs with Windows 8.1 Enterprise.
Searching for "color" should give you six system items.
If I give the user administrator rights on the PC the search works properly (whether they are using a new profile or not.)
(I suspect in this case the index is being "corrected" for the user's Standard permissions."
Affected users will get "Default Programs" as you'd expect.
For example, when you search for "background" you should see at least four system items.
I can't find any information on it and I can't imagine that this is how it's supposed to work because users can still access and run the programs that are not being returned in the search results which tells me it's not a matter of execution permissions.
But here's the weird part: when I return them to a standard user the full search results stop being returned after a few minutes and they are back to where they started.
An example of a search term that does work is "default".
I've tried a few different things but have not had full success.
