Figuring out CPU requirements (speed/number of cores) is a little more difficult - You will need to take into account how much "work" the server has to do to generate each page.
My first suggestions at 400 requests per second with the numbers you're quoting in your question would be "Move the MySQL server to its own box" or perhaps a better choice: "Add another web server and load balance your requests".
You are allowing Apache to spawn up to 1500 children to serve requests (ServerLimit / MaxClients) -- It's no wonder your server load (the number of processes waiting in the run queue) is getting enormous!
A tool like XDebug can help you out here by telling you how long it takes to generate a page (you should perform this test on an unloaded server as well as one under load, but you should also not use a tool like XDebug on a production server in most cases.)
Figure out how many apache processes you want to run on the new server and determine how much RAM you'll need to handle them.
To help you figure out how to size the additional server follow the advice HDDP500 gave in their answer to figure the average size of an Apache process.
