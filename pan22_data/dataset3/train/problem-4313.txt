It is available for iOS, Android, Windows, Linux etc, and it will scan the network for devices.
Here is how to you find out the IP of your Raspberry Pi.
3) You can then using SSH command (ssh pi@192.168.xxx.xxx) to connect to Raspberry Pi without a monitor and keyboard.
If so just plug the pi right in with any regular ethernet cable and run ssh pi@raspberrypi.local the password is raspberry This is more likely to work in linux, it relies on bonjour.
I get Raspberry Pi as manufacturer in the list for my Pis when I scan.
Assuming the Pi has an OS image on the SD card already and you have an ethernet cable to connect your laptop to the pi, you can try this:
1) Connect the raspberry Pi to your router via ethernet;
Another option is to use a pi zero and configure it as an ethernet gadget (https://gist.github.com/gbaman/975e2db164b3ca2b51ae11e45e8fd40a) which doesn't require anything beyond the board, sdcard, and a usb cable.
You will get MAC addresses with the IP address and more.
You can usually from deduct wich IP address goes to your pi.
Assuming you have the SD card created with an OS image.
One way I locate IP numbers of different devices in networks is fing https://www.fing.io/# .
If you are on Window, you probably need to download and install Putty in order to remotely access Raspberry Pi using SSH.
If you have an FTDI cable it's also possible to turn on the UART (enable_uart=1 in /boot/config.txt) which provides a debug serial connection on pins 8 and 10 (http://pinout.xyz/pinout/uart)
2) Login to your router and check on connected devices which is typically under DHCP section, Raspberry Pi always has a MAC address started as e8:4e:xx:xx:xx:xx, find the IP address that has a MAC address that match a Raspberry Pi;
Does your laptop have an ethernet port or do you have a USB/ethernet adapter?
