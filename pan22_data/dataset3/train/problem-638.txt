This is a good forum i remember, where like just skilled artists are grouped :)
Or you try learning it in a professional way, but that is exhausting...
1) If you want to improve try putting up your work on specialized sites like http://www.polycount.com/forum/
Or, you could advertise on a site such as Gamedev's Help Wanted Forum for an artist, saying that you've created such and such a game, with your programmer art, and looking for a improvment to the graphical quality.
Option 2 is probably the best way, unless it's more of a learning project (not for release).
You could search at Deviantart too, but there it's imo more complicated.

2) If you don't have time or insert reason here go to recruiting sites, here are a few to get you started:
The saying 'practice makes perfect' is probably applicable here.
I would recommend you to search a skinner and/or 2D Artist who is skilled and can create that kind of art.
The other way is to get free images, textures, and models from many sites on the internet.
