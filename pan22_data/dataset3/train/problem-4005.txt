But if only 1) is the case, you can fake the link-layer address, and reverse map it onto the right one in the other direction as described here:
If 1+2 are both true, you need indeed something like IP NAT, DHCP, ..
2) It might actually be even smarter, and know which IP address should belong to which link layer address (cause it knows DHCP and inspects it)
As the Pi will be providing WiFi to a printer with only ethernet, I'd like it to be robust to rough handling, so my next step will be to configure the SD card as read only.
4addr as described in other answers is certainly the best way when supported by the adapter/driver, but not all of them does.
auto-discovery, bonjour) will fail through the NAT.
Here's an Arch Linux version of a Raspbian implementation.
To support DHCP for the device connected to the ethernet port, create a dhcrelay (from the DHCP package) service.

The alternative is using an ARP Proxy (parprouted) as described in https://wiki.debian.org/BridgeNetworkConnectionsProxyArp.
I tried very hard to adapt the original approach from the Debian Wiki mentioned here to netctl using ExecUpPost and ExecDownPre without success.
NAT might work for some things, but getting proper communication both ways on the lan will become problematic (ex.
1) It might only want to see packets coming from you, with your known link layer address (and hence not of bridged packets)
Everything worked at the command line, but not within the profile.
I liked the Proxy Arp approach, but the original question specified Arch Linux.
connecting a printer or accessing other IoT devices on the other side of the NAT).
This approach worked for me on a Raspberry Pi Model B+ w/ ArchLinuxArm sporting a USB WiFi adapter with the RT5370 chipset.
Finding the address of the DHCP server by grep'ing through logs seems inelegant, but it works.
I've set this up on a Raspberry Pi for a printer and it works like a charm (I have added a 10 second sleep in the post-up commands to let it get an IP address first, it might have to do with the slowness of my old RPi...)
