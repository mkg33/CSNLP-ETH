Where can I learn to not only write HLSL, but learn techniques for writing shaders?
For those wondering why their code won't work, or if you're confused on how to incorporate the shader into your pipeline, this is a good place to go.
I found Riemers.net has a very good introductory tutorial on HLSL as part of its XNA tutorials.
I liked it since it tried to explain every part of what it was doing.
I found a series of tutorials that goes from a basic ambient light shader all the way to reflections and toon shaders.
The author, Riemer Grootjans, also wrote the recommendable book XNA 3.0 Game Programming Recipes - if You like the recipe approach.
The book walks you through all the nitty gritty details of DirectX11, it's resources, all the different pipeline shaders, HLSL (an entire chapter dedicated to this), and how to start implementing things like particle system simulations, tessellation, image processing, deferred rendering, and DirectCompute!
Not sure what shader model and DirectX version you are targeting but I highly recommend Practical Rendering and Computation with Direct3D11.

Most of what I learned I got from various blog posts that didn't explain things very well.
Also, the documentation on MSDN seems to be more of a function reference.
The last time I tried learning HLSL, I made a few shaders and mostly understood what I was doing, but I still felt like I was stumbling in the dark.
When I was reading about HLSL I found this tutorial back in the day.
Each goes through and explains every line and even explains some of the math a bit:
