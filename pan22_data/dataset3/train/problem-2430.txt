You might want to go through your BIOS and check whether you have any settings that may be putting a cap on the memory.
The version was installed from the MSDN Academy Alliance and is a X64 version.
Could be that there is a cap on the ASUS motherboard, but it's a brand new custom spec PC so I'd have expected this to have been sorted.
It's a brand new machine so it's possible it might not be configured in the BIOS (but it does say 16.0GB (8.0GB Usable).
If you can't find anything you should refer to your manufacturer's website and check for any new BIOS updates.
It's possible that you're running an older version of their BIOS which doesn't offer full-fledged support.
Last night I installed a Windows 7 Professional version for a Student friend and for some reason it's not using all the 16GB of the machine.
[EDIT]: Found this: http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/max-memory-limits-for-64-bit-windows-7/4254 make sure that you did indeed install 7 Professional and not another version which doesn't offer support for larger amounts of ram.
Any idea whereabouts in the BIOS I would need to change anything it's a P7P55D-E ASUS board?
