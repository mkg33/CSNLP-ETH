Or is there something I can do with the A-and-CNAME records to squeeze out just a little more performance?
Importantly, the IP address for the site maps to a landing page instead of your actual content.
My problem is, I have an existing domain in GoDaddy.
But, if I visit [sitename].wpengine.com directly, my wordpress site exists.
I need this domain to go to my [sitename].wpengine.com site (while keeping my domain in the address bar).
When I put that IP Address back into my browser, I see a landing page instead of my wordpress site.
In other words, if I run ping [sitename].wpengine.com I get an IP address.
I'm trying to migrate a WordPress site from GoDaddy to WPEngine.
Forwarding sounds like a wrapper which would slow things down.
I'm concerned I'll break our email capabilities or something.
From my understanding, an A-record requires an IP Address (which I don't seem to have based on the frst paragraph).
And for a CNAME record I'm not sure what to change.
Sites on WPEngine are hosted at [sitename].wpengine.com.
However, the performance of my site is of the most importance.
The best I could figure out is to create a forwarding record in GoDaddy.
I know there are A-records and CNAME records, but I don't fully understand those.
