Anywhere I had duplicated data but still had a FK to the main user (bad design yes, but not mine) I updated that data too so the name was consistent across the database for user x.
Take a look at dbatools PowerShell module for a free option for Static Data Masking, written by Chrissy Lemaire (@chrissy-lemaire) and her team.
Overall my data was still very readable although address did not make any sense.
Take a look at the blog post announcing this: automated data masking
I then had a table with about 400 million unique names.
I had a co-worker who had some program that generated garbled letters and updated the address line with that.
For names I went to the census and downloaded all the first and last names, ran them through a loop to join every first to every last, added sex code and loaded it into a table in all upper case.
When I scrubbed my user data I swapped out the names, for birthday I put everyone to Jan 1 of the year they were actually born and updated any phone numbers with their zip code (my data was US only).
All of their tools are great, so I'm sure this is worth a look.
The postal address gave me the most grief but I kept the city, state and zip because I believe them to not be an issue if the address is changed.
Email addresses became firs initial plus last name @mycompany.co.
It took me a couple of days to get all this working but once it was done and a sql agent job was created I could scrub the data in as little as 15 minutes.
I had to do this for my clients retail sales data.
I used upper case as our current data was not in upper case so  I could more easily tell data that was scrubbed.
