I removed the ethernet cable and the hash mismatch error disappeared.
if you're behind a proxy), fix "Hash Sum Mismatch" like this:
This files are used to verify that others like Packages.xz hasn't been altered.
In my case I solved the problem (which in the first place was just use the local downloaded mirror) by removing the release files:
Linux CSE-Cloud01 4.0.0-1-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.0.2-1 (2015-05-11) x86_64 GNU/Linux
I this case the problem always is the difference between the hashsum stated in the InRelease and Release files located in dist/[name-of-your-distro]/ folder.
I had tried to do the below commands that recommended, and won't work
In mirror itself or some of my machines, It failed in the end.
As stated here remove the files "InRelease" on the server and try again.
I had a similar problem and it seemed to be a problem on the mirror.
I was using wifi to connect to the internet, but also had an ethernet cable attached to a switch which was connected to another computer.
and adding a trusted switch to the line corresponding to this repo in APT sources:
Unfortunately rehashing and writing the new value is not enough, because you will also need to sing both *Release files with a private key that you don't own... a real tedious job.
It is possible that the local area network was preventing the laptop from connecting to the internet because I wasnt able to even ping google.
Try removing all network connections other than the internet connection before trying to update or install files.
Hope this helps, and even help me in the future :)
