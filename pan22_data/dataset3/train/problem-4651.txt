The -E command line option is a great learning tool for deciphering how the pg_catalog tables work and the \gexec internal command is extremely useful for as is \watch.
While discussing database clients, however, don't forget about psql.
Which database client to use is generally personal preference, and sometimes based on which client makes certain tasks the easiest to do.
I personally configured pgAdmin4 to use a browser that I don't normally use and that gives me a seperate location on my task bar to find my various query windows.
That said, pgAdmin3 doesn't connect cleanly to PG10+.
In that regard you will need to switch entirely to pgAdmin4 at some point.
This, and opening new query windows in new browser tabs have made pgAdmin4 more friendly for my own personal use.
How long you want to allow your fellow users/admins to use it is always dependent on your own use case.
There are some obvious and non-obvious UX differences between the two, some features easier in pgAdmin3, some easier in pgAdmin4, but ultimately some users are just more comfortable with pgAdmin3.
