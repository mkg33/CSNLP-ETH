Remember that when using AMM those parameters specify minimum memory allocated for particular pool.
In the same step you can also set PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET to zero.
If you see those symptoms you can cleanup pfile bounce Oracle with pfile and recreate spfile.
Additionally I wasn't able to set PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET to zero though - even if the manual claims that this is possible.
However Oracle won't let  me set MEMORY_TARGET to 4G:
I'm trying to configure an Oracle installation on a developer machine (Windows 7 Professional 64bit).
So if sga_target is 6GB you will not be allowed to set memory_target to 4GB.
The machine has 16GB of RAM and I'd like to configure MEMORY_MAX_TARGET to 8g but have MEMORY_TARGET set to 4g by default because that is enough for most of the work done on that machine.
From all I know, it cannot exceed memory_max_target, but 4G is clearly less than 8G (and where do the 6432M come from?)
But in case I need more memory I can dynamically resize it.
I don't understand why MEMORY_TARGET can't be set to 4G?
Also sum of internal variables __sga_target, __db_cache_size, etc.
Maybe db_cache_size, shared_pool_size, sga_target or other memory related parameters are set to non zero?
