I am currently running version 3.6.7 of Classic Shell.
That's whether your account has admin rights or not.
To add to the excellent answer for making the shortcut -- when you open cmd.exe make sure to do "run as Administrator" or use runas, otherwise windows will (probably) tell you "You do not have sufficient privilege to perform this operation."
At first I thought the message was due to my running in an RDP session (of course) but I was then able to create the shortcut manually in \Users\Public\Desktop -- so not a permissions issue, but just UAC doing its job.
Here is the article in Microsoft official website.
It can be found by selecting "All Settings" and under the Special Items Tab.
Additionally, pressing Alt-F4 while the desktop is active (i.e.
no other applications have focus) brings up a dialog window which allows you to shutdown/restart.
In Classic Shell there is a check box that reads "Show Shutdown during remote sessions".
Having looked around a bit, it appears there is unfortunately no way to enable reboot/shutdown from the start menu in a remote session in Windows 7, even through group policies :( I guess Windows 7 is designed for a "dumber" user on average, considering Server 2008 is not gimped in this way :) I guess my main method will be to press Ctrl-Alt-End (remote equivalent to Ctrl-Alt-Del) and then use the shutdown options from that dialog.
Just as stated above, I also am using the "Classic Shell" program to give back some of the functionality removed by MS.
I am also disappointed that there is no hidden setting to allow a shutdown/restart from the start menu.
