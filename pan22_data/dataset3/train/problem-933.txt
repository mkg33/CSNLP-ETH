There are a few specific apps that will allow you to pick a rectangle of interest,
I could probably take screenshots of the pdf, but that seems like a lot of work since I have so many parts to do.
The mouse pointer needs to be configured as a Select Tool and not as the Hand Tool for coping to work.
I have a lot to do, so an easy way way would be great...
I'm trying to copy parts of a PDF to make some footnotes in a separate document... but the format doesn't copy, so is it possible to copy a highlighted part as a picture like a jpeg for me to copy paste?
It's a very feature rich, free and open source, image manipulation program, but it imports PDFs (albeit as raster graphics, but I doubt you want anything else), and you can use it as your PDF reader if you want.
Preferably free linux software, but I'm open to other options.
You can also make the Hand Tool behave as the Select Tool when you move over text by opening Edit -> Preferences -> General and checking the box in front of "Make Hand tool select text & images".
If you take a screenshoot limited to the PDF window, it will not add much to your necessary effort (of choosing the area of interest).
Whatever software you choose will need you to 'highight' in the PDF parts that you want to be cropped into JPG pictures.
I'm sure there is specialized screenshot software that can do this too, but it's hard to recommend any without knowing your OS.
You can change this configuration through the Tools -> Select & Zoom menu or by right-clicking anywhere in the document.
Can you not copy from any PDF document, or just not from this PDF document?
