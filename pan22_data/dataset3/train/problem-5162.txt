On a practical basis, NFS performs well for home directory if there's a 100mbit switched network or better.
Rsync will thrash you syncing web browser cache... 10 minutes and 500 files hurt.
You won't win performance contests, but things like Firefox and Open Office will work okay.
Copying in the home directory will be a major pain in term of delays at login (on a 100mbit network that's max 12MB/s.
Lots of programs (e.g., Firefox) still require manual configuration, however, so you will probably have to do some extra work to identify and configure them in a uniform manner for all your users.
For more then 10-20 kiosks, the server should have gigabit connectivity.
These days, you can tell many programs to store their caches elsewhere (e.g., on a local disk) by setting the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable in a login script.
Some general advice that will apply no matter which network filesystem you adopt: many programs cache data in the user's home directory, which usually does more harm than good when the home directory is accessed over a network.
but you must make sure the network is fast enough and that it will never be down.
Also, don't forget to tune the rsize and wsize parameters and use Jumbo frames if possible.
