Earlier this year we had an email virus arrive that wasn't in our email gateway's AV signatures, and therefor ended up on users desktops.
Somebody could bring in a presentation on a USB stick, for example.
Usually they are ran in conjunction with a http proxy on the firewall to prevent users from accessing bad stuff from the web.
For the simple reason that a virus can come in from other sources too.
Eg if Joe Employee visits RandomBadwareSite.com, there's a chance the firewall will stop the viruses/trojans/etc before Joe gets infected.
I'm pretty sure the point is to protect your internal users.
I'm also strongly of the viewpoint that as well as ensuring no viruses get into your org, you also have a responsibility to ensure that no viruses can get outside your org.
The infection/worm slowed down greatly once our AV signatures were updated with one that had this virus in it.
No AV solution is 100% effective, so having AV inside as well (and please make sure it's from a different vendor) will at least give you a chance of catching something that slips by your gateway.
Some 'firewalls' also can act as a email relay and protect you from getting malware through smtp.
We thought we'd trained them better, but many opened it anyway and mayhem ensued.
As it was, we got off a bit lucky on this outbreak but we had the tools to handle a bigger one.
What this means is that if you share data with someone else, in any shape or form, you should play nice and make certain that you don't accidentally infect them.
Finally, the basic common sense reason is that you have two layers of defence.
If it had been the kind that also scans for open shares and drops infected files all over, it would have been nearly impossible to clean up without local AV systems.
