Is there a way to know for sure that your remote-ly hosted server is actually a dedicated, and not just a virtual, "faking" to be a dedicated?
What are some possible shell commands to run to test this?
"lspci", the unix command, would be the easiest method.
in windows check device manager and check the items, some will say vmware disk or things like that.
However, if the hardware looks like the hardware you are supposed to have, then it's most likely a dedicated machine.
