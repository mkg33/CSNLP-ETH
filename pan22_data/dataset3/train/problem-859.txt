(It is possible to add a Role and suitable permissions in msdb, but would the DBAs let you?)
If you can't find a tool somewhere, building your own may be the only way to proceed.
If you are looking for an export, why not try a screen shot?
It seems like an obvious thing to do, and I think I've heard of tools that might do this, but I've never used or actually found one.
unfortunately, if the tools require admin access, then you are going to be forced to roll your own solution and request read access to the msdb database.
This required building queries against the various sysjob* tables in msdb (particularly sysjobs and sysjobschedules), which required some serious deciphering -- some of their structures are pretty obtuse.
The Idera tool is the same one from SQL Sentry under an OEM license.
not sure about the permissions, but Capacity Manager from Quest software did have a view of the SQL Agent jobs.
Security/access will be an issue, as by default very few permissions are granted to those tables.
