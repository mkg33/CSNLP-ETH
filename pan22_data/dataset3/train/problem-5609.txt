open("/etc/ssl/certs/3c58f906.0", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
With strace, I found out that it's trying to open an SSL certificate which is denied:
It's not anything unique to your system and is included in the default install: http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/all/ca-certificates/filelist
The permissions are such that indeed my user isn't allowed to access it:
This certificate is a symlink which points to AddTrust_External_Root.pem which in turn is a symlink to /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/AddTrust_External_Root.crt.
There is no reason for this file not to be world readable.
There appears to be something wrong with your installation, or a previous administrator changed the ownership/permissions for obscure reasons.
), cURL fails to establish SSL connections with this error:
Generally I think anything under /usr/share/ may be world readable (since its under "share").
Now why this file is not world readable on your system is the real question.
There's probably a reason why this file isn't world-readable, but it's stopping cURL from functioning.
After extensive searching I haven't found documentation of this problem yet.
Does anybody know the reason, and, more importantly, a safe and secure solution?
