If your program is running at 100% CPU (and doesn't have an unbounded other task to complete), then your CPU is doing too much work.
do less culling) in exchange for having the GPU do more.
When your frame rate is insufficient, then one or the other is the limiting resource — your program is either CPU-bound or GPU-bound (assuming it isn't swapping or having scheduling problems).
Note that Minecraft uses cubical 16×16×16 chunks for its display lists, unlike for load and save.
I strongly suspect this is your problem, given your description.
On the other hand, if the GPU is the limit (sadly, there aren't usually convenient 0%-100% load monitors) then you should think about how to send it less data, or require it to fill fewer pixels.
Remember that your rendering executes on two processors: CPU and GPU.
Minecraft only rebuilds a display list/vertex buffer (I don't know which it uses) when a block is modified in a given chunk, and so do I.
If you do that, there's even less reason to frustum cull individual chunks.
All of this information is either hearsay or my own conclusions from observing Minecraft's rendering as I play.)
Most rendering chunks should be either entirely visible or entirely invisible.
You mention doing frustum culling on individual blocks — try throwing that out.
If you're modifying the display list whenever the view changes, you're not getting the benefit of display lists.
