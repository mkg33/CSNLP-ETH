Once you get your hands on the VPS from your educated guess you can then setup sql and run some testing, even something simple like a replaying a profiler trace & see how the server performance statistics compare to your current server.
It's running too slow for us and we're going to upgrade it when we get around to it.
No one else will know the answer to this question better then yourself!
It's actually only about 6sp/s - which isn't much but it all depends on what kind of load they place on the server - if they're very write-heavy then you're going to need to significantly bolster your storage performance, if they're very read-heavy then moving to a newer server (such as a nehalem xeon-based box) would really help as their memory is very fast.
I have a database that gets about 500,000 stored procedure calls a day in addition to other stuff.
Do you specifically want a 'cloudy' solution or is that just one option you're looking at?
These results will then allow you to improve/adjust your initial guess.
Sites like Reddit use it for extensive database stuff and they say good things about it.
I'm looking at Amazon EC2 as a solution and it seems alright.
CPU, memory, disk i/o and use that to at least guesstimate the kind of specs you would need for a new database server + allowing for future growth & headroom.
I would do some investigation into where the bottlenecks are on your current server.
