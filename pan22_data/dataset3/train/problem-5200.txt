Creating a letterbox / pillarbox viewport in MonoGame is actually kinda tricky.
This code needs to run every time the devices screen size or window size changes.
For example, you code the game against a virtual resolution of 800x480 but render it on an actual resolution of 1024x768.
The second part is how you get the letterbox / pillar box effect.
articles generally are not liked in Stack exchange but this is my go to blog post when trying to remember this
I have a full tutorial with all this stuff in classes on my blog.
The first is creating a scaling matrix to pass into the SpriteBatch.Begin call.

Because you've scaled and moved the graphics, you'll need to do the reverse for input coordinates.
I've recently been implemented something like this in the MonoGame.Extended library.
The variables represent your actual resolution vs virtual resolution.
It resizes the viewport on the GraphicsDevice and centers the image.
The last part is dealing with input coordinates from the mouse or touch screen.
For example, in the Window.ClientSizeChanged event.
