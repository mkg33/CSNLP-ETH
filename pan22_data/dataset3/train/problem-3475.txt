Is it possible to save a full backup that does not affect the maintenance plan?
If I understand correctly, a programmer could take a manual full backup on Wednesday and the automated incremental on Thursday will be dependent on Wednesday's full backup instead of Sunday's.
We use a centralized SQL Server 2005 server for web development.
My research suggests that a database snapshot might be appropriate, but I'm just looking for a backup without spawning a new database on the server.
All databases use the Simple Recovery Model, so transaction logs are not a factor.
Additionally our programmers are asked to manually save a full backup whenever they make considerable changes to the database.
The full backup is checked in to our source control repository.
The server has a maintenance plan to take a full backup each Sunday and incremental backups on all other nights.
We'll assume that the programmer can run/tailor a script if the functionality is not in SQL Management Studio.
It occurs to me that a manual backup will affect the daily incremental backups done by the maintenance plan.
