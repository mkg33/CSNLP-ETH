1) Run fuser -n tcp 80 to see which process id is listening on port 80 a.
2) Once you've identified the server process, look in the config files for the configuration.
3) You've got root; you can administer it any way you like.
I take it the previous admin is unavailable to answer any of these questions?
If this is the case, (and without any prior documentation) then you won't truly have a handle on what's running on it until you rebuild it from scratch, yourself.
This goes double if you've any reason not to trust the previous admin.
Most will have readable files and it shouldn't be too hard to locate the proxy configuration (if there is one).

If you know the domains of the web sites that are being hosted there, then use dig -t ns example.com to find out their name servers.
Another option is to visit the site with a known incorrect path and see what the footer says at the bottom of the 404 page.
4) netstat -anp again and look for open TCP/UDP sockets on port 53.
