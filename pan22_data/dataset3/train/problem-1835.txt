Can you split the job/process you are running in batches?
As already explained by others, you're running out of memory, so
You should be able to find out what killed your process by looking at the output of the dmesg command; or at the logfiles /var/log/kern.log, /var/log/messages, or /var/log/syslog.
The log says you are running out of swap/cache memory.
a) upgrade your ec2 machine to more powerful one, 'small instance' has 2.5x more memory (1.7GB) than 'micro instance' (0.64GB), costs additional money
b) adding swap partition - add additional EBS drive, mkswap /dev/sdx, swapon /dev/sdx, costs EBS storage and IO fees
Perhaps you can try running it in isolation after stopping the other processes?
The c) should be sufficient, but keep in mind that micro instance is not supposed to run long-running cpu-intensive tasks due cpu limits (only short bursts allowed).
The logs or dmesg should tell you why the process was killed.
out of memory killer gets triggered and kills some process.
There are a number of things that can cause a process to be summarily killed:
c) adding swap file - dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1M count=500, mkswap /swap, swapon /swap, costs IO fees and free space on root EBS
