I can't say I've heard of anyone trying to mirror traffic in this manner.
So I need to duplicate and send same query to two virtual hosts located at same physical server.
A is being realized as SSL enabled virtual host (name based).
Apache based web server runs Python-based software which gathers data from remote devices through custom HTTP-based protocol.
It seems more obvious to try and do it at your application level, rather than with Apache.
The reply from A host should be (as normal scenario) sent to the originating client.
The reply from B host can be discarded, it just need to receive original query.
Each time remote device wants to submit some data it composes HTTP query and posts data to the server using address A.
And I want to have each query that is being submitted to A to be duplicated also to B (just to have development database submitted with more realistic data), so basically:
Is Apache's mod_proxy proper direction to solve such issue?
At the same physical web server, there is another virtual host which is development snapshot of the production one A - let's call it B.
But it sounds like it would be better handled at L3/L4 rather than L7 - but this would only work for UDP traffic - as TCP/IP would struggle with the 3-way handshake to two simultaneous destinations.
