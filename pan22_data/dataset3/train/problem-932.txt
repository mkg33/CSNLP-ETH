You may need to worry about TLS, SASL, and which user and authentication to use for the outgoing connections to the mail relay you use, but the point of a null client is to be essentially unconfigured, and if you need that stuff, consider that either a null client isn't really quite what you want, or that you could use a separate outgoing mail relay on the same box using postmulti.
A null client will not listen for oncoming TCP connections, even on the local host, so SASL and TLS are not needed locally.
Your web application can use the sendmail interface, which is also what you get under the hood if you use pipe stuff into mail (which is most likely some variant of mailx).
The canonical reference for configuration of a null client is here:  http://www.postfix.org/STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README.html#null_client
sendmail is in fact provided by postfix, but provides a drop in for the old sendmail interface which became the standard.
Most Web Mail sending libraries will talk to sendmail, though there may be other options as well.
