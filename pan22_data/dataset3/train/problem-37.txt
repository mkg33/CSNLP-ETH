A RAM drive might be in your future in this instance.
Intel has a newer technology called SRT (Smart Response Technology) which will allocate a SSD drive to cache data from your Primary setup.
However, I did not want my new system to suffer sluggish read/write speeds.
Around 190-200Mb/s compared to 105-110Mb/s for single drive.
Further you could instead go with SSDs to see if that is enough OR... you could get REAL crazy with it and go for a RAID 0 with SSDs in the array.
Interestingly there wasn't much speed difference between Windows7 built in stripping and the Intel raid function on the motherboard sata controller.
I am getting right about 525MB/s constant speeds on boot, running applications, managing documents, etc.
I'll do this and put Photoshop caching on this spare partition.
I was in the same situation as you when I was shopping around for a new computer.
If you happen to get one with more than 64GB (limit of SRT is 20GB to 64GB of usable SSD space) then you can partition the rest as a separate drive letter.
We found that consumer grade SSDs weren't necessarily faster than spinning rust for sustained writes.
1 x SATA3 128GB SSD (Read/Write Speeds of 550MB/s)
Raid0 (ie stripping with no parity) a pair of reasonably fast 1Tb Sata drives gave almost double the rate of a single drive.
If you look at even more current motherboards, some of them have a 20GB SSD built onto them for SRT SSD Caching.
The SSD is acting as a cache for my RAID0 hard drives.
If your system does not already support RAID then you can get a pretty cheap controller with very little problem for whatever type of slot you have available.

Down the road if you're looking to upgrade your system, get one that supports SRT technology and use that SSD as your cache.
I knew that the system that I was buying peaked in every aspect.
More disks equal better performace as they spread the load.
