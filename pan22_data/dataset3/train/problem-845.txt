In order keep them both at least approximately in sync we copy the database from PROD to DEV once a week.
In DEV due to testing we end up with a different database from the one in PROD.
Very occasionally we return the DEV system to the same state as production if too many people have changed too many things.
Presumably the from from DEV to PROD is new tested software that is ready for production.
If you put a load balancer in front of the clients it can also automatically fail them over to the backup node without intervention.
What do you think about these backup / svn workflows I want to implement ?
PROD to DEV the database / data produced by the system.
I just thought that you should some how make that clear that the workflows in each direction are different
It will keep all the servers in sync at all times.
If you're open to commercial solutions WANdisco provides a clustering solution that may fit your requirements quite nicely.
It should be stated that this flow is entirely different from the DEV to PROD.
The only thing I can think of is the flow back and forward between DEV and PROD.
For my system which is very similar in essence we also have a flow from PROD to DEV.
