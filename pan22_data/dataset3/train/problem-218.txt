What I've been doing is press stop on the UI every evening and wake up to push start timelapse again.
If there's a "command line version" of the timelapse program you're using, or if you can control it from (for example) a bash or Python script, cron should be able to do what you want.
Then schedule a few simple cron jobs to gain familiarity.
Hi all I've been using Pi Cam with Web UI on RPi3 (with naturebytes build) for a long term timelapse (9 months).
I've been successfully shoot timelapse for the past week but it shoots the whole day night cycle but I only want the day time photos.
Or an option for time based operational like not shooting after 5 pm or something.
Suggest you read man cron, man crontab and Google a bit to familiarize yourself with it.
Let us know if you hit a snag; specific questions are best.
In fact you may be able to run a "gui program" from cron, but I've never tried that.
In any case if there's no easy way to do it I'm game with a way to automate trashing all the night image afterwards.
