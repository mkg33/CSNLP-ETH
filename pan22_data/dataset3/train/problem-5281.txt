In the process, I use AVG-free to run a scan on the zip files, before and after they are decompressed.
Are there any other command-line AV tools out there?
Personally, I prefer McAfee - they have a command line scanning utility - but you may need to buy a minimum number of Enterprise licenses (10 at most, I expect) to get it.
If you are willing to try scripting your needs in Linux then ClamAV would be a great choice...  You could setup a Linux VM to run the task.
NOD32 is an excellent scanner and has command-line options.
I want to avoid having an active "AV shield" which will simply monitor a working folder.
It's an open-source on-demand scanner, made to be scripted (it's meant for plugging into things like UNIX mail servers so it can be easily called from a script to scan incoming and outgoing files).
Hey all, I wrote a PoSH script that searches an FTP site and downloads specific zip files.
The current solution that my company uses (Symantec AV) does not support command-line usage.
I want instant results and return codes, which I use to generate alert e-mails.
Now I am ready to put this sucker into production, on an assigned Windows 2003 Std server.
The problem is AVG-free does not support this OS and won't install.
