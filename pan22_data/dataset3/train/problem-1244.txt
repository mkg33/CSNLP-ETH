It can track Average Instance Count up to a months' time.
Hopefully Microsoft will soon take care of the terrible costs management on Azure and allow users to put budgets on their accounts and have more fine-grained monitoring on how charges are accrued.
Using it, users can create rules that allow them to limit/cap their instances once certain dollar amount has been reached by multiplying Average InstanceCount by the going hourly rate and by the number of hours in a month.
An update on this: First, there's a new billing alert service (in preview) - sign up here.
Not a precise entry into the non-existent billing API, but a decent approximation.
This will let you receive email alerts when hitting a certain spend threshold.
Unfortunately, I had an Azure account that ran up a huge set of charges without any warning.
This will not allow you to cap abuse from students, but for those folks who are looking to cap scaling of their Azure applications by cost, look into http://www.paraleap.com - it's a dynamic scaling service that externally controls scaling of your Azure applications.
AFAIK, the closest thing to an account budget you can get currently are the recently introduced email notifications for compute hours usage.
Second: You can now suspend and re-enable spending limits.
