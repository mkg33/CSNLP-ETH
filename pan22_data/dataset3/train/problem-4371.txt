It should be possible to insert a bootable USB, CD or DVD that contains memtest, then at the boot selection menu select memtest.
You could also try running memtest, which is included with most OS distributions and/or rescue disks.
I would imagine that it is set to auto-detect the appropriate speed, but you may try setting it to the appropriate speed there.
Downloads for bootable memtest86 images can be found on the memtest86.com website and should have the latests versions available.
It should be noted that other memory testing and diagnostic tools are available.
Someone an idea why this memory module is not working?
I take a look at www8.hp.com/h20195/v2/GetHTML.aspx?docname=â€‹c04111535 and I think this memory modules must been supported.
I bought the HP Proliant ML310 G8v2 server with 4GB of  RAM.
There are several guides available for making bootable memtest images and analyzing the results that can be found be doing a * search.
With the upgraded memory you may need to check that the memory speed settings are correct in BIOS.
I also bought the memory module HP 8GB (1x8GB) Dual Rank x4 PC3L-10600R-9-10.E1 1333 ECC.
