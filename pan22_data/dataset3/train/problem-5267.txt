For further information on how to enable AHCI mode, please refer to the RTF card that is shipped with the server.
Also the Check the firmware (amazing how many people do not do this) HP excerpt: In BIOS revisions prior to 11/03/2006, the default configuration for SATA models will not recognize when more than four drives are installed while running Microsoft Windows operating system.
I have searched around for an answer but have not been able to find one.
Apologies if this is a rather silly question, but I'm not very savvy when it comes to interpreting server documentation.
If you have access to larger SATA/SAS drives then the ones listed you might try one.
The chassis comes in a hot plug and non-hot pluggable setup.
Is this concern unfounded or would the server not be able to use 1TB drives?
The HP documents I have looked at say you can mix and match the SAS/SATA drives as needed.
Seems basic info but some people do not know so try and make all your drives of the same type and capacity.
Since the total it can handle is 4.5TB, does this mean that it could support 4x1TB drives?
To recognize all six drives, AHCI mode has to be enabled and SATA AHCI driver installed.
I would suggest you look and see what type of drives you currently have and stick with those.
It also mentions support for smaller drives (500GB, 250, etc.)
My concern is that the hardware wouldn't be able to read the drives properly since 1TB is greater than the maximally "supported" capacity of 750GB drives.
The documentation does not advance much after a chassis is retired.
Most folks use the same disk type in order to make RAID optimized.
The documentation (http://h18004.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/12527_na/12527_na.HTML) specifies that the maximum storage possible for this server is 4.5TB resulting from 6x750GB drives.
