Try manually setting your AP to channel 1, then seeing how all your devices do.
Use only traditional 20MHz (HT20) channels in 2.4GHz, to leave room for Bluetooth and your neighbors' networks and the like.
Have you tried upgrading your routers firmware ?, there may be a bug with your router that has now been fixed in a firmware update.
Now you have it fixed on one channel dropouts are to be expected as the router can no longer change channel to avoid the interference so instead the signal gets so bad / corrupted from interference it just drops the connection now instead.
If you have a European (ETSI) model of Wi-Fi AP that supports channels 1-13, and some US (FCC) Wi-Fi client devices that only support channels 1-11, I could understand manually setting your AP to any channel from 1 to 11 (but not 12 or 13) so your FCC devices would be sure to join.
But if you have a Wi-Fi client device whose RF design is so crappy that it really only works well at one end of the band (channels 10 and 11), then I'd throw out that POS and buy something that doesn't suck.
Hopefully between channels 1, 6, and 11, you'll find a channel that all your devices can do fine on.
Also, to be a good neighbor, if your Belkin Wi-Fi router supports 802.11n, make sure you're not using "wide" (40MHz, HT40) channels in the 2.4GHz band.
When you router is set to auto select a channel it will switch channels if it detects interference, e.g a neighbour with a router on the same channel, interference from a microwave / other electrical gear.
Then try manually setting it to channel 6 and see how all your devices do.
