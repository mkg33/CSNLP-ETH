All the users and contacts I deleted prior to viewing this were not in the list.
Its as if Outlook hasn't synced up or updated the list according to the Exchange server.
In previewing this list, this allowed me to see what would show up in our address list through Outlook.
When viewing the global address list through Outlook 2010 all of the former users and contacts remained visible within the list.
As of recent I decided to open up active directory and clean up things a bit.
In outlook 2003/2007 click on tools -->send and receive -->download address book
After doing so I opened Exchange System Manager, dropped down All Global Address Lists and then right clicked and selected properties over default Global Address List.
In outlook 2010 click on the send receive tab and click on download address book.
removing contacts, users, and specific groups that are no longer used within the organization.
However, all employees here are using Outlook 2010 and use the Global Address List on a regular basis.
How do I get the address list in Outlook to accurately show the addresses and contacts of Exchange Server?
