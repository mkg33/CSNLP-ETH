I'm on SLES 10.1, and trying to configure vsftpd to allow root logins.
I know what I'm doing, and I accept full responsibility for any ruptures in the space-time continuum that may result.
BTW, if you don't know the answer, please don't bother lecturing me about how I shouldn't allow root logins.
And comment out the line with root on it by placing a # at the start.
You will probably find it is pam that has been configured to prevent root from logging in.
Vsftpd can use pam for authentication, so I suggest you check /etc/pam.d/vsftpd.
Edit your  vsftpd.conf  file, and add the following line:
However, if you really need FTP access, all I had to do was:
for Debian 8 Jessie, you just need to edit /etc/ftpusers and comment out or delete root.
Save the file, and reloading the server is not even necessary.
DISCLAIMER:   Enabling root login for FTP is a Very Bad Idea for many, many reasons.
Edit  user_list  and  ftpusers and comment out "root".
For those (like me) using VSFTPD on Ubuntu server in mid-2013, it appears that root is allowed to login via SFTP by default, no special changes necessary.
