The Finder DOES still have the capability to display gratuitously long filenames in full (or nearly—the limit seems to be about 1000px): just open the Desktop in a finder window, change your view to list, and adjust the window size and column widths to taste.
I don't think you can do this without hacking the Finder.
SecondaryClick on Desktop -> Show view options -> Adjust the Icon Size and Grid Spacing according to your requirement.
OS X can handle really long filenames, but it also cares about looking nice, mostly because other operating systems have a strong potential to look ugly, and Apple's developers care about design aesthetic.
As a result, icon displays are limited in the amount of text they can display to two lines and whatever horizontal space is available in the grid.
You can go to View -> Show View Options (⌘+J) and set the grid size to max, although really long filenames (with no spaces) maybe still have ellipses.
In the finder, go to "View > Show View Options" and change the LABEL POSITION to RIGHT instead of BOTTOM.
