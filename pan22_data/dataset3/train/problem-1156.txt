Never done that before so not sure what report means, here is the screen cap.
At the same time Search all of a sudden would miss both files and directories that were actually there.
Screen of AHCI instructions and me doing it on my PC
Peter'WMIC Partition resultss request for WMIC, image of results.
Anyone have same issue, whether relate to or not a SSD addition?
Never heard of AHCI before, but the article says it speeds up SSDs.
Took it back to shop twice, they could not figure it out, besides the fact they set directories to "Videos" for optimization and it did get considerably better when set "General Items".
The performance was much better for Win boot, but sometimes on opening a drive or a directory that green bar that paints on top of the box would take a minute maybe even 4 mins to slowly paint.
It may be MSAHCI Start, Peter your suggestion led me to this article on SSD perf on Win 7, pasted in as image.
The MSAHCI Start was set to 3, I set to zero to enable AHCI mode, it was 3.
I have 16G ram and 2T hard drive, then added 120G Samsung SSD as new boot C: (had shop do it) and 2 things happened.
Have not seen any green bars yet, although it been just 5 mins.
