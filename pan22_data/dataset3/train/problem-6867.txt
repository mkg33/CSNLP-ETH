If the answer is no, as the QuickConfigurationGuide seems to suggest, what is the best thing I can ask to my system administrator to do so that they can edit the configuration once and never talk to me again?
I don't have administrative privileges on the server.
I'm trying to deploy a framework like django, cherry py or web.py, but I don't think that should make a difference.
So presuming things are somewhere under your home directory, they should use something like:
Consider a multi-user system such as what you find in shared hosting or a University's user pages, for example.
That alone is as dangerous as it was in mod_python because you are running stuff in the main Apache child worker processes and any system administrator who has any level of paranoia shouldn't allow that on a shared system.
The system administrator should at least set up a mod_wsgi daemon process group for you and force anything you do in your directory to run in that separate daemon process group.
With modpython is was possible to do everything from the root folder's htaccess.

can I use mod_wsgi without the need to edit the global apache config files?
