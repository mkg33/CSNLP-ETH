Then create images, clone servers and tweak FreeBSD to your heart's content.
I have been using RootBSD (http://www.rootbsd.net/) for years and remain impressed.
There also is CloudSigma in Switzerland which might be a good choice if you're concerned about US Internet legislature and privacy related stuff.
Mine are hosted at joinvps.com; I have to admit I was worried when their prices started at $5/mo, but I haven't had a single problem yet.
You get VNC and serial console access, and can boot off an unmodified FreeBSD-8.0 release DVD in the "tray", so you can rewrite your boot disk to your heart's content.
I don't know if they have FreeBSD images, but even if they don't you get complete access to the server.
I use them and they give you all the benefits of cloud hosting, but the flexibility of dedicated bare-metal servers.
http://arpnetworks.com/ gives very affordable VPS solutions.
So you can view the console, reboot, go into the BIOS, store an image to be booted from and install FreeBSD yourself.
I haven't contacted their support either, so I don't know how good their support is, again no problems necessitating it.
