Mechanical tech that does not belong in an electronical device, switch to SSD.
I believe that at the time of this writing, the greatest platter density is about 500 GB/in^2, which Samsung uses in their Spinpoint drives.
Additionally, the price per GB sweet spot lives up in the highest capacity drives.
I would expect bigger performance boost when moving from 5400 to 7200 rpm.
SATA also has the bonus of being the cheaper interface, at the moment; equivalently sized IDE drives tend to carry a bit of a price premium now for being the older, deprecated technology.
), so a 1TB+ drive might be choked a little under a SATA150 connection for bursty reads form the disk cache.
Either way I would definitely suggest grabbing a ~$100 USD 1.5 TB drive and connecting it via SATA150.
These manage enough read/write throughput to actually saturate an ATA133 connection (finally!
In case of 5400 rpm drives, interface is not your problem.
SATA gives you performance boost only if interface is bottleneck.
In both cases there will definitely be performance gains to see from either.
Today's 1TB+ 7200 RPM hard drives are quite capable of outperforming older 10KRPM server hard drives simply due to the incredible amount of data flying under the drive read/write heads every rotation.
Hard drive performance is a function of a few things, such as:
