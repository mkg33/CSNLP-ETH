Are you trying to create some sort of remote server that's accessible externally?
You should now be able to connect using any standard ssh client.
Well The Problem you are having with NC ( assuming you are talking about NETCAT) the Apple Version does not have the -e option in its bin.
Are you trying to remote from the OS X computer to another?
Are you trying to remotely login to a Mac OS X computer from another computer?
First off, nc (which I had no prior knowledge of) appears to be a kind of telnet program.
Second, you have failed to adequately describe what you're trying to do.
I had to do this for a few apple daemons that were ...lacking.
Why can you adjust things via the system preferences?
The usual way is to enable the ssh service for command line access.
If you set up an SSH keys (for instance with "ssh-keygen -t rsa") with no passphrase and then put the public key (as found in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) in the ~/.ssh/authorized_hosts file in the remote user's host, then you won't need to exchange any passwords and everything can be done from the command line using ssh.
The best solution is, to Compile a GNU version of NC using the apple SDK, then replace the apple version with your own GNU NC version.
as far as i know apple has no plans to add the -e option to appleNC.
