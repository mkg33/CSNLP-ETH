After the for-loop to compute the max value, you perform maxBinValue = maxBinValue == 0 ?
You could add a bit of documentation explaining what your code does.
The only thing that I find a bit disturbing is the empty line after comments : it split relevant things apart and it makes the code harder to read.
Indeed, it is not just a random setting I can update if I ever want to : it corresponds to the maximum value yuv420sp[index] can take.
As far as I can understand, the point is not to have a division by 0 if max is 0 which corresponds to a situation where histogramBins consist only of 0s which should happen only of totalPixels <= 0 which is quite unlikely.
Please note that if you were to define a max function/macro, it could be useful inside the loop too as it would become : maxBinValue = max(histogramBins[index],maxBinValue).
This 256 in const int BINS = 256; definitly sounds like a value I've seen in other places.
Its type is unsigned char and the maximum value can be retrieved from limits.h : doing const int BINS = UCHAR_MAX would probably make things easier to understand.
