You'll definitely want to have your DCs have a Domain Controller-style certificate (Domain Controller is the old one; Domain Controller Authentication then Kerberos Authentication supersede it; if your CA is running enterprise edition, then consider switching to the newer Kerberos template) - while a lot of the functions that it satisfies will be handled by a Computer certificate, some of the DC-specific stuff like smart card authentication, the LDAP/SSL listener (I believe?
Then have the server enroll (request a certificate) again?
Try certutil -pulse - this should check for templates the system has permission in, and enroll them.
Did you try removing the certificate from the server itself, instead of simply publishing the revocation to the revocation list on the CA?
), and with the newer Kerberos certificate, strong KDC validation, need the special certificate.
It should have no problem grabbing the certificate, as long as there's nothing crazy going on in the permissions settings on the template.
