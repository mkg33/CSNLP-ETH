For me it is showing "<0x1c>", which I thought was a simple string at the beginning but is actually the representation of the ASCII code.
Unfortunately, the pipe symbol | is not one of Sublime's bindable keys, even on a US keyboard.
Binding it to something else like "ctrl+p" works fine.
Answer is similar as Andr√© except that it didn't show the same "FS" character.
It's the top left key on the keyboard, left to the 1 key.
I am trying to bind ctrl+| to Show Console in Sublime Text 2 on a Norwegian keyboard using the following line in the (json?)
I just had to copy this <0x1c> ASCII code from the console (not a string), and paste it to my keybindings config file :
When doing sublime.log_input(True) in the console, it shows chr evt: <0x1c> (0x1c) when I type ctrl + |.
This doesn't work, and the pipe symbol also has a slightly darker tint than the rest of the configuration text, as if it is special.
{ "keys": ["*<0x1c>*"], "command": "show_panel", "args": {"panel": "console", "toggle": true} },
Any idea of how to bind functionality with the pipe-key?
I tried to escape it using "ctrl+\|" and "ctrl+\\|" none of which work.
