Or can someone point me in the right direction, because i have never made applications of such a large scale.
Is there some kind of method of easily switching between these envoirments.
Now the way i work is doing the development and basic testing om my PC, and whenever i feel the need of testing something on the server i upload everything and and test it on the server.
I have a dedicated sever that runs CentOS with PLESK.
First up, this really isn't a system administration issue at all but I doubt the other trilogy sites are any more suitable than this one.
Hello i am working on a large php/mysql project and i am getting to the point where everything get really confusing.
One part of the script does the dump, upload and import of MySQL, while another part can use any number of tools to upload only what's changed in your PHP.
Especially for the mysql changes this is really a pain, I have to export and import a new database again and again.
The way you're doing it makes a lot of sense but you can make life of whole lot easier for yourself with some automation.
