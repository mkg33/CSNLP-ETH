You will need to look into setting up or using an existing VPN that's accessible outside of your home network to work around this.
First, double check your Apache configuration on the RPi and make sure it's not listening on 127.0.0.1 or localhost.
Worry about your domain name after you can confirm connecting to it with the IP specified.
If your ISP does block port 80, try forward it to different port, say port 87.
You would need to set up your router to forward traffic on port 87, and you would need to configure your web server to host your website port 87.
Check your port forwarding on your router and make sure you forwarded TCP port 80 and not UDP port 80.
try accessing on your phone while only connected to cellular or have a friend try to access from their home).
If an alternate port works, your ISP is blocking incoming requests on port 80.
If that still doesn't work, your ISP may be blocking all incoming traffic to you, this is common if your main ISP is a cellular service.
Also double check your router's configuration to ensure there's no weird firewall or filtering options configured.
Also sometimes ISP's tend to block port 80 to prevent their subscribers from running web servers, to reduce bandwidth of course.
Sometimes router has firewalls that blocks port 80, please check that.
If that doesn't work, try changing your Apache and port forwarding configuration to a different port such as 8888 or 48888, and try to go http://{your public ip}:8888 or similar from your phone.
If both fails try see if your PI can access the internet, sometimes wrong network setup is done and causes such problems.
Try http://{your PUBLIC ip} from a system outside of your network (e.g.
(You may consider connecting your RPi directly to your home Internet connection if possible and not go through your router as an additional troubleshooting step if needed.)
Ensure you don't have any iptables rules on the RPi possibly filtering traffic.
