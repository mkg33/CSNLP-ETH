Challenges faced by each 'location' means you may need to regularly re-visit the overall strategy, and you should be 'trying things out' in various teams and regularly rolling those changes back into the overall process.
I view this as both a failure to standardize process across teams and a management problem if people aren't sticking to process.
However, the general components and the ingredients and the intended SLAs for delivery will be the same.
An employee should be easily able to transfer between any location with some minor re-orientation.
Etsy has their famous example of 'schema change thursday', where they allow non-contract-breaking-changes to be deployed as often as needed, but anything that will require coordinated change between systems happens on a specific day every week.
Again, need authoritative control and agreement between teams... a corporate brand with many locations, not a food court of different franchises.
Each restaurant may re-organize things a bit according to the architecture of their specific location, to best suit their needs.
Individual teams should be flexible in terms of how they manage their people, but processes should be transparent and followed.
