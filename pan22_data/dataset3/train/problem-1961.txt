Based on the information of mail function in php,  it says that a setting of sendmail_path has to be set in php.ini.
This page tells where the php.ini file should be located.
in /etc I found php.ini.default file and another one php.ini.default-5.2-previous.
And on the top of phpinfo() result, what I found about configuration is:

Actually, I don't have php.ini file in my local iMac.
Not sure if there is way to see the mail configuration from a php page?
If I need to change settings of php config, I have to make a copy of the default file as php.ini in /etc and make changes as sudo.
