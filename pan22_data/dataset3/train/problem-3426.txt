I suppose (like you are saying) you cannot enter password because one key presses itself, but underneath the password slot/space there is a reset password option, click on it (with USB flash inserted).
If you are able to get into BIOS Setup, I would suggest a DOS boot disk from Bootdisk.com
If you are using windows Vista or 7, before starting insert a flash drive and then turn on PC.
The parts in question are probably on the motherboard itself.
A pop-up will occur and from it you will be able to see the problematic key.
That should tell you which key is being pressed, if you can get to change the boot setup.
The internal keyboard controller may be faulty, or the keyboard connector may be damaged or shorted.
This behavior is unlikely to be caused by software, and since you stated that the laptop keyboard is entirely nonfunctional but an external keyboard works to an extent, I would suspect that the laptop's internal keyboard electronics are at fault.
Best solution is to press the f4 key or Esc on start up you can then type your password and all is good.
