Finally, I'd make some simple class that have only one or two fields (such as Tag, Location, User...) immutable by duping and freezing the parameter and freezing the whole object : (note that it won't work if you expect a boolean, a number, a Symbol or nil as dup raise an exception in such case :()
For the create method, can the option parameters really can be an empty hash ?
I haven't read your whole repo, so I'm not sure but does the Tag class really need to include both Search and Ressource ?
is repeated multiple time and actually don't test for much.
should be replaced with @user_id = user_id || 'self'
One important point : your code must be hard to unit test as it is coupled with HTTParty, you should consider using a Strategy pattern here.
I haven't done Ruby in some time so I'm a bit rusty but I hope my review helped you at least a bit :)
In the code you present here, I only see one mishaps :
If not I'd consider at least removing the default value for this.
I'd consider making a private method that check id and also check if id is not empty (or even if it isn't strip.empty?
