If the flash drive is actually 8 GB (in terms of the base-2 numbering system), then there is currently 590 MB of space that we cannot use.
This amount in bytes is what is labeled in the flash drive.
Remember that this only scales up as drives get bigger.
If it really is 8 GB, how can we gain access to that extra 590 MB?
The problem is that if the flash drive is really the size that manufacturers consider to be 8 GB, they are undercutting us by 590 MB, or over half a gig.
So, as we all (hopefully) know, computers run on a base-2 numbering system (bytes, etc.).
This amount in bytes is what the computer considers to be 8 GB.
The sizes of files and drives are calculated based on how many bytes that file takes up or how many bytes can be stored in that drive.
However, computers and manufacturers look at sizes differently.
From a computer's standpoint, 8 GB = 8,192 MB = 8,388,608 KB = 8,589,934,592 bytes.
Which system accurately describes the drive's real size?
From a manufacturer's standpoint, 8 GB = 8,000 MB = 8,000,000 KB = 8,000,000,000 bytes.
NOTE: Please tell me what tags this needs, I couldn't really find any that pertained well enough to my question, so I put some drive-related ones.
