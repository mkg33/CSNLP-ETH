The Hubpixed is not a power hub, but it draws power directly from the main board and therefore you should be good.
This page shows a listing of many powered USB hubs with notes showing if they can be used this way:  http://elinux.org/RPi_Powered_USB_Hubs
Data transfer rate of this hub reaches the level of 480Mbps.
There's even a picture of this setup on the amazon page for this product.
I advise you donâ€™t fret and choose usb hubs, which has many ports with different connectors.
I prefer this because it leaves just one power cable going from your setup to the wall, and makes sure that your peripherals have plenty of juice.
Some powered USB hubs can be used to power the raspberry pi as well by plugging the raspberry pi into one of the USB ports on the hub.
Personally, I went with this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P2BY5I .

It does not require any cable or soldering and connects seamlessly to the Pi Zero.
Model hi-speed 7-Port Ultra-Mini Hub provides USB ports for Plug-and-Play connectivity to USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 devices.
It is tiny (same lenght as a Pi Zero, and just a little wider) and powers the raspberry pi with no problem.
Hubpixed has been upgraded to HubPiWi - It now adds Wifi at the expense of one USB port.
You may not need a powered USB hub for your setup, but there can still be advantages to choosing one over an un-powered model.
The usb 3.0 part does not benefit pi (yet) however, EVERY port is powered.
I reliably power my pi and ANYTHING I connect to it with a Transcend usb 3.0 hub.
