(Although your example does not explicitly show that "category" and "any+keyword" would be used together?
Realistically, given your example URL, the only potentially valid URLs that could be derived from this would be:
By the sounds of it, the URL could consist of any combination of "location", "category" and/or "any+keyword"?
You could maybe do something like this if there is really "+" sign in keyword parameter.
If the possible "location" and "category" values are unique then you could perhaps rewrite the URL to your backend application and your application performs the necessary lookups to determine whether it's a "location", "category" or not (ie.
Unless there is a discernable difference between the "location", "category" (and "any+keyword") values, or the number of different locations and categories are sufficiently small for you to be able to actually list (hardcode) them in your directive then there is no way to handle these URL differences in .htaccess alone.
But this potentially involves a lot more work (work as in computing power) and is not scalable, so it not recommended.
If there is not "+" sign every time and it could be just a regular string, so it wouldn't be possible, because keyword and category would have the same regexp pattern.
If the former then you need to resolve the ambiguity in your application and create a consistent URL structure.
