An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1,011) possible combinations.
Passwords must contain characters from three of the following four categories:
When this policy setting is enabled, users must create strong passwords to meet the following minimum requirements:
For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations.
By default, the value for this policy setting in Windows Server 2008 is configured to Disabled, but it is set to Enabled in a Windows Server 2008 domain for both environments described in this guide.
This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords.

Passwords must be at least six characters in length.
Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords.
Proper use of the password settings helps to prevent the success of a brute force attack."
A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations.
Passwords cannot contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters.
At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack such a password.
Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as "!"
Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially.
A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations.
It appears that your default domain policy is enforcing minimum password complexity- you will probably need to edit Group Policy if you want to change this behaviour.
Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %).
