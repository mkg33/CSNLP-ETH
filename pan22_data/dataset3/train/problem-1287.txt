However, note that most VPN instructions will tell you how to create a server for opening your LAN to VPN clients on the internet rather than vice-versa, so you may need to experiment a bit with routing settings.
I create a OpenVPN Gateway Image for Raspberry Pi.
I would like to enable couple of my machines to access the internet through a VPN connection.

Don't know if this is useful, but I'm using VPN on Raspberry Pi from a vpn provider when I travel out of usa to china, they have a dd-wrt script which I installed and it worked from first time.
If somebody is curious about the script I can post it here.

While somehow experienced with command line configuration of multitude of things, could you please point to me to directions on what packages/services I need?
I do not need NAT or DHCP services (DNS can also go through the VPN).
My idea is that the PI can simply dial in an establish a connection and then route requests from the other machines through it.
I am thinking that setting up a default router of the device to the IP of the PI.
Currently PPTP only (OpenVPN support coming) - check out my project called DSVR (Domain Specific VPN Router) for the Raspberry Pi.
So may be you can save yourself a lot of trouble if you look for a provider with already made dd-wrt script.
Raspbian should be close enough to Ubuntu for the setup to be the same, and I've just checked that the OpenVPN package is available in the Raspbian repo.
