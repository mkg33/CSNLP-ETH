I was getting the same "operation now in progress" error.
When I use the name for one of the other 3 IP addresses, mount works.
Once the network is classified correctly, right click your shared folder, select Properties, select the Sharing tab, select Network and Sharing Center link, and make sure Turn on file and printer sharing is selected for Public or Private depending on your wifi connection type as classified previously.
If the share folder is from Windows 10 (probably applies to 7 and XP too), confirm that the Windows folder's share settings are configured properly for the type of network you are connected to, i.e.
The problem in my situation was I had spaces in the credentials file /etc/smb-credentials
Open the list of wifi networks and for the one you're connected to, click Properties.
Not sure just how relevant this is for your case, but I had a similar problem mounting a CIFS share on my Android phone:
I guess Dolphin is smarter about looking up an actual host when given a (sub)domain name than mount is.
I'll just relay my experience and adapt to your situation as appropriate.
(In my case, a Private network was incorrectly labeled Public.)
I tried removing the trailing slash and apparently it made a difference - it mounted:
I saw a case today where someone was trying to mount a share using CIFS but CIFS was not installed.
The hostname I was using successfully with Dolphin resolves to 4 IP addresses, one of which ends in 0 (it's a subdomain name).
After doing this, I was able to connect a Debian machine to Windows 10 as expected.
