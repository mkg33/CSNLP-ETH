No one would see your ISP's address, nor would their routing (for the sake of NAT) matter.
I cant forward ports anymore to my Xbox cause turns out my ISP recently refreshed IPs and all their IPs are public now and they say you can only forward ports if I request a static IP for a large amount of fee.
Do check your router to see if it supports VPN client capabilities at that level.
In that scenario the traffic would be routed as so:
End result is the same, configuration part is much more in-depth.
Any traffic from the outside world would end up through the VPN service, who pipes it directly to you.
Good learning experience if you're trying to find a reason to spend an afternoon educating yourself on light networking.
Personally, I've been using nvpn.net for a few years and they are pretty reasonable.
Option two: Find a deal on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) and configure a popular VPN software like OpenVPN yourself.
Anyway, some people are saying its impossible to forward ports now, some say i should use a VPN.
Then, you can connect your router to $VPN_PROVIDER in a 'set and forget' fashion.
Yes, option: purchase access with a VPN service that allows for a static IP and port forwarding, you will be able to have clients talk directly to your device(s) as you'd expect.
