Set this UPN suffix on all of your on premises user accounts.
Reconfigure Azure AD Connect to sync the entire domain.
In Hindsight that makes sense, as I had an account First.Lastname@company.com on the account before.
now I have that account (which is from AzureAD) and First.Lastname0815@companycom.onmicrosoft.com, which is from my on-prem AD.
This will delete the Office 365 users that were synched incorrectly.
Create a UPN Suffix on premises that matches the UPN Suffix of your existing/original Office 365 users (@company.com).
Reconfigure Azure AD Connect to synchronize only this OU.
Connect to Office 365 with Powershell and remove the users from the Office 365 recycle bin:
I deleted the AzureAD-Account, and hoped, that Azure would re-sync correctly.
Google did not give me an idea, as I am not exactly sure what to look for :-/
Now all my AD Users are in the Office Portal (and the AzureAD).
This should then synchronize your on premises users with your existing Office 365 users.
During the initial deployment I installed the AzureADConnect Program and set it up.
I tried to delete the "wrong" Azure-AD Account, to have it re-synced, but I can not do that (as it states that it is synced from a local server)
