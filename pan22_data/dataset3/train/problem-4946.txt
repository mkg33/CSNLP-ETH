Your best option would be an Exchange server but if not properly configured you can make your life pretty bad.
I know next to nothing about servers and networking, so I need someone to point me in the right direction.
He said he wants this to be our e-mail server with a network login.
Our computers currently connect to the MOM database through a networked drive.
The software publisher offers a SQL version of MOM, but it's way overpriced.
My boss would like to move away from this peer-to-peer MOM setup.
Goto the cloud (Google Apps or Hosted Exchange , Azure) with this request/situation, and purchase some type of support.
Can make the email part even easier with other hosted services.
My boss just asked me to buy a new server for our office network.
We use a terrible piece of order/inventory software called Mail Order Manager (MOM).
Is there a better way to connect to these databases without using the SQL version?
I have no idea how to set up an e-mail server, especially one that sends/receives e-mail using our domain name.
Does this question make sense, is it possible, and can someone help me get started?
You're really going to want to hire someone to do this right.
