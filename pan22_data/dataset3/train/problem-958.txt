As mentioned in one of the other answers, this documentation (http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtpd_sasl_path) states that the default is smtpd.
The documentation for this config option is a bit scattered.
see http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtpd_sasl_path.
Also, if I don't specify smtpd_sasl_path, there is default config located?
The meaning of smtpd_sasl_path is specific to your SASL implementation; with Dovecot it points to a socket that Postfix can use to communicate with the IMAP daemon.
As for the Cyrus configuration file, have you tried setting cyrus_sasl_config_path in main.cf?
If it doesn't exist there, it will look for the file in /usr/lib/sasl2/
Then, to find out what this actually means, take a look here -
But when I connect to SMTP I get unexpected CRAM-MD5 mechanism
You should not set the full path "/usr/lib/sasl2/smtpd" for "smtpd_sasl_path" here,only "smtpd" is ok,this pespective need an application name not a path for cyrus to deside the configuration file used by the postfix.
I'm not sure exactly what it means with Cyrus, but you can find its default value (as well as the default value of all the other Postfix configuration variables) by running:
But actually I had no config at this location by default.
According to http://www.postfix.org/SASL_README.html
Then, you can check where Postfix will actually look first for the sasl config file, which can be found (For debian based distros) in /usr/share/doc/postfix/README.Debian
http://www.postfix.org/SASL_README.html#server_cyrus_location
http://www.postfix.org/SASL_README.html#server_cyrus_name
Putting that all together, defining it as smtpd (or leaving it as default), it will look for smtpd.conf in the /etc/poostfix/sasl directory.
