The relevant Add-ons in my case are: Flash, NoScript and FlashStopper.
Add youtube.com as exception by Flashblock etc ....
Run ->   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

Maybe you don't have h.264 proper codecs; then you must have gstreamer bad and ugly if using Ubuntu, or other codecs if another distro, this assuming you're using Linux.

In my case several configuration items and protective Add-ons are in place to block Flash (because we know great Flash's security is, heh), so it was being silently blocked, thus preventing the videos from playing.
By tweaking my settings I was able to remove the silent block and make it a case-by-case block, so now I can approve videos and YouTube is working once again.
Some Firefox plugins lead from time to time to strange behaviors of Flash and HTML5 Player.
