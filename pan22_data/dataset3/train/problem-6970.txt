The lightest I have seen is Sophos, however it seems to be really targeted at corporate use.
I also tend to check any media that hasn't originated here in a VM before i use it, but i have a spare box, and a healthy amount of paranoia.
Panda cloud has the lowest memory usage of anything i've tested, but i'm not sure how it is in terms of actual detection in the wild.
Yes, none of this is an AV, but well, i haven't needed mine to do its job yet.
I do software development and some of my compiles take over 15 minutes and are mostly disk IO bound.
running as a limited user hugely reduces your risk of getting a virus.
I also take down systems every six months or so for a full image (call me paranoid ;p) and at this point i also run an offline virus scan before i do it.
I'd also look at windows steadystate as well - its not an AV, but a way to protect shared computers.
We use the enterprise edition of this at the office and it's been very easy to setup and doesn't slow down the machine.
I'm going to suggest something rather suprising...
An modern update to what really slows windows down would give me enough information to make a wise choice.
I would like to find a cheap on access virus scanner that will not slow down this already painfully slow system.
While i do run an anti virus, and all my systems are behind a firewall/router (a wrt 54 g dd-wrt , though i'm considering supplimenting it with untangle), i haven't actually had any virus infections in years running limited user unless i need to.
Don't allow access to anything that dosen't need accessing- once again, lowering your threat signature.
I have an older machine (athlon 1500+, 1.5Gb RAM) running XP on which I not currently running an  on access virus scanner.
I do scheduled scans with clamwin and malware bytes.
