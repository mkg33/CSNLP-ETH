But, one of these bootloader programs should be installed on MBR.
Only one of these bootloader programs, either that of Pardus or Ubuntu, needs to be written to the MBR.
When you installed pardus, you should have made the installer to not to install the bootloader on the MBR and instead do it on the pardus partition?
Grub2 will not update be able to boot pardus if you have not done this.
So, Pardus and Ubuntu BOTH need to have their bootloader programs installed in their respective /boot directories.
The other boot loader program should be written directly to the system partition.
You shouldn't choose to not to install the bootloader for Pardus.
Install Pardus but choose not to install the bootloader to MBR and instead choose /boot directory.
A bootloader installation is required for each of your Linux installations.
The MBR on a disk is only 512 in size and the rest of the bootloader is installed on the /boot directory.
It will then recognize the Pardus partition and copy its boot entry to grub.cfg.
