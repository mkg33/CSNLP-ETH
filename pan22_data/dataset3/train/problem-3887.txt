Wiping it fully twice (all 0's, then all 1's) is sufficient to make a recovery extremely expensive and require even more time and specialized tools.
Again, you won't be reusing the results anywhere so charity donations are out the window after the drill or thermite...
Don't know how it works, and don't care, it's awesome.
dban is the proper tool to use if you are planning on using the drive for some other application or donating it to another party or selling it.
Just taking the platters off the spindles will make it impossible for almost anyone to read them (I've read different things about whether it's possible for anyone to get the platters re-aligned), and if you break the platters into a few pieces, that should be it.
There's even a challenge for data recovery companies to restore anything that has been erased with dd.
"NSA" level wipes take 6-8+ hours to fully write to the drive the required number of times.
but I've used it for data recovery on failing hard drives(think if=/dev/hda of=/dev/sda) and it has worked wonders.
If you want it to be fast and completely unambiguously safe, nothing beats thermite.
Seriously, I don't know any way of getting rid of data faster or easier.
If a disk uses 0's and 1's to hold data, imagine writing everything to 0 makes those 1's into 0.2's.
I guess you could still thermite the platters if you're really worried...
I've used DoD spec'd erasing programs that actually didnt work(the system was bootable afterwords).
A special tool can read that 0.2 and recognize it used to be a 1.
Simply writing over the entire disk once will make it safe from anyone who lacks specialized and costly tooks to manually read the data from the drive.
Somewhat slower but less likely to surprise your neighbors is a drill.
You don't need thermite or nitro, just take the drives apart and take the platters out (and keep the voice coil magnets from the head positioning assembly, they're super-strong rare-earth magnets, very useful), and break them.
