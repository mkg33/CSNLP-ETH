TCP, but the protocol is merely sitting in front of the actual application protocol rather than in the transport layer and sharing the space with TCP.
I assume in my question that we all agree that TCP/IP consists of four layers.
As far as I understand the whole thing, TLS (and the old dying SSL), are situated in the application layer of TCP/IP and acting as a wrapper around other application layer protocols (e.g.
It's even placed within different layers depending on which Wikipedia article you're just reading.
Well, I'd love to hear a clarification of this maybe not so important problem.
The Transport Layer only deals with the connection mode between processes - TCP/UDP multiplexing and the like.
Given the 4-layer model you are working within, TLS would fall the Application Layer.
Mainly people adding a fifth layer at the bottom for the physical stuff or they added a fifth layer beneath the application layer, just to place TLS there.
I have an endless amount of books and websites at my disposal, but this question stays totally unanswered, or rather every author invests his own solution for this problem.
