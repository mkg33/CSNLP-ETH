Looking at the info for these files, it appears that access rights were attached only to my old user account.
You may have created a second user upon migration.
If it's greyed out, click the lock and authenticate.
If so, the user you imported probably has permission to access your external drive.
I recently had to reformat my Macbook Pro, and imported my account and settings from Time Machine via the Migration Assistant.
if you imported from migration assistant, did you create a new account after reformatting?
There is a checkbox at the bottom for "Ignore ownership on this volume."
Is there some way to reassign these files and folders to my new user account?
A number of folders have the little red 'no access' sign on them and I can't rename or move anything.
or did you restore the backup from Time Machine during the initial setup assistant?
Check in you System Preferences->Accounts to see if there are multiple users present.
Everything on the Mac itself is fine, but now I don't have permission to access almost everything on my external drive.
I prefer this method since it doesn't actually change the file permissions, just makes the OS ignore them.
