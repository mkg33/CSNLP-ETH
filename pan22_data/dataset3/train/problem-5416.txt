The simple solution would just be to make sure that their is a folder withing the roaming profiles path you have set for any account that may login, including the administrator accounts.
Furthermore folder redirection and roaming profiles are enabled via Group Policy.
When connecting with that you will be immune to the session broker trying to balance the load on the servers.
Roaming profiles specifically are able to be applied to individual users using Active Directory Users and Computers by adding the path to the profile tab of the user properties.
Folder re-direction is normally a per-user setting, so it doesn't seem like this should be an issue.
If I only login with my Domain Administrator account is is always redirected to one machine.
We are having a bunch of Windows Server 2008 R2 in a Remote Desktop Session Broker farm to allow access for our employees to a company Remote Desktop.
If I login with the machine administrator accounts the folder redirection throws errors.
How do I handle the Administrator accounts in such a setup?
Administrator accounts are able to be excluded from folder redirection and roaming profiles by only applying folder redirection to user containers, as opposed to the entire domain.
Use the /admin switch when starting the remote desktop client.
You are able to setup Group Policy as a per-user setting by adding the individual user account to the scope of the group policy in the Group Policy Management Console.
Applying roaming-profiles via a group policy is a per-machine setting, that means you are basically setting up a fixed path for roaming profiles for everyone that may use the machine.
