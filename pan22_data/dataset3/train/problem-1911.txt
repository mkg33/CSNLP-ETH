Another option is to close Firefox, downgrade to Firefox 56, and restart Firefox.
I had this problem too and found the following solution:
This Quantum-compatible addon offers similar functionality and will magically find all those missing tabs from your old Groups.
I can't speak for how well it works as a replacement as I've only just downloaded it myself, for this very reason, but worst case scenario you can get the tabs back, bookmark them and get rid of Conex, so you've at least got those tabs backed up wile you work out how to cope without Groups.
(PS I know Stackexchange prefers an answer on the page rather than a simple link, but it didn't feel right to copy & paste that person's work from their blog on here)
At this point, you may save your tabs in a Firefox 57-safe way and upgrade to Firefox 57 again.
I have restored my tabs from inactive groups by installing the Sync Tab Groups extension.
This blog post (How I Recovered my Firefox Tab Groups) describes a way to extract them from sessionstore.js, using the linux commandline and Python.
