to get all the total size of Mysql databases in your VPS.
On servers with hundreds of databases, it can take minutes to calculate.
Warning: According to the storage engine, indexes are stored within the main file or in another file don't forget to sum them up if needed.
I am currently using information_schema.TABLES to calculate the total disk space usage grouped by the database name, but it is running terribly slowly.
You can see that all space is being hogged by a few tables holding many GiG's of data.
Is there a method for speeding up information_schema?
I like to do disk space management this way because sometimes you cannot even log into mysql because you don't know the password or user.
Here's an example of me finding where all the space is being eaten up from.
In any of the cases above, you can run the following query to get the information that you are looking for.
In order to see which tables are taking all the space you can proceed like this using the "human" or "-h" option.
I would look for the size of the file on your data dictionnary.
In order for me to see where disk space is being used up (regardless if it's in a mysql table or not), I use my trusty "du" command.
You can see that the majority of the space is being used by this folder.
What is the quickest method of calculating disk space usage by database?
If you have a very large number of tables, it can be slow, as you have already discovered.
