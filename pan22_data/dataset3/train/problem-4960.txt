There is a lot to think about, but I just need a little push in the right direction to get things started.
More if a hypervisor does not have enough disk space left for the creation of images.
Server A runs the web server where my customer portal runs and where customers can order virtual machines.
Server B is the hypervisor with KVM where images and ultimately virtual machines are created.
Whenever a customer clicks on the button 'Order VM', a telnet call to a hypervisor + port is done and a daemon listening on that port runs a script, for example:
I don't necessarily need example code (it might help of course).
I have not tried much because I don't know where to start.
This script sort of works fine when there is only 1 customer ordering a virtual machine and when there is only 1 hypervisor.
All these commands are executed with the use of SSH.
I have two Ubuntu 14.04 LTS servers, server A and B.
The problem however is my lack of knowledge about this kind of stuff.
This is my first question on serverfault so I hope I'm doing this right as I'm usually on Stackoverflow :-)
This means that for every virtual machine I need to do 3 SSH commands.
I recently created a bash script on server A that:
I can provide the bash script I have created if needed.
Having multiple customers ordering VM's and having multiple hypervisors will probably break the script.
