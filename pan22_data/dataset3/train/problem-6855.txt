Mid-keystroke, possibly, and if two attached users are on different windows at the time either of them hits that command, something hilarious happens.
For example, with bind p at % prev you change C-a p to send the "prev" command not just to the current display (and go to the previous window), but to all displays (the % argument: <matchstring>% means that matchstring gets prefix-matched against the display names, and the empty string matches all of them).
You can try setting the display's caption or hardstatus to include the window flags, which will at least indicate whether the current window is shared; to find out where everyone else currently is, use the displays command, which unfortunately doesn't have a key for "switch to this window".
Which works fine if everyone is looking at the same window; anyone hitting C-a p will move everyone one window back.
You could do some hackery with "at", to mirror window change commands to all connected displays, but that's dumb, in the sense that the command is mirrored, not the effect.
