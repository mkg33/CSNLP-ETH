I'm interpolating its position using easing equations, but I would like to be able to modify the end point dynamically avoiding discontinous or abrupt changes.
Is it possible to do this using easing equations or something similar?
you don't compute the position incrementally, but fully every frame), and the end point also moves smoothly, you should get smooth movement without much problems.
Specifically if i'm going from point A to B from time 0 to 1, then at time T decide i need to go to point C instead you have the choices:
In my game I have an object oscillating between 2 points on its local X axis.
A common scheme is simply lerping the new and old functions
Note that x is a function of the parameter p, and it doesn't depend at all on the previous value of x.
If you parameterize the movement on time elapsed since the beginning (i.e.
is a simple linear interpolation between start_x and end_x.
There are decisions and bookkeeping to keep track of and decide when and how fast to transition from the old to the new curves.
So if you want the end point to move smoothly, it's just like this:
For the best results, a good grasp of the underlying calculus (of both the curves as well as the externals causing the end point changes) can go a long way to crafting a formula to produce the desired effect.
or something else that suits your use case better.
Of course, the computation of the position of end_x will probably be decoupled from the computation of x; this is just an example.
