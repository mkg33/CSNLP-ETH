Restarted the terminal and everything is working fine now.
I have to use DOS file endings for some code shared with Windows users, so if I edit .bash_profile while in that git repo I get lots of error messages when running the script (at login).
I was running on the same problem, and I just found simpler solution:
I know this is an old thread but just wanted to leave here my solution in the hope someone else happens to have the same issue.
This would open a non-bash shell and you could edit the file there.
In the future it would be a good idea to keep a shell open or test running the new .bash_profile prior to exiting.
In addition to the previously mentioned showing of hidden files and using a text editor, there is also an easier way to open a new shell without changing your default shell.
You could try opening ~/.bash_profile with TextEdit and making it blank temporarily.
I discovered recently that DOS style files cause problems for both .bash* scripts in OS-X.
When I ran terminal from MacOS it was ok with my own user, but when changed to sudo it couldn't work (command not found).
You could alt-click the Terminal app and choose "New Command...".
