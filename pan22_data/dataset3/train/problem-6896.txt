After so much wasted time, I found the answer in this blog post:
How can I keep using gmail without signing in to chrome?
Another way to avoid Google forcefully signing users into Chrome
Now as soon as I sign in to gmail, chrome automatically signs in as well into the same account.
Now, when you sign in Gmail, it won't sign in Chrome.
Yet, I do have to use gmail and docs (it's a corporate account, I don't have a choice).
Navigate to chrome://flags/#account-consistency and switch the Identity consistency between browser and cookie jar flag to "Disabled".
With the latest version of chrome it seems this option has been removed.
In the past, I could refuse to sign in to chrome - and still be able to use, for example, gmail.

I do not want to sign in to chrome; I do not want chrome to associate everything I do in my browser with my account.
Go to â‹® > Settings > Advanced > Privacy and security and disable Allow Chrome sign-in.
If I sign out from under "people" in chrome settings, I am automatically signed out from gmail.
I would just select the tiny "skip" link when presented with the sign in window.
