I would suggest something similar to Antoine, get a nice low-end Dell Server.
There are hardware requirements on the web site, but I wonder if there are some special hardware that will be better in a router mod ?
Install Squid and SquidGuard as your proxy and blacklist (can block ads as well, which users like!)
I would suggest you to use Pfsense which is based on BSD and is configured via an extremely powerful yet simple and clear web interface.
Install SHorewall as a 2 interface bridge on Debian (my Server OS of choice) - Firewall
I have the exact the same problem as you but for a slighty bigger network.
I've used them in the past, look into Netgear's FVS338 or FVX538, they seem very cheap and can do most of the things you want to run.
Configuring it as a transparent bridge was the most efficient setup as it allowed to modify practically nothing on the actual architecture.
I therefore suggest you either get one nice Dell server (low end will be far enough) for reliability of the hardware components and install pfsense on it.
Untangle seems to be the best to solve my problem.
It is firewalling a zones of 70 servers on a Celeron 3Ghz processor with 2GB of RAM (largely unused).
Shorewall will route the traffic and should be set as your machines default gateway.
You'd hook up your ISP to the WAN port and then run a connection from the Netgear's LAN to your switch.
I would also recommend installing Apache on it and serving your proxy details via a proxy.pac, and/or WPAD.dat file if you are a windows house.
I think every standard server with 2ghz and 2gb ram sould be enough.
Or you can reuse two older servers on PFsense with redundancy (CARP) which is really simple to configure.
