But it is not a necessary thing and, depends on your team and project code style and decisions, maybe make things wors.
For finding out that your list is sorted, you only need to check did you make any swap in the last iteration or not.
message, you can simply create a copy of input list (using for example: input_list[::]) and compare that with the result of bubble_sort function in the last part of your code.
Because that could create many problems and misunderstandings in the future, especially when you are working with other people.
So It is better to think about using this method or returning a new sorted list from function.
After implementing suggestions from an earlier, related question (Python: Selection sort), I have written this code.
Also, for making your code more readable, maybe it is a good idea to split your bubble_sort function to two separate functions.
That is a thing that you can consider in your mind and think about it.
One checks conditions and calls the second one that really sorts the list.
But if you want to stick to the current method, don't forget to explain that in the documentation of your code clearly.
Also, many times changing the value of the function parameter and using that like an in-out parameter is not a very good idea in the python.
