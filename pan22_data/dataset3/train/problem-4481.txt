The flow of automation will be like this: Whenever a Upload occurs to ECR, CloudTrail records PutImage event and can write it to CloudWatch Logs.
Lambda Function Contains the code to Create Task Definition Revision and Update Service with latest Task Definition.
In fact in my pipelines I deploy the ECS Tasks through CloudFormation templates and the CloudFormation stack update is part of the pipeline.
An Alarm can be triggered whenever a PutImage event is written in CloudWatch Logs which can further trigger a Lambda Function through SNS.
You can however do it as part of your Jenkins pipeline - after you push to ECR as a next step in the pipeline can run a script that will reload the task.
I don't think you can trigger re-deployment based on ECS image being updated.
Automate Deployment whenever Docker Image gets uploaded on ECR
There's a good article about enabling auto-deployment everytime an image is pushed to ECR here: https://medium.com/@YadavPrakshi/automate-zero-downtime-deployment-with-amazon-ecs-and-lambda-c4e49953273d
EC2 Container does not write logs directly to CloudWatch but CloudTrail records API activity for ECS.
That way I update the ECS Task definition automatically every time I push a new image to non-prod ECR.
