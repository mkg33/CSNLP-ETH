( As to why multiples of 2 or 4 bytes: Memory access is usually 1, 2 or 4 bytes wide. )
There's no reason to continue that trend, at least for VMware...
I suspect every VM product still uses multiples of four bytes.
In the old times (before virtualization), memory came in powers/multiples of 2, because that is the way memory is manufactured.
I'm not ashamed to say that I have some 3-CPU virtual machines out there .
Note that 3 MB is 3072 KB, which is a multiple of two and four (2x1536, or 4x768) even though that is not instantly clear when you look at the value 3.
The answer to your question usually lies more within the guest OSes than the hypervisor used.
Hyper-V, as an example, assigns memory to guest OSes in 2MB chunks.
Windows has, for many year, not really cared whether the memory was laid out in any particular way, save a few requirements on it looking like a PC, so that the boot loader works.
This is only so that the page table hardware in the processors can be set up to use 2MB pages, which is more efficient in that it uses less memory for page tables and fewer entries in the TLB within the processor.
Nowadays that we create virtual servers that don't have real physical memory, people still create them using powers/multiples of 2.
Is there any reason to continue doing this (performance or others) or is this just something that people do because that is what they are used to?
