Using diff I regularly check whether the file I generate has changes to the old config and in that case I reload the DHCP server.
ISC DHCP 4.x allows the DHCP service to be backed by an LDAP database (local or remote).
You start the DHCP server and point it at the LDAP db (via a short config file).
It is a commercial product, but I can't imagine live without it.
If you select dynamic DB, each DHCP query becomes an LDAP query/response.
I used this to allow engineers to add and remove test boxes to a network without requiring them to log onto the DHCP server, edit a file or use root privs.
Works quite well for me with multiple data centers, dozens of networks and hundreds of IPs.
The package on both Fedora 12+ and Ubuntu (version unknown) includes the LDAP schema file.
Also allows you to have the 'web interface' and keep it open source.
With LDAP you can update the DHCP contents using any language with an LDAP library from any location routable to your LDAP server.
I ended up writing a few lines of Python code to generate DHCP config files from a database backend.
Your LDAP DB can serve an unlimited number of DHCP servers.
