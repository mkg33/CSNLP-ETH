If you haven't previously run a mailserver, you're likely to be in over your head attempting to run any of the common *nix mailservers (sendmail, postfix, qmail, courier) - there's a fairly steep learning curve, none could be characterized as plug-and-play.
I've hosted my own email server using Postfix for years and I recently looked at options for outsourcing.
However I do agree with anastrophe running a mailserver isn't something to be taken lightly.
However, RunBox offers standalone email hosting for a good price and are worth checking out.
You can apply for higher limits as well as have your Elastic IP reverse DNS records set by Amazon by filling in a form (only accessible if you login with your AWS account).
They offer a free trial period so you can test it out and see if it's a good fit for you.
While EC2 has no restriction on running a mailserver they do have a restriction on how much email you can send by default.
Most affordable services I looked at only offered email hosting as part of a domain and web hosting package.
