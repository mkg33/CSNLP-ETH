What I suspect you have is a regular NIC that supports iSCSI boot - I'm used to seeing these on IBM's servers.
So if this is your case, you need to use ESX's iSCSI software initiator.
You then bind this port to the dependent hardware iSCSI adapter, so that your host can direct the iSCSI traffic through the NIC.
IPv6 offload is currently only suported for (some) Qlogic iSCSI HBA's but since it is supported within Guests using the VMXNET 3 Network adapter I'd expect to see support at the host level NICs soon.
If so, it has iSCSI BIOS/UEFI support so you can boot via iSCSI, the card provides enough functionality to get your OS loaded.
I can't find any documentation that indicates that iSCSI Offload functionality is supported by ESX for hybrid devices like the Broadcom 5709 which I've always understood is not a HBA (at least according to Dell's tech folks).
Once you get that far, it's the OS's responsibility to do iSCSI via software.
The only hardware iSCSI HBA's that ESX 4.0 U1 supports are listed here
Their own iSCSI software is however 100% supported.
The ESX 4 Software initiator is substantially better than previous versions, it has substantially lower CPU utilization, better multi-threading, multi-pathing and Jumbo frame support so the advantages of using HBA's for iSCSI are much less significant than they were with earlier ESX versions.
You can check that it is enabled by looking at the MSS result from esxcfg-vmknic -l to see if the NICs used by the iSCSI VMKernel ports have TSO enabled.
Historically, ESX has very limited support for hardware-based iSCSI HBA's.
ESX 4 does support IPv4 TCP Offload, specifically TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) and LRO (Large Receive Offload), on all supported NIC's that support it AFAIK and it is enabled by default.
After you determined the name of the NIC, create an iSCSI port on a vSwitch connected to the NIC.
