There are only few services that provide abuse contacts beside WHOIS and SOA.
However, when signing up for an e-mail feedback loop program, the ISP came back with the e-mail address of one of our managers as the contact.
I've had this previously with nominet emailing an old address in regards to an issue, rather than the one on the whois.
whois and dig SOA reveal the public information about a domain and it's DNS.
The address in DNS SOA records may not be related to anything but DNS, and sometimes isn't even valid.
The other traditional thing to do is email abuse@ -- If there's a domain associated with the IP start there, and work your way through the upstream providers until you get a response.
The manager may also be listed under the tech contact for the ip block if you are a ripe member (you can check that with whois).
That e-mail address does not appear in any of the information above.
What other methods can you obtain an administrative e-mail contact for a domain?
But it is even possible that the abuse contact is maintained manually in feedback loops.
I've also noticed, the registrars usually keep the email addresses on file of what the admin/tech etc contacts are set to.
The whois system is the traditional way of getting this information.
