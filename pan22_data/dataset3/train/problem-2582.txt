I had this same issue you've described, with the exact same Error returned to FileZilla.
I know you said you double checked the permissions, but I wanted to verify that you'd checked the file- level permissions as well as the share permissions?
My suggestion would be to determine whether or not you want to use user isolation or not and then start from scratch.
It must be correct or you will find home directory inaccessible.
It's not clear to me from reading your post and the link you provided as to whether or not you're using user isolation.

You will need to verify the Physical Path of the FTP.
You will need change it to "do not isolate users, start users in "user name directory" "
If your IIS FTP Site, or one of its parents including the Default site, is using IPv4 Address Restrictions then you'll need to ensure that your IP address is allowed.
Another cause of this error can be the use of FTP IPv4 Address and Domain Restrictions.
