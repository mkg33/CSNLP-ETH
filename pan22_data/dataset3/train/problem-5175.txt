The problem was introduced when I thought to help a colleague who had an external disk he simply used as a dump as well.
Connecting it to his machine again, all of the data is fine.
It'd be cool to figure out how to make this setup sustainable.
I offered to add a share on the server and mount his disk, so he wouldn't need to move it around the office, which is all he would do with it.
The main partition works fine- ext3, internal disk.
Hey guys- got a little samba server running for a small personal file share, and was having some trouble with a very specific scenario.
When it works, it's great, but every so often (in regrettably undocumented conditions, but NOT upon reboot- that works fine) it corrupts the mount folder.
This has happened multiple times, and remounting to a different folder makes it work again for a time.
My samba server is a CentOS 5.3 box, and is running a large share for simply dumping files.
I know I'm asking for trouble, but this is a low-risk scenario, and it's an interesting scenario.
