How do you upload Exchange emails into Gmail from Outlook while maintaining the correct From and To email addresses?
Install Outlook on virtual hard drive (not recommended in general but works for transfer to Gmail)
Exchange Management Console -> Server Configuration > Client Access > POP3 and IMAP4 -> Authentication -> Plain text logon

Virtual PC -> Edit -> Settings -> Shared Folders -> to copy any data or installation files on your host desktop
Administrative Tools -> Services -> Microsoft Exchange Information Store -> Restart
Exchange Management Console -> Recipient Configuration -> Mailbox -> New Mailbox -> User Mailbox -> Create mailbox for new user + Select mailbox database
Host PC Desktop -> Start -> Control Panel -> Network Connections -> Properties -> Install -> Virtual Machine Network Services
Exchange Management Console -> Organization Configuration -> Hub Transport -> E-mail Address Policies -> Edit -> Add -> Select accepted domain + Set as Reply

Copy from IMAP4 mailbox to Gmail mailbox (I tested this successfully with Outlook but used Thunderbird for the mass transfer)
Copy from PST to Exchange mailbox (will mirror in IMAP4 mailbox)

Exchange Management Console -> Organization Configuration -> Hub Transport -> Accepted Domains -> + Set as default
Test Account Settings -> Should log onto incoming mail server but may not successfully send test e-mail message (not necessary for transfer)

I used Virtual PC 2007 and the pre-configured VHD of Exchange Server 2007 SP1 that Microsoft provides for evaluation purposes.
Essentially, you'll have to follow a two-step process:
All Exchange emails in Gmail are listed as sent by (unknown sender).
Add IMAP4 account to connect to your Exchange mailbox through IMAP (see account details below)
Virtual PC -> Edit -> Settings -> Networking Settings -> Adapter 1 -> Select the desktop network connection that you just updated
