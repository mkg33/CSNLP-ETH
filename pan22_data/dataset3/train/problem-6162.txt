The outlook.pst is an existing file, and I can see all my old emails, etc in it.
Note: I'm not asking how I can move the mails; I know I can simply drag them.
Even in this scenario, each mailbox use its own Outlook profile and structure, as they are on different mail system or mail server.
How can I get rid of the new files and their accompanying file structure in Outlook, and use the Outlook.pst and its folder structure instead?
Instead for each email account I get a new folder structure like for "Outlook", with "Inbox", "Drafts", "Sent", etc.
(I want to use the folder structure under the top level "Outlook".)
I want to get rid of the "me@mydomain.net" folder completely.
Each kind of mailbox has its own folder structure, such as Exchange account, Outlook account, GMAIL account.
I also noticed ("Data file properties" | "advanced") that these accounts are created in another datafile, instead of the existing outlook.pst:
I suppose you add other accounts by adding accounts in current Outlook profile.
I have to set up my email accounts, but when I do (they're IMAP) I don't see an option where I can select the target location.
