Also, you don't own the airwaves and cannot control other wireless implementations which may happen close by and cause interference.
After implementation, you should perform another wireless site survey in order to be able to tweak the WAP placements and radio strengths.
This involves performing a wireless site survey to identify proper WAP placement.
As @RonMaupin says, you will need a site survey to determine if this is possible.
This will involve cabling for the WAPs (wireless is not completely wireless).
You may be able to add an additional AP with a directional antenna to improve reception in the dead zone.
After you get the survey, you need to install the WAPs, probably with a wireless controller to get seamless roaming.
This is how companies do successful Wi-Fi design and implementation.
It sounds like the Wi-Fi wasn't set up properly in the first place.
The use of monitoring WAPs can help identify sources of interference which didn't exist before, and you may need to modify the AP placements and radio power over time to adjust for changing wireless conditions.
You probably want to do it correctly, or you will continually run into problems.
