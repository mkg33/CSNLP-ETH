Look for "Untitled conversation" in Skype and you can chat with yourself there.
I would like to transfer a file from one computer to another computer using Skype file transfer, but I can't start a chat with myself.
At least I can and I don't have the "download files automatically" option switched on.
If you drag a file to the chat in one computer, you can download it in the other computer.
When you type into the chat in one computer, you will see the text also in the other computer.
In both computers, start a chat with someone who is not online.
You can start a new conversation and do not invite anyone then send your text/file to the conversation.
Now you will be only one persone, who can see messages in this room.
After that just remove one persone, who you added.
This is what I just did to quickly transfer a file between my two devices.
And you will be alone in chat and still can write messages.
(Preferably use a contact who you know will not be available or use another account of your own.)
I have Skype running on two (Windows) computers using the same account.
Another excellent way is to run OneNote on every device, that lets you easily display links and documents wherever you choose.
