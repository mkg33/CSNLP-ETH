Note: I cannot afford a test server setup right now.
I have tried different solutions, but the simple ones just cannot be implemented like putting the try_files directive inside the if statement.
I also tried rewriting the url, if it is coming from other IPs than the VM, but that means all the css and jpg requests get rewritten as well.
My basic approach would be to to use an if statement inside the server block that says, if $remote_addr is not , then serve static files with try_files.
I'm looking for a different and simpler solution from someone who has done something like this before.
I know about the nginx geo module, but I don't think I really need that, also want to keep things simple.
Otherwise (in case of VM) all traffic goes the same way.
So again, the basic problem is redirecting all traffic to a static page if the IP is not one specified.
I want to update the app from time to time and during the update I want the users to see a static page that informs them that the app is having a downtime.
This is a HACK IMO, and actually it doesn't even work.
(the requests urls can be same, so location based solutions doesn't work out for me)
I have a virtual machine that runs the UI tests, so I would like to modify the nginx config, so only that VM can access the website, all the other IP-s are served a static page.
Now I also want to test the app with a UI test framework, that would require accessing the application during downtime.
