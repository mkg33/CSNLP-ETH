The following VBScript will enumerate all windows, find the ones that match the URL you would like to find and then close the tab/window.
You can test it by opening multiple tabs in IE, opening www.google.com and leaving others in about:Tabs, execute the script, and watch as the tabs/windows close.
If you're spawning it in VBScript, you need to explicitly free the COM server ActiveX object in your vbscript code before your script exits, by Setting it to Nothing.
To do so, in PHP, you can add this at top of your script so browser status has no effect on PHP execution state :
My solution is to open the browser, and close it immediatly after execution, but called scripts should be modified so there execution are not endend by closing the browser.
Something like taskkill /F /IM iexplore.exe /FI "CPUTIME gt 1:00:00".
Shouldn't be too difficult to modify script pass it a text file with a list of URLs to search for and close the windows found.
Are you invoking iexplore.exe directly, or are you spawning it in VBScript or something?
This is a kluge (a clever workaround that doesn't solve the root of the problem but gets it done anyway), but...
Schedule a new Task and use it to fire off Windows' TaskKill, and forcefully kill all processes with the Image Name "iexplorer.exe" that have been running for more than an hour:
Not a full answer, but something you can hopefully work with...
The If InStr section can be used to do partial URL search, while the If UCase can be used for exact string comparison.
