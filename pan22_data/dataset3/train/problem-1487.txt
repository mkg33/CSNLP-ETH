You shouldn't need to simulate much more than a login and directory listing, if IP whitelisting is your concern.
When you're happy that all the tests are passing then you can proceed with renumbering.
Get onto the case of vendors that explicitly fail the tests.
It would require a change, but once you implement the tunnel, you can make server-side changes at will.
It might be relevant if you stated the relationship between the vendors, your clients and yourselves.
You don't want to be relying on your old address space forever.
For instance it could be a bit more tricky if the service contract is by proxy of your clients, as it would require them to chase up the change requests on your behalf.
If you setup your firewall to NAT all the servers to the one IP address you would be able to keep the single public facing IP but host the services on multiple FTP servers.
Start testing against your vendors from the new address space as early as possible.
However if you make it professionally clear that the changes must be completed on time in order for you to deliver the clients the level of service they expect then there shouldn't be any problems.
But the difference is that we procure PI address space directly from the RIRs ourselves and don't really have any processes like you describe.
Make the rest aware of the change, even if the test succeeded.
One potential solution might be to provide your service to clients via VPN tunnels.
