I'm running Emacs on OSX (Emacs24) and on occasion I have to edit files on a mounted sshfs volume.
There are different ways  to set variables in emacs.
(setq vc-ignore-dir-regexp (format "\\(%s\\)\\|\\(%s\\)\\|\\(%s\\)"
assuming you mounted stuff on /tmp/mnt it should work by appending another line of formatting \\|\\(%s\\) and adding /tmp/mnt/* to the list of strings
                                     "/tmp/mnt/*"))
                                     vc-ignore-dir-regexp
I would try modifying the variable vc-handled-backends which my version of Emacs describes as:
                                     tramp-file-name-regexp
However, Emacs' vc integration -- git, specifically -- is REALLY slow over sshfs mounts.
I think writing an around-advice for vc-git-registered (or even vc-registered or vc-find-file-hook) would be the best course of action.
The default list of backends is (RCS CVS SVN SCCS Bzr Git Hg Mtn Arch)
Just editing your ~/.emacs file and adding the following two lines should do the trick (notice Git is removed from the list)
I'd like to selectively disable vc-mode, either in configuration or using .dir-locals.el.
As pmr mentioned, you can remove git from the list of backends.
In there, you would check the file path or the value of some variable that would be set through .dir-locals.el.
