Oracle RDBMS has always been designed to host multiple schemas in the one database, and for different applications that is the way to go.
Solaris Zones) or you are using VMs it is a really bad idea to host multiple databases on the same server.
You are just creating an environment where contention will be rife and tuning will be even trickier than normal.
Unless your server is physically partitioned (e.g.
But life is hard and software vendors fall behind and do not keep up with the later version of the database.
Software vendors demand their own database based on FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt).
I advocate one database - multiple schemas because:
I will try to add some arguments when several databases may be better.
Now you can plug a database into the multitenant container database - CDB.
Due to these restrictions, we end up running 8i to 11g, all kinds of encodings, backup is a full time job and the overall administration is a nightmare.
DSS databases and OLTP databases can be kept separate.
Software vendors require the DBA role for their application.
Databases use server resources: CPU, RAM, disk I/O.
Software vendors do not handle encoding correctly.
You already got two answers about one database - multiple schemas approach.
Oracle has this new pluggable pill in their latest release 12.1.0.1 of the database which is supposed to address the "multiple database vs. multiple schema" discussion.
This will add just a few minutes while creating users but may save a lot of maintenance time later.
If your applications are very different it may be better to have separate databases for them.
This is one of the main differences between Oracle and (say) MS SQL Server or MySQL.
Also one small note for the multiple schemas approach - put different applications data into separate tablespaces.
