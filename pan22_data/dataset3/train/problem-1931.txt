Having looked around the Microsoft Web Farm Framework seems the best solution for this, however I'm not sure if this plays nicely (or duplicates functionality) of the HAProxy level in front of it?
IIS 7 and 7.5 have a feature called Shared Configuration.
Application Request Routing (ARR) would duplicate the functionality of haproxy - Web Farm Framework 2.0 (WFF) is a platform- and content synchronization tool.
This happens because the hardware load balancers know the individual names of the webservers involved, whereas if you were relying on the Windows NLB you'd access the farm using a virtual server name - and the content would be served up by any one of the servers in the farm.
if I change a setting on one, then within a matter of moments, the second should be automatically updated).
You definitely need to check, but the hardware loadbalancing technologies I've used have always ignored any native Windows web load balancing (such as NLB).
Web Farm Framework or just WebDeploy/MSDeploy with a command-line sync would probably do the job.
Note: DFSR requires the servers being in an Active Directory Domain.
It works very well in combination with Windows Server's Distributed File System (DFS) replication and Network Load Balancing (NLB).
They can be installed together, or used separately.
I need a way of ensuring that the 2 IIS boxes are always in sync (i.e.
