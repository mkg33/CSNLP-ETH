When you are at work, have your local proxy forward everything to the business proxy, and when you are at home allow your proxy to make connections directly.
Instead of setting up another proxy at home, perhaps it would be better to install a proxy onto your laptop.
Configure all your clients that need to use the proxy at the proxy running on your local system.
If you control your own router and DNS server at home you can pull this off pretty easily.
Then add some iptables rules to redirect any requests to the IP address of your company proxy to the proxy running on the local system.
This is going to be a learning experience for you if you're not familiar with how DNS, proxies, etc work.
It seems like you should be able to setup a Linux box with a proxy between you and the Internet.
Not really, the requests are handled differently for proxied connections as opposed to direct to host connections.
If not, then you might be better off just unconfiguring the proxy when you're home.
I'm guessing that you're carrying a laptop home from work (and carrying home this proxy configuration with you).
I'm not sure it will do what you want but it is a proxy for all requests.
The name escapes me, but I am certain I saw a program somewhere that was designed just for this purpose.
