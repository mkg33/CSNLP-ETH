Data is supposedly from the European Central Bank.
I have been using the plugin below for quite some time.
The website http://www.xe.com/ucc/ has historical rate tables which you can consolidate.
This will return the exchange rate between USD and EUR for the date mm/dd/yyyy.
You can use built-in GOOGLEFINANCE function which fetches current or historical securities information from Google Finance.
You can, however, set up a sheet that imports data from an online exchange rate table like the one on the Yahoo Finance page (finance.yahoo.com > Investing > Currencies > Currencies Investing > Cross Rates).
Under Refresh Control, specify how often you want Excel to retrieve new data, or pick Refresh data when opening the file.
Click Insert > Script > Search for ECBExchangeRate
For example, we want to get the USD/JPY rate for today.
There's a Google Spreadsheet script that returns the exchange rate between EURO and a currency that you specify.
It's very comfortable for obtaining access to all major market data, including Yahoo Finance!
It uses Yahoo API and MSN money website to get live currency rates in Excel exposed as custom functions.

The data on the Yahoo Finance Page is pretty limited, but it covers the most popular currencies.
I don't believe such a function exists for Excel (at least by default).
You can then setup a VLOOKUP or INDEX/MATCH formula to get the relevant exchange rates for you.
Click the yellow arrow beside the exchange rate table.
You may use Spearian for MS Excel, http://spearianforexcel.com, to work and to download all history of any exchange rate.
