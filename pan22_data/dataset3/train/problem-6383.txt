Maybe I could invoke a script with sudo, inside such script invoke
This would be much more secure (no executing scripts from the browser - less so from the command line), faster - it can preprocess the data overnight during off-peak times rather then real time and simpler.
Without sudo, www-data (I guess that is the user when running the script) does not have permissions to access /var/log/mail/mail.log and does not count what I want.
Having them public readable is usually not a good idea.
I have a perl script that works fine with sudo and parses some logfiles at /var/log/ in Ubuntu 14.
Then check what groups is www-data in: groups www-data should tell you.
And add the previous script to visudo so that www-data could run it with sudo without asking for authentication.
Good start is to see who is the owner and group of the log files (ls -l /var/log/mail/mail.log).
It outputs stuff, but only zeroes in place of the numbers I wanted to check.
Using passwordless sudo in scripts is not a good idea.
Why not run a cron job (as root) every morning which executes
(Assuming Ubuntu - use the appropriate apache owner on the chown), and then simply execute the second part in the browser
Again, it seems it is not the "good" or the "right" way of doing it...
Putting www-data in the root group so that it can read the log does not seem right.
My question is: what should be the "good" way of doing this?
