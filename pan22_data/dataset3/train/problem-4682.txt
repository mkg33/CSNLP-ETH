If I want to make a 3D game, and I want all my textures to be 8 bit, to save RAM, that is 256 indexed colors, including "transparent", how do I choose the colors?
Easiest solution would probably be to drop all the desired colors into photoshop (or something similar), and convert to 8-bit paletted picture.
If you would like to have some creepy game you will have differente palette (gray/dark colors), then for game some casual "happy" game.
Photoshop, at least, contains variety of methods to do the conversion.
Be aware, colors presented at kuler.adobe.com are usually for web designers.
This is called the black magic art of color reduction.

There's plenty of ways to perform it, some work better than others, and all of them are wrong, as what you're doing is removing information.
If I interpret your question correctly, you want to know which 256 colors to pick to a palette to make things look good.
The end-rendering would use full colors, based on lighting, ...
I would say it depend on what kind of feeling you would like to achieve.
One common way is to place all desired colors into an octree and then reading out the 256 biggest cells; another is to do median-cut of the color space until you have 256 segments.
I think the link Sullivan provided is good, if you need Gameboy like palette.
