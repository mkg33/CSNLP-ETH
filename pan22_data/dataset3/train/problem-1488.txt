I can get by most of the time cannibalizing code from existing reports and the internet, but this one has me stumped.
I'm certain this is a matter of my ignorance of both SQL and/or general coding, but even on a team of experienced SysAdmins, I'm one of the only guys who will try to write something like this without reams of experience, and nobody has reams of experience with SQL or Queries in our team, so I'm the de facto SCCM Reporting Guy.
The most confusing part of this to me is when I add successive collections, every one after the first has the same number, and its slightly larger the more collections in the list.
If I add an OR statement, and another collection like this:
It executes, but when it does, only the first collection in the list returns its actual membership.
This is an SCCM 1610 environment, on a Server 2008R2 VM.
The difference between the bad number with three collections and the one with four collections is 49, but the fourth collection has a couple thousand members.
CollectionID XXXXXX02 does not have over 900,000 members.
Looking at the collection in ConfigMgr shows this, and I'm reasonably confident we don't have a million rogue devices in this collection.
To explain my issue more fully, here is the code for one collection:
I'm building the report in SQL Server Report Builder 3.0.
I would like to note that these numbers are not increasing by the collection count each time.
So for example, without more screenshots, if I add a third collection, the results are as follows:
I have written a report to give me the total member count on multiple collections at once.
My testing is running the execute command in the Query Designer, then comparing the results to the membership information of that collection in the Config Manager Console.
