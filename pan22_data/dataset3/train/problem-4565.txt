We are in the process of upgrading to SQL Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 with 32 GB of RAM.
Our current production system is running a 250 GB on average filesize database for a web application with no signs of performance issues.
No amount of speculation will give you as good of an answer as actually doing it.
So if your testing only needs a few rows of data, then everything will be just fine.
I have a 100 GB DB I am working on and need a sanbox envorinment.
Our setup is a SQL 2005 Workgroup running on 2003 SBS with 3.25 GB RAM
Since this is for a test environment, you might as well just try it out and see if it works to your satisfaction.
Will there be any problems starting the service once I get the large DB restored?
I am able to install SQL 2008 Ent 32-bit (trial) on XP with no issues.
However if your testing needs to run queries over all of the data then performance will be horrible as you'll be thrashing the disks.
Given that you've only got 3 Gigs of RAM installed, you've probably got about 1 Gig of memory for SQL Server to use.
How fast however depends on your working data set.
Will the database be accessible so that you can run queries against it?
The only hardware I have is a desktop with 3GB and 32bit.
3GB RAM (and about 1GB used for the OS) is not much to run SQL on.
The answer to that last one really depends on how much data you need to load into memory.
