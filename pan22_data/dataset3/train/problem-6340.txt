The addresses 00:11:22:33:44:55 and 11:22:33:44:55:66 are spoofed.
If it helps, the router in question is a Linksys WRT1200AC.
If the proxy is the only machine that can get to the internet, then you force it to be used.
I've installed an WiFi router with parental controls, MAC filtering, VPN, etc.
I block Internet for him, he tries to break out of the cage (for now I'm only blocking in a way that I myself know how to break).
He probably spoofed his MAC, but didn't change his IP using the new MAC, so they show together in your status screen.
After some days he figured out how to do MAC spoofing.
Your other option is to blacklist ALL MAC addresses, then whitelist the ones you do want to have internet access.
You may need to install a proxy if you really want to limit access.
The proxy can then have per-user authentication with whitelists, blacklists, and time-of-day limitations per-user.
Which protocol feature is it using to detect that traffic comes from the same computer that was using the old MAC?
It shows the attacker device under same entry, and all known MAC addresses from that attacker.
The thing is, my router has a "device information" page for each connected device, and it somehow knows that this happened.
