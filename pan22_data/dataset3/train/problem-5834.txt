and Cost reduction using Oracle SE and dbvisit standby
As with the other options there are some situations in which virtualization does not increase availability.
see how to configure dbvisit to manage existing standby database running SE
As an alternative to the excellent answers provided by ik_zelf and Niall, you could virtualize both severs so that both virtual boxes can run on either physical box.
This would increase availability when maintenance is required on one box or the other.
For example, it does nothing for shared storage outages, nor does it do anything for logical outages.
Similarly other active/passive clusters can be configured to provide HA for Oracle on other platforms.
See for example this redhat howto There are licensing restrictions (rule of thumb no more than individual 10 calendar days of operation on the standby node per year. )
With dbvisit you can maintain a standby database, in a very similar way as Data Guard does in the Enterprise Edition.
If the virutalization software supports a technology like VMWares's VMotion, then the virtual boxes can be migrated between physical boxes on the fly with zero downtime.
If your requirement is simply for an HA solution along the lines of dataguard (i.e using a second server in the event of DR) and you are on the Windows platform then you should take a look at Oracle Failsafe - this is a feature of SE1 (so no extra license requirement) and integrates the database and listener service with Microsoft's windows failover clustering.
While a node in a VMWare cluster going down would cause an outage, because the VMs can be brought up on the other node, availability would be increased.
The setup is very easy, support is good and the pricing is very reasonable, if not, cheap.
