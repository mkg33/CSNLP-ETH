I have seen this with particularily horrible ethernet chipsets that do crappy TCP Offloading and fail miserably at it.
seen that before, well it's really common with windows PC's to sit at 100% for no apparent reason.
Googling around I have tried some tips, none working so far such as turning off RDC (remote differential compression), turning off firewall, turning off antivirus, turning off network auto tuning.
One of my machines has started to get serious networking issues.
However connecting with vnc has no problems at all.
This is just to confirm that it is a networking issue and not a general machine issue.
Some of the symptoms that was not a problem before:
If you bring up the CPU monitor, is it idling or sitting at 100%?
Solution in my case was to disable TCP Offloading in the driver options pane, and bumping MTU back to 1500.
Log onto the machine and see how it performs over the network.
This could be a multitude of things, but in this particular case, that was my issue, and it took forever to figure out, so i thought I would mention it.
This all started to happen suddenly although I am not aware of any specific changes made to the machine.
Suggest you log in with VNC and check the event log and also check that something isn't taking up 100% CPU or more than it's fair share.
Just read a comment that you don't have physical access to the machine.
It certainly can make a difference in some instances.
As Greg has suggested, the following can sometimes help.
