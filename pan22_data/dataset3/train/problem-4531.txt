If not, do we have to select other network share system that fulfills these criteria?
But I assume you have reasons against that which aren't mentioned here.
The best scenario would be to have a local server.
You are asking for a feature called "server side copying".
It is a really new feature so you have to read the description of the latest versions of tools you could use to see if it is supported.
We have to move sometimes folders on the same VPS, and have huge amount of data.
A SSHFS and FUSE on the Office machines, accessing the files securely to the VPS.
These are both stable and heavily used network filesystems, and they don't rely on FUSE so should be more stable.
Everytime that someone copy/moves a folder inside the same VPS server using Nautilus (or similar) on the remote filesystem with the sshfs, the folder is downloaded and uploaded.
The other way may be to install a web interface for a server, something like owncloud.
If the folder contains 10Gb of data, the network suffers 20Gb!!!
The VPN ensures the traffic is safe from the untrusted datacenter and internet.
Both NFS and CIFS have security but are generally not intended to be run on a completely untrusted network.
Is there any solution to the above problem with the given constraints?
For it to work both server and client software must support it.
Setup OpenVPN on the remote server and either a whole site VPN on your office network (even most low end business routers support VPNs these days) or a VPN client on each PC.
Both are intelligent enough to move files without the two way trip over the internet.
