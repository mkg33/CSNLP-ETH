Note that the springy metal parts of the drive rails go at the front of the drive.
After, you can slide the drive into place on the rails and then re-attach the front plate.
In my experience these always came either in a bag with the case or these rails were attached somewhere on the inside of the case itself.
(In my experience they almost fit into the cage when they're on backwards, making it hard to guess what you've done wrong.)
If you do not have a case with this feature, you might look to see if the case came with any drive installation rails.
One set is higher than the other and would cause misalignment when trying to slide the drive in the case.
The locking lug was on one side and had a colored lever to unlock it.
The last antec case I used had a quick disconnect cage for the hard drives.
This can be done by removing both side panels and unclipping the tabs on both sides that hold the front on.
Now I can't slide the drive in from the front now, and even putting it in through the case doesn't seem to work.
Most optical drives I've seen have two sets of screw holes, did you try both?
Many manufacturers include case specific hardware.
