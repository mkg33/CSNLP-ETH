Combine this with a quick check of which version_number you need at omahaproxy, and you get a nice direct link to your desired "stable release" without accessing the slow snapshot lister website.
In the same way, you can use this website to get the latest stable version of Chromium for Windows, Android, Mac and Linux, from the official repository :
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bugazelle/chromium-all-old-stable-versions/master/chromium.stable.json
We don't need to find its positions and search the commondatastorage.googleapis.com any more.
For example, the current "dev release", at the point of this writing is 113143, and can be found at: http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?path=Win/113143/
http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?path=Win/ + version_number + /
The project crawl the http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html, and get all the stable chromium binaries.
As stated by Diago, you can download binary releases via the chromium-browser-snapshots repository.
Here are all the mac/linux/win stable chromium binaries:
If you prefer to use only latest stable Chromium release (or latest good Chromium build, for Windows users), check this website: http://chromium.woolyss.com/ The site is auto-updated each day.
