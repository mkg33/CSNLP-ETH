Without setting up an inline box like sysadmin1138 has, what you can do is execute a man in the middle attack against your gaming consoles, via arp-cache poisoning.
You may also be able to set a firewall rule to tee your traffic so a copy is sent to another machine.
I think dsniff will be a little simpler for this with the plain arpspoof command.
What I would do is just get a linux live CD designed for hacking such as backtrack ( http://backtrack-linux.org ), boot that up, and use the built-in tools to execute the attack, and then wireshark to analyze the network data.
Basically you are tricking your gaming consoles into thinking that your computer is the router, and tricking your router into thinking that your computer is the gaming consoles.
I think it would be possible to set it up on mac or windows, though I'm not sure how.
Install squid (an HTTTP proxy) on the MAC, enable logging, and tell the devices to use the proxy.
Remember to enable ip forwarding before executing it or you will break traffic.
So, all traffic from the gaming consoles to the router and vice-versa makes a stop through your computer first.
I believe backtrack comes with both dsniff and ettercap, both of which can do the attack.
If you are willing to replace you router firmware with something like openwrt you could probably install tcpdump.
edit: embobo's solution might be a lot easier for you if it's possible to set those consoles up to use HTTP proxies, I'm not sure if they can do that though as I've never used a PS3 or xbox 360.
Since you are running a Linksys, you might take a look at WallWatcher - www.wallwatcher1.com.
You don't need to get fancy and install a router or a bridge or set up a transparent (intercept) proxy.
If you need to see more detail then additionally install wireshark (packetsniffer) on the Mac and tell it to sniff port 80.
