Enter Microsoft they have locked down the ability to toggle Metered connections to Admin accounts so a Standard user cannot not.
Thank you very much for your help, I feel like an idiot that I didn't clock it was string!
We have a situation where a number of Reps use there iPhones as hot spots.
The fact it returns the whole Output as a String makes this job 100 times easier as I can just search the string for the text I need, rather than have to limit it to an object!
Not too much of an issue I can script this - Or so I thought!
If you run the Variable you can see the information:
What I'm looking to do is detect when an iPhone is in use as a hot spot and change a registry value to make it Metered.
However, to prevent over use of data we would like them to Set the Wifi point as Metered when using the iPhone.
All look generally OK and to some degree it does work.
I've Tried SSID, NAME, Profile - all information returned by the Netsh command, but somehow the commands retuen isn't including the information.
I've tried other bits of information and non returned a true result, even when I know it was true - so I'm assuming it's parsing the information across.
I'm assuming I'm missing something terribly obvious but I thought would return the information stored in there?
To answer some of the obvious things - all our Users use iPhone's and all are named as "User iPhone" It's not intended as a catch all, but a catch most.
However, I can't sem to pass the right information for the IF statement
