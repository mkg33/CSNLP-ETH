(Rebooting or resetting the VM is all logged in that file.
Should be easy enough to script something together in python, perl, powershell or whatever other script-language you prefer to automate all that.
The latter would be most logical, but I don't have any examples of that around at this time.
The date-time stamp on the log-file indicates when it was last closed.
Each line in the log-file has a time-stamp in "time since startup" of the VM.
Each VM usage session generates an individual log-file (located in the logs subfolder of the VM's folder).
I also don't know if 2 separate usage sessions of the same VM on 1 day end up in the same log-file or get separate files.
Older logs are retained too (not sure how many, you'll have to try it out or consult the VirtualBox manual).
So take the last time-stamp at the end of the log and substract that from the files own time-stamp and you know when the session was started.
Just backup the logs (multiple times a day if you do run more sessions per day than the maximum retention on the older logs) and you can work out the usage statistics from them.
