Since I imagine other users may have to un-mute and raise the level of Line In (at least in the most current version of Linux Mint these settings are not in the Volume Control/Sound Settings) through alasmixer, it is handy to know you can also enable loopback at the same time.
You can also enable Loopback in alasmixer if you keep arrowing to the right, although I am not sure if that change will enable it permanently.
When using the colume control applet, you might poke around to see if there is a linein-front that needs to be enabled.
Im not sure if this helps, But i came across this article a little while ago, and while not specific to your problem is about proffesional audio on linux
On some machines there are line in and mic in connections on the front as well as the back of the case, and they are selectable.
Adding this to your ~/.bashrc (or the start script of your choice) makes it persistent after each logout/logon.
