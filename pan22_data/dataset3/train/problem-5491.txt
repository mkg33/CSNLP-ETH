You need to set expectations with your management that while you can implement something given the resources and skills you have, it's probably not going to be effective and therefore a waste of your time.
What will end up happening is that you'll implement some sort of hack (your iptables posting indicates you might not have all the expertise required to do this), your users will work around it and now you've got an angry boss who demands to know why you can't do your job right.
I have been using OpenDns based dns blocking system.
and then add .facebook.com to a squid blacklist file like so:
If you are dealing with a techi users, (whom can access  facebook with an IP address), it is more difficult to do.
Any technical solution to this problem will not solve the actual problem, which is people in your office being bored and wanting to browse facebook / look at porn / whatever instead of working.
If you're the technical guy the boss has asked to do this:
If your users are clever, then your task may be difficult to fully enforce, and iptables cannot easily and reliably do what you want.
You can't effectively censor the internet without a lot of resources, expertise and control.
If the users at the office aren't so tech savvy, you can just change their hosts file, with something like this facebook.com 127.0.0.1 and add a line for the www too.
*Juristictional / local legal environment and restrictions notwithstanding.
This is a management issue, and needs to be resolved through the use of management tools, such as clear corporate acceptable internet use policies that detail clearly what is, and isn't acceptable, and what happens if they're broken.
Though most of the users in my company are not all that tech savy.
If a guy's using facebook all day rather than doing his job, don't block facebook, fire his ass*.
Since your Linux box is the gateway, why don't you setup Squid as a transparent proxy
