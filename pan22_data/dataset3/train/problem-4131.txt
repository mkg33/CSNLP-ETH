sample function: date '=left( right(A1, len('1/1/2014 10:30'), len('1/1/2014'))'

better idea is use search function to get the start and end position of the substring (only containing date) in the sampling time string, then extract month and/or day.

Better practice: contain the lab so that they can provide you the data in a better format (have sample name, date, time separated).
in some cases, trim the whitespace at the beginning and at the tail of the sampling time string is necessary.
Another idea is add new columns, and write a simple function to extract the date string from the cell containing sampling time, then sort/filter by the column(s) containing these functions.
Just some suggestions: if you can, separate the sample name and its datatiem into two columns (or three columns: sample, date, time), then use the sort/filter function provided by Excel.
