I want to know if possible to do a clean new install rather en an update to see if those two version can co-exist in the same server.
These commands can be used to download mongodb rpm and extract the files.
After extracting package contents, binary files can be used directly.
Repeat and re-use as needed with whatever version you wish, to shut it down, simply Ctrl-C the original shell (where things are hopefully still logging).
Take a look at the mlaunch tool by Thomas Rueckstiess.
I have installed a 2.4 mongoDB version and I'd like to compare against the recently released 2.6 version.
Once you download different versions of the binaries from the download page as suggested in the comments (and put them somewhere that makes sense on your system) you can then use mlaunch to start identical configurations for testing by specifying a different binary path (and data directory, port etc.
If extra tools are not what you are looking for you can achieve similar results using the internal test commands provided by MongoDB, though please note that these commands are currently considered internal for testing purposes, are not documented, and can be changed (or stop working) at any time (I have tested recently on 2.4 and 2.6 versions and can confirm that they work for those versions as of writing this answer).

For example, if you want to set up a 2 shard cluster, where each shard was a replica set, you could do the following:
