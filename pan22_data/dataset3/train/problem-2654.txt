FYI: I've noticed that ping writes to the descriptor truncated hostname jenkins-deb-builder instead of jenkins-deb-builder.service.search.km... What's going on here?
In our private network we have a Consul service discovery server (10.241.232.14) that provides a DNS interface (port 8600).
We would like to set our common DNS servers to forward some queries to the Consul in order to resolve the hostnames of dockerized services into the names of physical servers they are running on.
We added a file into /etc/dnsmasq.d providing the information about the Consul's private DNS (please note that there are some other system-wise DNS servers that are configured by DHCP: local dnsmasq instance should be aware of all of them too):

I've seen several similair questions over here, but none of them corresponds directly to our problem.
So we have Ubuntu 14.10 on our desktops with dnsmasq preinstalled.
After dnsmasq's restart we are able to perform name lookups with such standard tools as dig, nslookup or host:
