You send a trigger pulse of 10Âµs or more on the trigger line.
Unfortunately, I am not sure how to use it on a Raspberry Pi.

Shortly after the trigger line goes low the echo line will go high.
It has exactly the same programming interface as the HC-SR04.

The echo line high time is the time the sound took to travel to the detected object and back.
More Information and specifications about the module can be found here :
The main reason that i want to try this module over the HC-SR04, is because the JSN-SR04T is waterproof, which is what I need.
I am not sure how to connect it, and how to program it using Python.
The echo line will stay high until the echo has returned (or the echo times out).
If someone is able to help me, on how to properly connect and program this module using python, on the Raspberry Pi, please post below, and this will help me a lot.
I want to try out JSN-SR04T, which is an ultrasonic distance measuring module, that is also supposedly water proof.
