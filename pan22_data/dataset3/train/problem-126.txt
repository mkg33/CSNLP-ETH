All access to the servers is gated through ssh auth principals (currently cygwin SSH, soon to be Win32-OpenSSH).
Might as well set "User cannot change password" and "Password never expires" too for best results.
Bask in your newly enabled password-less RDP glory.
Fire up secpol.msc and navigate "Local Policies" > "Security Options".
I would really like to keep the password for the Windows machine "hidden".
I am running a number of Windows VMs and I would like engineers to be able to remote desktop into them without a password.
Change the setting "Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only" to "Disabled".
Add these accounts to the local group "Remote Desktop Users".
Ignore those creeping thoughts deep in the back of your mind that say "Maybe this isn't a great idea."
Grin mildly as you feel a sense of accomplishment.
These machines are not on a domain but are managed by chef.
In order to remote desktop you need to ssh -L 3389:localhost:3389 $vm and then connect to your local machine on port 3389.
