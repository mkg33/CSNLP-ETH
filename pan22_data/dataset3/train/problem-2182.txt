Although the old tile starts putty it still opens just the main page.
The new pinned putty after installing 0.67 will open the recent connections ok.
Since I only use one putty session every time, I deleted the original putty taskbar pin.
To fix it you do not only have to install the later Putty version 0.66 or 067, but you have to recreate a new tile in the start menu (pin to the start menu).
Right-click on this shortcut and select properties.
In the Target field, at the end append “-load putty-session-name”
Right-click the shortcut again and choose "Pin to Taskbar"
If you find yourself in the same boat as me, which is that updated versions of PuTTy do not fix this issue, you can use the following workaround that I found here:
If you have multiple connections you want to pin, then you would repeat the above steps for each one and would probably want to change the shortcut icons for each to differentiate.
This will be an additional putty taskbar item if you already had the standard putty pinned to taskbar.

You can now delete or move the shortcut, if you wish
