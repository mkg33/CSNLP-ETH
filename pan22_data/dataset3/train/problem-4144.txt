To SQ learn F over the uniform distribution U one only needs to learn majorities (which is easy) to find \phi and then find y.
Let \phi  a binary encoding of a SAT instance and y be its lexicographically first satisfying assignment (or 0^n is the instance is unsatisfiable).
Let F be the class of functions obtained in this way.
The reason for this, naturally, is that parities are essentially "invisible" to SQs and hence it is necessary to solve SAT to learn F.
Now let f(\phi) be a function that over one half of the domain is the MAJ(\phi) and over the second half of the domain equals PAR(y).
On the other hand, it is fairly easy to reduce SAT to SQ learning of F (to any accuracy noticeably greater than 3/4) over the uniform distribution.
Here MAJ is the majority function over variables which are set to 1 in the string \phi and PAR(y) is the parity function over variables which are set to 1 in the string y.
At least for learning with respect to a specific distribution there is a fairly simple example of a concept class that is information theoretically SQ-learnable but is NP-hard to SQ learn.
