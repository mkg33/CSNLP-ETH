Any signs of leaks or bulging tops or anything similar?
Perhaps the fan only comes on when the cpu reaches a certain temperature threshold.
If so do you have an adapter to power it from one of the molex connectors?
In some cases several on/off cycles may be needed to activate the computer.
Have you tried with the IDE cables removed as well?
This will sometime delay or even abort the boot process.
Can you tell us the year in which computer was made?
As it's such an old chip, could it be that the fan behaviour continues even after a quick reboot because the heat dissipates so quickly?
I don't remember P133 ever having variable speed fans.
Since it's old PC, maybe some of the capacitors on the motherboard have failing?
If the POST messages are delayed too then it means the entire boot sequence is delayed so maybe the CPU fan starting later is in fact the effect to that and not the cause.
It's possible that they could need long time in order to start working properly.
If a floppy drive is connected (3,5inch should be enough for a vintage pentium pc :-), check if the connector is upside down.
This could be the problem if the screen stays blank until the beep sound.
