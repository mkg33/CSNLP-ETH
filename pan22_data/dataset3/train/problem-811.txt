The jasper authors added some smart system to make the Wifi setup easier.
If you are using the Jasper image rather 'by accident', just get a regular raspbian image.
I am guessing that since you tried the configuration manually, at each boot your raspi is reconfigured for the ad-hoc network.
This is documented rather shortly here http://jasperproject.github.io/documentation/usage/.
If you really want to use Jasper, then you should either configure the Wifi as described in the Jasper Documentation, or find the code that reconfigures your connection and disable it (my guess would be something in  /etc/init.d).
If you don't there might be more surprises of this kind waiting for you in the Jasper image.
Then after connecting to the Ad-hoc Network, you can set-up the Wifi connection you really want to use.
They create an Ad-hoc Network on Startup (Meaning your Rpi acts as a Hotspot and you can connect to it with your Notebook/Cell Phone).
Are you using the Jasper image from the Jasper Voice control project?
