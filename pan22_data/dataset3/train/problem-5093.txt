You can usually take 1-2 seconds of start up if you disable 'Java 2 SSV helper' - i've never found a satisfactory description of what it does - the only thing i can see it do is slow down the opening of IE windows.
The finger pointing aside (as blame can be evenly divided between MS and SN) if you're having the speed issues and have SpybotSD installed, check the above references or update both pieces of software to their 'current' renditions as the problem seems to have been resolved.
Make sure that you defrag your HDD and delete temp files via CCleaner
I run 'current' versions of IE8/SpybotSD and Windows 64bit 7RC1 without problems, where I remember disabling spybotsd to get IE8 RTW functional in Vista 32bit.
With IE8's RTW release, users of the popular anti-spyware tool SpybotSD started having serious problems with IE's speed (from working as normal in the Beta and RC stages) to taking X minutes for startup and creating new tabs.
A problem was identified/highlighted by Safer Networking authors of SpytbotSD with IE8's handling of extremely large lists in the "Restricted Zones."
Disable unnessary IE plugins such as toolbars and the like.
I realize this didn't answer your question about how to improve, sorry.
For the archives (since an answer has already been accepted.)
Safer Networking's press-release references a Microsoft fix at KB969897 (released June 19th, 2009.
I was told by some people I trust that it has performance issues on WinXP systems.
