It could be that Windows is respecting file ownership and permissions on that partition, i.e.
This has the advantage of not changing anything so you have greater chance of getting the OS on the drive working again in future without reinstalling.
Perhaps you could try booting the Vista box using Knoppix of the Ubuntu LiveCD, plug the drive in via USB adaptor, and see if you can read the files that way.
You could try updating the ownership of the drive.
From there you can set the ownership flag to point to you.
Click OK until you are back at "my computer" then go to the security properties again and give yourself read access to the drive.
Another option is to plug the drive into a machine running an OS that doesn't neccesarily respect Windows ownership+perms and try to read the data from there.
The RAID controller may have overwritten the start of that partition with some information.
ownership is set to a user that doesn't exist on the second Windows setup (its local system account probably) and so on.
In XP this would be done by right-clicking in Explorer, selecting properties, selecting the security tab, then selecting the owner tab.
I would get R-STUDIO and RAID RECONSTRUCTOR/GetDataBack and run those tools to see what they can recover.
