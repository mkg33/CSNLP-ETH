They basically just added support for the copy and paste hotkeys (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, etc.)
It just happens from time to time while working with Windows 10.
Now that I almost disconnected our file server, I need to ask the question:
It seems they changed something in the clipboard functionality.
This is not the first time that this happened on Windows 10!
If a program is currently running, Ctrl+C can still interrupt it, but if no program is currently running, Ctrl+C copies highlighted text into your clipboard.
You must understand, copy & paste is one of the things I am most experienced in and I even put it into my CVs with great success!
This behavior might seem unexpected until you get used to it, but it's quite purposeful.
At first I thought that processes that I run as Administrators use a separate clipboard for security reasons, but I still am not able to reproduce this weird behaviour.
But it suddenly pasted the following line I copy-and-pasted earlier from/to our IT documentation: New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -IPAddress "10.0.0.6" -PrefixLength 16 -DefaultGateway "10.0.0.1".
I needed to verify that a certain setting has a certain value.
natively, so that you don't have to fiddle with the mouse quite as much as you used to if you wanted to copy and paste at the command prompt.
They haven't changed the way the clipboard works per se... but rather they changed the way the "Console Host" which hosts Powershell and cmd.exe works.
I ran some PowerShell commands (only Get-s), marked some of the output and right-clicked to copy the marked text.
Right-clicking can still paste it the way that it used to, but now so can Ctrl+V.
Gladly I was working on the same server the command belongs to.
So, I right-clicked again to paste the text right after | fl.
So I fired up my PowerShell as an Administrator on my local computer and entered a PSSession to our file server.
