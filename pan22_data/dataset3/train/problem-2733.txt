Are there any existing assets / tutorials / open source projects that do this, or do I need to write my own shader for it?
To simulate the ripples there are two main approaches:
I want to create a virtual fish pond similar to this in Unity (full video):
I have googled and looked at the Unity asset store, but most water assets and questions are regarding more general oceans in 3D games, and not this type of top-down clear water effect.
A full example with all of these effects gets a bit involved, but here's a quick overview of the main components you'd use:
The ocean floor and fish are not a problem, but the effect of moving water that displaces the content below the surface is a mystery to me.
And if so, what components do I need to include in that shader?
Add your colour sample from the shifted lookup into the grab texture with the reflection value you calculated and now you have a simple approximation of shallow, clear water.
Once you have the heightmap, you can infer the surface normals from its gradient.
My research has led me to believe that the effect can be achieved with shaders, however I don't know much about shaders.
