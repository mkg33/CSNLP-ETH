Note: Iron Mountain bought LiveVault, remember the John Cleese video?
I second the suggestions to shop around on pricing.
We use BackupExec, and are reasonably satisfied with it.
At my small development company, we threw out all our backup hardware & software recently and switched to the cloud with Carbonite Pro.
Everything is instantly stored off-site, it's cheap, and it's easy to restore.
Its not the most easy thing to manage at times (some tasks have to be done by scripts/powershell) but it does a great job at protecting the Microsoft workloads (SQL/Hyper-V/Exchange/etc).
For SQL databases, just set up a SQL task to back up the database to a folder, and have your backup software use that folder instead.
Pricing will be about 10-15% cheaper then what you find on this page: http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/en/us/data-protection-manager/dpm-pricing-licensing.aspx
Edit: I will add that we used Backup exec before switching to DPM.
Given the expense of a server, software, tape drives and tape, the monthly expense might make sense.
$150/server to just backup sys state/files (can't back up workloads)
We went from two backup exec installs on two separate servers to one centralized backup server with added drives for disk to disk.
$400/server to backup workloads/everything else (workloads can be SQL/Exchange/etc)
We use Data Protection Manager from Microsoft and we like it.
That said, you may wish to consider an online backup solution such as Iron Mountain.
