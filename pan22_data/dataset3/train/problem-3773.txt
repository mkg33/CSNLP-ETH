The preceding task must return success and the expression must be true.
The control flow of my SSIS package is not behaving as expected.
Your precedent constraint defaults to an AND situation.
There I have a check against my interactive mode and only attempt to display something if I can.
In binary scenarios like this, only one of those two tasks is ever going to happen.
Can anyone help me understand this, and/or point me to a good resource about SSIS Conditional Control Flow?
That results in the green dotted lines instead of solid
However, I would like to, if value == 0, continue to the MessageBox after Enable CLR on Server.
It indicates whether you're running in an environment where you can interact with the desktop or not.
As an FYI, in your Script task, assuming this runs in an automated fashion (SQL Agent), since you're using a message box, it will fail.
I also go ahead and fire an OnInformation event because that's automatically logged in the 2012+ Project Deployment Model, shows in both the GUI and the Output panel in Visual Studio/SSDT/BIDS and is easily recorded from DTEXEC.exe call by appending I to the reporting parameter i.e.
[MessageBox- Server is Configured] is never reached.
Since only one of those situations will work out, you need to swing the PC to be OR situation
By adding the next level of constraint in - both tied to the message box step, the final step is waiting for the "Enable CLR on server" to be successful as well as "CLR Enabled on Server" to be successful and for the value to be equal to 0.
If that evaluates to false and you attempt any GUI activity, the package will error out.
There's a System level variable, System::InteractiveMode which is a boolean.
If I setup my control flow to do only one or the other, it works.
