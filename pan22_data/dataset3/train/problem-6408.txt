This means that even a small drift will mean multiple meters in a second.
Is there any algorithm or math formula solving this problem?
as we know, we can make rotation by using Accel or Gyro data.
That's the main reason you need to combine 3 or more sensors to get something that even remotely resembles the actual rotation.
Is It possible to make transformation movement by using Accelerometer data or Accel + Gyro ?
The other big problem with the accelerometer is that it's in m/s², that means to get a position from this you'll need to first multiply it with the time difference to get the velocity, add that to the total velocity, then once again to get the position that you add to the total position.
If you need to measure large distances, then stick to the GPS instead.
For example, if the accelerometer outputs 0.1m/s² more, then it should and with 60fps you'll get a drift of around 3 meters in the position at the end.
I know this is still problematic and experimental.
The accelerometer is very imprecise, in fact all of them are.
