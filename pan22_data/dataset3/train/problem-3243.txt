Becasue i was checking on the router's CPU and it was quit high trying to process all broadcast arp that was going around in loops from the switch and the device.
Additionally a switch was already connected to the router.
These switch group ports act like a switch (connecting parts of the same segment) and not like a router (connecting multiple subnets).
However, it's not quite clear from your question how everything was connected.
And one of our customers connected a new device to that router.
A router does stop broadcasts (unless configured otherwise).
However doesn't the router stop the broadcast if the packet was reached on its interface.
Multiple LAN ports on a router can often be configured to be a switch group - usually you'd connect multiple clients or switches to the router without connecting the switches.
So there was only the switch connected to the router, then he connected another device which requested arp.
Of course that would cause a loop if it was in between two switches.
I was so confused as to why the router didn't stop the broadcast packet?
