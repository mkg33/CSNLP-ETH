Do I need to set something special on my user to allow him to self-update his password ?
The goal is to allow user to self-update his password on a remote Active Directory server.
If an admin sets the password of another user you can use your code:
Do I use the right method to update the password ?
MS Active Directory distinguishes two different use-cases.
I read everywhere that this function should not be used with AD servers...
In addition, I'm not the administrator of AD server (and haven't any knowledge in this).
I need to implement an "update password" feature in a Python web application (Flask).
If the user changes his own password you have to use:
When I run it, it fail on the last line (l.modify_s()) with this error:
    (ldap0.MOD_REPLACE, 'unicodePwd', [new_passwd_value]),
    (ldap0.MOD_DELETE, 'unicodePwd', [old_passwd_value]),
    (ldap0.MOD_ADD, 'unicodePwd', [new_passwd_value]),
Note : I also tried this method to update password, without success:
I don't know if the issue come from my python code or a bad configuration of my user on the directory.
Note: old_passwd_value and new_passwd_value both have to be the weird double-quoted low-ending UTF-16 encoding like in your code snippet.
