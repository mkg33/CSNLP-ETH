You'll need to install the 64-bit build, and ensure that the install DVD is booted in EFI mode (which it sounds like your system might do automatically).
Newer versions of Windows support EFI booting, so you might want to consider just upgrading.
If you've installed a legacy-boot GRUB and it's still failing to load XP, it may be that your system is still booting the EFI GRUB and never noticing the legacy one.
Since you're not going to be using EFI booting at all, you should delete your EFI system partition — this is where EFI boot applications like GRUB get installed — to ensure that your system finds no EFI bootloaders and falls back to legacy boot instead.
(Note that this doesn't mean using an old version of GRUB; GRUB 2 comes in both legacy and EFI boot flavors.)
From your comment that your EFI BIOS has no "legacy mode" setting, I suspect it's automatically looking for an EFI bootloader, and then a legacy bootloader if there's no EFI one.
It's very unlikely that it actually doesn't support legacy booting.
The EFI version of GRUB can't perform a legacy boot, so you'll have to use the legacy-boot version of GRUB.
