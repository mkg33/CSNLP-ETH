I've managed to fix the problem but have no idea why this fixed the problem and would appreciate further input.
This is especially true for IIS when only IIS is sending mail through the server.
Most likely it's because your SMTP server isn't configured to accept or relay mail for the recipient's domain.
Now SPF is used when sending out-going email and should have nothing to do with the receipt of email so I really can't work out why the removal of the SPF record associated with the domain would allow me to receive emails.
To test that this wasn't just a timing issue with some other change that had been made I added back the SPF record and tested that email failed and then removed it again and tested that email then came through.
What reasons would exist for getting this error message when trying to send emails to an email account that I run on a Server 2003 machine?
550 is also the error if a account doesn't exist...maybe the mail account does not exist, or is deactivated?
If anybody has any idea why this worked I'd love to hear your thoughts.
i think 550 is mail relay is not allowed, so you not in relay list
Also, sometimes SMTP servers get configured to only accept messages from their own IP, or something similarly restrictive.
In the DNS control panel I removed the SPF record for the domain in question and now email is coming through to the account.
550 sorry, mail to that recipient is not accepted (#5.7.1)
