Answer part 1: Connecting two routers wired to create a single LAN
how can I get back the original IP range back on my second Router?
You can't have 2 devices with the same IP address on the same subnet.
Without changing the setup on the ISP's router, or doing some dodgy convoluted switching a simple router is not capable of, you can't.
my cable ISP router have address 192.168.1.1, I canâ€™t change that setting because provider lock router access.

You may be able to disable your second routers DHCP server and routing capabilities and turn it into a dumb switch - but you will still need to change forwarding in the cable router.
All port forwards are automatically disabled because of this also.
that IP rang change affected my NVR and IP cameras now not to be seen on the network.
Automatically my wireless 2nd router adapts and change address to 192.168.0.1, and also my DHCP address range to 192.168.0.100 - 192.168.0.199
