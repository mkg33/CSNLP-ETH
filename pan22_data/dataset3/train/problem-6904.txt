Whilst I think this may not make any difference, it might and is worth trying.
Preferable to set them to auto-download and notify for install, then carry out the install manually (I like the comfort zone of being present to see servers going down and coming back up), but if that's not feasible then a scheduled install for 3:00AM on a Monday morning might be suitable.
I found this article mentioning a registry entry which could be the culprit:

I haven't seen this one before - but something to try is to log off from Task Manager (it's one of the tabs - 'users' I think) - as opposed to using the "Start Menu > Logoff" sequence...
The logoff could trigger the postponed automatic reboot.
I would definitely consider reviewing your WSUS policy for servers.
I never saw a Windows rebooting when you really hit logoff.
Maybe it's time to think removing shutdown and restart from start menu and only leave logoff there.
