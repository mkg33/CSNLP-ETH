Re-imaging a machine would solve this of course...  An alternative is to "trick" the machine into re-initializing its language display settings by changing its locale
The initial exception, 0xc0000005, is an access violation within the library.
RichEd20.DLL is the library which enables Rich Text Editing within Outlook.
The user is running 64-bit Windows 7 Professional.
It got replaced, but the log entry for each crash looks now like this:
This is what showed up in the Application log at first:
As an aside, if this comes up with a character set that's not natively supported within windows, a re-install of the Language Interface Pack or LIP may solve the issue as well.
The client crashes both when I use the reading pane and when I try to open the message without the reading pane.
Based on exception code 0xc000041d (unhandled exception in user callback, maybe a null pointer exception), it's safe to say the repair failed spectacularly probably by not linking the new library correctly.
This leads me to believe that there may have been a corruption in the language display support for the OS itself rather than only Outlook.
I have a user whose Outlook 2010 (32-bit) client crashes when attempting to view mail with Japanese text in the body.
