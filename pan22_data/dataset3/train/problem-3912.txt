I've worked on one of about 30, and one of about 50.
Personally, when there are only a few machines involved and a large number of domains, I use CNAMEs.
How many IP addresses and/or host machines you manage may have an effect.
I'd say that you can't accurately answer this question for all setups.
I run reasonably large DNS infrastructure that locally serves several thousand hosts with over 300 different domains.
When I have relatively few domains per server, I prefer A records.
Your performance profile, your available resources, the frequency with which you need to update IP addresses, and the tools available to you will all influence this decision.
Usually DNS lookups are done rarely, and are cached in the app anyway or on the requesting system.
Everything else (like services running on the server) is a CNAME.
is not so (in fact you don't really want to have the last entry!)
but then again, it is really a matter of common sense and preference, there are no hard rules.
For example, an administrator trying to squeeze the last drops of performance out of a system who rarely changes IPs or has access to a tool to easily make broad changes will have a different answer from an administrator who has more performance than time.
I keep A records to a minimum and use CNAMEs whenever possible and when it makes logical sense.
So, this 'speed up' argument is just hypothetical.
So, despite your implication that it can be answered definitively, I think it is heavily dependent on situation, resources, and (yes) personal preference.
I'm not sure what your definition of a "large" DNS system is.
Reason for not having multiple A's ais also that you'd expect (not a requirement though!!)
Rule of thumb is: A record only for the primary interface for the node, and that which need reverse resolving to it as well.
