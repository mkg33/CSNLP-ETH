So what I'm wondering is... how can the system connect the incoming IPv4 to the listening IPv6?
However, when I look at the listen, the Apache2 server looks like this:
I have another question, since the IPv6 is a local address, I would imagine I can DROP most everything in my ip6tables, correct?
Before, as I recall, I had to change the Apache2 setup to force a listen on the IPv4 address instead.
Leave the lo interface alone, but drop anything else, what would you say?
Then I setup Apache2 and attempt a load of the front page using the IPv4 address (because I did not setup the AAAA record for an IPv6, it has to be the IPv4 plus the IPv6 is local.)
So, I just setup a new server on a droplet and looking at eth0 with ifconfig I can see that the network card is setup for one IPv4 address and one IPv6 address (IPv4 changed for protection):
Some application can use v4-mapped-on-v6, supporting both protocols at once with minimum modification.
I see that the IPv6 is local since it starts with fe80.
