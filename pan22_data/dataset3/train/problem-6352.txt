There are a lot of good things to say about your program, and a few not-so-good.
And they're a pretty compact form of code, compared to the horror of str.format().
Note that this will appear to conflict with the code structure I showed above- because in that code structure, I chose to treat the result as data, not code.
Instead of calling a function named results, why not call play_once?
When doing the check for what type of action the player is doing set there input to lowercase so they dont have to get the case correct.
Your main code passes three variables to your play-game code.
But given a Yes/No question, you require a selection of either 1 or 2.
If you determine your outcome as code, go ahead and hard-code the outcome.
Don't ask a question and then interpret the answer.
I suggest you either present the Rock/Paper/Scissors options as a menu, or present the Yes/No options as a string input and look for 'y' or 'n'.
If you determine your outcome as data, go ahead and treat it as data.
However, you should replace your random.randint/if/elif/else with random.choice:
I suggest that you make this consistent with how you update the variables after each game:
The result of this is that you have a string parameter to be substituted that gives information you already knew: whether the player won or lost.
True or False are valid answers, so the code should look like:
Because you are not using a class, and are not using globals (which would be appropriate in this scenario, IMO), you are stuck with doing variable initialization here.
This should tell you that you are dealing with one aggregate data item, instead of three independent pieces of data.
In this example the code will run the paper logic if the player inputted Paper or paper
At this point, the "play one game" has also become a collection of abstract statements.
And then you pass that into your results_msg function as a string parameter.
I don't think you need to hoist the f-string up into the calling function.
In fact, you never use one of those variables without also having the others at hand.
I'm not saying you have to use data, or that you have to use code.
Similarly, you can treat the scores as an aggregate until you have to update them:
Now, starting_scores could just return 0,0,0 or it could load from a saved-game file.
Make your question-asking code handle the interpretation for you.
But it makes the initialization sufficiently abstract, and it also spells out what you are doing.
It does avoid problems with changing the text of the message, although there isn't much text in the message to change.
When I ran your code, I wanted to keep typing my answers.
That code then returns three data items in a tuple, which you unpack into three variables.
The key point I want to make is to keep neighboring statements at a similar level of abstraction.
If that's true, just treat the scores as a single item:
Because that's a detail, and your function name play_again should take care of that detail for you!
I consider the break to be equivalent in this case.
Obviously play_again is short for "do you want to play again?"
And as a side note, strings with substitutions in them make it hard to do i18n.
The while True ... break could be rewritten to use a boolean variable.
It also gives a bit more "flavor" if you customize the verbs:
I notice that when asking the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors, you allow them to type in an answer.
What's significant here is that you have an if/then statement that decides whether you won or lost.
I do think you should not pass 'won' or 'lost' as a parameter: you already decided you won or lost.
It's obvious from the code in main what is going on, but the function name doesn't really match the nature of the "step" being executed.
You have to consider that Python f-strings are code.
But notice that I'm treating scores as an opaque blob that I don't need to deal with: I just pass it along to the lower levels, with another data item describing the update to make.
I'm saying that you should pick one and stick with it.
Making the interface that much more consistent will be an improvement.
That's not super-critical, since the value of that variable is determined at only a single location.
Here are some things that I think could be improved:
In comp_play, you should return immediately instead of setting a variable to return at the end (although this is slightly controversial).
Finally, the inside of your loop has the same problem:
So there's nothing wrong with having an array of totally spelled out messages at the bottom.
Well, you are clearing the screen, showing a summary of the games played, and playing one more round of the game.
