The corresponding code is sitting in the next column over on the sheet containing my event types.
In order to import this sheet into another program, I can't have "Academic Calendar" as the Event Type, I need it's corresponding code, "et-acacal".
I've figured out a really crappy way to pull this off, by using multiple SUBSTITUTE functions (see below), but it was tedious to set up and I have to believe there's an easier way to do this.
I had to use some code to pull that off, but I found a YouTube video that walked me through it so my lack of excel coding experience didn't hold me back.
I only had 30ish different event types, what happens if I had/have 100 or 200?
To make things easy for users of this workbook, I've setup column J with data validation (pulling values from Sheet2) that allows for multiple selections of event types (Academic Calendar, Art Exhibits, etc).
Essentially I need to replace every instance of "Academic Calendar" with "et-acacal" and "Art Exhibits" with "et-artgal" as well as the various combinations of event types like "Academic Calendar, Art Exhibits" with "et-acacal, et-artgal"
