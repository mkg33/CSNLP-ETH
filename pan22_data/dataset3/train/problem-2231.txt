Since it's arriving from an infinitesimal amount of solid angle, it produces an infinitesimal irradiance $dE$.
To make that happen, the BRDF would have to be infinitesimal-valued, which...isn't a thing, in standard mathematics.
Another way to see it is that the BRDF plays a role similar to a probability density.
If we regroup the factors a bit, the combination $L_\text{incoming} \, (n \cdot \omega') \, d\omega'$ calculates the irradiance on the surface due to the light coming from the infinitesimal solid angle $d\omega'$.
It couldn't be a ratio of radiances, because we have a finite incoming radiance, and we need an infinitesimal outgoing radiance if we want to sum up many pieces of the integral and get a finite result.
The BRDF acts much like a probability density defined on the hemisphere, giving a likelihood for a photon coming in from a given direction to be reflected into some other direction.
The output value on the left is a radiance, so the result of the integral must also be a radiance.
There are a variety of equivalent ways to look at this problem, as with so many things in math and physics.
Recall that an integral means to subdivide the domain into tiny pieces and sum the integrand over all the pieces (in the limit as the pieces get infinitesimally small).
Algebraically, we can identify the units that the BRDF must have by looking at its place in the rendering equation.
So the BRDF acts as a proportionality constant between the infinitesimal irradiance arriving at the surface from an infinitesimal solid angle, and the infinitesimal outgoing radiance generated thereby.
Equivalently, the BRDF can be seen as a ratio of radiance to irradiance, since they differ by a factor of solid angle in the denominator of radiance.
For instance, a 1D probability density has units of inverse length (probability per unit length, but probability itself is dimensionless), a 2D one has units of inverse area, and so on.
The integrand contains a radiance multiplied by a solid angle $d\omega'$, so something else in the integrand has to cancel out that factor of solid angle.
The integrand should result in an infinitesimal amount of radiance $dL$, since we're going to sum over many pieces to arrive at a finite outgoing radiance.
If you look at how probability densities work, they have units inverse to the volume of their domain.
There are  a couple of ways to answer this question: an algebraic way and a geometric way.
$$dL = L_\text{incoming} \, f_\text{BRDF} \, (n \cdot \omega') \, d\omega'$$
So, like any other probability density on a spherical domain, it has units of inverse solid angle.
$$L_\text{outgoing}(\omega) = L_\text{emitted}(\omega) + \int_\Omega L_\text{incoming}(\omega') \, f_\text{BRDF}(\omega, \omega') \, (n \cdot \omega') \, d\omega'$$
The $n \cdot \omega'$ factor is dimensionless, and the only other thing there is the BRDFâ€”so to make the whole thing work out, the BRDF must have units of inverse solid angle.
Geometrically, we can get right down to brass tacks and take apart what's going on in the integral in the rendering equation.
So a single infinitesimal piece of the integral looks like:
