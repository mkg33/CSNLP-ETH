Leave the app a choice of fonts, it will pick one that fails and give you a misleading error message or no error message.
In using .Xresources, note that specs for both individual programs and CLASSES of program are possible.
When I say it "works", that doesn't mean it produces the SAME results in both apps - it does NOT - but it is recognized and acted upon.
Giving your app a general direction about a font that has a lot of asterixes in it may fail even if there ARE fonts installed and available to the app that match that wild-card spec and WILL work.
If the preview doesn't show a legible font, odds are it's a waste of time.
If there is any way to know what font package has the magic font for your app before installing and trying it, damfino it.
If the app has a command line arg for font, as this one does, experimenting with the command line is a quicker way to find what works.
After installing new font packages, some seem to be available immediately and soom seem to require a reboot.
I'm still looking for something better, but finding a better font isn't really the question I asked.
But I'll point out a few pitfalls for anyone trying to do the same thing with some legacy app so they can make their own mistakes and not repeat mine:
You will have to try specifying them more precisely to find out and trying them one at a time to find out.
