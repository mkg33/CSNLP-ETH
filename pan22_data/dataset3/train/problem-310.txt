But given that the CPU in my phone has a much lower idle temperature than the CPUs in my compute machines, I reckon the expected idle temperature depends on the CPU model.
And the CPU now happily ran at full speed for extended periods of time.
By happy coincidence I had measured its idle temperature when it was bought.
And I was right: The fan was full of dust, and the cooling paste had solidified to the consistency of rubber.
Now I am curious whether I might have other machines with bad cooling, and I really do not want to replace cooling paste on all CPUs "just to be safe".
So is there a reference to which I can compare the idle temperatures of my CPUs?
I would much rather compare the current idle temperatures to the expected idle temperature.
One of my CPUs had become sluggish: It would run at full speed for a very short time before throttling down.
After cleaning the fan and replacing the cooling paste, the idle temperature fell to around 40 C again.
Is there a list of CPU models and their expected idle CPU temperature?
It was around 40 C. Now the idle temperature was around 80 C. So I figured this could be a cooling problem.
