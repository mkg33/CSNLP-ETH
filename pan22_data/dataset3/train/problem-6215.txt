Regardless you need to set these up as a master-master pair with asynch replication (NOT master slave).
There are many ways of achieving this - but the most sensible approaches are fencing at the client or using a virtual address.
I don't follow - do you have three database servers?
And a cluster is exactly what you describe as your objective.
This avoids have to worry about promoting slaves in the event of a failure - you just need to route the traffic to the other node (it's also handy for backups and schema updates).
I'm not going to describe the process here, because space is limited and you need to understand exactly what you're doing.
In MyQL speak there is a very specific type of configuration refered to as an NDB cluster - this is probably not the right solution for you.
There's also lots of guides on the internet - but you might want to go buy a good book (just noticed that O'Reilly have brought out this one which is even more apposite).
It's only going to do this if you are using auto-increment columns or other values generated from a sequence - and mysql has specific functionality to avoid this.
If you are passing data between them then they are by definition a cluster.
If you want to add a 3rd node then add it as a slave only.
