Essentially if you have a dark grey font on a light grey background (a low contrast scan), then you tell it to "stretch" the dark grey to black and the light grey to white.
I used this to create a legible black and white PDF from a scan that was originally black text on dark blue paper (that scans as a very low contrast)
You can also try Nuance Paperport (I got this "free") with my Brother MFC scanner/printer.
This is done by setting the black/white points as follows:
It has a lot of filters in there, when exporting PDF.
This will not change the true contrast, but you can pick contrasting colors of your choice, or one of the defaults, as in the screenshot.
You can use the graphics card or monitor settings to handle this.
Now you can manually set the while/black points for finer control
It doesn't do anything for the images, but at least you can see the text on a dark background.
You can customize the color for the document text.
What I did was change the color of the text by going to edit menu, clicking on preferences and then the accessibility tab.
