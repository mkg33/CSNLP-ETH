It can backup windows machines via samba, and obviously also backs up linux/unix/macs
This won't relieve you of the requirement to get data off site somehow, but it will definitely help lower the amount of space required by your hot/live backups.
So we end up being able to restore archived data in seconds, while also maintaining off-site storage.
We have a replica SAN at another data centre that we snap and backup from.
In our old system, we had to cart tapes and disks home since every day about 200GB of files were modified.
As a result, we are able to backup everything to a remote site over a T1 in a few minutes (and under an hour on a very heavy maintenance day).
We have ~1TB of data, and backup everything nightly using custom rsync scripts.
you might want to look into backuppc, it has to run on a linux box but it stores files using hard links so if the file hasnt changed since the last inc/full then it just hard links to it (so the amount of space to store 4x full backups is vastly smaller than other backup systems)
You can get 3TB drives for well under $200 US and smaller drives for considerably less.
You are looking for a storage system that provide data deduplication: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deduplication
The nice thing about rsync is that it only copies modified bytes (not the entire modified file) ... plus it compresses the data before transferring.
Luckily disk drive space has kept up with our company growth ...
I think our total solution at both locations cost ~$1000.
Since your data is easily dividable into more manageable discrete units (project or job or whatever you choose to call it), why not just make a copy onto an inexpensive USB drive and store them somewhere?
But with rsync only the 1GB or so of modified data within these files are transmitted, and compressed down to ~200MB.
The scripts also utilize Linux hard links to maintain 30 days of full archives (not incrementals) using only 2-4TB (before compression) of space.
