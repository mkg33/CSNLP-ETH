I've set up postfix to use dkim-filter as the milter;  However, I'm getting the following in my logs:
In my experience this also happens if a mail is sent DKIM-signed, but the DNS isn't available or doesn't report the appropriate DKIM key.
Not specifically documented, but search for "resolver" on :
Chances are that your distribution has current opendkim packages available.
So any firewall blocking outgoing DNS traffic from your mail server (port 53 for both TCP and UDP should be allowed) will impede key retrieval functionality.
In order to fix this issue, I added to the bottom of /etc/dkim-filter.conf the line:
The same author who wrote dkim-filter forked it and it became the opendkim project, except now it has 2 years of bugfixes and enhancements.
The dkim-filter project has been abandoned for over 2 years now.
Please use the updated and current opendkim package to provide this functionality.
Since this is an inbound connection it means you have misconfigured your dkim filter it is trying to sign instead of verify the message and cannot obtain the keys.
