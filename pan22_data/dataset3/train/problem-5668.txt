If it is in fact code 3 (port unreachable) then there's something flaky somewhere.
Determine which by trying to do a traceroute to google.com traceroute google.com and see if that also fails.
there's likely a firewall between you and your ISP blocking ICMP communication, or your ISP is having issues.
I would almost think it's a routing loop but that would typically generate a "TTL expired in transit" response.
If that has nothing, contact your hosting provider or ISP and ask them if they are blocking ICMP outbound.
There's a misconfiguration somewhere, probably on the server or the router, as ICMP doesn't use ports but your ping response indicates "port unreachable".
You could see this if you don't have a default gateway set.
You can run a packet capture on the server and ping again and look at the ICMP code returned with the response to determine what's happening.
If so, it's likely either PING or ICMP is blocked outgoing.
Then check your software firewall - if you have iptables try iptables -L and paste the output, although Ubuntu might come with a different firewall by default.
