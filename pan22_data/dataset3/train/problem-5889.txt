Then I get the message "ZoomText was unable to activate the extended desktop on your system.
The ports themselves don't appear in Device Manager as separate devices - only the display adapter appears.
The problem comes when trying to run ZoomText with dual monitors.
We've tried the official support for the software, but they're not much use - presumably haven't encountered this problem before and prefer to lose a user who's already paid for the license than to lose the time in troubleshooting.
Dual monitors in Windows works fine; with an external monitor connected, Windows extends the desktop as expected.
