These variables might be very significant depending on the problem you are dealing with.
That makes it possible to assess whether a salary is dependent upon the region an employee lives in.
If the id's are extracted from, let's say, a employee database, they might contain information on the date when the employee started working at the company.
Depending on the format of the id's, there might be some information concealed in them.
Some creativity comes into play here, but when stumbling upon such variables, it's always worth it to look for more details and options.
But let's assume, for example, you are trying to predict mean income for employees (your sample consists of a bunch of employees of a specific company then), than you might want to transform the region codes into dummy variables.
Some more info on the problem setting would be nice.
Explore the data and try to make sense of the nature of the variables (nominal, categorical, interval, etc.).
Let your creativity flourish and i'm sure you'll have lots of fun :-).
In sum, don't look at the datatype of the variables too much when you're starting on a new problem.
