A ping response only happens if the phone is awake.
My router has reserved the first 19 ip address and I may have about a half dozen address that DHCP will assign, including my phone, starting at address 192.168.0.20.
There are checks to validate the ip address and return to the first inside loop if corrections are required.
If the Pi is rebooted and the phone is in sleep mode, multiple pings will place its ip and mac addresses in the arp table, with 100% packet loss.
the first inside loop would be to do a ping on a range of ip addresses, multiple times, that would be possible for my phone.
I just learned that the arp command is obsolete, ip neighbor is used now.
I will ping a dozen ip address once, in background mode, wait one second for response, and throw the results away as junk.
After testing, my solution would be to have two loops inside of a forever loop.
I will wait eight seconds on the arp table, and run the ip neighbor command, grep the mac address for the ip address.
With three ping 'FAILED' in a row, the phone is not at home.
The arp table will remain in the Pi, but will change states from REACHABLE, STALE, and FAILED from pings and time.
The second inside loop will ping and check the arp table every five minutes to determine if the phone is at home.
One 'REACHABLE', when phone is not at home, will make the phone return home (do something).
Why not add a reservation to your phone/s ip address and simply do a ping via a cron job every few minutes.
The router and phone will keep this same ip address unless something unusual happens.
I accomplish this on my rpi using fhem, it has a built in presence detection module that lets me set resident statuses that can be queried to influence home automation tasks.
My phone acts differently, as all phones has some difference.
