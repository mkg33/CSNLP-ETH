What I've observed is when a user realises they have local admin rights they go installing software for all their mates.
This will also wipe out any groups that were already members of the Administrators group before the policy setting was applied.
Typically you would want to grant admin rights to a specific machine only.
It's a subtle but important difference in the way the two sections work.
However, you can use the same policy setting in a slightly different way to bypass those annoyances (assuming you even consider them annoyances).
The only problem with the solution listed is that it grants local admin rights to all machines where that policy applies.
Members of this group effectively works out to be "Group A will only ever contain Groups X, Y, and Z".
So complete the steps as above but also create a group for each computer where users need additional rights.
Users are then added to the group that corresponds to the machine they need access to.
Once you've set policy with Members of this group, the only thing that can modify the group's membership is an overriding policy object that also uses Members of this group or any other policy using This group is a member of.
Izzy's answer is fine if you don't care that the Administrators group will effectively be locked out of future changes from the local machine.
This group is a member of effectively works out to be "Make sure Group A is a member of Groups X, Y, and Z".
There are a number of different ways you can do this but I might just suggest one.
Each of these "Computer Groups" is added to the myDomain\Local-Admins
