Similarly, would you want pages from the internet to be able to access all your local files?
By setting up a web server you can allow access to specific files and not others, as well as specify how things are accessed or run.
What your HTML file is possibly doing is sending HTTP requests to Localhost in order to load resources (such as Pixi.js), not actually requesting files.
XMLHttpRequests often go to this kind of dynamic content, and in this case the computer handling the request needs to know what to do with the file in order to generate the proper response.
As other answers have implied, it is a huge security risk.
If there is a webserver recommended in the tutorial, I'd use that.
There's also the python SimpleHTTPServer mentioned in another answer.
(If they didn't, then server-side scripts would be unable to run, you'd just get a copy of the file.)
This is useful behavior on a web server, as some of the things it might be requesting could be generated dynamically, differ in response to cookies, or similar.
