There is plenty of documentation around about them , but basically you set them up by:
What you describe it's not standard Active Directory behaviour, so you probably have some policy or other settings in place which is creating that; standard behaviour is for each user to have its own profile and to have it stored locally on the computer where s/he logs on, so:
This can be accomplished with the so-called "roaming profiles", which has been around since Windows NT.

Be careful with roaming profiles, as their content is fully synchronized between the server and the client at each logon/logoff, and their size can grow very quicly if your users are used to store big things in their Documents folder or on their desktops; folder redirection can help you mitigate this.

First of all, you should solve this problem, or nothing else is going to work as it should.
I would check your group policies and run an RSOP (Resultant Set of Policy) against a machine and/or user account to see which policies are getting applied.
It sounds like you may have folder redirection in place via group policy.
