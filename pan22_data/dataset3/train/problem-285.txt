It's not entirely clear to me what you want to do, but would
If you use the path to vlc palyer as debugger it will always be started instead of wmplayer.exe.
Also note that this is a very hackish approach that I would never use if there is any other way to solve your problem.
If you create a key "wmplayer.exe" as a subkey there you can then create a REG_SZ named "debugger" and specify any program to be launched whenever wmplayer is called (Details here)
In fact I would even rather replace the executable with my own vlc portable exe or something but imo the question is answerable, so it should be answered.
You can in the script of course also handle arguments and pass them on to vlc.
To prevent this you could instead use a simple script
Because it is no debugger wmplayer.exe will not be started but passed to vlc.exe which will not understand it and give an error.
Some things to consider: this will only work correctly with a direct call to wmplayer.exe.
And as debugger specify "wscript.exe <path to the script>"
The main problem with this is that wmplayer itself can have several command lines besides a media file so you would have to exclude all that are specific to wmplayer and include all the make sense for vlc which is beyond the scope of your question.
