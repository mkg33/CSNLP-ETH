NOT EXISTS requires a table scan (if not indexed) and an index scan (if indexed).
One thing you need to be wary of is that in your first statement you had IF @b > 0.
I'm pretty sure SQL server would calculate the Select * from t1 ... first, and only then check to see whether the result exists or not.
One thing you could do to compare these two versions is to rename one of them to f_old and execute them both inside the same batch, while including the actual execution plan and IO statistics.
Finally, I imagine you will find that your thoughts regarding NOT EXISTS vs.
From there, it is a simple matter of comparing the plans and IO stats of each.
If that's true, then both versions should be essentially identical speedwise.
I wonder if you could test this by running these functions on two large tables, and see if there is a consistent different in the time it takes for the functions to return?
On a small table, you will not see a huge performance gain, but it is always best to design your logic around EXISTS, as opposed to NOT EXISTS.
