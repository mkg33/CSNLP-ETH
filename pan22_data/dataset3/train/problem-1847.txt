When users first attempt to connect to the network, you can require that they authenticate using a username and password, as shown in this example image from PF's website : http://www.packetfence.org/typo3temp/pics/3623b54ba0.png
We have internet access in both LAN and WLAN in our offices which is only used to internet access.
Explaining how to set this up is beyond the scope of this Q&A site, but have a look at the Wireless Controller Configuration Guide, more specifically at the sections "Managing User Accounts" and "Managing Web Authentication"
Your Cisco 2500 WLC can authenticate wireless clients in many different ways, one of them being a captive web portal with username and password.
Unfortunately I can't exactly include a whole configuration guide in this answer, but there is good documentation available on the PacketFence site.
How do we enable a password based authentication in this infrastructure so that authenticated user will type a user name and password first to gain access to the Internet services?
I look forward how to configure one with Ubuntu Linux (preferably) and store user name and password in a database (if possible) so that the server will authenticate only those users.
Consider looking into PacketFence(.org) + FreeRADIUS.
Whenever a user will connect to a SSID the system will prompt for a user name and password.
you need Radius Server and 802.1x Enabled AP , for Radius server you have good option Microsoft Network Policy server and you need to define users on active directory integrated with your NPS
A Radius server can be used, but this might be overkill if you are only going to set it up for authentication on the wireless network.
As for (Free)RADIUS, PacketFence's administration guide has this to say :
I have read many articles on it and came to know RADIUS server can be one solution for this.
After verifying the user name and password the user will be given internet access.
