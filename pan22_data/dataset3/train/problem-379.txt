Change JRE_HOME and JAVA_HOME to point to the above example
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  22 Apr 12 23:35 latest -> /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_101
However teamcity (as of version 10) requires java 1.8.
Now go to where your tomcat is installed and go to bin directory.
I cannot seem to find anywhere that I can set a specific directory for choosing java 1.8 over java 1.7 in the teamcity configuration.
So transfer that to your host and lets load it into /opt (so as root)
So now you have java 7 in /usr/java and java 8 in /opt
This box requires java 1.7 to be installed for some of the other tools we have installed there.
How can I go about specifying the version of java for teamcity to use?
Here you see that latest & default point to jdk1.7.0_101
Next edit the file catalina.sh and the beginning has the following
In my example my tomcat is /apps/apache-tomcat-8.0.43
drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 233 Apr 12 23:35 jdk1.7.0_101
I've got teamcity 10.1 running on a ubuntu box at work.
So fare we are ok.... Now lets download latest jdk for Java 1.8.0.121. so go to https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp#lin and select one of the middle 2 linux files depending on your machine arch.
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  16 Apr 12 23:35 default -> /usr/java/latest
Next check to see if /usr/bin/java points to /usr/java/default
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 26 Apr 12 23:35 /usr/bin/java -> /usr/java/default/bin/java
If you get the RPM file that will not work well for you.
So I am not a expert with team city but know java & tomcat and the issues of different java major versions.
