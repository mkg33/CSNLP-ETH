This means that they have access to the same user database, with the same RID in place - in other word, you should encounter no problem in replicating ACLs.
My solution was to use rsync to incrementally synchronize the two fileserver, with a very brief final synchronization step during which the original share was put in read-only mode.
So you could setup a volume on the destination, and present it through iSCSI, then connect to it through your client system, and then mount the volume directly on the Windows 2003r2 box.
Moreover, rsync is a very efficient and versatile tool, and it should have no problem in incrementally copying your files.
Anyway, presuming you can't really use smb, you have two possibilities:
Before doing all that, however, really reconsider why (and if) you can't use SMB/CIFS for file transfer.
Well one method that would completely avoid SMB, but would probably be fairly difficult to build would be based on iSCSI.
Then you can use your local copy tools (ie robocopy) to do your preseeding.
The ene results were an almost perfect ACL replica on the Linux machine (some minor differences were due to how SMBACL and Posic ACLs differs).
You should really give us some more information, especially on why you want to avoid smb/cifs in the first place.
Windows 2012r2 can be an iSCSI target, and Windows 2003r2 can act as a client.
You are in a somewhat similar, but better, position: both your fileserver are Windows based, and I suppose they are in the same domain.
Some month ago I needed to migrate about 200 GB from a Windows 2003 fileserver to a new Linux+Samba setup, all without downtime.
