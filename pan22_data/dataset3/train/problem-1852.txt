I'm currently setting up a laptop for my grandparents to use.
I have so far found that gnome-volume-manager is responsible for the handy auto-mount, but I didn't find any way to set options, like always mounting drives read-only.
It lets you copy to the USB stick, then run a command and turn it into a read-only USB drive.
I also found a Lock License drive on the web (nexcopy).
It worked because the locking was done at the controller level so even a reg edit wouldn't change the status of the drive being read-only.
They have never used a computer before, so I'm trying to make this as fool-proof as possible.
So you want to create a rule file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ named, as an example, 25-usb-read-only.rules
I was looking for a read-only solution as well and found this post.
At this point I'll assume your system uses Udev and not HAL.
In order to save them the hassle of having to unmount USB drives before disconnecting them, I would like to have all USB drives auto-mounted as read-only (possible use cases for now only include them getting data from people, not them copying anything to the drive).
