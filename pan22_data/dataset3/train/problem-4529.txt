If replication is that busted, then there's not a lot of good that can come of leaving it up for any length of time - why not just turn it off, burn all memory of it from the domain (also known as a metadata cleanup) and seize any roles that it has left?
In the meantime, I'm trying to resolve an issue with group policy processing.
Strip its A record from the domain.local name in DNS, and then modify the settings on its DNS service so that it doesn't put it back.
This will only be a temporary band-aid until we are able to decommission the malfunctioning DC.
I've moved the PDC Emulator and other fsmo roles to a new DC and we're working on decommissioning the virtualized DC.
Some workstations, when attempting to process policy, are resolving "domain.local" to the IP address of the virtualized/malfunctioning DC.
We have a domain controller that was virtualized a while back; this caused issues with replication that we're now seeing fallout from.
What I'd like to do is safely remove this DC from the list of DFS servers that serve this domain (\domain.local\sysvol).
When they try to download GPOs from this DC, they are not available due to replication issues.
