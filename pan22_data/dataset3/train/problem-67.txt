This flexibility allows a configuration for a three monitor setup and then something different a netbook.
with a floating wm  YOU do the job (of the wm as some might argue).
I think the best way to understand a tiling windows manager without having used one would be this: Consider using your mouse to select a menu item and drilling into the menu to find what you want vs. using the keyboard shortcut.
Also, tiling algorithms can automatically arrange windows in a particular way that suits the task.
One might have ten images open at once, and have them arranged so they can all be as big as an efficient arrangement would allow, or a tall browser window on the left with documentation, and two wide terminal windows on the right, one to write code and one to run it and watch the output.
So one can be more efficient in managing the windows, but also be more organised with work if it involves many windows and tasks at once.
I recommend you take the plunge and try working with one it for a few months.
It makes it very easy to manage windows without needing to reach for the mouse.
so, a tiling wm could free up some time just because the windows are placed for you and you dont have to waste time placing them and keeping them "connected".
Well, if you have a smaller scren than most tiling window managers will automatically maximize all windows to the screen.
More work to learn the system to start but much more efficient from that point on.
a tiling wm places and resizes the windows (and the windows affected by your actions) on its own.
For me, the most important benefit is that I no longer need to use a mouse at all.
For my personal computers, from a desktop with a 19 inch LCD screen to my EEEPC701 with a 7 inch screen I prefer to use a tiling window manager (Awesome Window Manager).
