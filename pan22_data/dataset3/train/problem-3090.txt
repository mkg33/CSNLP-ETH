Is there any benefit of using one over the other?Known issues with a chip maybe?
According to Sparkfun TTL Voltage Levels (click here) 2V is interpreted as high: you can drive a 5V PL2303 device with a 3.3V sensor and expect to receive data.
This is fine if your sensor is read-only: if you try to drive the sensor from the PL2303, then you will need to avoid driving a 3.3V sensor with 5V.
When deciding which chipset to use to bridge in a serial signal, it is critical to ensure that you are not driving a 5V signal into a 3.3V receiver.
All are 4 wire devices so assuming them to be serial devices, I am planning to order Serial to USB converter chips.
Please suggest whether I should buy a PL2303HX or a CP2102 based converter.
I don't need any control signals to interact with my devices so either will work for me.
GPIO 14 (pin 8) is the transmit pin (TXD) and GPIO 15 (pin 10) is the receive pin (RXD).
I recently tore apart my old laptop and scavenged a few parts from it, namely a fingerprint scanner and a synaptics touchpad which I want to use with my raspberry pi.
However it seems there are quite a few options on the chips available.
Also if you have any other chip suggestions , that would be great!
