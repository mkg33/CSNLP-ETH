Is there a common or standard directory name for the company-specific stuff that exists in a server?
The usual best practice uses symlinks in /etc/* and other system areas that map back to a smaller number of company-admin directories where you keep and edit the 'real' copies.
Directory hierarchies are classic bike shed/holy war territory, and the only way to stop the battles once they start is to ask the combatants for input into your new whole-company coding standards...
The specific answer for your operating system can usually be found in the hier manual page (run man hier at any shell prompt).
The unix tradition is to keep your stuff in an appropriately named subdir of /opt/ or /usr/local/.
If XYZ Technology Corp wanted to have all the non-generic stuff in one place, would they make a directory /xyz or /home/xyz or is there an alternative directory name that is not company-specific, but intended for company-specific stuff?
Even then, there are lots of apps that ignore this standard.
(or vice versa for those few cases where the real file can't be in userland)
No, there are absolutely no standards for naming conventions beyond that which is provided by your OS vendor (or the FHS, for some subset of Linux distributions).
We could of course put crons in /etc/cron.d, put docroots in /home/webservd, scripts in one of the bin directories, but that would be messy.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Stow is an example of a similar scheme.
This would include any crons, scripts, webserver docroots, programs, non-database storage areas, service codebases, etc.
Whatever you decide to go with, just make a decision, document it well in all the possible places people might need to look for it, and then get back to doing useful work.
The only standard I'm aware of that even comes close is using /opt or /usr/local for apps installed manually vs. the platform's package manager.
