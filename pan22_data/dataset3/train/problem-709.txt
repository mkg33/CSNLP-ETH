And tcp is enabled, is there some other port i don't know about..
under TCP properties i have enabled tcp for the ip (of course this part must be owrking as if i disabled firewall it works) and the port number is left blank and dynamic ports is 0
I tried playing around with setting the port number to 1434 and setting the dynamic port as blank.
I am running my tests from my pc with NO FIREWALL and via Sql management studio.
I would check that SQL server is forced to using 1433, otherwise it might use "dynamic ports".
Have you tried specifying the executables as the exceptions in the Windwows Firewall?
Open Sql Server Configuration Manager > Sql Server Network Configuration > TCP/IP > Properties > IP Addresses
The strange thing is if i disable the windows 2008 server firewalll .. it works.
I have opened a port as 1433 on the server firewall.
And i have done all the standard stuff in sql to allow remote connections.
Can get to this instance remotely from Sql Management Studio with no problems.
Check if the rules you made (ports 1433 and 1434) are for inbound connections not for outbound connections.
Just this weekend I setup my own Win 2008 with SQL 2008 machine with these steps, things are working perfectly.
I have setup sql server express 2008 on a windows 2008 server.
I have the sql browser server running and named pipes..
