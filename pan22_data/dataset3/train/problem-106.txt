You can then navigate and download files into Android-x86 that way.
The Android-x86 image you are using in a VM probably doesn't have an app store.
This is possible under a Windows VM because VMware tools is installed within the VM.
You may have seen "drag-and-drop" functionality on Virtual Box or VMware before.
One thing you can do is run a local webserver (a quick and dirty one is mongoose) and then browse to your computer's IP on the LAN in the Android browser.
So, ask yourself, how would you get a file into Android-x86 if it was a separate system, like a phone or separate device?
Otherwise, if there is some type of app you can install to allow network access into Android, you could try that route.
You could try installing the AirDroid .apk here by browsing to it from your Android-x86 image.
If it was a phone, I'd install something like AirDroid or similar to transfer data via the web or your LAN.
When using something in a VM, you always have to remember that conceptually it's like you have a separate system.
I am not familiar with Android-x86 and if you can install the same .apk's as an Android phone or tablet.
