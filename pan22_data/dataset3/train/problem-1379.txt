This means that the problem is with groundcontrol itself; it has returned the status 2 (some sort of failure).
(Remember that on modern Linux systems, practically all devices are discovered dynamically; there is no point where it says "oh, I have all the devices, let's start init.")
(The & is also unnecessary, as systemd itself – being a service manager – runs everything in "background".)
Usually this specific problem – service failing on boot only – is caused by the service starting too early, that is, when it requires some hardware device that hasn't been discovered by the system yet.
The workaround is to order the service after the specific device (I don't know which device it needs though, so I cannot give a full answer), or use Wants= + After= to pull in systemd-udev-settle.service which waits until udev has processed the first batch of "new device" events.
The solution would be to rewrite the program to use libudev and dynamically add devices.
Also, why do you have a whole separate .sh script for the sole purpose of cd'ing to a directory?
