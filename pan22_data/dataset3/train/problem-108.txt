The root directory probably has more permissive unix file permissions, perhaps 775, which is why you're able to create new files and directories in the first place.
Make sure that the account you connect with has permission on the server side to create directories Z:\Dest_dir\
I also ran into this issue (Win 7 and 8) with robocopy and xcopy failing with error messages indicating failure to create folders, whereas copying via explorer or copy still worked.
Apparently something is going haywire with permissions when robocopy or xcopy were being used.
I was able to get this working by using the following config options:
says "NOTE: Xcopy is now deprecated, please use Robocopy."
I would suggest switching to robocopy since xcopy /?
As said above, i'd check the permissions on the server side.
Sorry to resurrect a question from the dead, but I would guess that you need to take a look at your create mask in your samba settings.
This does seem to indicate some sort of configuration issue, and this solution is rather indiscriminate, but that's all I can figure out for now.
The default is 755, so if your user account is not the owner of the directory then any new directories or files you create will not be writable by that account.
