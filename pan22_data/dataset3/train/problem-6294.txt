The Controller itself works fine, connecting it to MacOS 10.14 worked like a charm.
If they don't want to support it, why not simply say Unsupported device or something?
Trying to connect the Controller via Bluetooth to Windows 10 did not work.
Upon plug-in there was a notification telling me Windows is searching for a driver, and after a few seconds another notification telling me the device is now usable.
Searching the Internet there are lots of tutorials on how to connect a Playstation 3 Controller to Windows 10 requiring the installation of lots of software.
I've connected a Playstation 3 Controller via USB cable to my Windows 10 PC.
However, when I click on properties and click some buttons on the Controller nothings lights up, nor do the Axis react to anything on the Controller.
On the other hand, why would Microsoft implement a non-functioning driver for the Playstation 3 Controller?
The controller shows up in Game Controllers as PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller and the STATUS is OK.
I guess, if I could just plug it in and it would be working, these tutorials wouldn't be there.
