I loaded up live ubuntu to test if the problem might be in HW.
tl;nr: Computer is giving high pings to router when idle and normal pings when network is under load, it slows down our software significantly.
I tested it in the safe mode with networking, same problem there.
It slows down our client-server based programs and I have no idea what's causing it.
Fresh install, fully updated, drivers installed from included CD.
Concretely driver for RTL8168E, while (as far as I can say) the actual NIC is RTL8167.
When I start pinging router (direct 1Gb ethernet connection, 1 hop), pings start at <1ms (which is fine) and after a while they jump to 300-1000ms.
I disabled Interrupt Moderation on the NIC, didn't help.
Problem was solved by installing different driver (not the one windows installed by default, nor the one included on the CD that came with the pc).
All I could google up was that disabling Interrupt Moderation would help, it didn't though.
I also noticed that when I start using connection somehow, pings go down to 1ms, but go back up when I stop using it (tested by accessing live camera feed on LAN).
I bought new Lenovo IdeaCentre H430 pc and I'm having problem with high pings.
