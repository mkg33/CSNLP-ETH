There is 2 kind of "hidden" files ans folders: hidden and "super hidden" such as the system protected files.
It's possible to create such "super hidden" file with the command:
I have also modified the application to display (and delete) the contents of these (seemingly imaginary) folders, so I am sure they exist.
The files you're looking for may have theses "super hidden" attributes...
Keep in mind that it takes admin permissions to write to the Program Files folder.
I am using InnoSetup to install a .NET Winforms application that creates directories and folders on the fly.
(I have set the folder options to display hidden files, folders...) Although the files that are added to "created" folders appear within the application, they do not show when using Windows Explorer or even when issuing a Dir from a command prompt.
In the folder options you may uncheck the option "hide protected operating system files (recommended)" to see them.
I have Google searched for an hour now and I am confounded.
