What you will need to do is make a Live CD/USB with VirtualBox or other similar Linux VM host software pre-installed on it and also have your VM on a portable USB drive (it can even be the same drive that you are booting from).
Your biggest limiting factor in both setups will be the read and write speed of the USB drive you put your VM image on.
You then you just need to reboot the computer you want use and boot in to your Live CD/USB and start up your VM, you will be the "administrator" of Live CD/DVD's OS so the VM software can use the low level drivers that will get you good performance inside your VM.
Without admin privileges on the Host OS it will be very difficult to get high performance from your Guest OS unless the system was already pre set up to let you start your portable VM image as a non administrator.
Most cheap USB sticks do not have good write performance and I would recommend paying for a higher end one that lists good write speeds or even put it on a portable external SSD.
This can be easily done without making any modifications to the computer if the computer you are using supports booting from USB or the CD/DVD drive.
If there is no VM software already installed in the Host OS you will need to replace the Host OS.
For example if VMWare player was already pre-installed on a machine you could easily move your VM on and off the machine making it portable, and you don't need admin privileges to add or remove the VM from the player software.
