My advice - go to a local computer store and check it out.
I think this is a very personal decision and no one can really answer this.
1920x1080 on a 15" is non-sustainable for long periods of staring at the screen - it gets really uncomfortable.
You will curse yourself... if you get the 1920x1080 panel.
I don't replace it in part because I can't find that screen size anymore.
This is why the decision is yours and you need to witness for yourself and decide for yourself.
You can always adjust the text and icon sizes to fit your needs.
All things being equal, the higher resolution display will look better.
Frankly, I'd be ecstatic if I could get DESKTOP monitors that were 15" AND 1600x1200.
I don't WANT a WIDE screen laptop - it's getting too bulky - but to get a resolution even close to that (the last time I looked), I'd have to get a 17" screen.
I'd go for the high def screen, perhaps get some reading glasses.
I had a display that size that was 1600x1200 and liked it just fine, and I'm ok with my HP 2133 with a 9" 1280x768, but I'm a little near sighted, and have been know to get perscription glasses just for using the computer, so I will go a long ways for more pixels.
I have an 8 year old Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop with 1600x1200 in a 15" display.
1440x900 is a good resolution for a 15", trust me on that.
1 hour into working with it, my eyes started to tear, and I just told my colleagues that I was crying because i was broke and had no money for lunch.
Make sure the notebook has DVI/HDMI/DisplayPort out so you can always connect to a bigger LCD monitor when you need the higher resolution.
As much as I like to get high resolutions, as a consultant, I've seen plenty of people that complain about them.
Or find one with the same screen size and resolution if you can't find the same laptop.
For a period of time, I used a sony vaio tx that has a 11.1" lcd with 1366x768 resolution.
