When you discard that snapshot, an operation that should have been called "discard the ability to came back to a earlier version of this disk", all the contents of that log or journal are applied (committed) to the actual disk (which was being held unchanged up to now) and that can take very long, specially if the snapshot is old (ie.
I have a virtual windows server in VMWare Server 2.0 environment.
Anyone experiences same issue and/or knows how to fix it?
Do you have the option of switching to an ESXi host instead of VMware Server?
What type of disk(s) do you have backing this server?
You'll see much better performance with VMware running on bare metal.
When I create or remove snapshot, it takes ~30 minutes and Windows server goes completely unresponsive until operation completes.
Removing snapshots is a very IO-intensive operation (especially if you're do it while the VM is running).
I'm trying to ensure that the server doesn't go unresponsive while snapshot is being removed.
Even longer if other virtual machines are doing disk operations, which will have precedence.
When you create a snapshot, what happens is that the original disk is left unchanged and operations will be registered or logged on a file.
