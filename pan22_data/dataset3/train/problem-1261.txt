Doesn't seem to be too controversial in the subsequent discussion so it should make it into your favourite distro at some point.
In order to give permission for someone else to create in the root directory, as well.
Is it possible to disable user rights on a ext2/ext3 partition?
BTW, I've used ext2/3 on removable media myself for years but it's almost entirely for rsynced backups where the whole point is to preserve all the file metadata.
Because its User ID (UID) nor GID are the same as mine on my machine.
if I format my usb key with an extX file system, copy some files on it and then give it to a friend for him to add files or modify existing one on this key, then he is rejected by its own system.
you can chmod 777 all of the files, to remove all of the restrictions.
Funnily enough a kernel patch to do some sort of UID remapping on ext mounts "to make them actually useful on removable media" turned up very recently.
Of course, I would really like not to rely on any other file system.
This tells the system to give every file newly created/copied on the system permissions of 777, unless told otherwise(such as via cp -p).
