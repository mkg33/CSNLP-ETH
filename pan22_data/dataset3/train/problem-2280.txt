recommendation: just rent a windows vps from a reliable data center such as PEAK the same company that host SuperUser.com and StackOverflow.com check them out peakinternet.com
But I am glad that I stuck with my ISP simply because of hackers, we ordinary webmasters have no idea of their dasterdly tricks.
You can customise the pages to a limited extent, but you could add a link to another IIS website on the same server.
You can buy a preconfigured server (check out the HP MediaSmart series) or build your own.
After you do that you can use the IIS built in to the operating system, and you could use miniportal for the rest of the services such as pro/pure ftpd, httpd, dns etc...
That said, if are determined to setup your own site, then I am sure that you will learn to fend off attacks, and I wish you luck.
I hear what you say about wanting experience of running your own webserver.
From the WHS remote access web page, you can access your files, music, documents or whatever.
You could try a Windows Home Server setup - it is aimed at home users who want to consolidate files, photos, document onto a central server, but it also allows remote access via a custom domain name (yourname.homeserver.com).
A novice inernet site is to hackers like blood is to piranhas.
I recommend building something to your hardware specifications such as large hard disk and or powerful cpu.
