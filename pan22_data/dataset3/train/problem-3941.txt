Only Windows 10 OS/VM can be now join directly to Azure AD.
Here is a step by step guide for setting up a lab environment around the same idea:

Check out the (Still in preview) Azure Active Directory Domain Services.
You just change the domain under my computer as you would when joining it to a regular domain (you will need to enter the Azure AD admin credentials).

Note: Don't forget that you also need to add RDP access for the users/groups before they will be able to RDP into the VM with their Azure Accounts.
Using Microsoft Azure I have a default Active Directory domain (apparently) and I can create VMs.
You may need to configure the DNS servers if they're not set up correctly.
with this feature you will be able to join an Azure VM to your Azure AD Domain.
You need to have a local VM admin-level account and an Azure AD admin-level account.

Is it possible to join these Azure VMs to the Azure Default AD?
This is not the same as joining a typical on-premises active directory domain.
To my surprise, such VMs are not joined to the AD domain automatically and domain users can't log into it.
I was able to do this with Azure VMs (Windows Server 2012 R2).
Have any servers or computers created join the same virtual network that the domain controllers are a part of.
Keep in mind that by promoting one of the servers to a domain controller, you can then have it sync with Azure AD for the users and groups.
you will also be able to use GPOs for computer and users.
Suggestion is to build two AD controllers in Azure VMs and then have them sync with Azure AD.
for folder or RDP access) you need to use a security group (distribution lists and O365 groups, including built-in groups, will not work).
You don't need a separate domain controller or DirSync.
When we talk about Windows 10 joining the Azure AD you are only joining to see the list of applications available and authentication for the user.
