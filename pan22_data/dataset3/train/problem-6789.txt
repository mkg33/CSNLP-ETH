So I've been trying to solve the "The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission" problem and everything I've been reading says I need to get "DCOMperm.exe".
you can download it from here , see at the end of the page.

Some people say that it's part of an SDK, but I'm not sure which one.
Someone has kindly posted a genuine compiled version with batch files too.
If it's for another application/component then you can use dcomcfng to configure the permissions.
There are plenty of links to usage and download links that point to non-MS sources.
Is this for an application you're writing or for another application/component?
The source code for dcomperm.exe is included with the Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4.
I'd like to get this direct from Microsoft, but I can't find it there.
it is just that file, you don't need to download all the SDK if you need just that file.
