ErrorDocument doesn't work: http://keycraft.haydencity.net/.htaccess
I suspect the issue is that your error document definition is in the file which is being accessed.
If you didn't follow my explanation, here are links to show you what I mean:
I've been setting up ErrorDocuments for a website I'm working, and generally they've been working.
Check the file's permissions and try to make them match whatever the permissions for the .ftpquota file are.
ErrorDocument works fine: http://keycraft.haydencity.net/.ftpquota
The .htaccess file is most likely uploaded with your user permissions, allowing it to be viewed like any other file you might upload.
However, after I set the 403 ErrorDocument, I noticed that it didn't work when I tried to access the .htaccess file itself.
at the front only makes the file hidden from the standard file list, so that people don't see it listed.
When I access a different forbidden file, the Error Document appears just fine.
Have you tried placing the ErrorDocument definition in an htaccess in the parent directory?
How can I make the ErrorDocument work on the .htaccess file?
