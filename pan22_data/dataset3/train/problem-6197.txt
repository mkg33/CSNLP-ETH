It is a Pentium 4, maxed out with 2GB of DDR1 memory and a GeForce AGP video card.
It seems to me that, considering that they've said that Windows 10 is "the last Windows", that if they continue to update Windows 10 indefinitely, eventually every computer will eventually be rendered inoperable by some future update.
So a couple weeks ago I installed the Windows 10 Anniversary update to this older machine, and again, it surprisingly took it without a single problem.

In our business, we mostly just use it for data entry in Excel, and it works fine for that.
How and will Microsoft handle this responsibility to maintain the functionality of people's computers?

The technical details don't really matter, I'm just trying to set the stage here for a question about Windows 10 in general (I may make a separate technical post re: my problem).
I know there was a recent controversy with the AE disabling the functionality of many people's webcams, but at least their computers still boot.
I upgraded it a year back with a crucial SSD drive, and surprisingly it now runs Windows 10 Pro (32-bit) with decent speed and responsiveness, as long as you're only doing a few tasks.

Considering Windows 10 updates are now obligatory...  what exactly is my recourse to deal with this situation?
But just this past week, Microsoft released a cummulative update for Windows 10 v1607 and...
