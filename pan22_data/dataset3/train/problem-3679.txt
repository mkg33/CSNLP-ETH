It would not be that hard to make such a thing yourself by sawing a slice of PCB prototyping board (or just finding one of an appropriate size) and soldering pins in the right places.
I don't consider attaching jumpers directly to the pi a big deal, but I do have a case that doesn't expose them, and has only a side slot for a ribbon cable.
It is also a bit sketchy in that the bare pins are exposed on one side, meaning not safe to play with drunk in dim lighting ;)
These are for 26 pin models but there are 40 pin ones as well (e.g.
However, if you bend one row of pins to a right angle with a pliers, you can get it to span the gap.
Adafruit calls this a "cobbler", which I believe is a play on "pie" and not an actual electronics term.
I don't particularly recommend this in place of a proper breakout since it is quite a hassle to get it to fit (so much so I haven't detached it since; it is firmly attached due to the tension in the pins), but it works.
The advantage of this is that ribbon cables, pins, and breadboards are cheap and easy to find in local electronics stores.
At some point I was too impatient to mail order anything so I did the below.
In case it's not clear, the issue is that the spacing of the holes on the end of the ribbon cable isn't wide enough to span both sides of the board, so attaching the cable directly to pins means you need to use either one row or the other (or trash the pi by connecting them both on the same side).
Note they are not necessarily T shaped; some simply fit the cable end directly onto the board (an "I" shape), much like my hack job below.
I think the normative way to avoid hassles with the GPIO breakout on the pi itself is to attach a ribbon cable and put a further breakout on the end which is compatible with a common breadboard.
There are other are other similar things available -- Sparkfun also has one.
