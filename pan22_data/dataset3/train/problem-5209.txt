Linux likely just ignores BIOS settings, bypasses the RAID setup and accesses the ports directly, breaking whatever RAID you've built in BIOS.
Host RAID realizes its function by a combination of port hardware (less) and driver (more).
With Linux, I wouldn't use host RAID at all (switch SATA ports to AHCI in BIOS) but an mdadm software RAID.
However, please really pay attention on what HW RAID means in this context.
Intel's chipsets RAID feature require basically no dedicated hardware.
As a side note, I generally completely avoid those firmware-level fakeraid, using instead the much more capable Linux MDRAID or ZFS mirrors.
If you see the single disk block devices exported to your OS (as in your case) you are not running with "HW RAID" turned on.
In there you should be able to determine the RAID type.
During server reboot you should be able to access the RAID utility by pressing a certain key combination.
They are nothing more than a firmware-level software RAID, with the lone advantage (in respect to SW RAID) of "masking" the single disks, presenting instead a single volume to both the system BIOS (for a bootable array) and the OS.
