It appears that the init script checks for a running MySQL/Percona server on Ubuntu by using mysqladmin --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf ping (see line 27 and 77 of /etc/init.d/mysql of the in this case percona-server-server-5.5 package version 5.5.28-rel29.2-360.precise).
Our server normally requires around 40-70 seconds to start (init of an innodb buffer pool of 97GB takes about 35 seconds alone), so naturally 'start' reports it 'dead' since the socket file is not created yet.
The /etc/init.d/mysql 'start' function has the following (starting ln:112):
This works in a default new installation, but when copying over data files in setting up replication from another machine, the user configured in debian.cnf does not match anymore.
I've just increased the "10" value and that worked fine for me.
You may need to wait to have the replication process catched up and then try to restart.
On the master, just add the user like this (seems to have all privileges by default?!
One solution is to re-create the MySQL user the init scripts expect.
I know this is a bit old, but its 30/4/2015 and we had the same problem with Percona 5.6.
/etc/init.d/mysql start or service mysql start, it always times out.
Just wanted to know if there is a problem with the install because it happens all the time, not a one off error.
As a result, the mysqladmin command will fail and the init script will report the service failed, yet it just runs fine as you can see in the logs.
