You might also try a reboot after installing Xcode.
… but the "warning" message is probably misleading.
I'm trying to installed Ruby using Homebrew, the OSX package manager.
Homebrew does not work out of the box with XCode 4.3.
I manually added /Developer/usr/bin to my path, which didn't help.
Try updating Xcode to the latest version via the Mac App Store.
You also need to install the Command Line Tools for Xcode.
I had removed Xcode 4.1 and used the app store to install Xcode 4.2, so it was definitely up to date.
When I run 'brew install ruby' I keep getting the message 'Warning: XCode is not installed!'.
I was having this problem too (Brew claiming xcode wasn't installed), running 10.7.
What worked for me was simply to start the XCode app and click "OK" on "Start using XCode"...
You can do this by starting XCode and going to Preferences->Downloads->Command Line Tools and click on install.
Or get them mannually from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action.
According to the Homebrew Wiki, you need to use an Xcode version ≥ 4.1 when running OS X Lion.
