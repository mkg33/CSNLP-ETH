The policy setting is called "Turn off caching of thumbnail pictures" and is found under User Configuration –> Administrative Templates –> Windows Components –> Windows Explorer
Create a new file screen, type in the path and then select Custom Properties.
Since these files are quite common, make sure to turn off the e-mail and event log alerts when they are blocked.
In addition to local changes via the user interface or the registry, in Active Directory domains Group Policy can be used to apply the setting to all clients.
If you want to get rid of them, do this in Windows Command box:
On Windows 2003 R2 or later, you can use the File Screen Management console (inside the File Server Resource Manager) to block the writing of "thumbs.db" to particular paths.
This has the benefit of only blocking thumbnail caching on your file servers only versus blocking it on all workstations.
Follow the 2 steps to simply prevent WINDOWS from creating the THUMBS.db file  :-)
You will need to create a new file group that includes "thumbs.db" and turn on Active Screening.
You could do the same for .DS_STORE on OS X clients and whatever else is common in your environment.
A better solution is given here  (http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/what-are-thumbsdb-files-and-can-i-delete-them-windows.htm).
If your users are primarily Windows users running Explorer, you'll speed up the browsing process by pre-generating the thumbnails for them and make it easier for them to find the photograph they are looking for.
You may want to rethink deleting them, and instead consider creating them for them.
