I don't recall anything specific to a table count that is greater than 1000, but you may have been thinking of using tablespaces to spread db objects/tables over different volumes to enhance performance?
You may be referring specifically to the advice around tuning max_fsm_relations when you have lots of tables.
To alleviate this, you'll want to create a number of different tablespaces and place different tables in different tablespaces in order to prevent having thousands of files in the same directory.
But that requirement was removed in 8.4, and it's now automatically tuned for you.
PostgreSQL creates a file in the filesystem for every table; depending on your underlying filesystem, you'll eventually run into performance problems when any process (PostgreSQL included) reads the directory metadata.
I remember reading that there was a way to speed up the database once it reached more than a thousand Tables, but I cannot seem to find any mention of this on the Web with Google.
It might help to read a bit about the CREATE TABLESPACE and ALTER TABLE commands to move tables into a given tablespace.
tablespaces are covered here in the postgres docs.
we am at a point where I have more than a thousand Tables in our PostgreSQL database server.
having said this, unless there are specific performance issues you need to address, I wouldn't make the changes arbitrarily...
tables that more write heavy on a different volume to tables that are read heavy, or splitting different sets of heavy use tables over volumes on different channels)
