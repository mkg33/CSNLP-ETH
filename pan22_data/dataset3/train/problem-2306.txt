Do you guys think it might be better to go with a plain vector and use std::sort?
Now, somewhere down the line, I managed to mess up the priority queue.
It is no longer being inserted in a sorted manner.
I have updated my code quite a bit with many of your guys' suggestions.
Passed things as const when they weren't going to be changed.
I haven't done absolutely everything, but I did away with the class structure, went with the namespace structure suggested by @user673679.
Took me a little bit to fully understand it, but I typed it line-by-line and I think I got it.
I also tried to go through and update some variable names to be more concise.
I say this because I know it doesn't sort, it just inserts according to whatever priority you give it.
I passed in an almost solved board and it returned a heuristic of like 18.
We can make it a bit simpler by pre-calculating whether each value is in the correct row / column, then search down and right for conflicts:
I also implemented the linear conflict function according to your code as well.
