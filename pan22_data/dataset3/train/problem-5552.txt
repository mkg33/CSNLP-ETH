There's one built it into Windows 7 itself called Snipping Tool.
You can save the resulting clip as PNG / GIF / JPG / HTML (MHT) and also email the resulting clip from within the applet.
An extended list of freeware screen capture tools is available here.
- it works in the background, you just press the PrintScreen button and it creates the file in your folder, then you can postprocess it how you like it
You can handle and log this information using an unhandled exception handler.
Do you mean a screenshot of the unhandled exception dialog box?
- saves the file in what format and where you want it
If you're looking for something specifically for capturing information for bug reports, consider using BugShooter.
If the answer to these questions is yes, I don't see what value the image is adding that you can't already get from the exception.
It has extra features for testers, like the ability to automatically post a screenshot into a bug tracker like JIRA.
I found it while searching for a screen capture tool that auto-scrolls to get the full length of a web page.
After capture, you can use rudimentary marking tools like a highlighter / pen / eraser etc.
Features include Free form capture / rectangular capture / windows capture or full screen capture.
Click START and type Snip and it ought to show up in your list of programs.
It has three other modes (rectangle/polygon region, window, fullscreen) and you can do all your steps 1-4 directly from Ducklink.
Do you mean saving information about an unhandled exception to a location on disk, or committing said information to a SQL Server database, or sending said information to a remote location via email or some other protocol?
