Once I remove AD from this server, what happens to the directory permissions?
The process of building the 2008r2 box, adding it to the domain, and transferring the FSMO roles has already been completed.
This application has a rather convoluted set of directory permissions scattered all over the machine to make it work and these permissions are based on AD.
This step was taken to keep from having to P2V an AD DC.
Right now, I am just letting the two boxes sync everything before I move on.
The old win2k3 DC contains a custom application that consists of a database and a GUI front-end that users RDP into the server to use.
To facilitate this move, I'm replacing the old Win2k3 AD DC with a new Win2k8r2 AD DC running on an ESXi host.
We have a single server setup at a remote office and we're moving away from AD.
Before anyone asks, we intend to completely remove AD from the entire network.
The new DC was only provisioned so that we could P2V the old machine and continue running the custom database/GUI for clients.
