Your comments made me realize that IIS is not handling incoming traffic directly.
I have searched all over and can't seem to find an answer.
Unfortunately, the Secure Gateway does not support TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 though.
Is your site behind a load balancer such that the public facing URL isn't directly going to your IIS box(es)?
I am attempting to disable SSL 3.0 and enable TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 on my Windows 2008 R2 server using IIS 7.5.
After following the instructions at http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX201762, SSL3 is now disabled.
I also used IISCrypto to apply the keys with the same results after reboot.
If so, you need to make those changes on the load balancer.
I have made all the registry changes necessary and have rebooted the server multiple times, but ssllabs.com is still reporting SSL3 on with TLS1.1 and TLS1.2 off.
I did not take into consideration that the Citrix Secure Gateway was running on this server.
I have done this on all our other servers with success, but this server will not take the changes.
