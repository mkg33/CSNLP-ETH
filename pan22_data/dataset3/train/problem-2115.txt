Steam OS is perfectioning this method, and in order for it to work well, you'd need to play your game with a controller, because Steam OS will be much better able to predict your movements and thus sends commands quicker to you than normally.
However for graphical games the practical answer is no.
or you could run a counterstrike server on another computer and only run the client on your laptop.
The closest thing I can think of where it does work is if you have a game without many screen updates and run the program on a powerful desktop, then RDP/VNC/teamviewer/X11/.. to the computer running the games.
That is not so say that it is not possible, just that 99% of all commercial games are not written that way.
In some cases: Yes, you can use the resource from other networked computers to speed up tasks seemingly running on your own computers.
And very few are written in such a way that they allow this.
But as Hennes says, only a handful games support this.
Suppose there are several laptops in my house and I would like to connect them and then in one of the laptops use their hardware resources (CPU, Graphic card and etc) to play a game that a laptop lonely is not able to run it .
You can't combine the power of more pc's over the network to play a game for example, but you could stream a game that is played on a powerful pc, and control it from a weaker pc.
But that does not quite match your questionwhich seems to be focused on gamed.
Another option would be to actually exchange hardware from one pc to the other, but again, and especially with laptops, this is not gonna give a huge boost.
The best option would definitely be to look into getting your laptop replaced for a new model that actually does what you want it to do, or get a PC instead of a laptop (because a PC is overall cheaper to build/get than a laptop in comparison to getting the same performance.
