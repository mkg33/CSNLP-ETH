Ended up doing a System Restore to a week ago and it worked (for now at least).
If you're just a home user, you shouldn't have more than a couple of entries in the file (you'll probably only need "localhost 127.0.0.1").
Basically, the DNSClient is storing the wrong IP and the NIC settings are being overwritten.
Only Google related sites and Bing.com was being redirected to a viral page, which the antivirus blocked.
You have (somehow) Primary DNS suffix or Connection-specific DNS Suffix defined and enable to add in TCP/IP settings
However, I am very curious where the real cause of this is so that we can block future similar spyware.
A similar issue happened to a client of mine today.
If neither of the "ipconfig" or checking DNS settings works, you might find that the "virus" has created you a nice big Hosts file - look in %systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc (e.g.

Reconfigure (if needed) - Network Connection - Used connection (or interface)
Resetting Internet Explorer to default settings did not help.
There should be a file called "Hosts" (not Hosts.txt).
