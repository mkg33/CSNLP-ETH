Outlook, uses "Autodiscover" to find out where the user mailbox is, as long as you have Exchange server running in your network, the users will always be pointed to that server before anything.
We can't disable the Exchange 2007 server yet as mail is still migrating using MigrationWiz.
There are different stages for autodiscover, listed here according to the order Outlook uses them:
I would start with the SCP lookup method, as usually this is the default method for Outlook to find its mailbox inside a domain, you will need to disable that using the following steps:
I think this is related to internal DNS, resolving domain.com to the domain controller instead of externally.
After migrating 50 mailboxes from SBS 2008 / Exchange 2007 to Office 365, we are finding that some Outlook 2013 clients are trying to connect to the old Exchange server.
IMPORTANT NOTE: running this command will disable user access to the internal mailbox, you will need to configure each user who have their mailbox still hosted in the internal Exchange server manually.
