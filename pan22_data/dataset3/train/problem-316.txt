Another alternative which is not free but uses an MS SQL backend is Sage Act.
We personally use an internally hosted version of sugarCRM, we are utilizing MySQL, but it will work with SQL as well.
This is a bit more Sales focused (rather than MS CRM which is pretty even between sales and marketing) but last time I used it they deliberately locked you out of the SQL Server by using a random GUID as a password (I know this as we used a memory profiler to get at it!
It also has an Outlook and Word plugin available, and about a third of the cost of salesforce.com
I promised them to look into other CRM applications that use SQL Server as the backend and preferably has an Outlook plugin so you can do "CRM Stuff" directly from Outlook.
If you start on www.sugarcrm.com you'll find the windows installer for the free version hard to find!
I would look at SugarCRM as their Windows installer can use SQL Server as the backend straight out of the box.
A customer of mine have been testing a trial of MS CRM 4.0 that I installed for them, but they concluded that it might be a bit heavy for them.
If anyone knows about alternatives, I would appreciate it if you leave a link here!
Scroll down the link provided and look under Windows Installers.
I don't have personal experience with these but a couple of popular ones are Sugar CRM and Vtiger CRM.
