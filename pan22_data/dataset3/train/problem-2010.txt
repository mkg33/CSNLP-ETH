Look into event viewer on each machine for some clues.
To be sure, i suggest you reboot all the machines & try again.
Switching the router from WPA-2 to WPA+WPA2 allowed my windows 7 machines to ping each other and the home network to function again.
Either your wireless AP or your clients have a bug in how they're handling the WPA2-PSK group (multicast/broadcast) keys.
Execute tracert on the command prompt to the ip addresses & see what you get.
This is why the Wi-Fi Alliance exists, to make sure that 802.11-based products follow the specs correctly and interoperate properly.
Because of this, ARP broadcasts aren't getting through from one client to another.
Hopefully you don't have any TKIP-only clients that this excludes.
It broke when I received a new modem/router from my ISP so I imagine the issue is with the router, rather than the windows machines.
Assuming they're on the same subnet (192.168.0.xxx with a mask of 255.255.255.0), then I'd check your router settings.
Without ARP, they can't learn each others' wireless MAC addresses, so they can't address the 802.11-layer headers of the ping frames.
"Unreachable" usually means that it can't figure out where to send the ping, rather than saying something didn't respond.
Mixed mode is a little tricker than pure WPA[1] or pure WPA2, because it requires a TKIP group key but AES-CCMP pairwise (per-client unicast) keys.
Enter static ARP mappings between two machines and see if they can ping each other -- I'll bet they can.
Make sure your AP's firmware and your client machines' OS, wireless software, and wireless drivers are full up to date, in case your vendors have fixed their bugs.
If you enabled WPA2 "mixed mode", where both WPA[1]-style TKIP and WPA2-style AES-CCMP are both enabled, see if your problem goes away when you switch to pure WPA2 (AES-CCMP only).
Also, turn off any firewall so you can better isolate the issue.
