A Full format will also rewrite all sectors in order to reset all magnetic platters, thereby wiping out all data.
When you choose to run a regular format on a volume, files are removed from the volume that you are formatting and the hard disk is scanned for bad sectors.
If you choose the Quick format option, format removes files from the partition, but does not scan the disk for bad sectors.
A Quick format will only wipe out the file-system tables (MFT).
Only use this option if your hard disk has been previously formatted and you are sure that your hard disk is not damaged.
If you installed Windows XP on a partition that was formatted by using the Quick format option, you can also check your disk by using the chkdsk /r command after the installation of Windows XP is completed.
The scan for bad sectors is responsible for the majority of the time that it takes to format a volume.
There are 3rd party "Wipe Disk" tools that can really erase the data on the disk.
Files can no longer be reconstituted, except with special equipment to "peel back" the magnetic layers, which is only in the possession of organizations such as the FBI, CIA etc.
