The problem I am facing is that during building this worked fine, I built the project and it outputted "You Win!"
My question is then, how do I check for the total number of these pickups without doing it in an update function?
But it is more a case of curiosity now more than anything.
There are multiple approaches, but the simplest is Invoke.
My guess is that because the Playerscript checks at Start() and the SpawnScript creates at Start() that the reason the number is always 0 is because at the time of checking there are in fact no "pickups" created.
I then have a script on the "Player" game object that uses OnTriggerEnter to tell when an item has been "picked up" and compares a count (the score) to the number of objects that are created:
pickupCount =  GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("Pickup").Length;
Note that it's pretty easy to make some code execute once at a later time.
I know I could just change the OnTriggerEnter() function to be something like this:
after picking up 1 "pickup", I found out this is because for some reason the value of pickupCount is now always 0.
I have a game that creates and places a random number of "pickups" on a plane at random places.
This isn't necessarily the most elegant approach to this problem, but to respond to this part of your problem:
