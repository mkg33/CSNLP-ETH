I'm trying to check if my configuration management system is running on my servers.
You can set an item zabbix[items_unsupported], then make a trigger if returned value of this item > 0.
However, hosts that are not presently running the CMS will return ZBX_NOTSUPPORTED, and I'd like to detect these as well.
The complete procedure is described in the Zabbix official documentation.
Go here:  http://www.zabbix.com/forum/showpost.php?p=85153&postcount=7
For any people still wondering, unsupported item notification is now supported since Zabbix 2.2 and involves creating a specific Action (not an Item), and include all details concerning the unsupported item in the notification.
This key should work for puppet and Debian: 'vfs.file.regmatch[/etc/passwd,puppet]'
One bright spark created an external script for use in zabbix that will tell you server by server which items are unsupported.
Check the list of internal checks in the documentation for more information.
It is pretty easy to use it to distribute a Zabbix configuration that will test if the CMS is running.
This will solve your problem where the zabbix[items_unsupported] will not.
You can set a log trigger to read zabbix server log searching by 'cms item' and 'ZBX_NOTSUPPORTED', but, if you had zabbix agent installed on machines without CMS installed, you can search by cms user or try read CMS logs in Zabbix.
