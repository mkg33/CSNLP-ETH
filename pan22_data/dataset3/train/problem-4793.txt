Perhaps use a laptop drive, as they are designed for a mix of power and reasonable speed.
If you don't need speed on the main disk power can be saved, but the really power friendly drives are slow compared to power hungry but fast drives.
SSD should save considerable power though over a spinning media drive.
Maybe you can go green by consolidating development servers, if you have 10 development machines, perhaps you can build 1 or 2 monster machines and have everything running on them.
As for RAM, if this is really a dedicated box for sql server (nothing else running) with load from only a few people, you should be fine at just 8GB.
What you want are at least 4 good (preferrably 10K SAS) disks to set up in raid 10.
A very large PSU may draw more power due to internal loss than one that is appropriately sized.

Supermicro.com has decent rackmount cases and motherboards to match.
Database are still tuned to assume traditional disks (with rotational latency) out of the box.
What I would look for is a motherboard with a real, hardware-based raid controller onboard.
Find the most power friendly PSU you can, and don't get one that is extremely large compared to what you need.
Having tons of memory is counterproductive to "going green" in general.
You'll save heat, energy and space and it will be easier to maintain.
