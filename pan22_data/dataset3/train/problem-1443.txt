There's surely more literature in this vein, but let me know first if this is anywhere close to what you meant.
(A subsequence is a generalization of a substring: there can be multiple locations in the subsequence where material was removed from the larger sequence, not just at the start and/or end.)
There's some partial progress, where the estimation of ed(A,B) is done from f(A) and B (i.e., one string, say B, is fully known).
This question has been well-studied (though by far is not solved), and is known as the question of embedding edit distance into Hamming distance ($\ell_1$).
Then you compare the first pair of A with the first pair of B etc.
The question is to have f(A) to be much shorter than the length of the original string, $n$ (otherwise, one has a trivial solution by f(A)=A).
and then build a suffix tree, it should be possible to have a pretty fast algorithm, after paying the memory and preprocessing cost of building the suffix tree.
(I might not be understanding the question precisely, so I'll try to answer questions I know to answer.)
In particular, achieving (I1) precisely is not possible, but is possible up to some approximation (i.e., we approximate ed(A,B) up to some factor):
Each packet contains the position and the character, e.g.
There's indeed some research in this vein for the edit distance with some positive and some negative results.
Here's a slightly more liberal interpretation: (I2) we produce some sketch f(A) for each string A, and we estimate the distance ed(A,B) via some calculation on f(A), f(B) (i.e., not necessarily by taking the symmetric difference).
If the only thing that can happen is that characters disappear, I think you only need to solve the longest common subsequence problem.
Here's one interpretation: (I1) you want to compute, for each string A a set f(A) such that, for any two strings A,B, the edit distance ed(A,B) is equal to the symmetric difference between f(A) and f(B) (in some sense the opposite of intersection of the two sets).
It sounds to me like your simple thing should work.
This interpretation (I2) is more general than (I1) (=easier to achieve), though we do not know of any strictly better solutions.
I may be misunderstanding your problem statement, but it seems to me that if you define precisely how errors can occur (deletion, transposition, etc.)
