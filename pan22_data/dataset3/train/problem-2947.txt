But for the use case above (developers using just one application on the Mac) I would suggest installing X11 on their PCs, and using ssh -X to start xcode on the Mac with a tunneled X11 display.
A possible solution is to connect to the computer with ssh and use CLI of Xcode, which is xcodebuild.
What you are looking for is basically a Apple terminal services equivilant.
As far as I know, it does not exist and it would not be possible to implement in standard software as it would need a change of architecture in the way OSX works.
However, all of the clients will be controlling the same login session, so that may not be suitable for what you are doing.
You can use a regular VNC client such as Chicken of the VNC to connect.
Usually there is an option in the client that you have to set to enable multiple clients (it is a checkbox in the Open Connection dialog in Chicken of the VNC).
Pricing isn't available, but it looks interesting.
Just to clarify, you can simultaneously connect multiple VNC clients to the same Mac using the built-in Screen Sharing server, and they can all control the computer.
Looking in the comments, it looks like there is a 3rd party product called AquaConnect  (http://www.aquaconnect.net/) that does what I'd like.
