You don't need to remove Lubuntu before installing Linux Mint.
If your system doesn't boot from the disk, but instead always boots from the hard disk, you have to get into the boot menu of your laptop and change the boot order.
If you get to the part where it asks whether or not you are sure that you want to overwrite the existing data on the disk, answer yes.
If the installer detects Lubuntu and suggests that it can keep it and make your system dual-boot, you can select to remove it.
So make sure you have backed up everything you want to keep.
This will get rid of Lubuntu and all of the other data on the disk as well.
Just boot from the Linux Mint installation disk and start the installation of Linux Mint.
So my lubuntu OS v. Willey 14.04 has had a melt down the initial cause was a rewrite of the chown file and has grown from there, I can currently only access the terminal or an unusable desktop, I need to know how to completely remove lubuntu using its terminal as I'm on a PC without deul boot.
And than I need to know how to install mint rather via same terminal or via the ISO disk I have preburned, please make answer s vey simple this is my first Linux and I've had it only 3 days I do not own a flash drive and am on a relatively stable wifi network, my first language is English but I live in Mexico, so my region would be that.
Unfortunately I don't know any of my other specs besides that I have 2 TB ram
The PC I'm working with is a 64 bit Intel HP notebook 15" display with Blu-ray ROM and HDMI I'm using a b and g connection.
It is often Del, F2 or F10, but could be any key or key combination.
When you turn on on your laptop, it normally will tell you what key or key combination to press to get into the boot menu.
