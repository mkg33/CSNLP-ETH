You can't change a property on the object and return the object at the same line.
(Then again, you just move the two lines from one place to another).
You need parentheses because of operator presedence.
You could make balance be a function on the coin that modifies the value and return this, then you could do coin.balance(0).
Other than that, there it is not possible to my knowledge.
You gain nothing by making it single line, and you lose readability.
As it's currently written, this function creates a pitfall: it modifies supplied object and returns the result.
If you omitted them, the comma would be interpreted as a separator between const variable definitions.
You can use the comma operator, which takes the value of the last expression.
It's not used very much, so may make the code less readable, but if you wanna make it one line, this is the way to do it in a single statement.
I suggest to modify it to be a pure function (it can be a one-liner):
There is no advantage to making this function single line.
You have two distinct operations, and keeping them separate makes the function much clearer.
