One option is to have a tiny instance set up, you provide all your developers access to this machine.
You could use something like lsyncd to automate this.
Another option would be to setup something like Puppet, which would be able to manage the authorized_keys file for you.
You can use LDAP, but you'll need to apply the OpenSSH patch and build it yourself.
A malicious person with SSH access might setup something like a reverse shell, or add various types of backdoors to the code they are working on.
Is there a way I can centrally manage the authorized_keys file on EC2, rather than having to add keys manually on each server?
They SSH into it, and the machine has an authorized ssh key that allows them access to all the other machines.
Keep in mind that just because you revoke a developers SSH key, does not mean you have removed any access they might have to that machine.
I have several remote developers and several servers on EC2.
But you also get centralized account management as well.
Yet another option is to setup a script to rsync the authorized_key file over to all the hosts when it's changed on one machine.
Would be interested to see how other people approached this.
I ended up adding back password authentication to SSH so I could just manage it with the user name and passwords on the server.
You can then use firewalls on the machines to prevent SSH logins from other IP addresses.
