Let's take some common routing protocols in use today:
And in modern networks, it just isn't important enough to bother with.
Since IS-IS seems to be making a comeback, I'll include it as well.
Link utilization and other "transient" values cause more problems than they solve.
EIGRP can optionally use other criteria, such as load, reliability and MTU size, but in 99.9% of networks, these are not used.
BGP in particular is designed to allow more administrative control over the path selection.

I know that a routing metric can take into account several statistics, for example:

What metrics are actually widely used in routing nowadays?
In other words, the metric is whatever you set it to.
BGP -- Everything else being equal, BGP uses hop count, but for BGP a "hop" is an entire autonomous system.
You as the network administrator can change them to suit your needs.
EIGRP -- uses a combination of bandwidth and total delay (also by default a function of bandwidth).
