Running a CPU that high end without it will result in a dead CPU very fast.
Thermal paste is definitely needed, they're just being cheap if they don't put any on.
Sounds wierd, the i7 should be shipped with heat sinks having thermal compound pre-applied to the base.
Most vendor-supplied heatsinks come with pads on the heatsink which do the job of thermal transfer compound.
If you want to apply some third-party paste though, make sure you remove the pads first with a little rubbing alcohol on a cloth.
The thermal pads on the bottom of the stock cooler are fine without adding any extra paste.
The money you spend on the heat transfer compound is cheap insurance to keep your processor from burning out.
I don't think that the above advice is anywhere near reality on a newly-purchased chip.
You definitely need to go get some thermal transfer compound.
The thermal compound is essential in bridging the small gap between the processor and the heat sink.
Get some Artic Silver, from the tests I've seen it's the best.
Are you sure there isn't any on the bottom of the heat sink?
There would have been a cover on the bottom of the heatsink protecting it until you installed it.
But if the chip didn't work because you've clogged up your socket with thermal grease, that's another story!
