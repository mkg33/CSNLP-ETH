In device manager, do you see anything with a yellow triangle?
If you do not have all the drivers, Bluetooth can sometimes come under Unidentified Communication Device or similar non helpful (but understandable) names.
Other than this, if you are sure your laptop has it, but neither method detects, I would possibly check that it is 100% connected and hasn't fallen out / become dislodged.
This is where Bluetooth would show up if it were installed on Win7.
Most Bluetooth devices for laptops are done through a internal USB interface, so make sure that all your USB root hubs are up to date (installed latest chipset drivers for your laptop).
Do you see a bluetooth icon in your notification area?
I would just double check with the manufacturer / specification sheet that your laptop has Bluetooth, I have seen this problem a few times where the light is shared with wifi or it comes on even if there is no Bluetooth in your laptop.
Feel like I am saying this all day long - Try a Ubuntu live cd as this has support for Bluetooth and you should be able to see independently from Windows if it works or not.
There would be a physical button in your laptop to turn bluetooth on and off.
The other place to look is in Start->Devices and Printers.
If this is not up to date, it is possible that the card is not being detected.
