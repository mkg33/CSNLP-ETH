Using Ubuntu 13.04 Server on an AWS EC2 instance with Exim4, installed with apt-get and configured with the dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config command for my domain.
I have tried searching for the local protocol that exim is referencing there,(P=local) but that has not resulted in anything for me.
I could go on with the other scenarios, but I think you'll get the point.
Here are some of the tests that I have done and the resulting logs:
Does anyone know what that log is actually saying that exim is doing there?
I am creating an exim log parser, mainly so that I have a reason to dissect and better understand exim, and I am just trying to understand what is going on here.
Sending an email from testlinuxuser@mydomain.com to testlinuxuser@mydomain.com
When I send an email (using the mail command via command line) from a user on my VPS to any other address, I have noticed that exim logs a delivery to the user that is sending the email first, and then logs the delivery to the recipient.
The very first log always says that the message is delivered to the email account that is sending the message.
I have read the exim docs and I have not found any mention of this yet.
Sending an email from testlinuxuser@mydomain.com to externalemail@gmail.com
I thought that maybe that is because it was saving a copy of the email to a list of sent emails or something.
