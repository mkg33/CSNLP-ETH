Several others have mentioned using a provider specializing in backup instead of a generic ISP.
No transaction charges and and great file-deduping.
Would recommend jungledisk with the rackspace storage.
The whole point of a generic ISP is to provide web access to the entire world including ftp, php scripts, other cgi access, etc.
It is also not on the up and up and you certainly shouldn't suggest that as a professional in IT.
The company I work for uses Ahsay, which is an enterprise backup solution backing up not only files but Exchange mailboxes, SQL servers, and more for about 50 cents per gig.
I don't want to 'name names' so to speak, if you are interested in finding a provider you can find me via my profile link on here.
I would speculate that the backup providers are more secure.
Again, I would hope that backup providers are more cautious & paranoid with respect to security.
There are various hosting providers that provide backup services for cheaper than you are being quoted.
The problem with using hosting providers is that this is against their terms of service and you can/will be terminated without notice.
