I would be great if Remmina could connect via SSH, spawn a VNC server, and then connect to GUI, all in one shot.
Today, suddenly, I noticed them and wondered if I could issue my VNC server spawning commands through there.
Finally I created an executable shell file with that command, and provided that file in the pre-connection field.
Unfortunately, the Wiki does not elaborate on that, or I am too blind to effectively search for it.
My workflow is thus: I connect to my remote machine via SSH, then if I need a GUI, launch TigerVNC server using
There is little documentation on if this can be achieved.
Now it is just stuck at the "Connecting to Host" dialogue box.
The command is run on the client machine, not the server.
waits 5 seconds for this background process to setup VNC server (to prevent remmina from connecting too early)
So I copied the above into the pre-connection box, and tried to connect.
Obviously, I am also interested in the post-command to /usr/bin/vncserver -kill :4.
post-command terminates all x11vnc servers on the remote side
I never bothered to tinker with the pre and post connection commands in Remmina connection editor.
