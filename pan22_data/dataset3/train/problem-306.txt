I've bought many products packaged for OEM, and whilst the packaging lacks the 'frills'...it's still going to be packaged.
Though I appreciate it's not a clear answer to your question (on www.seagate.com you can download a free file recovery utility that will show you things you wouldn't believe exist on all your drives - then, if you wanted to retrieve the data, you have to buy a license but chances are you will want to clean rather than retrieve the corruption).
You'll want to select the "long" format / overwrite option, of course.
Many products sold in bulk or as OEM or as budget level forgo any fancy packaging as part of lowering the price of the product.
I think common-sense suggests your gut instinct is correct, in this instance.
For cleaning / wiping a SD card, I've been reliably led to believe the official formatting utility available for free on www.sdcard.org > Downloads (Windows and Mac only) is the best utility.
This is especially true of electronics and computer products.
I'm not sure what the comment about OEM packaging is referencing.
It should not usually be considered relevant to whether or not a product is new (although sometimes it is an obvious sign).
