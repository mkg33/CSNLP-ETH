Alternatively, Foxit Reader can also be installed using Ninite, which has an automated process for avoiding optional adware.
I have heard some people say that Foxit Reader is adware.
I noted eBay shortcuts and unchecked them, and then got a rather rude surprise (take the jump to see what):
However, the installation process for Foxit Reader is deliberately designed to trick people into installing some optional adware.
What exactly does it try to do and how much can I disable?
As you can see, I don't have any boxes checked on this page...A few clicks later Though the boxes are unchecked, you've still got to click decline in order to proceed without getting the toolbar.
It also taught me to slow down during installs(even of software I'm familiar with), hitting "Next" 5 times in a row can get you something you don't want...
While I was disappointed they went that route, to me it's still the best PDF reader.
... and the installer tells me it's going to install the Foxit Search Bar.
You can avoid the installer by using Foxit Portable.
While put off, I understand the reasons and simply unchecked the options to install any toolbars, etc.
The following is an article from here, I have put it as it is in the site.
Foxit Reader can be installed without any adware if one reads every screen of the installation process very carefully to avoid any 'gotchas'.
Counterintuitive to say the least -- I'm kind of used to needing to click accept in order to continue the install process.
I tried the install twice, and sure enough -- both times I received the Ask toolbar.
This time, however, there's nowhere for me to uncheck the toolbar to prevent its installation.
After seeing the Ask toolbar offered, I chose to do a custom install -- just in case Foxit defaulted to including anything else I didn't want.
I used it for a while then got a new PC and noticed the ask toolbar crap.
Previously I used the stand-alone executable from their download page, but I don't see it now.
