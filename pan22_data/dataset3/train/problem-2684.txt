On the streaming PC I use Voicemeeter + two virtual cables but this probably won't because I reinstalled the windows yesterday and tried it without it and the problem persisted.
I also suspect that it probably does just the bugging that I need to hear the game content from the gaming PC
Without running OBS Studio I do not have a sound problem on any PC
I tried everything and so I suspect my sound card the problem was never a problem if the computers were connected via 3.5 jacks using integrated cards.
Currently I have both computers connected by fiber optic cable with the fact that on streaming computer I have only wiretapping from SPDIF-Out to Speakers and that is why I can hear the game too (AND THAT IS MY PROBLEM HERE) because it sometimes happens to me for several seconds there will be some robotic sound and the stream tends to hang.
Today I was streaming for an hour and a half and everything was going well which unfortunately does not mean that it will work just as well tomorrow but all this week I intend to test this version of windows.
And I need to get the sound from the gaming PC to streaming.
For version v1903 I tried the older version of Obs Studio and this way did not lead!
So does anyone have any advice on what to do or how to connect computers?
For me, Voicemeeter and its features are extremely important because I need to have each application separately.
What I am trying now is that I reinstalled my windows on the streaming computer and used the older version and v1607 because maybe I read somewhere that the current version of windows v1903 has perhaps some sound problems so I try this option.
Then I just think that could be the only mistake on the side of the manufacturer of sound cards that I have, whether hardware or software but if it is so I really do not know what to do with it.
Built-in sound card off on both computers in bios (maybe that's good)
