The things that would be backed up would be the config files of the servers, the database and uploaded content as these will almost always be unique and necessary.
The containers, VMs, even the webapps would NOT be backed up as these should all be uniform and constantly updated under the CI/CD principles.
I don't expect a "magic bullet" just some possible solutions.
These programs would allow for many incremental backups and finer granularity of backups and work well with CD tools like Ansible.
However, there is no clean way to recover the most recent backup in an automated way.
However, I don't know the best tools for making backups in a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) environment and doing "rolling recoveries" of systems "as you go" which is the case in a DevOps oriented system.
I would like to know what are the best backup and recovery tools used in the CI/CD environment?
Relying on some form of caching or mirroring of your content on the cluster and hope it's not corrupted is not a way to go :(
I have used tar, dump, Amanda, Legato (EMC) Networker and other backup software for making backups of systems.
Many of these backup utilities are not necessarily best suited for a CI/CD environment because of the continuous changes taking place on both the development and production environment.
Currently I use a combination of scp and tar into an archive directory sorted by date and machine.
