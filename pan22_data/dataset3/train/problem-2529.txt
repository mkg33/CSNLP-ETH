The most commonly-utilized specifications for wireless LANs (802.11a/b/g/n) use one or two different "bands" of the RF spectrum at the physical layer.
**Restrictions for Amateur Radio operators using these frequencies outside of Part 15 regulations include, but are not limited to station identification, public access, and no use of steganography or cryptography.
The channels in this band range (though not quite incrementally or in order) from 7-196.
Amateur Radio operators in the United States can run higher-powered transmitters on channels 1-8, although they are subject to some significant restrictions* when doing so.
Just as there are many more channels within 5 GHz, regulation of these channels also varies more widely around the world.
In the world of 802.11b/g, and 802.11n on 2.4 GHz, the most common channels you'll find in use are 1-11.
Legal 5 GHz channels within the United States are 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 136, 140, 149, 153, 157, 161, 165.
U.S. licensed Amateur Radio operators may also use channels from 132-165 at higher power, but again are subject to strict regulations* when doing so.
Also, according to Wikipedia, channel 14 is not allowed in "Most of [the] world" with the notable exception of Japan.
If so it could be that (There's a list of the channel numbers for different parts of the spectrum here)
For example, if you have an 802.11n 2.4 GHz-only adapter (as is common in most cheap 802.11n devices today), it is physically incapable of using the channels 7-12 on 5 GHz no matter what your locale.

It should be noted that, while some RF bands may have similarly-numbered channels, transceivers operating on one channel of one band will neither interfere with, nor receive signals from the same numeric channel on another band.
One of the primary benefits of the 5 GHz band, which is used by 802.11a and 802.11n, is that there are a lot more channels to choose from and it is therefore much easier to avoid interfering with nearby networks.
Wikipedia has a good chart, covering several countries.
However, I do not see India on the list - perhaps someone more familiar with their laws can post a local reference.
These are the channels which are legal for non-licensed, low-power usage worldwide.
Use of channels above 11 is illegal within the United States.
