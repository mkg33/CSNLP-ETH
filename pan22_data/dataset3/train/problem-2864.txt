The problem is it never remembers one's credentials.
I'm posting this question under the assumption that its (c), they don't know how to fix it.
If it were just Outlook, then I would think it might have something to do with MS Exchange.
I changed my password about 3 weeks ago, so I only have one more 1 of this inflicted pain.
Since we're all required to change our passwords every 90 days, we've all had to go through this at least 4 times.
Here's what we see when Outlook prompts us to enter our credentials after a reboot or logging in:
So, we all go through the process of reentering our new password and clicking on the checkbox.
A different state government agency handles Exchange.
Then you hope you don't have to reboot or log in again, because you're going to get the same two prompts, every single time, for about a month after you change your password.
One of the most irritating aspects of the state agency where I work is the fact that after changing your password, neither Skype for Business nor Outlook remember the password.
But since Skype for Business is involved, which for my agency means our IT group handles that, I don't know where the problem resides.
The typical behavior follows this pattern: after changing one's password, whenever you reboot or log in, Skype for Business and Outlook will both present you with a requirement to enter your password again and have a checkbox to "Remember my credentials".
This is a long standing problem that affects everyone, after they change their password.
I can only think of 3 possible reasons for why this problem never gets resolved.
And I don't see any possibility of this getting any better.
And here's what we all see when Skype for Business wants us to reenter our credentials after rebooting or logging in:
If you get the password wrong, it will prompt you immediately afterwards.
