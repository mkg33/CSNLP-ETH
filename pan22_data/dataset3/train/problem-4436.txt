Say you collect 1MM data points from four different sensors in the field giving you four sets of 250k data points.
"Sample" as a verb is the act of extracting a subset of data points from some larger body (reality or a larger dataset).
What you actually do comes down to context and what's appropriate for your intended audience, but the general answer is to use more specific words.
"Sample" as a noun usually refers to a single data point.
The only way to be less ambiguous is use more specific words than "data" or "sample".
To make it less ambiguous, establish a unique name as soon as possible for each possible definition you'll be working with.
('reality' for the set of all possibly observed samples.
Say this data is too big for some demo of a model you're testing or an analysis you're running, so you pick 100k data points evenly split across the four sensors (giving four sets of 25k data points).
'our trial dataset', or even Y for the small 100k dataset.
'Data' or 'sample' could refer to reality, the 1MM dataset, the 100k dataset, or any of the sensor-specific subsets.
Second, you sample again to decrease the size of your data set to something more manageable.
First, to gather your 1MM data points sampling from reality.
'the complete dataset', something derived from the source of the dataset, or even X for the full 1MM dataset.
