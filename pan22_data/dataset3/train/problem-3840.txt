Not a perfect solution because you have to click the "right to click" icon first and then click and paste in the password box.
The most bullet-proof way I can think of is to just temporarily disable JavaScript, then paste the password(s), then re-enable.
There is a Firefox add-on that certainly works for your example:
bypass a websiteâ€™s copy-paste restriction on Firefox:
(Firefox won't allow anymore the websites to mess with your clipboard).

I had to do this with ebay just now, because even removing the onpaste attributes didn't help (and I didn't feel like spending any more time trying to uncover/bypass whatever other blocks they had in place).
I haven't extensively tested it just yet, but I know it works on appleid.apple.com as that's the reason I wrote it.
I created a JavaScript bookmarklet that removes all onpaste events from password fields.
