(The next question can arise: For each embark what is the relative proportion of the pclass?
So, you see that 1st and 2nd class had a higher survival rate comparing to the 3rd class.
I guess it is more about "What would be the most informative (and easy readable) way to visualize one specific problem?".
Other questions can be visualized in very many different ways but what counts is how readable and informative your plot is.
For some question there are pretty trivial solutions.
I am a fan of factor plots as you can introduce lots of information into it and it is quite understandable from the first sight.
In case of titanic imagine three questions that you want to visualize.
What if a survival rate depends on the pclass and age?
Additionally you could see what is the age distribution of each class.
You could also explore another kernels to see how people visualized it.
Having a specific question in mind you can explore galleries of the libraries with their examples, for instance,  seaborn.
