But, there is more to Linux than Ubuntu/Debian and even though how much I like Ubuntu/Debian I'm always keen to look to other distros as well.
I was actually looking into Arch the other day myself and to me it comes across as a very solid and well maintained distro.
You can then continue using your Ubuntu install with a new found understanding.
Not to get you the best OS, of cource, but to bring you the new point of view at things you thought you already know.
I've been running it for quite some time (have switched to Ubuntu and Mac now).
I've used Ubuntu/Debian for years and can set up a server in no time.
It's not a distribution to use; it's something to do and then throw away once you've done the work.
In a way it reminds me of Debian but it's workings and approach are quite different.
It really helps to learn the real internals of Linux since it is pretty much a vanilla distro with not much on top but a very basic set of Tools.
They have a nice handbook, by the way: http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/
Trying out different distros is fun but, it can also be very valuable to be very good with a single distro rather than knowing bits and pieces about many different ones.
I might give Arch another, more intensive, try and really get a server up and running with it.
Only then you can tell if you can actually work with a system.
What I like about the Ubuntu/Debian community is the overwhelming amount of information that is available for these systems.
In addition to jldugger's answer, if you want to learn how things fit together, I'd recommend working your way through Linux from Scratch, which will teach you how to compile your own Linux install.
