Im just not sure if i need a bridge or a switch, or another router.
Unless you are running some very serious in-house data transmission, that will be unlikely to be any slower than having the router moved up to the 2nd floor.
I want to migrate my internet to the second floor of my house, where i will have two PCs, leaving none at the ground floor.
You'd only need to buy another router if you notice a drop in speed in wifi on the first floor, since the router will be on the second floor.
You can leave the modem where it is, you just have to connect the cable that goes to the second floor to the modem and to the router.
If you leave the router/modem on the ground floor & already have a single cable running to the new location, then to achieve your requirements with no further inter-floor wiring, add an unmanaged switch [ethernet 'hub', 1000 Base-T, $£€ 50 or so] at the end of your link cable & spur everything else from that.
Hope this helps and I hope I'm understanding you correctly.
I already have a cat5 cable (just one) going from this floor to the second one, and just the router/modem from my ISP(DSL).
Run the cables from the back of the modem to the ethenet socket in each of the computers.
If you have your router upstairs with the two computers, then all you need is connect two ethernet cables, one for each computer.
