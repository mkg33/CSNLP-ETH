You could also move your name servers and DNS zones to a registrar that has a more robust and resilient infrastructure, such as Network Solutions.
You can use any number of DNS hosters that have geographically dispersed name servers.
Once this setup is complete, you should have NS records from more than one DNS provider returned in a DNS query.
On your zone file, add a few more NS records for this provider  (preferably geographically distributed).
This way, even if a geographically-distributed, robust DNS provider goes offline, you are still online with provider2.
After the change your nameservers might look like this:
This morning, the company I work for was brought to its knees because the DNS hosting we have for our domains through our registrar (bulkregister.com) went down.
When provider1 goes down, a recursive DNS server would merely time out on the first two NS and proceed with the next one.
Look for another provider that accepts zone transfers as well.
As a variant of suggestions offered here, you can continue with your existing registrar as long as they provide the ability to make a Zone Transfer.
I'm trying to find a few options of ways to do high availability DNS hosting for a few existing websites.
To expand on the answers here, you want a geographical based DNS service with automatic failover.
I'm now being tasked with finding an alternative which will not put us at the mercy of a single DNS provider.
If self-hosting is over the top, my company has been using dnsmadeeasy.com for several years with great success.
I'm more of a programmer myself, but they've tasked me with this, so I wanted to get the opinion of people more experienced than I am.
