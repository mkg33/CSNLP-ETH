First step would be to change the date and time of the OS and see if it reboots on its own so you can narrow it down.
Turned out to be a clock issue on one of the system cards (http://communities.vmware.com/thread/9359).
Drove me absolutely mad with frustration trying to figure it out.
I had the same situation where both server-power-cords connected to the same ups.
After looking at the ups logs the reset did happen when the ups did it`s selv test - every 14 days.
Solution: Plug one power-cord into another ups or connect it directly.
A bugged/faulty system monitoring process could be doing this at specific days/hours.
Maybe BMC timer is configured for 24 hours and it is not being resetted by OS (still many BMCs try graceful shutdown first)
All I can think of is the sysrq "magic" key or a faulty kvm card if no other servers using the same UPS are experiencing the same.
Assuming you've eliminated any scheduled jobs (by changing the times thay all run at - not just looking at the logs) then top of my list would be looking at the UPS logs.
I had an IBM server that would crash every 76 days.
What exactly do you mean by the "exact same time"?
Be sure to check if anyone has experienced similar issues with the make and model server just in case.
