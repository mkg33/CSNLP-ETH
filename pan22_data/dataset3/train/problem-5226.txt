This would force the mapped drive to mount and look for the file, return an error, but the drive will be mounted.
You could get this to start at logon a number of ways - put it in a batch file and add to startup items, add it to task scheduler, or add it to the local group policy are three that come to mind (no doubt there are others)
When you map the drive (In explorer) choose to map an internet (connect to a website to share your documents) and then map as usual.
I have never delved into the differences between this method and the normal map method or between in and the normal net use x: \server\path method
Select drive letter, enter your network folder path.
A simple batch file in the startup group should do the trick -
Our samba shares are off site and on network, and it works great...
The only other odd thing we have to do is enable NTLM v1 if v2 does not respond.
you can try using a batch file to copy a non-existent file from the mapped drive to the local c:\ drive.
If your network share requires a different username/password, those can be specified too.
Sometimes it takes a moment or two after logging in for the share to reconnect.
You could try adding on logon via the 'net' command
Click on "Computer", you will see "Map network drive" button on top.
This is how we map our SAMBA shares and it maps on login.

Save as MOUNTME.BAT then put this in the startup folder.
A simple net use command is all that should be needed.
I map shares like this all the time without issue.
