In his paper, Flajolet proves that several CFL are inherently  ambiguous by showing that their generating function is transcendental (their “local behavior” around their singularities is characteristic of transcendental functions, for example, logarithmic terms appear in the expansion).
For example, solving the intersection non-emptiness problem for a context-free language and a regular language.
More generally, you should look at Analytic combinatorics.
The first two of the above references also give a survey of the mathematical and/or historical background.
Whether there are some results on solving formal languages problems using mathematical analysis, continuous mathematics.
One of the first connections is via generating functions.
The Chomsky-Schützenberger theorem states that the generating function of the number of words of a unambiguous CFL is algebraic.
Recently, a few research problems in formal language theory were solved using continuous mathematics via this connection.
It gives a beautiful connection between formal structures and complex analysis.

Lamine commented on the connection to the Chomsky-Schützenberger enumeration theorem.
