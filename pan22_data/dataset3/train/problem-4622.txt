If you can get your hands on a Windows CD, then create a BartPE CD: http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/
Windows repair basically resets the windows and windows component install to the defaults and original file versions that are on the CD.
When you put the CD in set the laptop to boot to CD.
I actually had the ntfs-3g Linux driver screw up a NTFS drive and I lost ALL data that was on that drive.
If you can't then download a live version of a Linux distro, I would say Ubuntu, but you use Linux to mount NTFS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
the L in sdL corresponds to the letter that Linux detects the drive as...ie in the above case it would be b sdb
Once you boot up the LiveCD launch a terminal and run the following commands:
Maybe you can borrow one from a friend and boot into the recovery console, from there you can rename or remove SPTD.sys from the windows\system32 directory.
I once had problems with SPTD.sys, so try this before you do anything "destructive" like repair or reformat!
Setup will run through its thing and you will then be prompted to enter the CD key, administrator password, computer name, etc.
Once in the setup screen hit Enter to setup windows then F8 to accept the agreement.
That should eliminate the driver issue if it was installed just before the last shutdown/restart
Then hit R to repair the detected version of windows.
The repair basically reinstalls windows but doesnt format the drive.
Similar idea using bartPE, you just want to move the driver to the root of your C so it doesn't get loaded and that you can restore it later just in case.
