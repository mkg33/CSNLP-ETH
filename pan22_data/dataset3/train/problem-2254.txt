I haven't done it yet, but ordering one in a day or two.
Only inconvenience is that it occupies your card reader so if you use a lot of flash memory cards you'll have to constantly swap the cards, but in most cases is a great solution.

The other option is to use the Transcend JetDrive Lite 330 which I have had since I got my MacBook a couple years ago in the 128Gb version.
Any other options (and there are almost none) like the drives MCE Tech offers are mad expensive and run for like double that.
They offer a replacement 512GB SSD option for late 2013 mid 2014 MacBook pro and Air which is for $260 and that is the cheapest option available out there, but make sure you read their instructions and follow everything carefully when replacing the drive yourselves.
It sux that this is actually a little more expensive than a 1TB M.2 SSD (amazon.com) which most PC laptops use so still paying double as a MAC user, but considering all other impossibilities around these machines in recent years - it is still a good deal!
When replacing the SSD if you have a MacBook Pro just follow the instructions here: MacBook Pro 13" Retina Display Mid 2014 SSD Replacement
It makes me really annoyed that nowadays with all the technological possibilities out there companies like Apple try in such sneaky ways to rip clients off with having adequate storage which should be a basic thing when buying a system.
Seems like the best and cheapest DIY option is the drives that Shenzhen nuofang is offering.
Transcend recently came up with a 256GB version which sells for $150 on amazon.com This way you don't have to see with hardware operations, etc.
The drive has served me well and occasionally (maybe happened 2-3 times) the computer wouldn't recognize it, but a shut down fixes that.
