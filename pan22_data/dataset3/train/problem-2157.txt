Soooooo my system boots fine, its just that I underclocked it instead of overclocking.
The equation is b * m = C. So, play around with the numbers (in a calculator!)
Probably not since I'm not much help here, and I don't even know what setting I changed.
After learning what BCLK actually was, I changed it's value to 102.38.
and see what you need to reach your desired clock.
In turn, 102.38MHz multiplied by 42 is 4300MHz, which is 4.3GHz.
Also for overclocking high numbers tend to relate to a higher overclock.
Just reset the bios and fix the boot order, it only takes like 15 seconds.
This was my first time overclocking so I learned quite a bit!
I thought I changed back the only setting I touched in my BIOS after noticing the 3.00Ghz, but it didn't change (can't remember setting name).
That would be a pain since I have 4 hard drives (boot order stuff)
The min/max CPU Cache ratio (this is our multiplier) will be 'm'.
For those wanting to know how to get to a certain clock for the first time, here is some helpful tips.
If you didn't get it before, I tried overclocking but screwed up.
Turns out, I had changed the BCLK and while keeping the min/max CPU Cache ratios at Auto.
