That is, I "unfreeze" them, Install updates, and then re-"freeze" them.
I am completely stuck, so any help would be greatly appreciated!
Whenever we try to update these machines, they act like the updates install successfully.
I have reset the SoftwareDistribution folder many times, reset the Windows Update service, run the Windows Update fix tool.
We use Deep Freeze on all of our computers, but I go around once every couple of weeks and update them manually.
Except for Windows Internet Explorer 11, which throws Error 9C57.
They claim that the Install was successful, and then the update with the same KB number pop up to be installed again.
We have several Dell Optiplex 980s that otherwise work perfectly, except one tiny hiccup.
I am the Administrator for my local Public Library.
Additionally, whenever I install only part of the updates, they will go through, only to pop back up again later.
Also, in case it's at all relevant for checking at Dell's website, my Service tag is CHC6FQ1
I have searched extensively online to try to find a solution, I know all of our computers are properly activated, and I have tried Microsoft Supports solution of manually installing updates "in order".
