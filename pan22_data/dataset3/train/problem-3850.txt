In the unlikely event you have such a device, you'll want to turn off the access-point mode, use it strictly as a WiFi client (wireless bridge), and setup the Access-point wifi on the second device, which because it is also acting as a router, will offer DHCP to your computers on a new (different network number than the pubic wifi) and perform NAT (network address translation) to it's WAN.
Then install a second router connecting it's WAN interface to the LAN interface of the first.
You don't specifically state whether the wireless devices are connecting directly to the public wifi, or to your bridge.
Set the first up as a Wireless Bridge: acts as a WiFi client connecting to the public WiFi and bridges it to the device's Ethernet ports.
You said that your current single device is serving your network and you mention wireless devices.
If the later, this would normally require two WiFi radios: one to act as client to public WiFi, and an other to act as Access-Point.
In this way, you have installed a firewall (2nd device) between your devices and the public WiFi.
Using consumer equipment, like the TP-Link, you'll need two such devices.
