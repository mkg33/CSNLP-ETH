They think you can create a GPO and link it to an Organizational Unit (OU).
Second, the only way to modify the Account Policy settings for a domain user account is within a GPO linked to the domain.
But, for a several reasons, this configuration will never provide the desired outcome.
Long story short, in a Windows 2003 domain you can have only a single password policy.
First, the Password Policy settings are computer-based rather than user-based policies.
GPOs linked to the OU that are configured to alter the Account Policies settings will modify the local SAM of computers that reside in the OU, or are in sub-OUs of the linked OU.
With this foundation for the settings, they will never affect a user account.
The idea is to move user accounts to the OU so that the GPO will affect the objects.
That said, many administrators believe it's possible to have multiple password policies for users in the same domain.
Within the GPO, the Account Policies are modified to create a more secure Password Policy, perhaps by setting the maximum password length to 14 characters.
Windows 2008 domains introduce fine-grained password policies that allow more than one.
