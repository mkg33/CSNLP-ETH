Not because I need to but just because it's the sort of thing I reckon should be possible but can't figure out how to do.
While this might be possible with a third part client I'm really only interested in whether or not it can be done with the Windows built-in client and if so how?.
If so, I can simply port forward another port to the second server.
Scenario: Two Windows Server 2003 machines running RRAS VPNs.
I've done a fair bit of Googling over the last few days and have only found others asking the same question but no answers.
I could see the TCP control channel getting redirected, but once the data flows (GRE encapsuled packets) I dont think it is possible (i.e.
Use this second IP to forward TCP 1723 to your second Win2K3 box.
Have to say, though, that I never had the need to this too.
I'd like to find a way to connect to the second machine as well.
I have of course tried to add a port number in the host name or IP connection box, in various formats, but to no avail.
The only way to do this with a PAT firewall is to bind another IP address to the external interface of your firewall.
The firewall port forwards 1723 to one of those machines for normal remote access.
The main problem i see with PPTP is the package payload (GRE packets).
Is it possible to have the Windows PPTP VPN client (on XP in this instance) connect on a port other than 1723?
