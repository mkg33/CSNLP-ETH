It seems that the MVC stack is not being called at all.
Please can I have more potential fixes before I resort to my last desperate act?
I'm more than willing to do a skype conversation or a share screen kind of thing if someone wants to dig in deep.
Added security permissions to folders related to the website (on multiple accounts)
This has been the most annoying thing because everyone else's issue is fixed when they do this but mine is not.
The server wants to display the directory, which I can enable/disable, but the website is not being displayed.
I want to get away from developing in PHP but doing that is proving to be a massive headache.
Start by creating a simple hello world app as default.aspx and see if it works.
Also check to make sure IIS is actually configured to serve a default document such as default.aspx.
After setting up the application in IIS7.5 I am getting an HTTP Error 403.14 - Forbidden.
I am trying to set up a website with MVC 4, ASP.NET 4.0, on Win7 Professional (64-bit).
Change the user/permissions used by the application pool
Try naming your sample application default.aspx when you copy it into the web root.
I can get a regular html document to show up if I add it to the websites root directory.
I've done a ton of research and tried multiple different suggestions on how to solve the problem but NOTHING is working.
The website is just the basic site that is set up with Visual Web Developer 2010 Express selecting New Project > C# > Website > ASP.NET MVC 4 Application.
