should automatically see the chat's last x messages) as well as working timestamps.
If possible, users would be able to see this chat history regardless of the IRC client they're using, but if this requires me to host some sort of modified web client alongside the IRC server then that's no problem.
Some ircd's may have a logging facility that dumps every message going past it, but unless you have IRC bots running in every channel, which is not a feasible or scalable solution when any user can create their own channels, "replaying" the channel history to users is not possible.
Ideally, this server would have a persistent chat history (where new people joining the channel(s?)
I have seen several similar questions on SU (see this and this), but I was wondering if this is specifically possible in Linux with a self-hosted IRC server, and if so, how best to do it.
IRC itself doesn't record chat history, it only forwards messages between users.
I have bought a Raspberry Pi which I intend to use as a 24/7 IRC server, probably using IRCD-Hybrid.
A bouncer can do this, but this is something that typically the end user has complete control over, if you're wanting to keep chat logs for auditing purposes or something like that.
However, PHP Free Chat works like you want, only requires Apache and PHP, and the end user doesn't have to worry about installing a client.
