FTP is an application (and protocol) used for file transfer.
CBR is a quality of service term usually used in the context of codecs, describing how they convert analog signals to digital (and vice versa).
Both CBR and FTP are traffic generators not traffic agents.
Their main difference is as they said: FTP uses TCP for transferring packet and CBR uses UDP for transferring packet.
Are they any protocols like TCP or UDP or something else?
And Note that: As its known the request through TCP has an Ack while the one through UDP has no ACK and in Network simulation the same scenario works if you are familiar with it.
It uses TCP for transport, but FTP is considered an application protocol.
Questions about protocols above layer-4 are specifically off-topic.
UDP is a best-effort, fire-and-forget transport protocol.
It's not a term commonly used in the TCP/IP suite.
FTP is a protocol, but it is above OSI layer-4 (transport layer), and it uses the transport layer to do its work.
Constant Bit rate is not a protocol, but a description for an ideal situation.
