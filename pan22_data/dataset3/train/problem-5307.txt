Let's say you want the file to be called /var/lib/mysql/.shutdown_signals
The error log just shows "Normal shutdown" followed by the typical shutdown messages.
We have had several situations when our production MySQL server suddenly became unavailable.
How can I determine the Linux or MySQL user account and host name of the connection issuing the shutdown command?
One perfect example why root access even for admins is bad.
cd /home; for u in *: do; sudo grep mysql /home/$u/.bash_history; done
Check the secure log in the event it was run via a sudo service call
If you want to see who issued shutdown from a Linux viewpoint and if you are real risk taker, I have a very dangerous but fun suggestion.
Check to see if there's any mysql related stuff going on in cronjobs
You will need to shutdown mysql and switch the files around
You could create a special log file that records when service mysql stop is issued or if mysqld_safe decides to shutdown.
Check with people you know that either have sudo or mysql root access on this machine
Maintaining a sudoers file and a centralized database of privileged users and groups(LDAP for example) would help solving problems like this.
