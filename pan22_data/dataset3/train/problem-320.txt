I guess that a write in the guest machine is treated the same way as a write in the host machine, and a virtual machine doesn't shrinks SSD life-time more than a host OS, if I use virtual machines in the same way as host OSes.
My virtual machine is a Windows 7 virtual development environment with Visual Studio and I rarely do intensive write operations.
For example, in my case I'm using VirtualBox latest version and since some more-than-a-year version, VirtualBox supports marking virtual hard disks as SSD in order to let guest operating system (i.e.
Since virtual machines create a file that represents a hard disk - the so-called virtual disk -, and it usually takes 20-40GB (and even more), how does this affect a solid-state disk (SSD) life time?
You can use some tool like CrystalDiskInfo, Intel SSD Toolbox (for Intel SSDs) and see how "host writes" attribute changes.
Windows 7 and above) detect the whole disk as SSD and optimize the OS to work better with SSD pros and cons.
The actual question is how virtualization software systems treat these big virtual disk files.
