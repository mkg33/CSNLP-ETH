So, you're not really looking for a "plugin" I'd say, but a websocket "server" we'll call it (it's a bit confusing since both ends can act the same way ... no more "master" / "slave" relationship).
When you click to make the websocket connection, it goes to a gateway that passes the request to the websocket server.
So, that initial request should be handled by a gateway function that sends the request information to websocket software to complete the connection and handle any messages that follow.
Although Websockets use a standard form HTTP header request to initiate a connection, it's not HTTP.
But since you're apparently seeing this as a computer operation rather than a development issue, let me give you a quick briefing.
Many websocket questions have already been posted.
It might be better to post this in stackoverflow as it's more of a development question.

The following article has a link at the bottom to a websocket demo webpage.
This of course also involves whatever application software is needed.
The full request includes a request to "upgrade" (parameter) to the websocket protocol, which is covered by an entirely new standard.
