You need at least a 3.0 kernel and glibc-2.14 for this to work.
"ln -s /proc/1/ns/net /var/run/netns/default"  <----- Is not recommended at all.
Newer distros/kernels support the nsenter command which, should do what you want, providing you are root when you do it.
Personally I always ssh to the main namespace, then I can always get back to the default by typing exit and then re-entering the namespace if required.
As a last resort so the ln as above, but I would suggest removing it as soon as it is done, and before any changes occur to any ns.
You can get the pid form doing 'ps aux' or even a top if you wanted.
If you have ssh to a netns, then ssh to the interface of the default ns and do what you need to do there.
Otherwise the counter will be corrupted and cause issues.
If you are in a separate PID namespace as well, returning to the default namespace is not as simple.
The counter for the code that outputs the "ip netns show"
I don't know if there is anything distribution specific about the approach.
I found that you can return to the default network namespace with two simple commands:
RHEL 6.5 provides support for persistent namespaces but not support for moving existing processes into new namespaces.
This method obviously assumes that you can see processes outside your own namespace through the proc file system.
if you have exec a bash shell, simple exist out of the bash, exit.
