Should my organizationalUnit for user accounts be named "users" or "people"?
Really, at some point in the future you'll need to query, organize or do something with particular groups of accounts.
Follow-up question: Should we differentiate between people and users to take a scenario into account where we want to provide information about people who do not have a user account on a connected system?
There is a required distinction between ou=Users and ou=People:
For example, we have an OU for 'Employees', 'Contractors', 'Students' and another OU for 'Service Accounts'.
What I have found to be effective is to separate OUs based on type of user.
To narrow the possible answers in the first place, is there any institution that defined that?
When a DIT needs to contain a uid (unique identifier like a username; attribute provided by account objectclass) and an email address (mail attribute provided by inetOrgPerson objectclass) there have to be two entries for one user.
Because the objectclass person from the core.schema and the objectclass account from the cosine.schema are both structural, no DIT entry can contain two structural classes at the same time.
Therefore you are likely to put account entries under ou=Users and person entries under ou=People.
If you're too granular, it'll be overwhelming, if you're to broad, it'll be useless.
