Today after giving up on Samsung Data Migration software I've successfully used it yet again to clone all three partitions (including the primary bootable one) of my laptop's HDD to a brand new Samsung 840 Series SSD drive.
If you're like me and aren't that well versed in anything but Microsoft Windows, I'd suggest using either
After supposedly cloning my new Samsung laptop's HDD it the system did not recognize the new SSD at all.
  I've used both in the past few years without a problem.
Another option would be to boot any Linux Live Disc and do a bit-by-bit clone.
I have been using Seagate Disc Wizard for quite some time and I absolutely love it.
Without a hitch, my system started right up into Windows 10 faster than I could hit the F2 button to change the boot drive in BIOS, but not until after it took about and hour & a half to copy the C drive during a reboot and before Windows started.
After unzipping the package I tried the cloning operation again.
The way it works is you would download the .iso, burn it to a disc (or USB) and boot from that.
Those tools are often times junk, a better solution would be to use something like Clonezilla to accomplish this.
I am delighted with what I've seen thus far, and am thinking that I should have gone for a larger SSD!
I'm typing this reply using the new SSD, using all the default settings.
If you do it this way, I would just default to Ubuntu since it's common and well supported by the community.
  - MiniTool Partition Wizard  (https://www.partitionwizard.com/download.html)   OR
 - EaseUS Partition Master Free  (http://www.easeus.com/partition-manager/epm-free.html).
If you approach it this way, ask for help and do more research - as you could kill your old hard drive's data if you mess up.
Then, no hard drives are directly mounted and then it'll walk you through.
nerdwaller's answer looks like a robust solution, but requires you to be familiar or comfortable with Linux/Unix/Ubuntu/*nix.
After some difficulty I located a Samsung download page for Magician 4.0 AND Migration Wizard v2.5.1 (http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/samsungssd/downloads.html).
hours with Migration Wizard v3.1 taking me in circles - "Do you want to upgrade to latest version v2.5.1?"
The command you would use is dd if=/dev/sd[x] of=/dev/sd[y] [x] would be replaced with the FROM drive, [y] would be replaced with the TO.
For this task (cloning my laptop's slow HDD to an SSD), I used the "Migrate OS to SSD/HD Wizard" using MiniTool Partition Wizard 9.
I just now spent another 15 minutes swapping out the drives and tested - my new laptop now boots from a cold (off overnight) start to fully operational in 15-20 seconds!
