As I changed the number of CPU's in my guest system from 2X to 1X  (I have the total of 4X) I was able to fully load my guest machine .
I decided to select the IO APIC option (Settings - System - Motherboard - Extended Features - SELECT Enable IO APIC) - not really knowing what its function was in Vbox.
Once I selected and rebooted, the machine fired into life and works perfectly.
First, it can break older Windows VMs if it is disabled after installation.
What are the advantages of checking the "Enable IO APIC" option in VirtualBox?
As my machine does not support APIC (Host is win 8.1 64 Bit,Guest is  Oracle Linux 64 Bit ) I was getting system panic and could not fully initialized the guest machine .
While I can't find any information on advantages when I google it, two disadvantages are clear.
Yet, I noticed that it is enabled by default when installing Ubuntu 64bit.
You might need it when migrating a physical machine to a virtual machine, if the physical machine has an IO APIC.
Having tried to get an Acronis restored image from an original, physical image to boot in Vbox - (XPSP3) - (Just displays the 'didn't shut down properly' message...every boot),
