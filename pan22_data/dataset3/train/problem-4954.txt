If so, specialist hardware will be needed at the server end; that's by no means an uncommon requirement, but it tends to be offered only on multiport KVM devices.
Depending on the Guest OS and Hypervisor you will have a bunch of options VNC, RDP, PCoIP etc but in all cases you will have to use some form of remote desktop protocol so just having a screen at the remote point will not work for what you are describing.

The graphics output of a VM running on any hypervisor (either the aforementioned client type or server type Hypervisors like Xen,VMware ESX(i), Hyper-V etc) can't just be redirected out a network port in any raw format.
With a Client type Hypervisor (VMware Workstation\Virtual Box ..) you could have one VM at a time redirected to the physical local graphics adaptor and then use a VGA-RJ-45 conversion on that.
I'm sure comparable devices will be available from other manufacturers.
As far as I can tell, it plugs into the KVM ports on the server and presents the console over java and/or VNC interfaces, so you can use either a browser or a VNC client on the remote client system to access the server's physical console.
I am comming in very late to this but I think this is
If you want video performance, you'd want to try SPICE instead of VNC or RDP
For a scenario where you have multiple concurrent VM's your only option is to work with the remote desktop capabilities of the Guest OS, route traffic over a standard network connection and then provide a client at the remote end to consume that.
As you say the VGA to RJ-45 conversion wont work for you - they can't.
I haven't used that device myself, though I have an Adder KVM switch on my desk at home, and it's pretty good.
If I understand correctly, you want to take a physical VGA port and have access to it via IP.
Adderview seem to do a one-port KVM-to-IP converter called the
