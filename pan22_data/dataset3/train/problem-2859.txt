To program in Java you need some sort of text editor.
There is also a version of Java designed for embedded computers.
There are different runtimes and libraries out there, so you will have to check how to download your favorite to your Raspberry Pi.
You do not even need an IDE, though that can be helpful.
If you want to access the gpio pins of your Pi, you'll need a library that allows you to do this.
Instructions for downloading them are at https://dzone.com/refcardz/iot-applications-with-java-and-raspberry-pi.
The two most commons ones are Pi4J and Device I/O.
To run a java program all you need is a Java runtime.
The last time I checked, Java was included in the Raspian I downloaded for my Pi.
This is a collection of libraries plus the application "java" which runs a compiled java program.
An IDE includes this and sometimes will let you switch to your favorite editor.
You do not need to run NetBeans to program Java on the Raspberry Pi.
The official name from Oracle (the owner's of Java) is the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
Then you will compile your program with the "javac" application.
Oracle's version is called "Java SE Embedded" and this page, http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/raspberrypi-1704896.html, describes it, but it's outdated.
