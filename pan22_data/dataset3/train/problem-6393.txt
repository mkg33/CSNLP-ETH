vhosts is likely what you want because Patricks answer (running 2 services) requires more RAM which is limited on the raspberrypi.
i have looked at trying to host 2 domain names under one IP address but i have no clue where to start.
I have tried to edit the sites-enabled.conf and added a virtual host for each domain name i want to have , i then ran a2ensite Domain1.com.conf & a2ensite Domain2.com.conf then sudo service apache2 restartin terminal and forwarded both domain names to my IP address but they both root to the original website folder.
can anyone either give me a good tutorial to follow or explain how to setup 2 Domain names to one apache2 server with different content?
I have a Raspberry Pi 2 B , Its running a LAMP package setup with Rasbains Jessie .
Note that you will be editing /etc/apache2.conf to include the correct vhost setup as laid out in the docs, as well as creating a properly configured file at /etc/apache2/sites-available/domain.tld.
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/examples.html
You should then be running two hosts on one machine from one IP (if desired / set up as such)!
Once that is done, you can run a2ensite, selecting the recently created domain.tld file, and running 'sudo service apache2 reload'.
