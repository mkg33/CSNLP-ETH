You're unlikely to reach those speeds consistently on any other technology, unless you have an ideal 802.11AC setup (which theoratically can reach gigabit speeds, though real world performance may vary), or ethernet.
There is no substitute for real butter actual ethernet cables.
Homeplug is also notoriously finicky - I ran into trouble until I moved one of my homeplug nodes, because it was picking up interference from our washing machine, and dryer.
You're likely going to want to go with cat 6 or better in this day and age, though I've found cat 5e works well enough.
While there is a gigabit homeplug AV standard, most initial reports tend to indicate they arn't faster than the 500 mbps varient.
If you need a reasonably fast way to connect two parts of your network, without the need for new wires, where wifi won't work to your satisfaction and spend a little time doing it, go with homeplug AV.
If you need a phone socket, pay for a new install.
To start, There's a difference between an RJ11 (aka a phone connector), and the cable used there, and a RJ45  (aka ethernet, though more precisely its one flavour of physical connector used for ethernet) and the cable used there.
You can't turn a powerline into a phone jack - you can turn it into an ethernet adaptor.
They're also affected by SMPS (ironically cause most computer peripherals use these), though a passthrough adaptor helps there.
If you need gigabit ethernet, pay for a new install.
To make things more complicated, lots of 500mbps devices 'only' have fast ethernet - I get close to 90mbps between properly located (more on that later!)
