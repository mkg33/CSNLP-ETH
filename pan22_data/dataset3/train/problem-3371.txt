First, a DVI-I dual-link (Digital+analog) female connector type will accommodate any DVI male connector you throw at it.
I just wanted to follow up to say a couple of things for those folks super confused!
However, you cannot connect a single-link DVI-I cable to a dual-link DVI-D port.
Yes, a dual link port can support both single and dual link cables.
There are two different types of DVI ports your laptop may have: DVI-I or DVI-D.
If for instance you attempted to plug a DVI-A into what looks like a DVI-I dual-link (d+a) female connection and you get no output, it is probably because the adapter/dongle/cable you have doesn't actually support analog IO.
You can also connect a single-link DVI-D cable to a dual-link DVI-D port.
Yes you can connect a single link DVI cable to a dual link DVI port but not the opposite.
You can connect any single-link DVI cable (DVI-I as well as DVI-D) to a dual-link DVI-I port.
Just because you have a female DVI-I (d+a) doesn't necessarily mean that the adapter/dongle/cable you are using support specifically analog connections.
DVI-I carries digital and analogue signals, DVI-D just digital signals.
if my laptop has a dual link DVI port but i have a single link DVI cable, can it be connected to the laptop?
