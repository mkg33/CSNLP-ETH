I know there are virtual folders, but I don't want to add folders one by one...
C:\myweb\virtual\app.php) -- you really have to test it.
I would create 2 different FTP accounts, one for C:\myapplication and one for C:\myweb
I have one site www.mysite.com where I got an application program and now we're going to put our web site here too.
The possible problem with this approach is that you have to rely on how well your php app is written -- it may incorrectly calculate paths for include/require and other file-related operations (in one place they may use REAL file location (e.g.
You can replace virtual folder by symlink or directory junction if you want -- but it has some drawbacks as such symlinked folder will be physical part of website (at least on server) and can be overwritten by mistake (unless you setup proper access permissions).
The problem is that the application is untouchable, and want to keep it out from the web site team.
C:\myapplication\app.php), in another place they may refer to the path as seen by website (SERVER_ROOT), e.g.
There are files on the root of the website for the app as for the website.
1) Create virtual folder for your php app (I know, you have said you do not want it)
Your visitors should see normal URL while behind it will be located differently.
