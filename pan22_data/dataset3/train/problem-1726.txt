Since im into ASP MVC 3, I thought I would try to install the preview of V5.
I start the installation vizard, go through step 1- 3.
I now have 2 choices, "Preview your new website" and "Set up your new website".
I know this might be buggy, but I did expect that I could install it properly, but that was not correct.
But when I look in my DB I see no tables, so something did not go as planned.
If I click on "Set up your new website" I return to step 1 of the installation vizard.
In step 3 I add my DB information (which I know works), and go to the next step.
I wish to try Umbraco CMS 5.0 CTP 1 since it has a good reputation.
I tried looking into the log file, but I did not find anything of interest to me.
I think you'll be better asking this question in Umbraco's support forum, especially as this is a beta release and likely to have issues.
Step 5 says "Install a Starter kit", with a HUGE button with the text "Dev data set".
Then it looks like everything is OK, and I get this message:
I click this button, and installation is completed.
