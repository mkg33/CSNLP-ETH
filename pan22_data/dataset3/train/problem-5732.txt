If you pop out a Mac key, it's (usually) easy to pop it right back into place.
Really though, once the key is off, just clean the area out with a piece of cloth dabbed in a bit of rubbing alcohol (while the power is off).
Once you pop it out, you will see a little rubber bubble piece.
In that case I would suggest you use keyboard remapping tool such as KeyRemap4MacBook to remap the bothersome key to something less annoying (or disable it all together if possible)
If you'd like to disable the key, you could probably get away with just removing that little rubber piece - they pop right off.
You can't just fix the issue from the software side of things - that won't change the fact that the keyboard hardware is transmitting the signal that the option key is being pressed.
Any attempts to override the option key signal is going to start mucking up the signal gate.
Since you said option key, I assumed you are using a Mac.
As skub mentioned, fixing the hardware would be the ideal solution.
The option key is always engaged and i get special characters each time I type.
You'll probably have no problem fixing the issue with the key.
If you need it disabled, then physically disable it.
