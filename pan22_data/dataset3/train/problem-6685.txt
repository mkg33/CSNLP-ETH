I can bring ethernet up with nmcli con up 'System p5p1' and turn off wifi with nmcli con down id 'MyWifiNetworkName'
I have two different setups I use on my work laptop; one enables synergy over an ethernet ssh tunnel with my work computer on the local network, and the other opens an HTTP tunnel to my work computer from outside the network.
I have tried route add and ifup, none of it works, so I dove into gnome-control-center's source code and found that it enabled the connection by libnm's method nm_client_activate_connection with some libnm specific structs that I am having trouble tracking down.
I have scripts that begin my ssh tunnels, add my ssh keys, and starts up other programs like synergy, and close themselves when I shut my laptop.
When I have wifi enabled at work, my laptop seems to use it by preference.
Does anybody know what fedora 17 does with ethernet connections to fully enable them?
Do I have to write a c script to run libnm for me to fully emulate whatever gnome-control-center is trying to do?
Or does anybody know what libnm does to fully enable an ethernet connection?

However, every day I have to start out my routine by opening my gnome-control-center and turning on my ethernet.
I'm not much of a c programmer, and I'm not familiar with either GTK or libnm.
