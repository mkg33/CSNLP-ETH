The lag you are experiencing might look like video lag but it is most likely do to your guest PCs need to constantly move information between the RAM, HHD, and your virtual memory.
By turning of the 2D and/or 3D accelebration as snapshot below.
What are the specs of your PC and what specs did you setup on your guest machine?
My guest machine screen is very lagging, open a window then minimize it will remain the unresolved drawing on the guest OS's desktop.
HHD are normally the bottleneck for most PCs so giving the guest machine enough RAM so it doesnt depend on the HHD as much solves most lag issues.
Windows 7 is 64bit, unless you were the unlucky bloke that has the 32bit version, and as such requires much more RAM than the older 32bit operating systems.
That being said you generally want to give your guest machine at least 4GB if not 8GB of RAM depending on what your PC has to offer.
I try to increase the display adapter memory size but it doesn't help.
Often times the most common issue is to little RAM.
