Please note that this might have some negative impact on your VPN session.
Well, most VPN connections I am aware of are able to push a DNS server to the VPN client.
So if you always want to use 192.168.1.1, put that in explicitly.
You can use your Mac HOSTS FILE to solve the problem (The Hosts file is used to map human-friendly domain names to numerical IP addresses....google it to know more about it).
System Preferences -> Network -> Ethernet (left pane) should produce a window that has a "DNS Server:" text box you can fill in with the IP address of your desired DNS server.
Simply add to the host file the DNS record that you need in your case so that even if you are using the VPN the OS will use the IP that you specify in the file.
In my experience if you specify a particular DNS server in Network preferences, even if you're using DHCP, Mac OS uses that server in preference to the one obtained through DHCP.
(If your VPN connection is WiFi instead of Ethernet, then you should click on that instead of Ethernet above.)
If connected with some other interface than Wi-fi you can check valid names with:
For temporary override on command line you can do:
Click "Apply" to apply the change, and you're done; you shouldn't have to make this change again.
The DNS cache needs to be flushed after every change:
My suggestion would be to ask your VPN provider to not push the DNS server for your connection.
