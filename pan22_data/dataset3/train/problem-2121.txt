The best way to synchronize your subtitles is not via VLC (tho it is possible).
To permanently synchronize subtitles you would need to use tools like SubtitleWorkshop and through that tool you can easily edit subtitles the way you want, even set first and last spoken like synchronize subtitles even with more accuracy.
So to shift the subtitle of 3 second you can run vlc with the following command line
You can easily synchronize subtitles with keyboard shortcuts G and H within the application.
Through this app, you can easily set the first and the last spoken word in the movie and subtitle timings are automatically adjusted between these two lines.
This way, you can sync subtitles by +/- 0.5 seconds by default.
However, if you want more functions and possibility to save synchronization permanently in your subtitle file, then you would need to use tools such as Subtitle Workshop.
In a similar way acts the option --sub-fps that override the normal fps.
One trick: Use big numbers at first, e.g., 20s, to test water, then fine-tune to close in on the actual delay.
For further information invoke vlc -H or check the online vlc user manual
By command-line is possible to use the option --sub-delay followed by the number positive or negative of 1/10 of seconds of delay to add.
With VLC 3.0.0 there are some other option that can be useful (and almost self-explicative)
