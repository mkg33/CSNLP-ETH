But for this new server room I can't locate the outlets on the back wall.
I'd always thought that I'd have the electrician run conduit and put the outlets on the top of the racks, but he suggested putting them on the bottom of the rack at the back right at floor level.
I'm building a new server room, and have to decide where I'll be locating the power outlets (120V 30AMP locking connectors) that my UPSs will be powered from.
I place them half-way up the height of the rack and coil excess power cords in the side panels.
Instead I have to locate them on the racks themselves.
On 2-post racks: I like rack-mounted horizontal power strips staggered throughout the rack.
The same is true for the UPSs and electrical receptacles-- they're at the bottom and feed the power strips in the rack.
I see the advantage of this as not having to run power cables up through my cable managers, and thus interfering with any network cable, but the disadvantage is that I'll have long coiled-up 30A power cables jutting out from the back of the racks.
I coil the power cords on one side of the rack in the vertical cable management (and network cables on the other size).
The UPSs feed the PDUs, and the PDUs feed the servers and other equipment.
In the past I've put the outlets on the back wall, and just run the cords up and over the ladder racking on to the back of the wall.
What have you done, and would you do it differently?
Normally the UPSs are at the bottom of the rack (where they really should be), plugged into mains outlets that are either under the floor or at floor level.
If you're talking about 4-post cabinets: I like vertical PDUs inside the sides of the rack.
We have used both and the vertical ones are a lot easier in the 4 post racks, otherwise I always have at least one power cable that is too short.
Increasing, though, I'm using Neatpatch cable management and have less and less need for vertical cable management.
