It shows up as synched for time but it will not show up in our replica ring.
Check for its local replicas/partitions by doing "ndsrepair -P".
These should make sure that it is communicating with the other servers in the tree.
Positive numbers are a reference to how far away from [Root] as I recall.
We have a sles10 sp2 oes2 sp1 server that is in eDirectory as a replica server.
This is in order to get to three copies of each replica for redundancy where possible)
(If it is the second or third server into a partition then it will automatically get a replica of the partition it is inserted into.
If there is no replica but you want to add one, I would use iManager.
When you do a ndsrepair -T what is the replica depth value?
Also, while not directly related, I would definitely check the server's DNS entries using "host" and slp configuration using "slptool".
I forget the exact numbers, but -1 means no replicas locally.
The server may be in the tree but have no replicas (partitions) on it, which dovetails with geoffc's answer above, and is perfectly normal if the server was simply added to the tree.
