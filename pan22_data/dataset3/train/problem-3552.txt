Another possibility: your provider promised you DSL up to 2000 M where the dsl and 2000 M are in 36 font and  the up to is in 2.5 font.
Or they do say it, but then in the fine print there's this:
Actually the internet service providers mentioning our internet speed in bits per second.
Unless they made any guarantee it could very well be only 0.5mbps and you're SOL then.
Your speedtest shows 1.7Mbps, your connection is 2mbps, your download speed is approx 200kBps.
This is similar to UMTS where you share the bandwidth with others on the same  cell.
So if your ISP mentions 512 Kbps , 1 Mbps , 2 Mbps , 4 Mbps ., to calculate your download speed in Bytes simply divide it by 8 , that will be your download speed in KiloBytes or MegaBytes .
You must share the bandwidth with people on the same physical wire.
And your speedtest website also showed it to you in bits per second ,whatch it clearly.
But in our computer level,our download managers or some applications shows the download speed in Bytes per second like this,
