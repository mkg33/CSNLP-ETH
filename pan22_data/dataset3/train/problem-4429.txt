If I simply add a ServerAlias directive to the virtual host it doesn't work.
This is working, but I'd like to add a ServerAlias for each such that requests on host 'apple' are proxied to apple-app and requests on host 'orange' are proxied to the orange-app.
In order to fix underlined configuration you need to create another VirtualHost for "default" purposes using:
Interestingly if I do a similar setup but with port 80 then the ServerAlias works...
This is probably due to the special SNI protocol requirement (SNI - Wikipedia; SNI - Apache Wiki).
Well, from my testing it appears that the ServerAlias directive is ignored when using name-based virtual hosting on port 443 with Apache 2.2.15.

The work around is to create two separate virtual hosts;  from my example one would have ServerName orange.fruitdomain and the other would have ServerName orange.
comment the listen 443 line because listening start with the ssl automaticaly and if you start it before it will see a conflict.
I've got a name-based virtual host setup on port 443 such that requests on host 'apple.fruitdomain' are proxied to the apple-app and requests on host 'orange.fruitdomain' are proxied to orange-app.
