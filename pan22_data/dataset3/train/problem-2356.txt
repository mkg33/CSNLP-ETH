If you do not mind to change approach and can use Python, I believe Fabric could be a nice solution for your needs, although I never actually tested it on Windows machines.
Is there any other method that I can use to accomplish the task of changing the IP address information for these servers remotely?
You can open up a command prompt on a remote machine from your local desktop with:
If I login to the server over RDP I am able to run the command netsh interface ip show config, and I receive the expected results.
Maybe you can write a batch (.bat file), upload it, login via RDP and run it?
I have looked into netsh, but I'm having problems getting it to change the address remotly.
For testing I'm tring to run the following comand which should return the current network config on the remote machine:
Use the xcmd tool to logon first on the remote machine then execute your netsh command as if you were doing it locally.
Ideally I would like to be able to preform this from a command line on my local system (Windows 7) remotly, so I can script out the process to update all systems quickly.
We are going through a network redesign and I have 35 Windows 2003/2008 servers at a remote location that I need to change the IP address, gateway and DNS informaiton for.
This would seem to indicate, as the error is saying, that not all commands and funtions are available from a remote machine as might be available from a local session.
