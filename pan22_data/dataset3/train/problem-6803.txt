I'm trying to connect to a remote Windows 7 box that needs a setup change or two.
Cygwin won't let me connect as Administrator@computername.
Runas might not be supported but you could use a freeware utility CPAU  http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/cpau/index.htm
This utility will allow you to launch an application using a different set of credentials then the current user.
The neat advantage with CPAU over runas is that you can specify both the username and password at runtime.
The standard solution for this is, to the best of my knowledge, RunAs.exe, but trying to run it via SSH results in it quitting instantly with no diagnostic (even when run as "runas /?").
I've got access to an Administrator account via Cygwin's SSH server, but Cygwin won't let me run Administrator-privilege utilities ("The requested operation requires elevation (Run as administrator.)")
Starting "cmd" from ssh gives me a standard DOS prompt, but from the DOS prompt, "runas" just echoes the commandline back at me no matter what I do, again, even when run as "runas /?
/lwp means to Load With Profile, and can be replaced with /lwop Load Without Profile
Using CPAU to launch iexplore.exe you could use a statement like:
With the runas command you'd first have to configure a cached credential or be prompted for password at each run.
