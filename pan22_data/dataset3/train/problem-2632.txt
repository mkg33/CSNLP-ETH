Manually loading (modprobe) hid_multitouch, elants_i2c, etc., has yielded no progress.
Also, for those of you with this model laptop...perform an lsmod | grep -i acer and if you see a module listed, you should uninstall and blacklist it.
I don't know much about Ubuntu or drivers so I don't really know what to do with this information.
NetworkManager will once again be able to control your WiFi :P
HP Envy x360 m6-ar004dx...touchscreen no worky on Arch Linux (latest trunk), nor Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
No response when I touch the screen, even after reboot.
to release a driver, or someone who knows touchscreen controllers to fix hid_multitouch.
Not sure where to go from here, other than wait for the mfr.
As best I can tell, this thing has an ELAN0732 I2C touchscreen controller (/sys/dev/bus/i2c/...).
I've seen a couple of other topics on this but none that solved my issue so I apologize if a solution is already out there somewhere.
I recently installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my HP Envy and can't get the touchscreen working.
