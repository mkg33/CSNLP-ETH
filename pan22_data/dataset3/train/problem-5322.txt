For my main gateway I use an Apple AirPort Express and I also have an Asus RT-N12 running as a repeater (the RT-N12 is DD-WRT compatible).
If there's a solution that does not involve VPN, then that would be preferable since I plan to be streaming videos from the HTPC (large amounts of data).
I believe that the University is assigning my subnetwork a public IP (not NAT) because when I go to a site like http://whatismyipaddress.com it shows the same external IP address as my AirPort Express.
I have my own subnetwork setup inside my apartment.
I've set the HTPC's local IP (in my subnetwork) to be the default host for the AirPort Express but I still can't access it from outside the university's network.
One solution that comes to mind is to install DD-WRT on the RT-N12 and set it up as a VPN client to a VPN server that I host outside the university's network.
I have an HTPC that is connected via ethernet to the RT-N12.
I want to be able to access the HTPC from outside the university's network.
