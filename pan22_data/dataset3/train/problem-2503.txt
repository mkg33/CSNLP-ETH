You'll right click that, select Delegate Control, click Next, and then select the user you want to delegate control to.
Then select "Only the objects in this folder" and check "Computer Objects".
Then it gets tricky, instead of using the stock delegation tasks, you need to select "Create a Custom Task to Delegate".
For instance, say you have an OU called Other_Computers.
You can use the delegate control feature in active directory to apply permissions on each specific OU that you want your guys to drop their computers into.
Then check "Create selected objects in this folder" (You can also select "Delete selected objects in the folder" if you want them to be able to delete computers) and click next.
Once, you've done that, assuming the user does not have rights to add a computer object elsewhere in the domain, any computers they add will automatically be added to that OU.
One, caveat, they cannot have permission to add computer objects elsewhere in the domain, otherwise, it'll pick the first OU it finds (I think!?!
Then, on the next screen, you have to select "Create All Child Objects" (also Delete all Child Objects if opted to Delete objects in the folder).
