That's probably some sort of bad design by the motherboard manufacturer and/or power-supply manufacturer.
I've never seen a motherboard not misbehave afterwards.
I would throw the motherboard away & start from scratch.
PSUs aren't built to run eternally, especially not in a consumer grade machine.
Even in "legacy" mode... power should not be applied to USB when the PC is off.
Did the fact that a 5 year old PSU was running eventually cause it to fail?
That seems way overkill to run a PC (albeit in mostly shut off mode) just to power a fan.
More than likely... the power-supply failed (due to surge... cheap components... bad design... who knows)  and since the 5v line was still getting juice... that bit got fried.
Various random things like humidity, too much dryness, stressful power drains, or unstopped surges can all make a PSU go "POP".
PSU's have an average smaller lifetime span then hard disks.
And we all know how much hard disks like to blow up due to moving parts, etc.
The relevant bit there is that the PSU was 5 years old.
Honestly... in my experience... if the PSU dies... and ends up cooking anything on the motherboard...
