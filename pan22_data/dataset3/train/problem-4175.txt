When I stop watching one, I want my player to remember where I was, and resume from that point.
The VLC development team is opposed to automatically playing the next file, even as an option.
Open VLC, go to Preferences -> Interface -> Use the native fullscren mode
I often need to work my way thru a lot of videos, in a particular sequence.
Also note that the example is for a Windows system, you may need to modify the syntax slightly if you are using a Unix based system.
(Optional step) remove "--no-osd " from the command to still show the name of each file that gets played.
Then open map and you choose the map with all the music.
VLC cannot do either of these, not without extra work.
I even created my own tiny script to launch MPC-HC and resume the most recently-played file automatically.
The "-L" shouldn't be needed because help for "-Z" says "Play files randomly forever"
This will start a full screen, loop playback of all media inside a folder:
Just figured out the easy way, you open vlc then choose media.
They insist that you must select the files manually, and then add them to a playlist, or open the folder (which would start from the first file, which isn't what I want), or add them individually.
All of this is from the man pages and/or --help output.
Or, if you'd prefer to use mplayer (vlc video scaling is currently borked on one of my machines)
According to this blog post the --playlist-tree will play everything in the folder passed into it.
Instead, I use "Media Player Classic - Home Cinema" http://mpc-hc.org/ for this very reason.
