I've been trying to change it with sqlplus to no avail:
I get this error no matter what new password I type in.
When I connect to my local development database, I get an error saying the password has expired.
I was getting this error connecting to an 11g database using the 12g sql*plus client while another person was able to successfully log in and change the password using the 11g sql*plus client.
We have discovered that those of us who have this issue are NOT set as (Windows) Admin on our own machines.
However, I'm also curious if there's a way to make the password never expire.
My main question is how I can reset this password.
On the other hand, those coworkers whose machines (and therefore the very same version of SQLPlus program we have) we use to reset our PROD passwords ARE set as (Windows) Admin on their own machines.
Late to the party here but I just ran into this and at least in my case I am fairly certain it is an oracle bug, possibly with compatibility between client versions.
This is a local dev database, I really don't care about the security or anything and none of the data on it is important.
Many of my coworkers, including myself, have been having this issue last four years (yes, that long).
