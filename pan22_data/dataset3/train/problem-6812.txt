This is temporary while you test the thermal issues.
Which was really bad, because ACPI sendt a "power-button"-event to the operating system shortly after it was booted up.
is more than 10 degrees difference, maybe the sensor is inaccurate.
Normally, temperatures above 50 deg C aren't good, and coupled with CRC errors and the age of the drive, you'd be best off replacing it (and make sure you have a backup!
I've had SSD-drives that are measured as being -20 Celcius.
the "hot" drive from the usual area next to the other hard drive
If the temperature is reduced a great deal, then the problem can be because
if it is the drive i am thinking about, a wd 250gb jb series, then speedfan does give the wrong temp reading, but if it is about 4 years old then i would be very careful of it since i just had the one i was monitoring go with crc errors.
be careful and migrate away from that western digital drive if you have critical data on it.
I would say that the reading of ~60 degrees is accurate.
right away we swapped to other drives and the drive became unreadable later in the day.
If so, and you don't have high uptime requirements, try removing
While it MAY be possible that the sensor has an offset, I'd say that it's probably just a model that happens to run abnormally hot.
small cardboard box it can rest on rather than mounting in the case.
If the temperature feels the same to the hand, but the probed value
if you want the model of the drive i can look it up remotely on one of the old servers and post the model back here.
The temperature isn't innacurate by a "large margin", in my opinion.
It sounds like this isn't a rack mount server but a tower type of system.
