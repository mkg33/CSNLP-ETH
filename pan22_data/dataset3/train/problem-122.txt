When the need for several load balancers arises, you may want to go for a heartbeat configuration, that either will ensure only one balancer mounts the virtual IP for a given domain, (if sessions required, or mount both and feed DNS with two IP addresses for instance).
It amazse me the amount of mis-information that is put about regarding round-robin.
If I were a cynical person I might wonder whether there is any connection with the vendors whoi produce big expensive load-balancing hardware.
do you need the user sessions to be handled by the load-balancer(s) and always driven to the same web server (if alive)?
At first, there is an important question that must be answered:
You should need a very good reason for introducing additional complexity and a single point of failure into your architecture.
Maybe this should be detailed in another question at the time it becomes necessary (as the tools evolve quickly).See also this link for instance.
