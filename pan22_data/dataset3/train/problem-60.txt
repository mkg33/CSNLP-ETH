This allows the CPU to quickly communicate with hardware devices by reading and writing to them the same as it does with memory.
All of the above applies to a 32 bit OS but there is an additional factor.
There are other methods available but they are much too slow for high performance devices like video.
64 bit operating systems have a physical address space measured in terabytes so there is plenty of room for RAM and memory mapped IO.
A great deal depends on whether this is a 32 or 64 bit OS.
Memory mapped IO appears in the same address space as RAM.
RAM is the biggest user of this address space but it is not the only one.
Typically this would require about 500 MB and more address space.
A 32 bit OS has a fixed 4 GB physical address space.
With a 64 bit OS the biggest user of hardware reserved memory is typically the video system.
Thus, whatever space is used for memory mapped devices is unavailable for use by RAM.
For reasons of economy many video systems have no or very little memory of their own but rely on system memory for it's needs.
Typically about 500 to 750 MB is lost but the exact amount depends on the hardware.
This memory would be reserved by the BIOS for video use before Windows even starts.
For performance reasons a substantial portion of this space is used for memory mapped IO.
You can't have 4 GB RAM and 500 MB+ of memory mapped devices in a 4 GB address space.
