I had a similar issue arise when I used the beta build 7k, but didn't involve turning off the monitor.
Being diligent, I wrote up a nice little message to the Softies for them to fix it.
I got a new laptop with Windows 7, and moved my mouse to it.
if I remember correctly (as I'm not currently running it) there's a setting that states something to the effect of "lock screen on awake" in the power settings.
Some programs are programmed on purpose to disable the activation of the screen saver.
I now installed it (I downloaded the newest version), and my screensaver started working again.
I think my steps were let it go to screen saver screen lock.
Originally, I didn't install the Logitech software (SetPoint).
This might be because of some program that you have/had running at the moment you turned off the monitor.
The solution in my case was to download a (free) updated version of PowerDVD, which solved the problem.
I had this happen with Windows XP for quite a while, and the solution turned out to be quite bizarre:
I just experienced a similar problem with my Logitech VX Nano wireless mouse.
The screen saver does not start after you install a wireless pointing device
Perhaps your screen saver is set to lock and this other setting is not.
It seems that the device drivers that come with Windows 7 don't handle it very well and it seems to the system that the mouse is sending some movements to the computer.
So you might look for similar incompatibilities in your case.
Based on an XP system, you should be getting the login screen in both cases.
Then prompt to change user, then cancel and then the screen saver screen lock went away.
After some research (including reading this question and previous answers) I understood it's the mouse.
For example, a program that does media playback may do this to avoid disruption when watching the movie.
The only way to then lock the machine with that user is to restart.
Up until recently I used it with an XP machine, without any problems.
