This article about changes to retropie with Emulation Station 2.0 helped me http://blog.petrockblock.com/2014/07/01/major-update-for-retropie/

Each tutorials at some point tell me to access retropie/emulators... - the problem is that an emulator folder doesn't exist in my retropie SFTP, I've tried searching for a solution and a few websites suggested to update my RetroPie which I think I've done correctly and even noticed it say retropie/emulators... in the command lines a handful of times as it was updating and assumed it would be added.
I've installed RetroPie and I've tried update it to its latest version (I think).
