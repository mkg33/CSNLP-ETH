This is for an internal code war framework so it's minimal work - maybe a couple of hours.
Where's a good place to post to find a decent game artist to create a small number of 32-bit sprites?
(Technical means not necessarily creative or polished or stylistic; but technically clean.)
Unless you can get someone on-board full-time for free (like a partner on your development team), I would really recommend learning how to create basic artwork yourself.
There are many good people in this Indy gaming and gamedev community.
However, it's indeed harder to find people ready to work for free (not impossible trough) and if you can't afford for this kind of small help you can also consider to make it yourself as ashes999 suggested.
Any suggestions where I should post to find someone to do this?
I'd recommend TIG Source as a nice place to visit.
EDIT: if it's XNA related, you could also ask/look at the XNA forums:
It has a simple but sufficiently diverse toolset to allow you to create good technical art.
This is a frequent problem that game developers encounter that's hard to surmount.
If you go there, please remember to introduce yourself!
The answer depends on your intention to pay or not to pay for this work, but whatever is the answer you can try on "art & design" forums such as:
you can quickly learn to create polished technical art -- not the most beautiful, but good enough to launch.
With tutorials and basic stuff available on the internet (sprites, textures, icons, etc.)
I also personally find that Flash is a great tool for creating (vector) art assets.
