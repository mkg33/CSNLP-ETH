The software has a tool to decompose Fourier transforms into simpler matrices.
Although it is not a general-purpose package it is a nice tool if you work with this class of (rather complicated) unitaries.
There is a program “Qubiter” by R.R.Tucci that uses CS decomposition, described in http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9902062 and distributed free via source code (C++).
[EDIT] There are (at least) two packages for decomposition in list http://www.quantiki.org/wiki/List_of_QC_simulators
This website - Quantum Compiler.org - has sourcecode for a python library that does this, in two models, Solovay-Kitaev and Kitaev-Shen-Vyalyi.
In this context there are no alternatives that I know.
Such decomposition is essentially an efficient quantum circuit to implement a non-abelian quantum Fourier transform.
In addition to the previous answers, there is a package that computes Fourier transforms for solvable non-commutative groups based on this algorithm.
This package (CUGates.m) was announced on the arXiv a couple of days ago which could be useful for you.
I haven't tried it out though, and it may or may not do what you need.
I just have seen  – a link in e-print still valid, the last version is 1-11, but I never used the program myself and so may not comment that.
