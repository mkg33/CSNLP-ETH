The url is http://www.oml.ago.state.ma.us/default.aspx, with some post parameters :
You can find it with a developer console, looking at the network.
I sometimes find sites that post content (files) as javascript links.
Trying to hide an url to a public document is always stupid and useless.
http://www.oml.ago.state.ma.us/Default.aspx?sectionYear=1&year=2013
Even applications like Acrobat are able to handle this and generate a PDF of the relevant area of a site.
Here is an example of a site which has content (public access, no login or password required) but uses javascript links.
Two options spring to mind (neither of them Java):
In cases where the links are posted with the traditional <a href="..."> construct, one can easily parse the HTML, find the link and download the content.
There are several hundred links here but short of clicking on each one I can't figure any way of finding the target and downloading them.
There are tabs for each year, take this one for 2013.
How does one go about downloading the PDF files here programmatically?
It also breaks the navigation (for example, you can't just open it in a new tab ...).
