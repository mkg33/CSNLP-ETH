In a more nefarious and damaging attack plugging in a USB device might access the CPU directly via a debugging interface and directly inject exploit code without you ever knowing.
I recently purchased several Arduino Nano v3 clones from a merchant on AliExpress.
If you don't trust them, and don't know if the silicon itself hasn't been tampered with then there is nothing you can do that will make them trustworthy.
If that bootloader is altered at the silicon foundry then you've already lost.
I'm aware of the possibility that they may arrive damaged or just not working.
There have been many hacks over the years involving autoplaying USB sticks so they could conceivably imitate a USB storage device and try to get your machine to run an executable.
While the bootloader might be able to be reflashed, many devices such as that one might have a backup bootloader in the silicon itself that it falls back to if the flash based bootloader is corrupted.
However, a friend of mine raised a concern that they may infect or damage my computer when I attempt to program them.
Going a step further they could also appear to the operating system as a USB keyboard and spew keystrokes to manually run an executable from the internet or stored on the device.
