It's a licensing thing, not a problem with Windows.
The "guides" on how to do this that show up in the Google results all suggest replacing a system DLL with a hacked one, but that's not acceptable.
This has never been a problem with rdesktop on Unixen; I could rdesktop from as many machines as I wanted and any logged-in users would never notice a thing.
Client versions of Windows allow one user at a time.
Windows is obviously capable of concurrent RDP sessions because the server versions allow two out of the box, for admin.
Any way to allow concurrent local and remote logins to a Windows 8 machine without hacks or cracks?
This is not how it works in the *nix world of course, but there we are.
The 'client' versions of Windows do not allow multiple users to be logged in at the same time, or permit multiple desktop sessions.
I tried connecting to Windows 8 using its built-in Remote Desktop feature, but for some inexplicable reason, it requires that no users are logged in on the target machine before a remote user can log in.
Or many sessions if it has the appropriate licenses installed.
If you want to be able to control the users machines while they are still logged in without interrupting their session, then you need to either use the Remote Assistance mechanism (instead of Remote Desktop) - or switch to something like VNC.
