How to limit the connection (upload and download) speed of a particular application (e.g., a particular exe file) in accessing the internet?
When traffic is shaped, its rate of transmission is under control, in other words you apply some sort of bandwidth allocation for each port.
Apparently, it is easy to allow or block completely using a firewall.
It can slow down traffic for a given port and services on Desktop or OpenWRT based routers.
tc qdisc add dev br-lan root tbf rate 4mbit burst 10kb latency 50ms peakrate 8mbit minburst 1540
Please provide more information on the question and the Network environment.Also tell us in which device you are planning to do the bandwidth limiting.
But I could not see any option that addresses the above intention, i.e., just limit the connection to specified speed.
Commands for throttling Upload 2mbit and Download 4mbit for OpenWRT based Router.We can modify the same set of commands once we know what is the type of service/exe we are looking at here.
If you are using a Linux based Desktop/Router then you can do a Token Bucket Filter with TC commands.
You can use the netstat or identify the ports which are being used by the application and then apply tc rules based on the ports.
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root tbf rate 2mbit burst 10kb latency 50ms peakrate 4mbit minburst 1540
