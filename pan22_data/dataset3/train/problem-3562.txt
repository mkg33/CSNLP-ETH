Late answer, but I came across the same need and the two following commands do the trick:
I want to put the host behind a Linux box (Smoothwall), and assign it a private IP address.
No need for specifying real IP, simply PREROUTE the gre traffic to the private server and let the gre connection tracker do its job.
You are on the right track, just missing the control protocol.
This is what I think I have to do for the tunnel to work:
Here is a Link that describes the iptables configuration for this.
Running this results in No chain/target/match by that name.
false-ip = the IP the host will get after it is put behind the Linux firewall
I have a host that has a permanent static GRE tunnel to a server on the Internet.
For most GRE tunnels you have to have a control protocol on TCP 1723.
real-ip = the real IP currently used by the host, that I want to assign to the Linux router
You forgot the -t nat table switch in the PREROUTING/POSTROUTING instructions.
tunnel-server-ip = the IP of the end of the tunnel the host is connecting to (on the internet)
