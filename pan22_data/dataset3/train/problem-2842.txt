The following snippet is a configuration example for the grml Linux Live system:
I've used Grub4Dos to make a working multiboot USB drive customizable with many different bootable installers and utilities, but it was far from easy.
grml2usb of grml.org should give you an idea how to get a working multiboot USB setup.
Tip: grub2 brings a nice feature known as 'loopback'.
The easiest way I've done this is to use the Slax creator (wont let me post a link, sorry) to create your bootable USB key (with slax installed), then modify the resulting bootloader config files and load your own images/utilities.
I've looked around a good bit and I'm fairly certain there is no app that does all the MBR setup and bootloader config work for you.
Here's one guide if you're interested in doing it the manual way:
It is fairly straightforward to make a BartPE/SLAX combo usb key this way.
Isolinux/syslinux work fine but aren't as flexible as grub.
It's pretty simple to extend the menu.lst/grub.cfg either statically as well as on-demand (thanks to tab completion in the grub shell :)).
maybe "unetbootin dot sf dot net" or one of the links mentioned ther ("gujin dot sourceforge dot net") will get you started.
Using the loopback module/option it's possible to directly boot an (iso9660) ISO without having to manually extract kernel/initrd/.... from it.
