I am concerned that if someday myplex is compromised and some hacker get access to my myplex credentials, then he basicly have access to my media collection, and I could potential be streaming content that I have no rights for streaming to anyone but my self?
I understand that this is what must be the best user experience from most people, it just worked :) But how did this happen, because from my knowing my pc should not be accessible from outside my network.
All ports are blocked on the router and I have private stuff on this machine.
I only want my server to be visible to me and no one else, should I consider alternative solutions?
And at the end to the plex community, I think you should address this better when installing and making it clear when I press stuff in the configuration that I am making content available outside my private network.
I had a little scary surprise the other day when I tried out Plex as a media solutions.
Same as I have no interest in myplex having a list of the content my server is holding like private home videos.
I have deleted my myplex account and would like to know if myplex is just not the solution for me?
After installing the plex server and I logged in to myplex from the server and then selected the server from my mobile phone by logging into myplex there also.
In the windows 8 phone app, I am having a hard time to connect to my server without myplex atleast and also in the myplex server I have a hard time figuring out where to set the port for it to listhen on.
Is all my media send to myplex and my devices streaming from there or how can they make this work?
I installed the server on my local server that is behind the router and windows firewall.
