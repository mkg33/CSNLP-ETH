to kill process you need to find its process number.
Occasionally the process starts behaving poorly and consumes a huge amount of system memory and CPU, running indefinitely on a particular PDF.
I would assume it will be related to the above feature.
Plain ol' ps can help with this: we run a process that considers the number of seconds of CPU each process has consumed according to ps versus the elapsed wallclock time and alerts a sysadmin to have a look if the ratio is excessive; you could of course tie that to a kill for specific processes if you so choose.
This repository of sandbox scripts may also be useful.
OS X 10.7 (Lion) will bring more application sandboxing features, as well, but the details on Apple's site are light.
I'm running a piece of OCR software [with gui, etc] on OSX that watches a folder and OCRs PDFs that are put in there.
There are some switches for kill command, sometimes you need to use
See the man pages for sandbox(7), sandbox-exec(1) and sandboxd(8).
You can sandbox an application on OS X with the built in sandbox(7) facility.
