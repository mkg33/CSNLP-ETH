Did I get a duplicate non genuine battery or does it mean that the clock chip on my board is now failing?
Note that in Windows settings it's just set to the correct region and my region does not observe any Daylight Saving just in case it matters.
I am also going to buy a relatively more expensive Duracell CR 2032 just in case that would matter.
The RTC (Real Time Clock) could be thrown off by an undervolting CMOS battery.
Despite putting in a brand new battery I am getting the same result.
Nothing you could do apart from trying to replace the battery again or replacing the motherboard.
After about 2 - 3 days the system clock runs behind by about 5 - 10 minutes.
Obviously I suspected it to be weak BIOS battery and I replaced it with a Sony 3V CR2032 battery.
Those are integrated into the motherboard's southbridge.
Is there anything else I can try to attempt to fix this?
I have a Windows 7 desktop PC with Gigabyte 880GM motherboard purchased sometime in 2013.
Off lately I noticed that the system clock somewhat lags behind the actual time by about 5 - 10 minutes over a period of 2 - 3 days.
