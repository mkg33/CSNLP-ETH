I solved the problem - I didn't have VirtualBox extension pack installed.
After getting the same error, I just changed the default port 3389 to something else.
In case it helps, here are the commands I used to configure VRDE access to a VM which runs on a headless server (not keyboard, mouse, monitor attached).
If you run VBoxSDL with no args you can see other options you may be interested in.
And disabled Windows firewall for a moment - but I don't think firewall was the problem.
You can attach to a headless VM by running VBoxSDL --startvm <VMname> --separate.
While it is added in  Linux version of VirtualBox, you have to install it separately on Windows.
My experience has been that VirtualBox's RDP is actually provided using VNC, and not the Microsoft RDP protocol.
if you change the port, etc) without the cost of booting the VM, or indeed tearing it down when you want to try another setting:
(I played with -vrdeauthtype external without success - I was never able to successful authenticate over VNC)
Fire up your VNC client and try to connect, and if you successful find yourself viewing a big black rectangle you are good to unpause the VM and begin the boot process:
If you launch the VM paused, you can quickly test the VNC connection and VDRE settings (e.g.
I was able to use the VRDE feature using VNC Viewer (rather than Microsoft Remote Desktop).
