Also the regression testing effort and developer/DBA learning curve will be significant in either case.
If you stop at 2008R2 now you will just have to repeat the exercise again in a couple of years.
It checks for installed components and identifies those you will need to fix either before or after the install.
Read each of them to see what major stuff is changing.
2008R2 has already seen its last Service Pack and in a few months (weeks) will be 3 full versions behind the current version.
I am recommending my organization move from 2008R2 directly to 2016 for the same reasons.
It works and depending on your situation might be the best idea.
It's nothing compared to 2000 - 2005 or 2008 R2 - 2012 (mostly SSIS changes).
IMO if you are going to the effort to migrate then you should go all the way to 2014 even if you run it in 10.0 compatibility mode.
Honestly the move from 2005 - 2008 R2 isn't that bad.
I expect we will start a testing effort as soon as 2016 hits RTM.
BTW, I agree that a Side-By-Side upgrade is preferred.
When I last did this exercise we ran the "Pre-Production" version in a Dev environment for about a month.
That's a really big question so let's break it up a bit.
Pay particular attention to features you are using.
Basically the pros & cons are the opposite of In place.
Now you can mitigate the expense of the side-by-side by creating a new instance on the same server, moving everything to it, then uninstalling the old instance.
