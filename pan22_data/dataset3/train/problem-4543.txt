The machine has a route to 192.1.1.2 via a gateway reachable from eth0:
I'd like to take any traffic coming in on 192.168.2.4 and NAT it to an external ip address.
If they're not being incremented then I'd start sniffing the traffic on the eth1 interface to see if the traffic is making it there.
It's likely that your FORWARD chain is set to a default drop policy and doesn't have a rule to forward this traffic.
I'd do an iptables -t nat -L -v -n to see the counts on the DNAT rule in the PREROUTING chain.
As best I can tell I've done everything needed to make it work, but it doesn't so I'm missing something.
You can watch them increase with each new connection processed by the rule.
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 192.168.2.4 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.1.1.2
It has 2 ip addresses (eth0: 192.168.2.3, eth0:1 192.168.2.4).
192.1.1.2   192.168.2.248   255.255.255.0   UG    0      0        0 eth0
my iptables are all set to default ACCEPT, here is my DNAT rule:
The DNAT rule doesn't seem to actually be doing any sort of NAT/redirection.
