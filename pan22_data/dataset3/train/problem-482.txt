Keep in mind that you can always upgrade in the future.
Obviously, backing up your data every day will mitigate this risk, but what you need to ask yourself is, do you really need the speedup?
Price-wise, upgrading a laptop to 8GB just dropped to $50-70, I'd get both.
Could you not just get a SSD in the future should you decide that your HDD is too slow for your purposes?
And installing 64bit would allow you to add more memory later (just make sure your motherboard supports it).
I'm sure you know by now the benefits and drawbacks to more RAM or a SSD - the decision is for you to make, not this community.
Computer parts are cheap, and getting cheaper every day.
But if your memory is full, you'll start paging a lot.
And for that matter, will you actually need or benefit from the extra RAM you want to get?
You can get the SSD AND the Windows 64bit - Windows versions have the same price.
That being said, it's not a one-way road if you choose one over the other.
If you go the SSD route, be aware that you can easily burn it out in less then a year, and possibly lose all of your data with it.
I can guarantee you that the RAM will be both cheaper, and last longer then the SSD.
Finally, since you're even asking this question, I'll give you my honest recommendation: don't upgrade either.
As a general rule, an SSD will make things run faster.
Since this came from Stack Overflow, I'll assume that the data you work with is very important, and you can't sustain a big data loss.
That, and it's not a big deal to purchase an SSD in the future should you actually need it.
Not only will it be cheaper (especially not purchasing it from a computer retailer), but you might not even find you need either for a little while.
If you want more RAM in the future, or you want a faster storage device in the future, buy it when you need it, not before.
It's fun to take an SSD and say "Look, I can boot in 7 seconds" but the RAM will give you more bang for your buck.
