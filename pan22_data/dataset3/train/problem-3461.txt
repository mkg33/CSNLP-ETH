Reinstalling the program as a "normal" installation into the Program Files directory (as opposed to a portable installation) fixed the problem for me.
I have tried disabling/enabling the default handler, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling, but it still seems to prefer the Windows version.
Is there any way for me to force it into the default handler or at least on the right-click version?
I have TeraCopy installed on all my computers and it is set to be the default copy handler.
I can still open TeraCopy manually and drop in some files then select the destination, but I want it to go automatically.
I have not noticed any pattern as to when it lets me use TeraCopy.
Seems about 80-90% of the time, when I drag and drop a file it is preferentially using the default Windows copy method.
I have an older computer that still seems to be working as expected (no idea on its Windows or TeraCopy update history).
You can change between TeraCopy and the default Windows copy function by launching TeraCopy, rightclicking on its interface, hitting Preferences, and toggling "Use TeraCopy as default copy handler".
A right-click drag and drop should offer me the TeraCopy and Windows versions of the copy/move procedures, but it is currently only showing the Windows one.
However, since my last OS reinstall, it does not seem to want to act as the default.
