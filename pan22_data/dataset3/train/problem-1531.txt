Most IPv4 hosts use link-local addressing (IPv4LL) only as a last resort when a DHCP server is unavailable.
For link-local addressing IPv4 uses the special block 169.254.0.0/16 as described in RFC 3927 while IPv6 hosts use the prefix fe80::/10.
An IPv4 host otherwise uses its DHCP-assigned address for all communications, global or link-local.
One reason is that IPv4 hosts are not required to support multiple addresses per interface, although many do.
However, discovering the DHCP-assigned address of another host also requires either distributed name resolution or a unicast DNS server with this information, and some networks feature DNS servers that are automatically updated with DHCP-assigned host and address information.
Both IPv4 and IPv6 have standard methods for address autoconfiguration.
Another is that not every IPv4 host implements distributed name resolution (e.g., multicast DNS), so discovering the autoconfigured link-local address of another host on the network can be difficult.
