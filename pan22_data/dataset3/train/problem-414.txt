You don't even need to turn off the SSD's in BIOS.
This will make sure Grub gets started when you turn on your PC.
After Grub starts at boot, you can choose to boot Windows or Ubuntu.
Then set your boot device for the SSD containing Ubuntu.
Generally yes, either through changing the boot order in bios, or by selecting a boot device in the system boot menu.
(in short, Grub also works for different disks, not just for different partitions)
i have 1st SSD formatted as ext4 and installed Ubuntu 14.04 on it and i plan to get 2nd SSD and format it to NTFS and install Windows 8 on it.
You don't need to 'turn off' the SSD - the windows system can't see the linux FS without additional filesystem drives, if they exist, and the linux system generally can be told to not mount your windows bootloader.
If you don't want one bootloader stepping on the other, disconnect the other SSD and install.
On the Ubuntu SSD, install the boot loader Grub (installed by default), and make sure it has entries for both Linux and Windows.
If it's possible i would buy the 2nd SSD and try it.
