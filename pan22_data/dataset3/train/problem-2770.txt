I know about things like rsync and other command line tools that are available to make it possible to copy and retain original file dates.
I know that's technically true, the file is copied so its creation date gets changed, but when the modified date of the copy is still the original file's creation date (the file that a copy was made of), I'd like to be able to update the creation date of the copied file to be the original copy date.
If it has to be done by command line, I suppose that could work too.
I don't know if it will do batch files but it does integrate with shell.
I also know about touch and other utilities for Mac and Windows that will let you manually change the "date created" and "date modified" attributes, or change them in bulk to a single manually entered date.
Or maybe the command could be ported to a cmd script that could either be added to the context menu of File Explorer to run it within a given directory, or a standalone cmd file that could be run from within the folder whose contents you wish to update/synchronize file date attributes as described above.
What I am looking for, if one exists, is a utility that lets you sync one date attribute of a file to another date attribute of that same file, ideally by combing through a list of files (in bulk or batch processing) and handling this date change automatically, on each file in that collection.
I hope I've described what I'm looking for clearly enough!
I have a special case where I have to copy files through a specific channel that isn't rsync or command line capable (at least not easily).
I'm annoyed when I copy files and the creation date is made new.
I've installed on it every box I've owned in the past 8 years.
Ideally, if it could be accessible via File Explorer's context menu, that would be phenomenal.
