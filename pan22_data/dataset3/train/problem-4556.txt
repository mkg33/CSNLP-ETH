You would use this to search for the number of times T3ID appears where it has two matches.
If i am aware then query may be re-written accordingly
So for example if the previously established query (Q1) has T1ID's 1 and 2 selected then I want this query to select T3ID's 1 and 4.
(I have no ability to change the database design so please no comments on changing it.
you need to re-explain with clear output expected in tabular format.
Assuming the values for your initial query result are 1 and 2, you have two values returned back, which you can now plug into a HAVING clause.
It is okay that T3ID 1 also contains other T1ID's in T2 for it to be selected.
What I want is an inner-join of all 3 tables but I only want the values in T3 selected if all of the values in T2 referencing the selected values in T1 are part of a previously established query.
This code is written in T-SQL, but I'm sure you can convert it quite easily to Access, as it's for demonstration purposes anyway.
A typical join would select T3ID's 1, 2, 3, and 4 but I do not want T3ID's 2 and 3 selected because the values for T3ID 2 and 3 do not include T1ID 1 in T2.
I have use CTE becasue I don't know what is your previously established query.
Now you can plug that result into your existing INNER JOIN query, which returns everything, just adding on a WHERE clause.
