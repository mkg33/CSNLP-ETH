This Linux server is running a control panel (InterWorx-CP) that is managing an APF installation, which in turn generates the iptables rules.
How do I go about closing this hole in the firewall?
I am handling vulnerabilities reported by a PCI-DSS scanner, and one of them is new to me:
My guess is APF is generating some rules outside of my indirect control.
But even when I did that in the CP, the exploit still was successful.
What is the impact of this vulnerability from 2003, which the PCI scanner is just now reporting (years of scans already)?
The first linked article gives a proof of exploit command, nmap -v -P0 -sU -p 1900 ${IP} -g 53, which does in fact return one 56 byte packet if the source port is 53.
In contrast, a request to port 1900 with UDP source port 123 (also open) returns 0 bytes.
In this example, it reports port 1900 is "closed" but a 56 byte reply was returned.
The server is also a DNS authority for the domains it hosts, replicating to slave servers, so incoming DNS queries could be disabled.
