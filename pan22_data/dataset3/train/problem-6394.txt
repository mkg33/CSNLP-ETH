Keep in mind that all sorts of traffic are generated by a LAN, including requests of updates for pcs and firmwares, surfing traffic, and so on.
You can see some improvement if your client is running Winodws Vista or above, and the server are running Windows Server 2008 R2 or above.
The first one is that you might not be the sole user of the connections, in which case you would be entitled to  smaller fraction of the total bandwidth than you think you deserve.
The second consideration is that the traffic the user of the VPN generates needs to be encrypted, and this consumes time.
This is because newer versions of Windows have updated versions of the SMB protocols which reduce the effects of latency.
I do not know which kind of computing power you have at your disposal, but just remember that in these things the connection is only as fast as it slowest component.
This is just how CIFS/SMB is if you are on a high latency connection (>~50ms).
There are two considerations to keep in mind, when trying to evaluate the effectiveness of a connection.
