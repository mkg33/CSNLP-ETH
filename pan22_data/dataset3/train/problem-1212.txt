Unfortunately, I didn't have an option to use UNC paths directly, due to the way third party libraries were treating the UNC paths.
Mapped drives are only available to an interactive session.
You're stuck in a bit of a quandary... the scheduler is executing your bat file in "administrator mode" which doesn't really affect the user-mode environment.
I know that sounds odd, but my own testing shows that it might as well be 2 separate user environments.
I need to map to a network space a mapped drive such as S: for some other jobs.
Therefore, I have to make the network space available without any user log on.
In Windows Server 2008, I can create a scheduled task with a bat job, and I can specify it runs when Windows is reboot or Log on without specified user.
Have you considered using a UNC path instead of trying to map a drive letter?
Not sure if it is possible to let Windows to run the job as local system when it reboots to make the drive available?
I was able to run my scheduled task as my desired user, and just use NET USE Q: \\192.168.7.1\space as the first line of the batch script that was run.
You can adjust the sleep time as needed... or do some more advanced time/date checking mechanism... but this should give you the idea.
I can check from the Task Scheduler job's history.
If the drive doesn't get unmapped... this will throw an error the next loop around when it tries to re-map the drive... unless you catch the error... or do a quick & dirty
You can't map a drive while running as a service, you need to use UNC paths.
In 98% of cases using \\server\share\ wherever you spot a s: causes no problems.
It seems that I have to log on the box to make the mapped drive.
You might want to try running a quick & dirty vbs script in the user profile's startup folder... and see if that does what you want.
As I mentioned above, I have some other dependency scheduled jobs under Windows local system.
