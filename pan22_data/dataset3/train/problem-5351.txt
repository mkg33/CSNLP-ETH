I have several cron jobs that run (in /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.weekly, etc.)
You may want to use one of the wrappers for the programs, that output everything when something goes bad and swallow stdout otherwise.
where /etc/cronic is a place with executable cronic script, downloaded from the website mentioned.
You should send successful email notifications to /dev/null so they disappear.
So, if you want to keep error notifications, don't redirect STDERR, just STDOUT:
try changing the redirection part of your cronjobs to
But you want to see unsuccessful email notifications.
What is the best way to suppress success emails for those scripts?
One example might be cronic, just prepend 'cronic' to 'run-parts' e.g.
This means you need to first direct stdout to /dev/null and then direct /dev/stderr to stdout
I understand how to do that for individual cron jobs, but the scripts in those special directories are run using run-parts.
If you do the typical >/dev/null 2>&1, you are effectively suppressing both (bash documentation).
I'd like to stop those emails if the jobs are succeeding, and only email on error (which I understand can be done by redirecting stdout to /dev/null).
