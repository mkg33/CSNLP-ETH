SPF is set on the customer domain, but that doesn't matter as whenever i send an email from my own email account on my own domain to hotmail, gmail and others, any email containing the words of the name of the customer domain also goes straight to spam!
I had a customer domain who got their password compromised and spam was sent from their email account with links back to drive-by files that had been uploaded to their web space.
The infected files were cleaned from the site, passwords changed and removal requested from Spamhouse.
After a day or two, the server was clear on all blacklists.
Now whenever the customer sends any email that contains their text of their domain name to hotmail or gmail the email goes to spam.
Without any link to their site it goes through OK.
It seems their domain name is considered a spam word regardless of the email address it is sent from.
I know where to check and go to remove IP addresses, but is there a list of spam words in this case that the domain name has gotten on to?
