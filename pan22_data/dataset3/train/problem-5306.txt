but it certainly is not true today, especially with the rise of VoIP where everyone has their own timing mechanisms (I'm thinking NTP sources as I write that).
I have worked with various networks that have poor time keeping; Due to humans being lazy and prone to mistakes the concept of the telephone network being isochronous is in fact almost imposible.
Maybe this was true 50 years ago (although I failt to see how?)
Since many providers are moving to VoIP we do emulate TDM circuts over IP to interconnect with the PSTN and comply with standards, and codecs rely on this.
The closest we can get to this is that many providers use GPS for NTP stratum 1 sources.
I have encountered on several occasions other SIP carriers when tourbleshooting issues between us they are running packet captures are specific times of day and missing the VoIP traffic we want to capture and test or measure because their clocks on their gateways aren't accurate!
Everyone is keeping their own time though, if you understand my meaning.
