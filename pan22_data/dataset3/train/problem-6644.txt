I also have a kazillion tiny useless catalog preview files (from Lightroom) which I would like to ignore.
Now, one month later, a lot has been deleted, edited and added on the source drives so I need to synchronize everything.
The data I want to backup on each system lies in the folder "digitalized" (photos, time-lapse, etc).
(Full-size here: http://i.imgur.com/41YVQjz.jpg - 2 million baby jpegs, eeeeeh!)
Run either a separate copy pass with the purge option or simply delete the files with another .
Instead of copying your many source drives to the root directory of B:\, create sub directories (B:\FromD\, B:\FromE\ etc) and use robocopy to mirror each source to the sub directories on the B: drive.
I would like to mirror each of my source drives to my backup PC:
Each time robocopy runs, /purge sees that 75% of the files located on dest do NOT exist on source (D:) because that data is from E:, F:, etc., so it begins to delete everything else!
I manually copied of all source drives to the NAS (which took about 4 days).
I have multiple 2-3TB drives inside and connected to my working PC.
Put into a batch file which runs whenever NAS is pingable.
It doesn't have to involve robocopy but I thought it would be the simplest since it's included with Windows.
I have a NAS (PC with 8 drives in a JBOD array) with 9TB free.
