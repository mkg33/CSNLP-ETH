Recently I setup a test environment for my self-test.
Regarding using "domain.net" or "domain.co.jp," either are valid DNS domain names for active directory, though, since you didn't name your domain with them, they wouldn't work for you.
When type in "whoami" in cmd it shows "domain/user".
If you wanted to try to use those anyway, you could potentially do so, by setting them up as alternate UPN suffixes for your users.
If you want to log in using the DNS domain name, you do so with the below format:
Everything is fine and installation completed without problem.
The same would apply if you named the original DNS domain "example.co.jp", and the corresponding NetBIOS name "example" - you would then be "example\user".
The name you're seeing is the NetBIOS (think legacy) name).
The NETBIOS domain name primarily still exists to provide support for legacy systems, but either are valid.
The NetBIOS name dates from before Active Directory, and lives to support legacy apps.
When you configured the domain, you would have been asked for the domain name (domain.com) and later, the NetBIOS domain name (which you probably left as domain).
However I don't get why everywhere the ".com" is missed.
Where as logging in with the NETBIOS name is done in the following format:
You can log in using any reasonable form of your logon name:
Microsoft has a support KB article about naming conventions, and valid/reserved names in Active Directory, here.
Also what if I use domain.net or domain.co.jp as AD domain name?
You don't have to have matching names either - domain.com.au could have the NetBIOS name "AUS".
