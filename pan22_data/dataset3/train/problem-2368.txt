I had this error after running out of harddisk space.
Sounds like (a) there's a bug - a bad pointer triggered an attempt to "touch" memory that is protected, resulting in the OS slapping its fingers, or (b) you have some bad RAM installed, and a bad spot is triggering a pointer to access memory that is protected, resulting in the same yada-yada as (a).
I finally solved it by deleting ib*.tmp files from C:\Windows\temp which were causing the startup to fail, even for data directories that were previously working.
Seems to indicate that there is a problem parsing your configuration file, I would examine it with a good text editor, check for non ASCII characters and check that all the paths and variables are sensible.
Try deleting innodb logfiles (ib_logfileXX in your data directory) before starting.
If you re-install MySQL, would it be possible to install v5.0 instead of v5.1?
I ended up just uninstalling and reinstalling MySQL, and it's working fine now.
There were initial reports of 5.1 having some stability issues when compared to 5.0, although I'm sure that those issues have been addressed by now...of course, if you are using features specific to 5.1, that's out of the question...
