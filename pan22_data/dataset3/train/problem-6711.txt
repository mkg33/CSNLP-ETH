I don't need solve databases, sessions or someting else... but I need know, how to do that both server will available as www.myexample1.com
It's not what I would call a CDN, but the quickest way to achieve want you have described is to have a caching proxy (squid to name a common one) , which you point domain1 to.
If a visitor hits the proxy and it already has the file they are asking for in cache, it will be served from there rather than domain2.
Do you have a current issue you're working around by investigating a CDN?
but I dont know how setup DNS or Apache that, so both servers served files for www.myexample1.com request
If you just want to have both servers serve files for www.myexample1.com without any high-availability, you could use DNS Round Robin for www.myexample1.com, and set up your second Apache to also answer requests for this hostname via a name-based virtual host.
Your question is vague to the point of being un-answerable.
That's quite a big question your asking, and not an easy one if your not familiar with DNS or Apache, but first can I ask what you're looking to achieve by using a CDN?
A real Content Delivery Network (CDN) has servers on several continents, and routes the end users to a server near him by means of TCP/IP Anycast, geo-aware DNS, HTTP redirects and HTTP proxying, or more likely combinations thereof.
Then the proxy goes off to domain2 when it needs content it doesn't have in the cache.
and now I would like to setup CDN of www.myexample1.com to www.myexample2.com
