Any help would be appreciated as I'm pulling my hair out over this.
App Service supports dedicated outbound IP addresses for apps deployed using the App Service Environment (ASE) feature.
When I set the firewall to allow all incoming connections into the VM, my app service has no trouble connecting to mongo.
Please upvote this feature request if you would like to see dedicated outbound addresses.
You can determine the outbound addresses by looking at the properties of your webapp.
For the foreseeable future, apps running in the public multi-tenant service will continue to use outbound addresses from a shared address pool.
However, once I take this rule away, no connection is possible.
I have a standard Azure app service running NodeJS through IIS and a Linux VM running mongoDB.
Now I know the solution seems obvious, "just add in a firewall rule", however, I don't know the IP address of the App Service as it's currently using shared hosting so I suspect it might change even if I did know.
