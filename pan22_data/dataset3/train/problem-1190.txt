I don't currently have a camera cable for that model, and in one day I'll be able to return the camera to its owner for photo downloading.
You need such an adapter to insert it in your existing card reader:
I have a MS Pro Duo card taken from a Sony digital camera to read.
Otherwise, if I can't find a USB MS Pro Duo reader somewhere in the office, is there any adapter that can be used to read such a card in a SD reader?
But, with only my laptop and unwilling to buy adapters, I'd like to download my pictures right now, if possible.
Basically I have an Asus N76VZ laptop equipped with a card reader.
Anyway it's a SD hole with the following text on its left
I tried to gently insert the card but I found it's quite a short card so I didn't attempt to enter it deeplier in order to avoid breaking the reader.
From what I can understand it reads Memory Stick Pro, so the question comes straight: is it compatible with MS Pro Duo?
I wanted to show you a photo of this card reader (not taken with that camera of course) but I couldn't get a decent one.
