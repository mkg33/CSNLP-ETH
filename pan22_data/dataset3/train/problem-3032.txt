You could configure the machine to do a kernel core dump over the network, but you'd still need someone skilled to look into that.
If you follow the instructions and still can't get a dump created locally then you should then move on to capturing over the network..
You'll need to install the right kernel-debuginfo rpm for your running kernel and then invoke crash - you should get the general gist from the whitepaper.
This will capture all kernel output on the remote system.
Have you checked /var/log/dmesg, /var/log/messages, and /var/log/syslog?
This runs at a much lower level (the same point in the kernel that writes to /dev/klog), so you may see the very last bit of information that the kernel outputs when it panics even if syslog et.
If you can get it open the first thing you should look at is the log - scroll down to the bottom and you should get some clues as to what is going on at the time the crash occurs.
On the remote system, run (this requires that you have netcat installed):
Of course once you have a core dump, you'll need to do some analysis on it using the crash utility.
If you have experienced a kernel panic, you can set up a remote kernel console to capture all the data that might be lost on the local console (especially if the crash is from a non-maskable interrupt, which tends to reboot the system).
Collecting a core over the network is probably overkill, you can dump it locally.
