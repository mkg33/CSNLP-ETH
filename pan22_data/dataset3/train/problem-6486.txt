I can't even think of a way to write a calculator do do that sort of thing.
It sounds like performance is your main criteria here, so you probably know what raid level you want; you just need to find the best performing hardware.
I found a calculator that will give you multipliers of speed.
If you're not familiar with the trade-offs, take a look at a comparison chart to see the relative merits.
Also I believe that probably for most operations the network will bottleneck before the RAID.
Besides all of the drive characteristics, the speed is going to be largely governed by the performance of any given RAID card.
The RAID controllers make a huge difference, as can the firmware on those controllers, the type of data, as does the ability of the motherboard to push data.
But I think you also need to consider why there are different raid configurations.
I don't know of a calcualtor that can tell you that, in part because there are so many other factors besides just the disk and connection type factors.
As others have said, I don't think this can be done in the terms you've stated.
It would still be inaccurate, but may give some guidance.
I think the best you could do is work out the relative performance of different raid options i.e.
One usually chooses by judging the trade-offs between performance, capacity, data protection and cost.
Which will depend not only on obvious things like it's interface (eg PCI-X).
But more dramatically the quality and performance of it's chipset routines.
The sort of speed that you will see with vary a lot depending on the drives, the controller, and your workload, so you are not going to fine a nice easy calculator that will give good accurate+precise results.
