Then start a second session from your local computer to the remote computer:
This forwards the remote port 2222 to the sshd listening on 127.0.0.1 on your local computer, creating a reverse tunnel.
The ssh command sets up a tunnel from localhost:2222 to the remote machine 192.168.1.37 behind the net facing server remoteserver.com.
You can also do the opposite, to grab a file from a remote machine to the local machine,
I know how to use SCP while on my local machine command line, but I have no idea how I'd use it from the remote machine (nor what my local path would be).
Start the sshd on your local computer if you hadn't already done this.
Some good examples and tips here, and how to configure it in ~/.ssh/config to automate it.
What terminal command can I use to transfer a directory from a remote machine (linux) to my local machine (mac)?
Most importantly, I'd like to do this from the command line while SSH'ed into the remote machine.
You can then access it from the remote computer by addressing your public IP address on whatever port you choose (you can map port 22 directly, but I generally personally recommend avoiding this as standard server ports are common targets for malware trying to find a way in).
If you're locally behind a router/firewall that is giving you a private IP address, you'll need to configure the router to NAT a port to map to your local port 22.
