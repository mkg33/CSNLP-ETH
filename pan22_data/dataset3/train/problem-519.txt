What changes do I need to make to my Apache config in order to achieve the desired behaviour?
The DocumentRoot is /var/www/, which looks like this:
Your config looks good - try reloading Apache in case there is a config change that hasn't taken effect.
I have a collection of debugging scripts in /var/www that display useful information that helps with investigating issues on the server, however that same information is potentially sensitive, so I do not want it publicly available.
This is partially working, as it's allowing responding with a 200 to requests to www.example.com and www.example.com/index.php from any request IP address, however it's incorrectly responding with a 403 to all other requests even when requested from the whitelisted IP address:
To secure this information I'm trying to configure apache to only accept requests from my IP address (which for the sake of this example is 192.168.33.1).
My status.conf virtual host config currently looks like this:
The complication is that I want requests to www.example.com and www.example.com/index.php to respond with a 200 regardless of which IP they originate from.
