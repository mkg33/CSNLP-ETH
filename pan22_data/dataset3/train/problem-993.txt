(Seriously, they start to change but IE is far behind any browser out there.
It misses FF extensions, Opera's functionality, Chrome's speed.
Hating IE is starting to become the "cool thing to do" that everyone does baselessly out of habit.
So basically, just nothing new, way behind the others.

And add on other css for other browsers if they have time.
Those are hardly unbiased tests, and even with fancy new features, IE will probably still not follow web standards.
Another reason might be due to the large number of people still using IE, more developers would still develop web base on IE rendering.
Think back to IE6, which was alright in its day, but lacked tabs.
Most browsers are "fast enough" compared to the competition, and IE has such a bad (Yet well deserved) reputation among most web developers, that IE-only features are unlikely to be adopted in any kind of widespread manner.
There's more to a web browser than standards conformance.
Apple used this out and made a totally restricted stuff, a demo with that, promoting, 'hey its html5'.)
Is the results in this http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter mean that IE 9.0 will be the best of all browsers next years ?
IE9 could surprise us all and be fantastic, but we'll have to wait until we can actually get our hands on it to find that out.
In any case, we've gone beyond "One best browser" these days.
More info about the (apple/)html5 "specification":
And also, HTML5 is not a valid specification, its more like a draft.
No it means that the link is from *microsoft.com/* :-D
GPU accel is one of the most hyped features but Firefox nightly also comes with gpu accel, and you can enable it in chrome 6.xx.
