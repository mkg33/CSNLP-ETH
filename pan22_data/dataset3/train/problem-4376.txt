In this first method you would the -O flag to write out the file based on the remote name from the URL; in this case it would most likely write the file out to the system as IMAGENAME.ISO?md5=hUhpyFjk7zEskw06ZhrWAQ&expires=1454811899; note how the URL value is contained by double quotes since & and ?
On linux and alike systems, this makes it a background process.
While that method technically “works” but the filename is confusing at best.
As noted previously, be sure none of the special characters in the URL are getting interpreted by the command parser.
If you are just trying to get a reasonable filename the complex URL, you can use the output-document option.
So if you ask me, the second method works best for most average use.
Solution it to enclose url in double quoutes (") so that its treated as one argument.
So in this other method you would use output redirection—with > followed by a filename after the URL—to output the file contents to a file named IMAGENAME.ISO:
Also notice the -L flag being used in both commands; that commands tells Curl to follow any redirection links that a file download URL might have since a lot of times files on download services redirect a few times before landing at the destination payload file.
