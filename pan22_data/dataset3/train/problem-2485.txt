Is it possible to configure BIND to override only some entries of a domain, and to resolve the rest recursively?
The approach is fine if you only want to override a few hosts.
I would like hosts located on the internal network to resolve "host1.example.com", "host2.example.com" and "example.com" to internal IP addresses instead of that of the gateway.
In BIND I get to this results by defining a zone using desired host name.
I have succeeded in doing that for the host1 and host2 entries, by defining two single-entry zones in BIND for "host1.example.com" and "host2.example.com".
I have an internal network with a DNS server running BIND, connected to the internet through a single gateway.
Other hosts like "otherhost.example.com" should still be resolved by the external DNS provider.
querying "otherhost.example.com" results in an error.
Some of the entries in that domain, say "host1.example.com" and "host2.example.com", as well as the top-level entry "example.com", point to the public IP address of the gateway.
My domain "example.com" is managed by an external DNS provider.
So if I query example.com on intranet DNS and ISP DNS I get same IP but if I query override.example.com I get different results if intranet DNS (primary) is accessible.
However, if I add a zone for "example.com", all queries for that domain are resolved by my local DNS server, and e.g.
