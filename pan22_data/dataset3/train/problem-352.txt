Instead, you will need an "interface" between the low level trigger on the left and the RPi.
The GPIO pin will be connected to the "base" terminal of the transistor Q1.
Your software program on the RPi will drive the GPIO pin you've chosen to an "active high" state (i.e.
simulate this circuit â€“ Schematic created using CircuitLab
I'll show this generically in the schematic below.
From the information in your question, it seems reasonable to assume that the "low level trigger on the left" may be used for your "one pin connection" to the RPi.
I'll not go further as that may be a waste of time.
I'll cover some "safeguards", but if your hardware knowledge is very limited, then your risk increases.
Once the GPIO pin goes "high", transistor Q1 will be "turned on", and conduct current between its collector and emitter terminals.
Review this, and if you'd like to proceed, post a comment.
One caveat: Your Raspberry Pi may be ruined if one of us makes a mistake: either I make a mistake in my instructions, or you make a mistake in executing them.
And so, "this" is a way to achieve your objective.
But we'll start from what we know, or can reasonably assume, and go from there.
Short answer: "Yes, there is a way to achieve this."
That said, your question omits some details that are needed for a complete answer.
