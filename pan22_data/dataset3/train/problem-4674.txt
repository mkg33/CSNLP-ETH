But you can open the calendar view and search by modification date:
If you don't have a backup, there's a possibility you can use the "Restore previous versions" option in the right-click menu of the PST file (or its parent folder) in Windows explorer to get a recent version.
I've been looking for a solution to the latter for a long time and just now stumbled upon it.
I am not sure if, by "retrieve", you mean to view a list of all dismissed reminders or if you want to "undismiss" them.
To be safe, I closed Outlook, backed up my current PST, and disabled my network connection before restoring the old PST.
Change it to a new interval and then click Save & Close.
For example, I would type modified:2.10.2012 to see items I might have dismissed today
It is not possible to restore already dismissed reminders.
If your reminders are from emails you can sort by date then flag status.
I accidentally dismissed some old reminders and the other answers didn't work for me for recovering them, so I restored a recent backup and reverted to that temporarily which brought them up.
You first open the meeting or appointment (I double-click the event in my calendar).
If you dismissed the reminder then the Reminder field will say None.
Your question asks to "retrieve all dismissed reminders".
