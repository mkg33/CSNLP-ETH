While the answers above provide very good ideas on finding the errant installation, or proving it isn't installed, the report itself may get you closer to a good starting point to use their suggestions.
And if it isn't an OS package and you installed it yourself, hopefully you already know what it is.
Verify tomcat is running somewhere by running a port scan on your server.
I installed tomcat6, but the scan problem is still showing..
I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction.
I have a server which is hosting a client's website and they run a Vulnerability scan every so often to see everything's in working order.
If Tomcat was ever installed on this server, there might be traces left behind that are triggering the scanner.
If the scan found a major vulnerability you missed due to a lax security upgrade procedure, fix your update procedure.
Use the PID from lsof to find the exe and how it was run:
Some scanners "detect" the presence of an application based on the presence of certain files in available directories.
Now, armed with the might of cold hard fact, upgrade that package to within an inch of its life!
'Apache Tomcat directory listing and file disclosure problem - Severity 5!
Depending upon OS, check to see which package your exe belongs to.
See if logs can tell you where the scanner went wrong.
Port 8080 has been blocked so I'm not sure what's going on.
I think you need to provide additional details like OS, web server software being used and what applications are running on this server for someone to have a stab at the answer.
And if any of these steps have failed, talk to the (isScannerOpenSource ?
Now that you have the port, use lsof -i :portnumber to find out which nefarious process is giving you grief.
- and the solution was to upgrade Tomcat to a newer version.
Strange thing was Tomcat wasn't even installed on the server.
