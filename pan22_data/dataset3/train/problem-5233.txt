If I repeat the steps above, my newly added folder is not in the listbox on the "Edit environment variable" model when I click to edit the PATH system environment variable the second time.
I had the same problem and changing it solved this issue for me.
You can check it on the Registry (for User variables):
But I found a solution: On the environment variables window chose the path which you want to add or change (either system or user one) and click edit.
I am unable to update my system environment variable PATH.
when you back to environment variables windows click the path again and hit enter since there is no accept or ok button on this window.
on the edit windows however dont chose modify or new.
(I m not sure if this last step was necessary or not but I did it this way and it worked.
I expect my added PATH to be shown, but it is not.
add a new path or change and existing one (don't forget to use ";" if you are adding a new path) and click accept.
If you use any variable within another variable, this variable type must be set as REG_EXPAND_SZ in the Windows Registry.
I also expected Windows to prompt me for elevated admin privileges at some point when editing the environment variable, but this never happens.
I don't receive any error message when editing PATH, but the change doesn't take.
