Needless to say, I googled the error message but the best I could find was one cross-posted article in Japanese.
In fact, the error has not returned in the past ~hour since clearing the log.
The only RAID controller in the box is a PERC 6/i, and its battery is reported as good.
I'd be happy to provide any logs, etc, however everything except that message in the SEL looks hunky-dory.
I checked the SEL via the DRAC web UI and saw the following message repeated about 50 times for today:
Followed a few seconds later by the equivalent trouble cleared message (unfortunately I cleared the SEL to see if I was still getting the messages before I could copy down its exact wording).
It looks like he replaced the controller and the battery thereby resolving the issue.
I recently got an alert from a PE 905 which I manage: I1912 SEL Full.
With only one available post on this topic, I'd just like to know if anyone could shed more light on this error.
Via G translate the author appears to indicate that the message could indicate a RAID battery failure or impending controller failure, per Dell.
The trouble is that I wasn't even aware that the drive bay had a battery.
(I'm on a tight budget, and no, we no longer have Dell service/support on this machine).
I did not see any ROMB errors (nor did I get alerts), nor anything else to indicate the PERC's battery is bad.
