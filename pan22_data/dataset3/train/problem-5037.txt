Create a directory named TimeMachine in /etc/skel/ .
Backups happen, if they need to restore either via Time Machine or by booting from an install disk (set language, then it's an option on the menue).
The transport doesn't matter (I do it over AFP to an airport extreme and SMB to a FreeBSD box (onto a raidz volume).

The one tricky part is getting a 2.2 netatalk build, I'm running 2.2 beta 4, and this makes things much easier.
I've meant to hack this together on my Gentoo, but never got around to do, so I'm not making guarantees of whether it works or not.
That is easy enough, do note you need your MAC address and the name you are advertising.
This is all I have in my netatalk file (well, and comments):
I recommend at this point logging in via ssh with a user account that has never logged in, just to make sure the above is all working right.
In short, it's a 6-step guide on making OSX think that your Ubuntu computer is a XServe box, because it will be able to talk AFP and Bonjour.
My setup authenticates via ldap, the backup server runs Ubuntu 10.10, and I found a ppa for the beta.
Here's an article I've stumbled upon that describes how to configure an Ubuntu box to be recognized as something to use with Time Machine by OSX.
Here is what my users experience: The user opens Time Machine preferences, clicks on select a disk, clicks on the host and then the disk (somewhere in there they are prompted for their ldap username and password), a home directory is created with the TimeMachine directory, and TimeMachine starts backing up to it and otherwise just works.
There has to be some correlation between the names, I just set everything to TimeMachine after realizing that, but I have not tried much else.
This will make a mounted share available and create a sparse disk image atop it and allow you to back up to that.
The key is enabling backups to unsupported volumes:
