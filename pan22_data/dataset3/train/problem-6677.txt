That said, I'm looking for a trackball with a heavier ball and scroll wheel.
Using your thumb to left-click is a far more natural movement (squeezing) than your index finger (levering.)
I had tendon problems using mice, and this trackball fixed it.
I've used the top trackball for years with no problem.
I think a finger-operated ball is healthier than thumb, but just an opinion.
Go for different working positions, ie combine it with a trackpad and/or mouse and learns as many keyboard shortcuts as psossible.
I've used the lower one in the wireless version for a couple of years as my main mouse / pointer device.
The only downside I've found is the trackball is not suitable for graphical or other precision work.
In combination with other options it's probably a good choice, but it's not (none of them are) a holy grail.
I have two of the Logitech Marble Trackballs (top picture), one for work, one for home.
It's also helpful to have the mouse when someone else wants to use your computer.
Especially because you can efficiently use it as a mouse with your right main (for me: right) hand when your hand is
I bought one because of shoulder/upper arm strain, and after a couple of months they were back.
An advantage of this trackball is it's symmetrical and you can switch between left and right hands to rest them.
I get a sore wrist after using a mouse for half-a-day.
But anyways, the lower of the above is not better than a mouse (and I assume this goes for both).
