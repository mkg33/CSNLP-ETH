If you are then you may be hitting a different process for every request and seeing the delay in loading Django the first time.
in Apache configuration so that mod_wsgi logs stuff about when it is initialising Python in processes and loading WSGI script for first time.
If this were the case though you might expect that after a while as Django gets loaded, that response times then drop.
Better still, if you don't know much about setting up Apache or mod_wsgi, use daemon mode of mod_wsgi as that will save you from many of the mistakes you can make in setting up Apache badly for Python web applications.
That will at least help you to eliminate that as the issue.
This is not absolute though because if request load is very light, depending on how you have set up Apache, Apache could decide your processes aren't needed and shut them down, meaning that on subsequent requests after idle period, it is loading the whole of Django once again.
Make sure you aren't using mod_wsgi in embedded mode, especially with Apache prefork MPM.
