Your index helps increase speed in certain statements (the ones that can use the data in the index without needing to search the entire table.)
Additional rows and some increase in time are to be expected.
Here's what I look for if I suspect DB performance issues:
Is the running query substantially different from normal?
4. Review the DB logs and look for errors, locks and the like.
Then when you suspect things are not performing well, run your test query again.
Speed on table select or insert statements depend on many factors:
Very different data, table lock on the query or a 10x slowing from your last test run would be unusual.
Now, speed changes: under normal operating conditions you should not see appreciable changes in query speed.
A query with 4 joins will not be as efficient as a query on 1 table with no joins.
Try some or all of these steps and see if you discover any problems.
That being said, depending on how many concurrent users you have a 1 second difference in a query may be normal.
You run this at the beginning of the database life, note the time to run and the number of rows returned.
(normal = average work day, abnormal = day when you have a large data load or delete, when another DB is created on that box and is in production, the power goes out and you're running on battery.)
