and, after you modified the file you will import it, by the same procedure.
If you have something that people [have to] sign into with a username and password, and you are able to modify the code of what is reading in their password, then you could do the following:
I have 1000 users I need to change the password for to a known password for a migration tool (groupwise to exchange).
Log in  to the iManager if it is installed you will find it at
If you use this way, you can always run a dry run, to check if your syntax is correct.
As you can see, it does somewhat borrow on less-honest techniques that might be used in a phony website, but could pay-off in having fewer users to have to change passwords for.
If you want the users to be able to maintain their old password, here's a (kinda sneaky) way that you do that... it is perhaps rather unconventional (for legitimate uses).
Tell me if you need any further information on this.
How do I change the password for 1000 groupwise users via batch using ldap or other medium?

Go within the Menu eDirectory Maintenance and run the Import, Convert, Export Agent or ICE to export an leif file.
When it gets time to switch, remove this code, and educate users that they may have to get their password changed.
[it's also a good illustration of why something like SSO systems such as SAML, with some user-education, are helpful in helping to prevent phishing attacks].
