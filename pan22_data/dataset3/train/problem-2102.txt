When you boot, hold down the Option key, and it will allow you to select booting from the USB drive.
I have just booted a MacBook 4,1 in Live Linux Mint 17.3 Cinamon.
Just connect the USB drive with the OS X DVD in it, start the computer, and press the "alt" key when you hear the chime.
Repartioning via Gparted and intalling Mint as we speak.
I simply plugged in a FAT32 USB with the OS and pressed OPTION as soon as I turned the Mac on, it gave me an option to boot from the HD or the EFI (with a USB graphic) and so I chose EFI and all went well.
Computer should find the bootable DVD and allow you to select it as a boot device.
If you can't extract ISOs, there's this nifty little application that automates the whole process.
You will have to find a working Mac, and use your OS X disk to install onto the USB drive, Once you have done that, you will be able to boot from the USB disk (I have Snow Leopard and some disk repair utilities on a USB drive in case my hard drive fails).
You could create a Live USB stick to boot Ubuntu: simply grab a Fat32 formatted memory stick and extract the contents of the Ubuntu ISO on it.
I have never tried it but I think a Macbook can boot from most USB DVD drives.
