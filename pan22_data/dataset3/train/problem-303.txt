Until now, I could access all the hosts publicly and any way I want.
I want a way to translate all the public IPs to private IPs.
There is this one problem that I am facing right now.
I have tried the following so far but nothing changed:
I have created a VPN server and everything works fine -- I can see my internal network easily.
In this example, I am assuming your outbound interface is eth1.
For example, let's say I have 2 hosts with the following IPs:
Intercept traffic and route to an IP using iptables
In your example, you were trying to route the traffic on the OUTPUT rule and it is too late in the routing decision.
I a bunch of hosts in the cloud with private and public IPs.
Now, I want to disable some access to all of these hosts from the outside and set up a VPN.
All the hosts are being accessed via public DNS and this DNS have public IPs for all the hosts.
Ensure you have console access to this device in the event you lock yourself out via a misconfiguration or based on a lack of information exchanged between us.
If I access 5.6.7.8 (1.2.3.4), I want the server to translate it to 10.1.0.6 (10.1.0.5).
