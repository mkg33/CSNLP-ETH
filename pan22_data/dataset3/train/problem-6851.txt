I read that the HFS+ filesystem I'm using has no limit in depth, but maybe there is a limit in path name length ?
If the deepest directory path were /Users/danielbeck, the result would be 2
I searched on Google and forums but couldn't find anything conclusive.
EDIT: Someone tried by filling up the fs but it's a dirty solution...
So I need to know how many levels of folders there are between / and the deepest folder.
Short version: Is there a command and/or set of commands and/or utility to know what is the maximum depth of folders on my filesystem ?
Long version: I'm on Mac OS X. I'd like to know what is the deepest folder there is on my system (I don't care for access rights).
This is because I want to launch a command on the root / and it will be recursive and I don't want it to hang (unexpected results).
find / -type d | sed 's|[^/]||g' | sort | tail -n1 | egrep -i -o / | wc -l
The following traverses your entire file system looking for directories only, removes everything that's not a forward slash (path item delimiter), and prints the longest trail (at least on my system, sort behavior may depend on locale).
Count the resulting slashes, which is one for every directory except root, so if the deepest directory path were /Users/danielbeck, the result would be //.
Actually, finding the maximum depth on my actual system would be enough without testing out the limits.
Based on Daniel Beck's answer but for those who like counting machines
Of course, there could be files in that directory.
