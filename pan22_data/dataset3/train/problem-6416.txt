Bounce the "Server" service (or reboot the machine).
Also, be aware that there won't be any way to do Microsoft File and Print Sharing connections between the server with the alias name set and the real server computer using the NetBIOS name.
You'll have to "connect" to the real server computer from the backup server by IP address if you need that functionality.
I'm not sure if I've misunderstood the question or not, but I was wondering if maybe Microsoft DFS could be used in this scenario at all?
Here's the basic procedure for adding an alias name to a Windows Server machine.
It's possible, but you may have some difficulties if there's NetBIOS communication between the backup environment and the production environment.
Where you may have a problem is that the backup server is going to try to register this alias name in WINS and will broadcast it using NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
If I understand right, you want a machine in your backup environment to respond to the name of a server computer that's running in your production environment.
I haven't tried this, but maybe the LMHOSTS file  would help?
If you can firewall your backup environment away from the production environment for NetBIOS then this will be a non-issue.
Since you already have a computer with the alias name running you may get "duplicate computer name" messages.
You can find it at %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\Etc  (maybe it doesn't exist, but at least on Vista there is an lmhost.sam sample file).
