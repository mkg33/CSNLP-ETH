Using your home directory means you don't have to think about whether you have access or not - and its more private than /tmp.
What I normally do - not necessarily the quickest, but certainly safe - is to do something like this (using nsswitch.conf as example):
That goes only for files which aren't managed until now.
this is some extra work to merge the changes but it paid off.
I usually save it to a temporary file in $HOME/tmp/apache.conf (for example) then
Before that I was thinking of ACLs or assigning corresponding groups to the files but it didn't work out all to often I either forgot to change the ownerships or was changing files where I didn't mean to do so.
Note well that this is a whole file replacement: if you don't want to add all the changes, you'll have to pick and choose.
In spite of the headache involved in any of these answers, there's no reason to lose your changes.
This will delete all of the lines and read in your changed and updated version to be edited in its place.
The overall solution we use is puppet with a git repo where people locally edit files and test the changes on appropriate servers, if the configuration works as desired the changes are pushed back to the central repository where our configuration engine pulls changes at regular intervalls.
I find it to be a nice way between convenience and measurements against unwanted changes
