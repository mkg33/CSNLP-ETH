If there are that many, they may be stumbling over each other.
First, you have to make an OS change to increase open files (-n) 1024.
24 connections from one server is potentially excessive.
In google, It is specified like open_files_limit value need to be increased to have more max_connections.
Is setting the open_files_limit on the MySQL configuration file enough ?
(There are STATUS values that indicate whether it is 'too small'.)
Will it be enough to set below values on the /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf and restarting the MySQl server ?
I have seen cases like this; the best remedy is to throttle things earlier, not later.
The units of table_open_cache is tables, not bytes.
Bottom line:  Decrease the number of client threads until you can restart mysqld.
And it is a cache, so it is usually OK to have a smallish number.
Is there any other way to change the values without restarting the MySQL server ?
I am using  MySQL version 5.7.15 , ubuntu0.16.04.1.
The end result is increased latency without increased throughput.
