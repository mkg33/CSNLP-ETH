There seems to be a way, but it is not mentioned in help file or in a book.
Here is how to make a brand spanking new standalone XP mode machine from the base.vhd just like the first one.
Now, the new Virtual PC should be running based on a hard drive with XP on it.
In fact, this looks like how the default Virtual PC with XP is set up...
I wonder how do we set up 2 or 3 or 4 machines, all with XP on it?
Those machines will all use the same hard drive though.
The default Windows Virtual PC installation sets up one Virtual PC with Win XP on it.
I wonder if that is a correct way or if there are other ways.
If you want separate machines you will need to either copy the XP vhd, or in settings for a new virtual machine, boot from an XP CD and install it to a new VM.
Any other method or somebody familiar knows this is the correct way?
By the way if you have already created a blank virtual machine you can go and use steps 1-4 above and delete the empty disk of your existing machine and rename the base.vhd and it works.
