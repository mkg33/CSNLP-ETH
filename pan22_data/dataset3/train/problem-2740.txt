But you should be able to do what you need in your ftp client.
If you have a larger amount of text I've resorted to just mailing the file I need to myself
You could try using Le Putty and do a ZMODEM transfer using sz.
Back in those days it was too difficult to add multitasking to user level software, so the answer is "no".
Your ftp client might even have a setting to display hidden files
Look in the client's settings for where you can set the list command, and append "-ah" to the end of it.
You can use SCP or SFTP for transferring files over SSH.
This is ok for key files since they will fit in one screen.
After that's done then use the unix fg command to reconnect to your suspended, background putty.
I had similar problem, I used the copy feature in putty - just select (hilites text) in putty window and you can paste directly into Windows app.
If both sides, client and remote system, are unix, you can use ~ followed by ctl-Z (no space or return after the tilde) and that will suspend your putty session and then you can start using scp, or whatever, to transfer the file.
Is there something preventing you from copying them to a location from which you can FTP them?
You're using Putty, which is basically 30 year old technology.
