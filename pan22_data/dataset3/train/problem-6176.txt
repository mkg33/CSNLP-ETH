But if you have a specific reason to use the CPAN client to install the module, it needs a build environment (i.e.
It looks to me like the perl shared-object isn't properly linked against the libmysql library, which is most likely due to version differences.
This is faster than installing from cpan because the dependencies are installed automatically for you and not compiled from sources.
