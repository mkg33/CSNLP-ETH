Idera SQL Permissions Extractor seems to be the product you're looking for.
The feature comparison between the two editions can be found here.
As you guys probably know, SQL Server does not provide an out-of-the-box solution to export all the security related statements that are declared for each element in the database (both at the database level and also the object level)
Schema, object, server, and column level permissions are often missing).
It can script server and object permissions and it is free.
I have seen online many different "possible solutions" using non-curated scripts that people graciously post, but since I have to be 100% sure that all security information is captured I can't fully rely on those scripts.
I haven't actually used any of these, but they're a set of starting points, in no particular order.
Isn't there a tool provided by someone (either as part of the SQL Server product or an 3rd party tool) that could reliably provide you with this information?
Automated Permissions Auditing With Powershell and T-SQL: Part 1
There is also a commercial edition, called SQL Secure which has more features.
You would think that SQL Server MUST have something like this but neither the SQL Server Export Wizard or the various scripts that are generated as a result of right clicking the objects do capture this information.
I'm sorry you haven't had a response since yesterday; here's at least a starting point for you.
I have the option of using those as a starting point to write something myself but I hate having to re-invent the wheel for a requirement that you would think many people may have.
Or at least, is there a community supported script that most of people would agree "will do the job"?
As always, read the discussion threads (I was, regrettably, unable to find a script endorsed by the big names I recognize, so test thoroughly!
I'm talking about the ability to come up with this information
