(I'm radically simplifying this and not considering VNC compression at all, but this gives you a general idea of how it works.)
VNC is a "bandwidth hog" because it's oriented at duplicating the pixels of the remote display.
You can use various "flavors" of VNC that have different compression options, but at the end of the day the RDP protocol (and protocols like it-- ICA, X, etc) are very difficult to "beat" because, fundamentally, they need to move less data to accomplish the same effect.
In RDP, the instruction "draw a box in the middle of the screen" gets sent over the wire (which is much more concise than a list of pixels to change) and the client "draws the box".
Think of it like this: In VNC, the pixels on the display that change get sent over the wire (simplified somewhat).
You're absolutely right in your observation that, typically, VNC requires more bandwidth than RDP.
If lots of pixels get modified-- say in drawing a large box in the middle of the screen, a potentially large number of pixels are modified and need to be sent over the wire.
Conversely, RDP is based on drawing primitives (boxes, lines, etc) rather than sending pixel updates.
