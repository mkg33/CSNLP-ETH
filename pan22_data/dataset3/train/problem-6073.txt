I was testing/analyzing the program and accidentally terminated its process in task manager on Windows 7.
There is no error message when running TrueCrypt afterwards, so is unencrypted data being saved to the volume or "TrueCrypt.exe *32" is just the GUI and the real thing (what performs the encryption and decryption) is running somewhere else safe from user mistakes?
The main program is the element that let's you handle mount/dismount of the volumes, configuration, ...
The context is the following: We know that TrueCrypt virtual drives remain mounted even when TrueCrypt is not running anymore.
Also, I read that TrueCrypt never saves unencrypted data.
From the Truecrypt .pdf manual, in "Using TrueCrypt Without Administrator Privileges" section (there are more references in the manual, just an example):
It's the device driver who handles data read/write.
I ask this because I found nothing on the manual and no one has asked this yet, it seems.
note: At least in my portable Truecrypt copy the truecrypt.sys and  truecrypt-x64.sys files are the indicated 32/64 bit device driver.
Even when TrueCrypt is (apparently) not running anymore, you can still save data to the drives (which in my case are mounted file containers).
