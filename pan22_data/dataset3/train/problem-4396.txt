In order to be able to predict some value reliably, your data needs to have embedded information which correlates with that value.
For example, if all your features contain no information which correlates with the predicted targets then no matter how powerful your model is, it will never be able to predict the target reliably.
As a consequence we can now train models using much more features than was previously possible.
In fact the revenue has very little impact on the stock price.
For example, I cannot predict your dinner tomorrow night based on data of what you are wearing (unless you are a very particular individual).
Thus, you cannot expect the target predicted value to be reliably determined using this low information feature.
Machine learning is a powerful tool however it is not a silver bullet which can predict anything from nothing.
What differentiates machine learning from analytical predictive models is that it introduces algorithms which tune model parameters efficiently.
Furthermore, a target value which is very noisy will require you to have substantially more data.
For example, it's common for stock prediction models to use sentiment analysis from daily news articles.
In order to predict stock prices you will need much more data, here are some good starting features:
This is exactly the case for stocks, a stock price is not dependent on only the revenue.
This is an exaggeration however you can see that in order to make some prediction it is vital that your data correlates with your desired targets.
