This makes no sense to me, what am I missing here.
so, I though by running this I would get what I want:
first create a string value of the date adding day (01) and then convert this to datetime type.
The only caveat being the data coming from SAP for each sale is group by sale period of month.year (09.2018, 10.2018, 11.2018, etc).
My import script break this data into two columns, month & year.
I have create a view that combined all this data into a single easy to read "table".
But, let say I need all data from past 12 months, from entire month, meaning if I run the query on 15th of May 2019 I need records from 1st of June 2018, not 16 of June.
I have a few tables that hold customer sales, products, customer and other data imported from SAP.
Now, because I will have to run queries with date function on this view I needed a datetime field, so in the view definition I essentially did this:
by just inverting the operator and getting the date older then 1 year ago it works fine!
This view will not hold any future data, but for the sake of argument & testing I run this query:
