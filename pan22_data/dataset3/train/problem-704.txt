You don't mention what kind of perimeter you have.
The usb port in the back can be used with a USB 3G dongle to automatically connect as a failover.
Why not just use dns to switch the host name to the ip address of the other connection?
If you need a single, static ip address, is there any way you could get your isp to route the ip address to the other connection in the event that the first goes down?
My experience with firewalls is that you can have your main line entering your firewall, set up some kind of heartbeat on your ISPs perimeter router (which most will allow if you ask), and when that heartbeat fails, you have a backup DSL line or something inexpensive that it will failover to.
Why have an external server proxy your http requests?
That way if the clumsy crew with the backhoe digs up the phone lines you'll still have net.
It used to be that we'd use an ISDN backup but these days you might also look at something like the Draytek 2800VG (Vigor 2800 ADSL2+ Router
That sounds reasonable, though for the cost of a second connection, I'd also compare the cost of remote-hosting the app somewhere else.
