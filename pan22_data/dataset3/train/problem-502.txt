This creates an ssh tunnel from your local port 3307 to remote's local port 3306.
the time when you install mysql and that time it ask which way you wana go 1st is unix sock which is very served and gives you good performance and the 2nd one is TCP/ip and please do check the privileges either you can connect to you db remotely just used some other ip if no then you and enable to the security feature in mysql
These two version works with Debian Wheezy but not with Debian Jessie.
While adding the "KexAlgorithms" to the sshd config works, you can update the python libraries that come with MySql Workbench.
The error MySQL Workbench 6.3.3 give me when I try to connect to the Debian Jessie server:
Also tested on Windows 10 64 bit with MySQL Workbench 6.3.3.0 (592) msi and noinstall against Debian 8 Jessie with OpenSSH 6.7
I have double check the IP address/hostname, username and password...
So the man difference is the ServerKeyBits between the two sshd_config file...
You can use 7zip from http://www.7-zip.org/ for the ecdsa-0.13.tar.gz gizpped tar archive.
So you just configure mysql-workbench to connect to localhost:3307.
I use to connect with Windows 7 Pro x64 to my MySQL server hosted on a Debian Wheezy with the MySQL Workbench client using the "TCP/IP over SSH" but it does not work on my new server on Debian Jessie, why ?
If you scroll down in the bug report, there are instructions to download and copy the paramiko and ecdsa libraries.
Note: Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 is required on Windows 10 from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784

In linux (and TOTALLY sidestepping the issue), I found it simpler/cleaner to manually create my own ssh tunnel for mysql-workbench to use:
This may be handy if you don't have control over the sshd config...
According to https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=74658 the issue presents itself when using openssh 6.7 the python libraries shipped with MySql workbench.
Since there is a lot to scroll through on bigmandan's answer, I think it might make sense to also post it here to make it easier to find.
I have tried two different version of MySQL Workbench:
