Commenting these 2 lines in my .ovpn file fixed the problem, without having to use a post-disconnect.sh.
Apparently the reason is due to setting the following in my .ovpn file
There might be an issue with how the OpenVPN server/client is configured which is leaving this (and I'd be interested in finding out what that is), but I installed a Tunnelblick post-disconnect script that automates this route deletion.
When I'd connect to my work network I couldn't connect to the internet at all, and run into the same issue as OP
If the VPN is disconnected then just take your network interface down and then bring it back up with ifconfig.
Initially I put the "route -n delete" in a post-disconnect.sh script, but that was a little messy so instead I found this link
For completeness, when I connect to my VPN at home and running the following command, it'd show the default gateway as below
I was running into this issue while using a home OpenVPN server and connecting to it using the Tunnelblick application on Mac.
What was happening on my end is that a route with my home IP as the destination and an incorrect gateway was getting leftover after disconnecting from the VPN.
I connect to my home OpenVPN server with Tunnelblick.

And when I disconnected, the [home-ip] gateway would still be there.
First you need a route for your network interface.
Which means the route is set up as root, but when the connection is taken down the user is no longer root, so the route can't be deleted.
Then use the route commnand to build in your default gw.
I was running into the same issue as @Sean (I'm also running OS X), in that when I switched between home and work networks the default route was not getting deleted.
Example: I am at school and after a fresh computer boot, I connect to a wireless network.
I can't under any circumstances connect to my home network (VPN, ping, anything) after this happens.
