I'm not exactly a system administrator by profession, so this is a foggy area to me.
From what I know, AWS assigns every new PC a random ID, which is quite hard to work around in most software.
From there you can do a site to site vpn connection from amazon to your office/other datacenter to make the two lans talk.
The last one feels to me like an option that most fits the AWS model.
THen you can choose to add a subnet and when you create EC2 instances you can give them an IP on that subnet.
The other two will wokr, bu you're essentially running three of four persistent, EBS-backed vitual machines, and AWS isn't the cheapest way of doing that, especially if you have a high compute/bandwidth requirements.
Your worker agents can be entirely stateless and rebooted on a whim, where they'll check-in to the (persistent) messaging server to announce their presence and be ready to start work.
So what I'm thinking is, is to create a Linux cluster with 3/4 PCs, one with static external IP which also works a DHCP and DNS server, so that all new PCs just get adresses out of it's static allocated pool.
Within the framework of AWS, I think you've got three options:
