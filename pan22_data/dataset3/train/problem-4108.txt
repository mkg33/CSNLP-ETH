Though if you're just trying to pull files you can mount the drive read only and just work from that.
Personally, I'd call it a lesson in making backups and move on with my life, but if you're the "Don Quixote" type, and you're really only after the images, give scalpel a go.
If that can't find much, then the data's been overwritten, and if you want to get it back it's time to ship the drive off to a company that can read the residual cruft off the edge of the tracks to recover the data.
If you think $70 is too much, though, you'll have a heart attack at the prices these places charge.
The thing is, I'd like it to be free (or at least, trial), or at least, not very expensive (as I'd rather not pay $70 for something I'm going to use 30 minutes a year...).
I'm going to give it a shot tomorrow, with the following programs:
The standard procedure is to image the drive from a read only mount and work from that image.
You should tell him not to use the system or even boot it up as each write potentially destroys data.
I'd like you to recommend me a program I could use in order to recover the data for that person.
It's not how long you use it for, it's how much the data is worth that determines how much the software is worth to you.
It's five figures just to look at the thing, regardless of whether they find anything or not.
It scans the disk looking for headers and footers from images, and pieces them back together.
It's like this: someone decided to reinstall Windows on his PC, but did not make any backups, and there are a lot of things (well... photos, mainly) he would like to recover from the previous installation of the OS.
