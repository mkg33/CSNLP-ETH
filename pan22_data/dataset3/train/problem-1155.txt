And here's how you can generate a report or two from the data you've collected.
For most shops I'd write a powershell script to get the counters I want and pipe the output to powergadgets and for small shops use polymon to monitor the windows stuff and groundwork to monitor the rest.
In a larger environment (30+ servers) I'd take a look at System Center Operations Manager for monitoring and alerting.
Otherwise I would go the Nagios/RRD route as joseph suggested.
PROTIP: You can setup your single vista machine to also remotely log perfmon data from other systems.
if not realtime charts [ that is with few minutes sampling time ] are ok for you - take a look at Munin Node for Windows.
alternatively you can probably fetch plenty of statistics from windows via snmp but i've tried it long time ago and abandoned idea quite quickly.
It's designed to correct problems and ensure business service, unlike most monitoring software that only cares about server counters.
You have to realize howver that SCOM is NOT just monitoring.
Perfmon can be scripted, and the settings can be saved in Vista.
I would seperate out the charting/display from the montioring/alerting piece.
