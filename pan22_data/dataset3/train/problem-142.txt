We obtained a media bay hard drive caddy from NewmodeUS ( there are others out there as well) and installed a 7200RPM Western Digital Black drive in the bay.
The team could then keep a copy of a VM on both drives and then if one failed, they were covered.
With proper RAM and CPU assignment, this worked well.
They could also run one VM on the internal drive caddy and one on the external RAID drive at the same time.
We had several say there was no way their software would work and we ran it on many VMs without issue.
You do need to check with vendors to see if it supports virtualization.
Xeon processors and much higher RAM are usually available as well as more drives and faster drives.
Smaller and lighter but a drive failure could be an issue.
There are other suitable drives as well and an SSD would be better.
First, it is hard to get the power of a desktop in a laptop.
Some of the team carried a couple of 2.5" USB3 drives rather than the RAID unit and just did regular backups of the VMs.
For our developers we came up with a  couple of solutions that let them be mobile and recover quickly
Licensing can be tricky and you will need to check further on this
