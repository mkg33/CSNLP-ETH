After searching a while, I discovered 'AWS CLI' in order to find a set of instances with a given tag, or in a given scaling group.
The problem is that I can't seem to find a way to succesfully probe the network.
There is no way of pre-defining IP addresses, nor is there a way of controlling which servers get spun down when less servers are needed.
To make automated shutdowns a not an issue, I was thinking of running a cron job on each of the cluster peers, checking if there are any disconnected peers, and removing those disconnected peers if any are found.
From there on, it's possible to pick one, SSH in, and do any necessary commands.
I'm trying to configure a proof of concept where a server automatically gets spun up and joins a replication cluster.
When the server is no longer needed, it gets spun down, and automatically removed from the cluster.
I was thinking of running a cron job @reboot, which probes the network to see if there are any servers online running Gluster, and then SSH's into the  first it finds, executing the necessary commands.
How can I get the server to discover and join the already existent Gluster cluster?
