tungsten, Percona) saves a lot of pain but needs additional effort / software to set up.
Depending on the number of slave nodes, you might also want to designate a fanout node to propogate the changes.
That way you can easily switch over in the event of an outage, or for maintenance tasks such as rebuilding indexes, backups, schema changes.
In terms of managing escalations, scheduling scripts to collect data etc, there are lots of tools available which do this - I use nagios, so do lots of other people.
If the network between ndoes fails, then the processes can all be running be fine - but will be unable to transfer data - you need monitoring on each node to check it can contact the upstream node.
1, 3 and 4 can be captured usingf SHOW MASTER STATUS / SHOW SLAVE STATUS on the relevant nodes, although the replication delay only has 1 second accuracy and only across each hop.
The Percona toolkit has scripts for getting more accurate replication lags.
Best practice would be to designate one of the slaves as a master too - bi directional replication.
