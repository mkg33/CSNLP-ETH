Also, as others have mentioned, rsync is a valid option.
I think you can boot from emergency disk and set this bit on sudo using chmod.
There's a pretty good chance there will be other issues beyond this program.
First, you copied to a NTFS partition, which has different permissions, so yo are likely to lose some information in the process, although I have never tried it.
After installation of Ubuntu, I copied back all the folder using a nautilus (running by sudo nautilus).
And boom, now I cannot run sudo any more, my network services cannot run.
So you may find other things blowing up once you resolved the specific problem with sudo.
Unfortunately, cp'ing to an NFS share isn't going to retain all the permissions you'll need for a fully functioning system.
Second, you probably should have copied the files with cp -p to preserve mode and ownership.
Recently, due to some messy stuff with master boot record, I have to re-install my Ubuntu.
In ubuntu, root account is disabled by default, I don't know why all these files is no longer under ownership of my account.
sudo command must have setuid permission bit set on it's executable.
When I run sudo from a terminal, I ge "must be setuid root" error.
Before doing that, I back up all folder (exclude root, bin, sbin, tmp, media, mnt) to a NTFS partition.
A detailed explanation of how to fix it can be found here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=219767
The best option is to use tar (or equivalent) and I guess you mistyped the command with its options.
As Fractalizer said, this is an issue with the setuid bit on sudo.
As the others have already said, this is a permissions issue.
