We had a distribution group on Exchange 2010 which didn't had any members for long time (nobody noticed).
We've set up a PowerShell script that runs daily and will email us if it finds empty distribution groups.
A bit obtuse since one is led to think Get-DistributionGroup doesn't know about members (thus the need for the Get-DistributionGroupMember cmdlet).
I've confirmed that works on Exchange 2010, SP2, RU5v2.
Just put this in a .ps1 file and schedule it to run at whatever interval you prefer.
A more efficient query since it only returns a list of empty groups.
Unfortunately all those emails have gone into the black hole.
For me the nothing was happening with the above script - not sure if it's a different Powershell version or such like (Exchange 2010, Server 2008 R2) but there was nothing in the "count" attribute.
Also note: You would not receive any NDRs either, the process did completed as expected.
What happens to the emails that come to such group?
You would need an archive/compliance setup to retrieve those emails.
If anyone is wondering how to do a schedule of this, since the "basic" Powershell doesn't recognise the Exchange commands, I created a wrapper batch file as per http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/exchange/en-US/0cad57bf-1113-4622-aac3-c3278fa97d72/how-to-schedule-a-powershell-script-through-schedule-tasks?forum=exchange2010
Exchange has done it's job, it looked up recipients but nothing exist, therefore discards the email.
