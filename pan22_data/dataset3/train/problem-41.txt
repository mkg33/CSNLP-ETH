I don't fault him for not knowing the answer to most of the questions in my classes, as I would't have any way of taking the classes without him.
I am currently a high school student takes APCS, as well as several other IT related courses from an instructor who has very little understanding of CS concepts as a whole, and I greatly appreciate him for essentially sponsoring these classes.
He started in the navy doing electrical work, and then transitioned into being an officer relatively early on, so most of his experience is irrelevant to CS and IT.
Simply learn as much as you can, and attempt to facilitate a good learning environment for those who are interested in being involved.
So, to recap, what he does is uses his skills and network to find others who are knowledgeable to teach (be it online coursework or people he knows), and create opportunities for the students that otherwise would not have existed.
If you are in this situation and interested in contacting someone with experience doing this, I'd be happy to have him get in touch with you.
