You could prompt each player to select what key they would want to use for the functions you have in your game.
I guess a config file would be OK, but is there another way to handle this problem that would make every one happy?
Also SHIFT is usually not a good choice on windows because of the sticky keys feature.
Plus some players like to have the direction on left hand (FPS style) and others on right hand (platformer style).
The problem is that some configuration can be uncomfortable on certain keyboards (especially when there is no keypad).
Since your game consists of 9 keys, it would be a very small amount of work to incorporate, and take care of any keyboard setup the users may be using.
Some games have you manually set your gamma and screen size, as I am sure you have experienced before.
Also I'd like to avoid using a settings screen (kind of heavy for a small game).
I've been struggling for a while trying to figure out the best way to map two players on a single keyboard.
A options menu would be ideal, where the user sets the sounds/video options and sets key functions.
You could have the users configure their settings when they choose to start for the first time.
