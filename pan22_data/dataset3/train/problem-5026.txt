3     The ib_ipoib driver is an implementation of the IP over InfiniBand
After this you are able to use your device as a normal ethernet device.
Or do you just need high bandwidth links between things?
7     address length to 20 (earlier proprietary implementations
Sun HPC Linux Edition is a Linux clustered HPC server with Infiniband.
The Infiniband itself is not a big deal to set up.
You might be better off bonding several 1GigE links or going with 10GigE.
Since you're not going for the budget solution (that's six figures for the metal only), you'd probably want to use support from a paid, enterprise, OS.
6     setting the interface type to ARPHRD_INFINIBAND and the hardware
I don't know the details of setting it up, but some good performance numbers are coming.

You have to load the driver for your device and if you don't want to use anything else then IP the ipoib kernel module.
