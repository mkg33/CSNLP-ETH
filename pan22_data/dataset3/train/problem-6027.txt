As of SQL Server 2005 and higher, it depends on what accounts you have your services configured to run under.
It's not a general user account and shouldn't really be treated as such.
Basically the System account is used to give the OS itself rights to Do Stuff.
If you're talking SQL Server 2000 and Full text is installed, no, you cannot remove it.
Generally speaking, local or domain accounts are preferred over any of the built-in accounts for the major services, thus alleviating this concern.
One other thing you didn't mention is whether BUILTIN\Administrators have been removed from the sysadmin fixed server role or not.
If the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account has the SysAdmin role in SQL Server, that means that any Windows Service, or Scheduled Task, running under LocalSystem has God-access to your SQL Server.
The reason for that is if Full Text does not run under the local System account, it could potentially throw an Access Violation and crash.

Have these people been asked why they want to remove it, and if they understand what the purpose of the System account is in the first place?
I would agree with your guess about an audit report being involved here, and I would also guess that the report just listed which accounts have rights to do what, and that the DBAs are blindly following it by removing any accounts they don't recognise.
If the DBAs are determined to remove it, maybe try suggesting that they do so on a test system first (preferably one that gets some active day to day use), give it a month to see if anything happens, and then make a final decision.
And the account Full Text runs under needs sysadmin access to the SQL Server.
If not, then System still has sysadmin access as it is considered a member of that local security group.
Here's the Books On-line page with the information on service accounts.
