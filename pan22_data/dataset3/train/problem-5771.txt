I used a module similar to the Sainsmart to control a crockpot.
I've previously used a 2N2222A to good effect with a 1.5 Kohm resistor.
Is it possible, using the GPIO Port to power a relay.
I've had this problem before and although not with a RaspberryPi, the solution is still valid.
I have read things about the GPIO port saying it is very easy to mess up, and seeing that activating a relay (basically a short circuit through a magnetic coil) scares me a bit.
The emitter gets connected to ground and the collector gets connected to the - of the relay.
Several internet providers have these modules, really inexpensive.
The GPIO pin gets connected to a resistor, which connects to the transistor.
Because of the high electrical requirements of a relay and the low power output of the GPIO pins, you need to step up the current to power the relay with a transistor.

I want to be able to turn things such as lamps on and off with the raspberry pi and knowing they use 120VAC means I will have to use a relay.
(The + is connected to a sufficiently high current/voltage source to drive the relay.
