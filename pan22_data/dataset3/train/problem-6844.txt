If the program can not be installed without asking the questions, you wont be able to install it via GPO.
When manually run properties are specified in the form msiexec /i installer.msi property=value and you can specify multiple properties.
Depending on the program you might be able to get around this by specifying properties for the installer.
(I love those vendors that do, makes my life a lot easier, especially with complex apps).
You can initially test this by running msiexec /qb /i installer.msi; if it installs you should be fine; otherwise it will fail.
You might also be able to create an Installer Transform (MST) that changes how the installer works slightly, thus allowing the program to be deployed.
The AppDeploy website might have info about writing an MST for your app; otherwise you'd have to learn Orca enough to fumble through it (hit-and-miss).
Check out the http://AppDeploy.com website for your app, it might have the information you need (if your app requires these properties).
I'm looking around for a walkthrough, but not finding much.
If the installation is assigned to the computer itself the program will be installed the next time it starts; you'll have to manually restart the server if there isn't some auto-restart mechanism.
The usual tool to use is MS's Orca, which is part of the Platform SDK (IIRC).
Rarely, the app vendor will publish information on how to write MSTs or Properties=Value pairs.
The basic publishing process in a GPO is pretty straight forward, the greatest difficulty is getting the MSI/MST files in order first.
