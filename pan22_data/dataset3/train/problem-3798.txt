Good thing is you dont install this on top of an operating system.
If the virtual servers you wanna create are physical server today you can use  VMware vCenter Converter (also free of charge) to move them to the VMware server easily.
For what its worth you should look into Hyper-V and ESXi and see which one you like more.
VMware ESXi is a free hypervisor from VMware also worth checking out.
We typically run CentOS 5 in the VMs but we also have a few that run Windows so that is not an issue for you.
Windows 2008 has it's own virtualization methods called Hyper-V. To start with virtualization on almost every other platform (and some people prefer it to windows 2008's built in methods) you can try VMware Server.
The two servers will have their own virtual hard drives so no information will be shared between the two.
But remember to check compatibility for raid controllers and other hardware.
I have no experience with Hyper-V, so I cannot offer any advice on it.
It's free, very popular, and lets you learn how virtualization works.
They will also have their own IP addresses and from the out side will look like totally separate servers.
Then you provision a virtual computer and install as you normally would.
