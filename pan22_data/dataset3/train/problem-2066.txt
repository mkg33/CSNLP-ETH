The kicker for me is having to move (and keep in sync) the sprocs in master ....
In my case, we have one kit of sprocs in the app db (business logic, etc), and another set of system management sprocs in master.
The issue is (in my world, anyway): Where are your sprocs?
Here is a query (set output to text) to return the stored procedures :
From memory you right click the database and under All Tasks is Generate Scripts or something like that.
This will produce the Transact-SQL to create whatever you select.
Right click on the SP under the DB and click Script Stored Procedure As > CREATE To > File, it will create an SQL script file, then run that script on the other database.
You can Copy all database including Stored Prcedures, maybe this is what you need:
This will crerate a full copey of the source includind tables, data and Stored Precedures.
Just use the Management Studio to generate a script for the stored procedures, save the script to a file then run it on the other SQL Server.
Into Ms SQL Server Managment studio -> Right Click into source data base, Go to "Tasks" menu and select "Copy Database".
