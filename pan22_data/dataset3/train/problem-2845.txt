Computer Settings in the GPO are applied regardless of the specific user logged in.
How do I go about testing a Group Policy before applying it to an entire OU?
One user with admin/domain admin privileges and one without.
I take a snapshot before applying the GP and restore the snapshot if necessary.
In the Group Policy Management console, you can use Security Filtering to restrict the GPO to a specific User/Computer.
I currently have an OU with many users within the OU.
Is your proxy setting user level or computer level?
That way you can apply the policy just to that OU and make sure everything works.
I found these very helpful when I first setup my GPO testing strategy:
As I have never used Group Policies before (I've just read a tutorial about it from Microsoft's website).
You can remove Authenticated Users and replace it with a specific account or groups.
This makes it easy to recover if the GP breaks something on the machine.
I also create some test users as well for that OU.
Its always a good idea to create a test OU in your AD tree to apply and test new policies.
That way I can see how the GP affects each type of user.

By default, the GPO will apply to Authenticated Users in the linked Organizational Unit (every user and computer basically).
I want to test the Group Policy on one of these users before applying it to everyone in the OU.
Here are two Microsoft article with recommendations and steps for using test OU's to try out your GPO settings before deploying them into production.

I have created the Group Policy (just changed to proxy to something which doesn't exist), but don't know how to apply it to a single user.
So in that case you need to restrict it based on Computer Account.
