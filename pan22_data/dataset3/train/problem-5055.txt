So how to get rid of this problem or how to uninstall it without using Add/Remove Program wizard.
This describes how to automatically remove Office 2007.
If it doesn't work, use the method described in second article:
My MS Office 2007 somehow got corrupted on windows 7.
I can't even uninstall MS Office from control panel.
Also keep in mind that any changes to the system in that time are rolled back too, so drivers, software, etc.
How do I uninstall the 2007 Office suites if I cannot uninstall it by using the "Add or Remove Programs" feature?
You need to follow some steps to manually remove it.
Still, for problems that occurred relatively recently it's a nice solution in many cases.
You can roll back to a system restore point before you installed Office (or before it started acting wonky).
Provided, of course, that you have System Restore enabled and that Office hasn't been doing that for the last few millennia, in which case it might be a little difficult to find that restore point.
