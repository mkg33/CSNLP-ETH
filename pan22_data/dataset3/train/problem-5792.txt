The important part is the "*", meaning "more of the same" -- if it prints anything other than zeroes, the asterisk, and addresses (in the left column), the disk isn't fully blank.
The additional erase passes don't actually do anything useful on modern hard disks, so I'd just go with zeroing.
If you're paranoid, I recommend following the erase with a check to make sure the disk's actually blank.
Mac OS X's built-in secure erase is good enough for general use -- the only thing it'll really miss is bad blocks that've been mapped out (since they're mapped out, it can't write over them, so they'll still contain whatever they held when they were mapped out).
(Note: if you were talking about an SSD, it'd be different.)
(replacing /dev/disk1 with the correct device, obviously.
Note that you can only usefully perform this test right after using the zeroDisk function -- not, for example, an erase in Disk Utility, 'cause that'll immediately reformat the disk, and so it won't still be zeroed when you go to check.
You can do this from the OS X command line like this:
The key is that the od command should print something like this:
BTW, OS X also offers some "even more secure than zeroing" options: a 7-pass DOD-spec-based erase, and a 35-pass Guttman algorithm erase.
