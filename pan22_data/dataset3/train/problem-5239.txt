Ones like Ubuntu are very good now a days and pretty easy to use.
I use VMWare workstation for similar purposes, but in my case I am rolling back to a clean install when I want to test software.
It can be set to restart on its own, and restore its state on each boot.
You also get the option to run maintenance like Windows Updates with no user interaction (keyboard and mouse is disabled).
VMWare workstation will let you take a snapshot and then rollback when needed.
You can also manually install software when needed, and even password protect DeepFreeze to prevent unauthorized changes.
And of course, people don't know how to use them correctly, logically or with respect.
Basically, we have computers that the public has access to use unsupervised.
Set up the XP box how you want with everything and then once you reboot, it's taken back to it's original LiveCD settings.
SO, it would be awesome to be able to set these computers to automatically restore maybe once a week, erasing EVERYTHING the user has done and bringing it back to a point of healthyness every week.
Have you thought about just stripping the hard drive out and using a linux livecd?
It's typically used for backing up and restoring from disasters, but could be used to back up each computer to an external hard drive or hidden partition.
Have you thought about making something like a Windows XP LiveCD?
I have "heard" of something like this but don't know how to really "Google" it.
