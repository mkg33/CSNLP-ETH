You would run the mysql client if it is already installed in your system.
If using MySQL from the commandline is giving you to much trouble you can also install phpMyAdmin.
I can't seem to find a good reference for the first time setup of MySQL to be used with Apache and python.
You create a database when you want to store data in it.
Just download it to your web root (NOT ON A PRODUCTION MACHINE!)
Create a database, create a user for the database, and populate a database.
4) Is there a good resource online that describes setting all of this up?
1) Under what circumstances should I create my first database.
Recommendations specific to your distribution package cannot be provided without your distribution being identified.
3) Do I have to do anything on the MySQL side to make MySQL talk to Apache, or MySQL to talk to Python/Django?
I've found a bunch for using a database once it's in place, but none for the initial setup?
and then edit the sample.config.inc file to enter the mysql username/password and visit http://localhost/phpmyadmin
Notes: I'm trying to run my LAMP stack on a dedicated little box for testing/learning purposes only, so I don't have access to any DBA that could help me, as much as I'd like one.
In trying to learn how to work with the LAMP stack, I've hit a wall with MySQL.
See the Access Privilege System and User Account Management pages in the documentation.
If you want to use one of MySQL's releases directly, there will be a README and other incredibly verbose documentation within the tarball.
Additional details are going to be specific to the application.
