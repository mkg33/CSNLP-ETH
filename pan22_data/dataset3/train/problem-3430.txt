I'm trying to find out what hardware configuration/spec a laptop would require to allow it to drive two Dell U2711 @ 2560 x 1440
Not too worried about specific laptops, more what ports (and protocol versions)n and graphics card would be required to run this setup.
I was searching for such a product myself and found the Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Dock.
Your PC or Mac requires a USB-C port with Thunderbolt 3
Again not bothered if the laptop screen must mirror one of the monitors.
It's a dock with multiple ports and supports dual 4K monitors.
Total bandwidth would be approximately 20 Gbit/second, but USB3 is limited to 5 GBit/second.
Taking this USB 3.0 Docking Station with Dual DVI/HDMI/VGA Video (sd3500v)
Ideally, I'd plug into the hub close the laptop lid and then use the monitors and external keyboard and mouse.
Apologies if this is a repeated question...although if it hasn't been asked in 2013 then any answers to previously asked dups may no longer be relevant.
You need two HDMI 1.3 connections for those monitors, which each clock close to 10 Gbit/second.
