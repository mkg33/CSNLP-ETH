You should install screen on the Amazon instance which would enable you to carry on working when the connection is being intermittent, this however doesn't really address why your losing connection
See http://www.openssh.com/faq.html#3.3 for more info.
It could be one of many problems along the route such as a badly configured wireless link.
Are you using regular Putty or something like Putty Connection Manager?
In that case the server waits for the DNS lookup to time out before it proceeds with the connection.
Try using something like wondershaper on your router, to reduce SSH (small packets) latency.
If any of the replies are lost, or take longer than 1000ms, then that is the problem.
Or it could be caused by higher priority network traffic somewhere on the route between the hosts.
In many cases when I've experienced slow SSH connections to a server, the problem was that the server could not do a DNS lookup on the client to ensure that the IP address from which the client is connecting matched the IP address returned from looking up the client's hostname in DNS.
PuTTY, like any other SSH client, does not work well when the Internet connection has high latency.
If the ping time is good and you are still experiencing delays then the problem is probably in the remote host - they might be executing a data backup or the processor could be overloaded for some other reason.
