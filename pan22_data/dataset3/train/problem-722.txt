When you remove the mailbox then remove the additional SMTP address.
When an employee finishes his work in my company, we archive his mailbox, back it up, we move his AD account to a "Disabled Users" OU and mark to hide his address from the exchange address list.
Is there a way to let a sender know that he sent an email to a user which has left the company?
It does require a bit more tracking if you do it manually, but if you are repeating this often then you can script it.
Or if this is for outside contractors then create a generic Mailbox gone mailbox and set the ooa on it and then assign the smtp address to it when you disable the mailbox.
That way they can reply personally if its business related and update the sender of the change.
A much better solution to this problem is to assign the SMTP address to the person taking over their responsibilities.

Something like the mailer daemon email which says undeliverable..
But if someone keeps sending this person an email, he doesn't receive any indication that the employee doesn't work here anymore.
