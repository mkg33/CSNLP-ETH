I don't have anything on 7.2 still so I can't give you a definitive answer on your question.
Reference: Configuring FlexConnect in Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Configuration Guide, Release 7.2
However, what I can say is that if you take the letter of the documentation as law and presume that you cannot combine FlexConnect and Local ACLs on a single WLAN, and you really don't want to create multiple WLANs, what I know you can do is use central switching on FlexConnect APs to apply local ACLs.
Yes, traffic on this network must transit back to the location of the WLC, but it was the best solution for us at the time of implementation.
We actually do this for our Web Authenticated guest network.
The GUI allows the entry of a local mode ACL in the Interface tied to the WLAN and also a separate FlexConnect ACL in those APs that are in FlexConnect mode under the VLAN-Mappings section.
Does the FlexConnect AP ignore the local mode ACL on the WLAN and just use its FlexConnect ACL or is the behavior something else to back up the statement below?
I really don't want to have to create separate WLAN's just to handled the FlexConnect ACLs.
There's a limitation (stated below in Cisco's documentation) that FlexConnect ACLs in Cisco WLC cannot be combined in the same WLAN with local mode ACLs.
