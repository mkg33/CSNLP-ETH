I see this as a VERY common problem either when the optical drive is heavily used for writing in a relatively short period (1), or if the machine has not been used for several years then you suddenly start using again (2).
For (2), usually something mechanical ceases up and the drive either no longer works and/or starts making loud and unusual noises.
Also, if you have a spare known working optical drive, it may be easier if you just quickly swap them around and test.
Both of these problems are not exclusive to those situations, any error can happen at any time - just in my experience, this is what I see a lot of.
In my case it started to boot from the CDROM after I had disabled Quick boot in BIOS
I hope this helps - if it doesn't, in comments, can you write if the machine can read other bootable disks, or standard disks from within any operating system it runs?
The BIOS may be too old and not support booting fron a DVD device.
I could not find a BIOS upgrade so I have to temporarily attach an old CD drive I had laying around.
In the example above, I typically find that for (1) - it manifests by random read/write errors and/or can read from some media and not others.
If the machine is from 1999-2000, I would say the most likely cause is that the optical drive is broken.
