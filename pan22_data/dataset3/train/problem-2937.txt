As far as I can tell, the tunnel only exists for the (entire) virtual machine, not my host machine connection, however I have not done a route trace to verify this.
The VPN software that I was provided with for work would not install on Win7, and so I had to install it on the virtual machine.
However, this might break some or all of your VPN services.
You basically need two network connections, one that is tunneled through to your work, and one that is wide open to the world.
All connections to "unknown" IP's (anything on your subnet is "known") will go via whatever is setup as your gateway, which after connecting to a VPN is usually via the VPN.
One option to achieve this might be to use the XP virtual machine, if your version of Win7 supports it.
So, you just need to adjust your VPN settings to not provide a gateway so that you return to using your LAN gateway.
when you make the vpn connection, in it's properties is a setting similar to "use this connection as default gateway" - that'll route all traffic over the vpn link.
