Hi have created some buttons from sprite and I added image and button components on it.
This means that where the player sees the button, and where Unity thinks the clickable UI is, have no relationship to one another.
To detect a click on a Sprite, add a Collider to it, and use a script to listen for clicks:
It looks like you tried to attach a SpriteRenderer to your button to render its visual in your game scene rather than as part of the UI.
I am just using sprites because In my game the camera can be moved on x and y.
Then you have all the power of the normal UI system, and the freedom to position it anywhere in your world that you want it to go.
Or, you can click the button itself, by getting rid of your SpriteRenderer and instead using a World Space Canvas to draw your actual UI button where you want it in the scene.
Note that the presence of this method forces Unity to fire a ray into your scene every frame to track mouse interaction with colliders in your scene, so it does have a performance cost.
If you click the SpriteRenderer, that is not part of the UI system, it is not the same as clicking on the UI button.
But I don't want my button to move and since UI buttons move with camera that is why I am not using them.
The UI Button On Click event fires only on clicks on the UI Button itself.
