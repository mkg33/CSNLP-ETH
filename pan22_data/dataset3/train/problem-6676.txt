This system can handle any number of appliances with any number of parameters, as long as you can add the appropriate records for them.
You create date for an appliance parameter in a specific table, then populate values into appliance_parameter_values when you need to.
Most likely you have a limited number of types of appliances (fridges, washing machines, coffeemakers etc.)
If this is correct then you may have the following structure:
Do you have someone experience something similar or know to help me in my case?
I do not think they are effective represent each category of appliances separately, but on the other hand, I do not know how to include them in a single table.
For example, television, washing machine, dishwasher line, fridge, freezer.
Each type must be having its own stable enough set of parameters.
You could go with a more general structure, such as this:
This is the application where users can add appliances in their home.
I'm working on a project and I would need help with proper design a database schema.
In this example, you don't need to create specific columns for appliances.
Each one of these appliances have different parameters that I need to store in a database.
I only have five categories, so five tables it was not a problem, but if they got a hundred, so I do not come quite inefficient.
