Do you know if there is in fact such an application?
I use the following AppleScript to do what you're asking to do; while it currently assumes the screens are the same size and positioned side-by-side, it should be relatively easy to change for other cases.
[Windows+Shift Left] – Move window to left monitor
I have been using it since it first came out and it works wonderfully.
[Windows+Shift Right] – Move window to right monitor
In Windows I had this great little app that allowed me to move application windows between 2 monitors with a click of a button (or a key-stroke).
I'm aware of an application that will change the position of a window WITHIN a monitor, but not BETWEEN monitors.
The following script can be used on Apple Mac OS X.
UltraMon is a shareware that solves the problem nicely for Windows.
But feel free to donate to the developer, since the app is absolutely awesome!
[Win+Home] – minimize/maximize all inactive windows
Many techniques exist to run AppleScripts with keystroke commands; personally, I use Butler.
[Windows+Shift Up] – Maximize vertical size of window
