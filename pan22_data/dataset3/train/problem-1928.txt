With the overheating, the fan interior needs to be blown out if you removed it totally.
Check cavities in the path of airflow, blowing them out with compressed air.
Unless there was a connector overlooked that had to do with the charging of the battery.
It is reputed by many to be one of the best conductors of heat out there for CPUs.
It is just a coincidence that your battery has gone bad at the time of your heatsink work.
Its always part of the printed circuitry of the motherboard.
Anytime I take the heatsink off of a desktop or laptop I use Artic Silver 5 as my thermal paste of choice.
Of all the CPUs I played with in different laptops, I never seen a cable pertaining to the charging.
If all that was done the first time, now is the time to consider the thermal grease you are using.
Blow the air the opposite away the air normally flows.
Do not make the fan spin up too much with the compressed air, I understand it is bad for the fan to exceed its working RPM too long, even though it is being powered by a can of air.
It is mainly used by overclockers, but in your case where you laptop is overheating still, I would take the extra step of prevention.
The symptoms you describe are a dead battery, the overheating issue is part of another subsystem, part of the whole working unit, but working independent of each other, separate from the battery.
