The CA file is required if you or your client sets up a PKI to allow secure SSL connections from trusted clients only.
The CA is used to authorize clients, not your own backend servers.
HAproxy does not make SSL connections to its backends (to my knowledge) - there are no handshakes, and no certificates for HAproxy to validate.
I think you misinterpret the significance of the ca-file.
I solved by pointing to the combined CA certificates file that your linux distro packages and neatly maintains for you.
I recently hit this issue in 1.5.6 where I was receiving the error message
On debian, this file is /etc/ssl/cert/ca-certificates.crt, it's probably the same for you.
Even in the rare case where several CAs are necessary for the same service, it seems to be possible to bundle those in one PEM file.
I likewise did not want to think about service disruption should the backend endpoint have their cert re-issued by another CA.
This was related to not specifying a ca-file, which you cannot specify at the default-server level (according to the docs).
You (or the client) will generate the CA certificate yourself, and use it to sign client certificates.
