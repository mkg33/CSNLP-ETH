Now I am able to browse the site as 'https://webapp.b2c.com/'
C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv>appcmd set site /site.name:"site_name" /+bindings.
You have a wildcard SSL such as *.ipsum.com and the certificate is installed but you can't choose a host name for the site in IIS when you try to add an HTTPS binding because the text box is greyed out.
cscript.exe adsutil.vbs set /w3svc/websiteID/SecureBindings "ip.ip.ip.ip:443:abc.123.mysite.com
*.ipsum.com but you can call it anything that beings with the asterix: *foo
Change those values (in quotes) to meet your requirements.
In the main window, expand Certificates (Local Computer) then Personal then Certificates and you will be able to right-click the certificate, hit Properties where you can update the friendly name.
Your wildcard SSL can be used with any subdomain, you just need to make sure you start the Friendly Name of the certificate with *.
Hostname can be added only when the friedlyname of the selected Certificate will be like hostname *.xyz.com and You can rename certificate friendly name to *.xyz.com from mmc(Snap-in).
[protocol='https',bindingInformation='*:443:subdomain.domain.com']
You will then need to delete the old binding if its using port 443.
Close and open IIS Manager and you can then set your host name.
I think this KB article will shed some light on the issue.
I prefer to use the same friendly name as the wildcard domain, e.g.
What will probably accomplish what you want is to use the SecureBindings metabase key.
Some machines won't let you edit the host name if the protocol is changed to https or after adding an SSL certificate.
I gave my certificate the wrong Friendly Name, help!
On previous versions of windows you will need to do something slightly more convoluted:
In a nutshell HTTP 1.1 host headers are not supported when you use SSL.
Since Windows 8 or Server 2012, you can type certlm.msc in the start menu to manage certificates for the local machine.
The accepted answer here is confusing and I don't think it's correct for the question.
This Windows command will create a new binding with protocol "https", on port "443", host name "subdomain.domain.com", site name "site name".
