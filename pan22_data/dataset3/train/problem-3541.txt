You really don't want to know what that did for the disposition of a tired and cranky coder who was using the machine at that time....
Lately they have started staggering their start times at 4:00, 4:15, 4:30 e.t.c., but a few years back they would all start at e.g.
If it hits the disk subsystem or the CPU heavily, that's a different story.
If that minute is spent waiting on a couple of network connections you probably don't have a problem.
That way you spread the load timewise, so that the server resource usage has lower peaks.
You could also try running the cron script process under nice/ionice, to give it lower priority when using resources.
IMHO if the task the script executes is something incremental like "collect all new files from /incoming, compress and archive them to that-other-server-in-the-basement", it is better to run it frequently, in order to keep the high load periods shorter.
PS: Some desktop Linux distributions (you don't mention an OS btw), are under the impression that normal people (which I am apparently not) sleep at 3-4am, so they have all their cron jobs run at about that time, especially on Saturday nights (or Sunday mornings, if you like).
Much like any other heavy resource user, a cron script can and will bring a system on its knees.
In general you should see if large tasks can be done incrementaly and you should try to stagger your cron scripts, rather than have them all start at once.
