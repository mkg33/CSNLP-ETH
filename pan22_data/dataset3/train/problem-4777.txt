SQL Server Management Studio is used to manage SQL 2005 and later versions.
I've just discovered a computer serving sensitive data from MS SQL Server that appears to have virtually no security protection.
Also some details would be helpful, like which version and edition of SQL server are you running?
Does this situation suggest the existence of other vulnerabilities that I should check for?
If you cannot remove the SQL Server Enterprise Manager, you could remove the SQL Server Registration or almost check the flag "ask always username and password" in the Server Registration.
Check also the sa (root) password for sql server, because until SQL Server 2000 there was the option to leaave it blank!
My problem is that I'm a Linux admin with no experience of Microsoft databases helping out in an remote office with no IT staff.
I would like to protect this box as quickly as possible.
SQL Server Enterprise Manager is used to manage SQL 2000 and earlier versions.
Is the problem that this computer is actually actively accessing and exploiting data on your SQL server or is it that you're able to access the SQL server, seemingly with no restriction... because those are two different things entirely.
So I found a program called SQL Server Enterprise Manager (There's no version number in the 'about' dialog, but the copyright in the help files says '1988-2000') which lets me read all the data, create accounts and change passwords of any existing accounts.
(Also the installation is in Spanish so please forgive me if I'm mangling any names).
