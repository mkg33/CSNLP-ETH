I know Google Calendar is smart enough to understand that an all-day event takes place on a given date (in any/all timezones) and ignores the time component altogether.
I understand the Microsoft lock-in is probably in play, but for what its worth, other products may handle this better.
I've since migrated to another computer with Office 2013 installed, and the symptom does not occur in Outlook 2013.
I've spent some time trying to solve it and come to the same conclusions mentioned in the comments.
Is there a way I can adjust their calendar entries so they display at their timezone's times, instead of my timezone's?
It appears to be a limitation in the way Outlook handles "all day" as a special case of midnight to midnight.
Our desktop support team all have access to a shared calendar, where we publish our locations for the week.
Hence, their all day events are stretched over two days in the calendar view:
I've run into this too when dealing with workgroups that span EST/PST...
Hence their all day events are going from 9pm - 9pm, instead of 12am - 12am.
