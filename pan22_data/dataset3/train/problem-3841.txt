this way the vast majority of players are never affected, the hardcore gamers are affected for a short duration, and the bots don't "ruin the game" for anyone else.
if these are ignored but the player keeps actively playing the game, mark the player as "bot" and exclude him from the rankings.
if they're addressed, mark him as "power player" and take him off the bot list.
regularly timed pings to the server, or close-to-perfect timing for many hours in a row), and if so then put the account into "bot mode" - display occasional captchas and whatnot.
A lot of the responses I've seen (slower page results, not allowing multiple pages open to facilitate faster input, etc) would also prevent legitimate players from doing things fast, which will just needlessly frustrate them.
1) add an explicit NO-BOT clause to your TOS, and add that detecting bot activity will remove the player from the high-score list (or have the label "cheater" attached, so people aren't as frustrated with them; if you go that route, allow people to hide cheater records).
Whatever you do, remember to NOT make it more annoying for the real player!
imho the easiest approach may be to apply social engineering to the problem:
I don't neccessarily disagree with the soft-science answers but there are technical things you can do to detect botters and some things that just make life harder for them.
