When you draw the ball itself, offset the Y position by the "height" of the ball.
The higher the ball, the longer the distance between the ball and the shadow.
Draw a shadow at the ball's actual 2D position; the shadow will help spatially orient the ball for the player.
You draw a shadow below the ball, like it's done in the gif.
Shadow position represents position of ball in 2d and when Ball height increase you have to change Ball position (I m assuming that light source is homogen and it is not single point like a lamp.
Also, Ball size should increase when Ball height increase.
A thing I remember from playing tennis on old TV games is that the ball also slowed down the higher it went and bigger it became.
When it reached it's zenith and started "coming down" it would start going faster again as it became smaller.
Shadow size and distence between Ball and shadow should increase when height increase.
I would do what the above posters suggested, Shadow and size increase when ball is higher.
If you want to implement more than just an illusion, use this height value in computations as well -- for example, you can implement the ability for the ball to go over a player's head in a game like you showed by checking if the height is geater than than a player's height.
