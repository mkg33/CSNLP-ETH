I would like to backup my dad's home computer to a remote server.
which can be written to by Windows while you are copying them which means your copy may be out of sync or corrupted.
With that said, I am not sure that cygwin/rsnapshot is the best way to approach this.
I do some pre-checks in the Cygwin bash script to make sure certain processes (such as e-mail programs) are not running before proceeding with the rsync.
Is there a better configuration I could use to accomplish remote backups in this case?
I haven't used rsnapshot but this method works fine with rsync.
Obviously the first backup will take a bit of time and the space does cost but I never had any problems with it.
I prefer this route because other Windows-based backup services make me nervous as I never know when they are not going to run.
Also, if you have physical access to the remote server, you can save a lot of time and bandwidth on the first sync by using an external HDD to copy the contents across from source to destination.
My current plan is to install cygwin on his box, and configure rsnapshot on my remote server to access his machine on a daily basis and download updated files.
I also prefer this style of backup over Windows-based backup services but find it is generally only suitable for backup of documents files - not system files.
This runs all the time in the background and updates files as they change.
