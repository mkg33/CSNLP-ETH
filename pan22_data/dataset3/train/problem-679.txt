Therefore the best thing it would be if i can see my home pc under My network places as another LAN pc.
But right now I am at dormitory and i have just my laptop with me, and I want to access all the files on my computers at home, i also want to use other resources and operate with services etc like on home LAN.
This crazy solution to your crazy idea is called VPN :) You might try hamachi for your needs though.
For example: At home I have 3 PCs and I can access them all and all the resources/services on them over my home LAN, thats super.
I was thinking if I can use putty to ssh home, and then use "net use" command to somehow tunnel to my home pc and map a drive on my laptop.
I know i can have remote desktop or something, i even have webdav at home, but it's such a pain in the ass, and i can't watch movies that i have on my home pc :)
I have one crazy question :) Is it possible to connect two computers over Internet in such a way so that you can see them both in a My Network Places as two PCs on the same LAN?
