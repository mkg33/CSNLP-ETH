If you want to add more animations click the "Animations" drop down and set the "Size" to the amount of animations you wish to add.
In your case it looks like you want to animate a character; I would highly suggest using an Animator Controller instead of the Animation Component.
Unless you only have a few animations that you want to play at specified times, an Animator Controller would be a better option in most cases.
I have been looking at this for 2 hrs now and i cant get it to work.
Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
When you want to access and play those animations you reference the Animation Component and use the "Play" method like so:
In that animation component you can add the animations you wish to play.
If you don't want the animation to play on start make sure you un-check "Play Automatically".
In order to play an animation there needs to be an Animation Component attached to your GameObject.
I want to play an animation but it seems that in The new version of unity it is harder.
I have an AnimationClip but I don't know how to play it.
