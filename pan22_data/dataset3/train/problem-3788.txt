My computer is running pretty good, but I get the feeling that the Display Manager (or whatever it's called in windows) is having a hard time.
First, interaction with desktop items is slow and stuttering, meaning if for example I drag an icon around on the desktop, it looks like this is happening at 5 frames per second or so.
Both of these problem are already present right after system start and do not occur in safemode.
Notice how only inside the chrome window there're remnants of the chrome window and the previous active tab in chrome, although you can see a tooltip of the wikipedia page being shown.
This image shows what is displayed on my second monitor while running a game on the primary screen and having my chrome window on the second.
Second, when running a game or other maximized fullscreen applications on my main monitor while having other open windows on my other monitor, the windows display not their current content but some older stuff.
I know this sounds weird, so let me explain using an image
I've already completely removed and reinstalled my display and graphics drivers but this didn't solve the problem.
Does someone of you have any experience with this type of errors?
Before this picture was taken, I've dragged my steam window over from the second to the first monitor and switched to a wikipedia tab in chrome before Alt-Tabbing back into the game.
