I've seen that setup on database servers, where admins wanted to do full backups, but didn't want to have extended downtimes on the databases.
They created raid setups with 3 mirrors, and when it was time to backup, quiesced the database, removed one disk from the raid, did the backup from that disk, and after backup was finished, put the disk back into the raid and let the raid controller handle the re-mirroring.
This is a RAID using 3 disks, giving you additional read-speed and more fault-tolerance.
If you have a RAID1 with two disks, and one of them fails, you are left with no redundancy until the rebuild is complete, so any defective sector on the remaining disk will cause an error (which is also why RAID5 systems die so often).
This is a typical configuration for important data that needs to be accessed quickly, and database loads in general.
Does it mean, mirroring the data across 3 drives, so there are 3 disks having the same data?
Having three disks gives you three sets of read/write heads that can be independently positioned, which improves performance greatly.
Also, in database setups, random read performance is crucial.
This was almost 20 years ago; of course, these days, you'd rather use logical volumes and snapshots.
