The reason I'm concerned about the speed is because it slows down the testing of our product installer considerably.
Testing an installer is time consuming already, but this new .NET Framework installer makes it almost undoable.
Every [n] tests you need to test on a machine without .NET 4 just to make sure that it still works as expected.
2 and 3.5 both always took nearly that much time for me as well.
Yes, it is pretty normal according to what i have seen.
You don't have to test on a machine without .NET 4 every time you want to test the installer.
You can get a machine that is fully up to date .NET wise and use that to test the bits of your installer you have control over - i.e.
You don't say what other operating systems you're targeting, but you should also test on machines that don't have .NET 3.5 or even .NET 2 installed.
Why are you so concerned about it - it is a one time task, it's not like you have to do it every day?
When I disabled AVG "realtime protection" the .NET installer progressbar started moving 4-5 times faster.
On my Windows Vista, it takes a full 12 minutes to install the .NET Framework 4.0.
