Here is a list of the main features available in Fail2ban.
I have denyhosts monitoring for bad SSH logins, and that's great - but I'd love something I could apply to the whole machine that would help prevent bute force attacks against my web applications as well, and add rules to block IPs that display evidence of common attacks.
It a little bit overkill but there are great project called OSSEC, it can monitor server logs and if it sees something fishy (it has list of rules plus you can write your own) it can block remote IP.
Then, learn how to use the -j SET target; preferably in combination with -m recent -m limit and/or -m hashlimit.
Also, what other solutions are out there that would manipulate iptables to behave in some adaptive fashion?
I am running a series of web servers and already have a pretty good set of firewall rules set up, however I'm looking for something to monitor the traffic and add rules as needed.
I've seen APF, but it looks as though it hasn't been updated in several years.
You can not call it iptables daemon, but it is way more powerful then denyhost.
(Since you're using Ubuntu, you must install ipset from source; see my blog for the HOWTO: http://pepoluan.posterous.com/powertip-howto-install-ipset-on-ubuntu )
