Just to expand on @bobbymcr 's answer above (which I found very helpful, thank you!
); you can simplify the command and broaden the results by using the LIST BRIEF or LIST FULL options.
Note the escaping of the backslashes \ in the path (it does not work otherwise).
I'll work on this more in the morning when I have access to an XP and win7 VM.

I also found a powershell method, but I haven't been able to test it.
What you are looking for can be pulled with a combination of dsofile.dll (not needed if you have Office installed) and autoit or any .NET language.
Note: As mentioned by @bobbymcr, remember to escape the \, else it won't work.
I am on Vista and I can't get the few dsofile.dll calls to function as I would expect, though it still provides some output that you might be interested in.
You can use WMIC.exe to get most of the way there:
I wrote up a little script with autoit that still needs some tweaking.
Note that you need to change the path in the dll functions to wherever you install dsofile.dll.
