Squid only really needs lots of memory if you're going to take advantage of in-memory caching.
My question is, how will streaming affect the server without caching.
Squid is pretty efficient so can run well even on low-end hardware.
If you're not caching then you won't need much memory.
These servers upstream to a caching Squid inside the DMZ.
As an example, I've got a couple of Compaq ProLiant DL360 G1 servers with 512MB memory and 1.2GHz PIII Xeon processors running Squid as proxy-only and they're more than capable.
A lot of the users will be streaming television programs and films etc through the server.
I understand the streamed content will be stored in memory until it is sent to the end user.
The thing you should really look at is your NICs - some cheaper NICs don't have a TCP offload engine so require more system CPU usage to process network traffic, but server-class NICs usually have a TOE and so process traffic themselves, and therefore use fewer system resources.
I'm preparing to buy a server for use as a proxy server, without caching.
