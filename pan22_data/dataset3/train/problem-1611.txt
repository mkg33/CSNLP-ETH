First thing that comes to mind is to increase the oplog size and repeat the process.
The resync was started on 12 Jul 2017 and took until yesterday (6 Aug 2017) I can see the index rebuilding and immediately after that, I got the magical message (there are dbs before the test one):
[rsSync] build index on: test.t1 properties: { v: 1, key: { _id: 1 }, name: "_id_", ns: "test.t1" }
