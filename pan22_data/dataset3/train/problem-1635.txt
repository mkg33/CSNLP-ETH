I would like some help knowing why it won't (or will) though, if possible.
This is a somewhat hypothetical question--I realize that Ethernet does this exact job very handily, and I could just throw in a switch instead of the splitter.
I'm being told the connection would work after this, just as a normal Wifi connection would.
Bonus mini-question: if this works, would it still work if a splitter were attached to the access point and multiple receivers plugged in to the network?
I'm being told that it is possible to, to describe it briefly, use a cable to connect an access point and a receiver directly to one another.
Then, on the wireless receiver, I would also unscrew the antenna and plug in the other side of the cable.
This is a very strange question--I'd go so far as to say it's a stupid question.
Based on my surprisingly deficient knowledge of radio transmission, I don't think it would work.
I simply feel that I should understand this scenario.
This means that I would unscrew the access point's antenna, and attach one end of a cable to the port.
