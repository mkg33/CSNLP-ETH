Regarding cp you could use rsync copy the files and after is has copied, run it again and if the data has not changed then nothing will be copied and you will know the copy was fine, if it wasn't it would only copy the parts of the file which were different.
You will need another healthy device for that as a target.
The only thing can do is to get a new drive and copy the data from the old drive before it fails completely and you lose all of you data.
There isn't a file system which will prevent a failing hard drive from failing, at best they would let you know that data is wrong via checksums, ZFS and Btrfs have checksum support, I believe EXT4 is working on adding checksums.
Remount it as READ-ONLY and copy your data of NOW.
First: stop mounting your drive writable - this is very dangerous because a confused driver can produce a lot of damage to your data.
Second: Try one of these two tools: myrescue and ddrescue.
This might take a lot of time depending of the damage of your device.
That is the only sane thing to do with a bad drive.
I have no idea why you would try to keep using the drive, you would save a lot of time and messing around by just replacing it.
But if you're happy you will get most of your data back.
The tools try to copy as much as possible, skipping bad blocks and trying them later.
