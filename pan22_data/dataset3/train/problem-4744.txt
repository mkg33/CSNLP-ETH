I mean, it's a really dumb idea, but you could do it.
Unfortunately this is not the case, and you really do need to spend some time to get your head around the new model of installation & security Linux uses.
I highly recommend you return /var/www back to what it was.
It's the same thing as being root, but it would technically work.
From the way you phrase the question I assume you're coming from a windows background, and expect software to work along the same model that windows uses.
You would still have to type sudo in front of commands that require root privileges, though.
For a normal user, sudo and su are more like "Run As Administrator", not UAC.
Here's an interesting excerpt from my /etc/sudoers file (on Gentoo):
Have a look at man sudoers and also the comments in the /etc/sudoers file (which you edit with the visudo command).
Of course whenever it comes to permissions and security, think many times before relaxing any restrictions.
If you seek ways to make Linux more like Windows then you'll not be happy with the results;  they have very different design philosophies.
Your user needs to be in the wheel group for this to work.
the linux way is more far flexible and powerful, the windows way is less secure but easier.
You could grant yourself password-less sudo rights.
