You would effectively be maximizing your uploads, just not to the same set of clients.
You will end up with 2 copies of the data on both pc's, not a lot you can do about this unfortunately.
But in practice it usually doesn't work that well, since you have some things to consider :
@Garth: I don't think he wants to use 2 IP addresses, just the 2 connections, so I don't see the prob with BT (It's only level 2 related) but the usual level 2 caveats do apply.
That way you'll show up as two clients but you'll be able to use both connections.
If you're only uploading/seeding, you could easily set up a tracker on each of your public IP addresses to seed files.
Or can you use one connection as the primary connection, and then use the other connection to spoof packets coming from the primary one?
The simplest way to use the upload of the 2 lines is to send the packets on the 2 lines just like if you route half the packets to WAN1 and the other half to WAN2.
They both independently download/upload from their dedicated internet link but then share their downloaded chunks over fast Ethernet (like any other peer except this one can transfer at very very fast speeds localy), its possible that they may end up downloading the same chunk but its unlikely due to the way that chunks are selected.
Since each Internet connection has its own IP, I see that as a problem.
Nothing would stop you running a client bound to each IP.
Unfortunately due to the way bittorrent connects, each tracker would only utilize one line.
if you have 2 physical computers connected to each other and then directly to 1 of the ISP connections (different default routes) and then enable local peer discovery on both clients and you will likely get a much faster speed.
