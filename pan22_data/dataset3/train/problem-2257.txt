Unless you have a very good reason, using your system's built in package management is  definitely preferable, compared to non-standard install locations and chmod -R 777 games.
If you are deploying to a nice package managed system, then your "buildout" script need only invoke the package manager of the target system.
Is your home directory mounted across NFS, mounted with config which is squashing root privileges down to "nobody"?
Is there a specific reason why you are compiling MySQL server from source?
For a RHEL/CentOS system, the procedure is roughly:
If so, start as another user, or don't store the data in NFS, or export the NFS share without root_squash.
I found this MySQL "buildout" script, which may be related to what you're doing: It seems to download MySQL server and a package to give MySQL support to Python, then compile and install these in non standard locations.
In any case, MySQL specifically recommend against compiling from source, as they provide their own optimised binary packages for various different platforms.
This will give you a vendor recommended and approved installation (no chmod -R 777 necessary!)
