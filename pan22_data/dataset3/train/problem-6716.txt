I figured this out shortly after I asked the question - IIS7 uses a different schema for the web.config.
The module is loaded correctly when I run the site from within the VS web server (the break point in my Init method is hit) but when I host it in IIS it seems to be ignored (the breakpoint is missed and the module's functionality is absent from the site).
My Solution involved removing the Module first and then re-adding it to the system.webServer namespace.
I have a custom HTTP module for an ASP.NET MVC3 website that I'm loading from web.config:
Is there a setting I have to flick in enable IIS to load modules from a site's web.config?
So adding the module to  seemed to block it from loading in the  namespace.
This may be because we deploy to two different IIS servers.
one on server 2003 (iis 6) and one on server 2008 (iis7+).
I have tried it on two separate IIS boxes with a similar result.
7 years later: It is not specific to the IIS version, it is specific to the application pool mode: classic versus integrated.
