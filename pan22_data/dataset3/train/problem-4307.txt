However, df only displays the free space apparent to regular users (even when run as root).
This is where the data storage capacity information begins:
Here you can see that I have 121,179,648 blocks total... with a block size of 4K (4096), that multiplies out to some big number (462-ish GB).
I'll provide my system's info for reference, I'm going to remove extraneous lines not important to this question:
By using the command tune2fs (found in /sbin/tune2fs), you can easily determine the reserved space: (and more!)
You could pull the actual reservation from tune2fs -l <device> and combine this with the above in a script.
df the root, grep for the line with dev in it (to remove the header), cut the size and available fields, then use an awk script to calculate 5% of the disk size added to the available.
And the reserved blocks... by looking at the number above, and the number below.. you should be able to relatively quickly figure out I have 1% reserved.
There's lots more information available here, but this should give you an ability to quickly ascertain how much is available, and how much more is reserved for root.
By default, Linux reserves some fraction of a filesystem for the root user, at least on ext4 (to prevent ordinary users from filling the drive completely and crashing the system, and to reduce fragmentation).
I am not sure there is a tool built in, but assuming you have left the reserved at the default 5% then this will tell you:
These lines say WHO the blocks are reserved for... user 0, root, in this case
How do you display the "real" free space, that would be accessible to root?
The header... and volume name, I label all my drives, makes them easy to identify if needed.
REALLY want this to say "clean" while the system is running.
This displays free space in bytes in partition related to "/path"
BTW I do not quite understand what is the difference between
