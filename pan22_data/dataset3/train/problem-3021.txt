I recently discovered that an external hard drive is giving a "device not recognized" error.
What could possibly be wrong on the PC side, and how can I investigate those possibilities?
It has been plugged in and in use for several years.
Unfortunately, I cannot say for sure whether or not the HDD was having problems prior this incident.
You can get fairly cheap adapters designed to copy drives that allow raw drives to be connected to USB so you could also remove the actual HD from the USB enclosure and try one of those to make sure the HD itself isn't dead.
Other devices, including mice, keyboard, printer and my breadboard device that caused the surge, communicate fine with the PC.
It could be coincidence that the drive has chosen this time to fail.
So I am concerned that I might have damaged the USB controller on the HDD.
In particular, does it sound as though the HDD is the problem?
A couple days before realizing that the hard drive will not work, I was working with a usb microcontroller (plugged into the front) and caused a "power surge on hub port" by not wiring things correctly.
It is very unlikely that you would have caused such damage.
I've rotated the ports which the devices use, and get the same results:  everything works on any port, except the HDD is not recognized.
The HDD was plugged in (to the back) at that time.
So in general, can a USB power surge affect devices on other ports?
If you have, I would expect other USB devices to fail to work as well so why not try some other devices.
