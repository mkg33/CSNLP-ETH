You could also buy a cleaning solution that does not contain bleach, ammonia, or vinegar.
Once in a long while I'll use a damp napkin with a tiny-tiny amount of detergent and then afterwhipe with clean water.
The second part is a dry towel to remove excess cleaner.
Starting from the top, wipe the screen in one direction until you have cleaned the entire screen.
Use a non abrasive cleaning solution, diluting isopropyl alcohol (not rubbing alcohol, as it may contain oil) into a solution of 50% alcohol and 50% with distilled water water (or purified/bottled water).
A large cloth is best, since it will help reducing the risk of leaving streaks across the display from finger pressure.
When I got my first laptop about 8 years ago, we were advised that the easiset thing to clean it with is damp toilet paper, because it's a lot softer than tissues, and more common and cheaper than micro-fibre wipes or glass-cleaning cloths.
I've been doing this for years with no adverse results, however sometimes you get tiny flecks of paper left on the screen (wait for it to dry and just blow them off).
The first part is like a baby wipe which contains a mild solvent to clean the screen.
Spray the cleaning solution on a soft cloth (for example an old T-shirt), lint-free microfiber cloth, or some other very soft cloth.
The best i have found are the ones that come in two parts.
It's obviously not the best way but lcd's are not that fragile.
Before you start, power-off and unplug your monitor.
