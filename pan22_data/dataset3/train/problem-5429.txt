The attackBoxes variable can be an array to hold each collision box for each frame, which you will have to set on each attack.
I want to know how do you create this hit box system.
I have no idea as to how to make a flexible system where I can enable and disable a hit box on any frame of a move and also adding additional frame data.
The attackFrame variable is also what you can use to render each animation frame for the attack.
The problem with that is that a list item can only be one object so I have to somehow make all my frame data and hit box enables & disables into one object.
What comes to my mind would be to have a list of each collision box per frame of the attack, then advance each hit box every frame and check if it collides with any enemy.
If I can have as many hit boxes in a move as I want then this list item object needs to have a list as well, which I don't think is a good way of doing it.
If so, set the attack hit to true so the enemy doesn't get hit twice or more times for the same attack.
If this doesn't make sense, here's an example of the code in Java:
All I can think of is having a list that is the size of the amount of frames of the move, and add all of the enables, disables, and frame data as one list item.
In a fighting game a move that you execute is basically just a series of hit boxes that are enabled and disabled at certain times.
So I just want to know all of the good ways of implementing a hit box system in a fighting game.
