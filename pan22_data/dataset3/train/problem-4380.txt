I used SmoothWall for years in a small business environment (~25 users at that time), and loved it.
We eventually moved to ISA Server because we'd grown and needed an application-aware firewall that integrated with Active Directory and could securely publish internal web apps, but I have absolutely nothing bad to say about SmoothWall.
Mine is that you are only losing time if you try it, don't like it, and try another one until you find one that suits your needs.
One distro not mentioned is Untangle, which I've been pretty happy with - though the most useful parts of Untangle are commercial addons rather than opensource.
Yes, SmoothWall is generally considered to be pretty decent.
It performed well on a crappy old PC and it was extremely easy to set up and administer.
Well...it works, if you set up the hardware correctly.
Any of these should manage 15-17 users pretty easily on relatively cheap hardware, especially if you don't go mad turning on every single feature.
If you don't like it, you download a different distro.
If you have the hardware with multiple NICs, you aren't losing anything by trying it out.
If you're not entirely sure then just download one or two of these distros and have a play, either on a spare box or a virtual machine.
My only advice would be to mark your NICs with a Sharpie to indicate which one is "red" and which one is "green"...I can't be the only person who's ever forgotten :)
It's not really a "linux" thing since it's meant to be turnkey, and managed from a web interface.
Smoothwall and a number of other firewall distros were reviewed at the weekend by Tech Radar.
It is relatively up to date, easy to use, uses modern tools, and popular.
