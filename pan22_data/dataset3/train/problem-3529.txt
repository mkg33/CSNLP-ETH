message.py there you can Change the Output of your can Messages
python_path/site-packages/can/Interfaces/socketcan_native.py
Use the python-can module with pip3 install python-can, documentation is listed here https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
you write your own socketcan Client with the python-can package.
socketcan_native.py relevant method to create a socket Connection:
socketcan_constants.py in this file are the relevant constants to communicate over CAN-Socket
