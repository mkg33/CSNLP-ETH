Most browsers in use at the moment allow 6 concurrent connections to a single domain (over HTTP) and 30 concurrent connections in total.
But the majority of my assets are served from Rackspace's CloudFiles CDN.
Should I merge them all into one (as is the preferred serving method for SPDY files, to cut down on DNS lookups), or should I leave them as they are because they're coming over regular HTTP 1.1?
DNS lookups will cost you about 20-120 milliseconds and are cached for varying periods.
If you can't do that, you need to calculate the appropriate number based on how many files you are serving.
Do those files get streamed through SPDY somehow, or are they pulled in via separate laborious HTTP requests?
If you have several subdomains which use the same images and your users may visit all of those subdomains it makes sense to keep the same asset domains for all subdomains.
Because no matter which subdomain your user visits, it's already cached.
The best approach is to put everything on single domain using SPDY.
Thanks, I couldn't find any decent information on this via googling.
I currently have these CDN assets split across 3 different sub-domains.
If you have more than 6 files they should be evenly split over (filecount/6) subdomains, up to a maximum of 5 subdomains.
