I wouldn't allow others to connect and use your service primarily as a security concern.
Or use keylogger to monitor them(maybe impossible)
Barring any don't-even-think-about-letting-them response, turn off file and printer sharing, install HTTPS Everywhere onto Firefox, install Tor, and install a keylogger on his/her computer (no, not really).
One other thing you can do is to set up a secondary wireless router for you neighbors, put them on their own subnet that is different from yours, this would be the most secure way to isolate the 2 networks.
One other consideration when doing this sharing any activities your neighbors engage in links back to your ISP issued IP and not to their local machine.
Some routers with guest modes also include the ability for the guest access to allow or disallow connection to your primary network.
However if you absolutely must then see if your router has a guest mode.
Usually when the router has a guest mode the guest connection is separated from the primary connection.
Best way to avoid this problem is: don't share your wireless with others and set a strong password for it that no one would break it.
Strong passwords consist of at least 8 characters that consist of Upper and Lower case letters, a number and a special character like ~!
If you need to share files on your home network you will need to turn on password protected sharing.
Depending on the OS's you run on your PC's, I assume XP, Vista, or W7, they all have a built in firewall, check each PC firewall setting and turn Off file and print sharing on each PC, set strong passwords on each user account on each PC.
