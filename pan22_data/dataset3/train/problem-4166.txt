At any rate, after the initial copy, I do an rsync step to sync it all up:
This thread was very useful and because there were so many options to achieve the result, I decided to benchmark few of them.
I hope this information helps more people to decide among these alternatives.
I believe my results can be helpful to others have a sense of what worked faster.
This is also good, and continues on read-failures.
Or maybe the process will get interrupted, or if it is a filesystem migration, the you might want to do the initial copy before the actual migration step.
To move 532Gb of data distributed among 1,753,200 files we had those times:
Note that the trailing slash on /src/ is important.
When doing local a local directory copy, my experience is that "cp -van src dest" is 20% faster than rsync.
tar would also do the job, but won't resume from being interrupted like rsync will.
Here is the rsync I use, I prefer cp for simple commands, not this.
When I have to copy a large amount of data, I usually use a combination of tar and rsync.
It's about as fast as tar, maybe a little quicker.
Usually with a large amount of files, there will be some that tar can't handle for whatever reason.
