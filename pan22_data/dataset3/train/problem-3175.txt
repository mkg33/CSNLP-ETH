There is, in the configuration file for the VM, and the "kernel" setting for that was set at "Latest 2.6 Legacy (2.6.18.8-linode22".
I guess for my next server fault question I will need to ask about server os upgrade strategies...
I had to change that to "Latest 2.6 Paravirt(2.6.38-linode31)", and then ssh (and websites served from this server) all came back.
I guess that the kernel that the linode was configured for was only for use in versions of Ubuntu older than 9.10.
Frankly I thought that the os upgrade process would take care of that, but then I don't really understand everything about how the VM configuration file and the VM os interact, so it's not surprising that I was able to get into trouble, I guess.
Nonetheless I will have to take a deep breath and think a bit before trying to upgrade to the next newer os.
I think maybe the takeaway lesson is that if you let your server os get that far out of date, there are odd things required for the upgrade path that won't always be in the most current documentation, because my god who is still on a version that old.
Well, it appears that the problem was a Linode-specific one.
