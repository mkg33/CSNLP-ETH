getent ahosts just does this one thing that you're trying to investigate.
Regarding what you can do to see what is happening
What this means is that nslookup is bad for testing how the system resolver behaves (ie resolv.conf, nsswitch.conf, etc), while eg ping is bad for testing DNS.
What you're saying about things "breaking" when the "wrong" server is queried makes me wonder why you are putting all of those servers in resolv.conf in the first place.
It can be noted that in Linux-land I would consider getent ahosts (eg getent ahosts www.example.com) a better choice for testing the resolver behavior, and dig to be much preferrable over nslookup for testing DNS.
It's worth noting that ping is just an example of a regular program which uses the OS resolver library (ie, getaddrinfo/gethostbyname calls) while nslookup (as well as dig, etc) are DNS client programs making DNS queries of their own, rather than using the resolver library, they just so happen to pick up their default server from the configuration file for the system resolver as a matter of convenience.
As was suggested by Hangin on in quiet desperation, you may want to use strace (maybe also ltrace for a higher level view) and I would suggest using it with getent ahosts rather than ping to not get all the noise of what is ping's actual purpose, while you're trying to observe what is just a side-effect.
It's generally really not a good idea to put servers with different behavior (different in some way that is actually significant to your use) all in the list.
I don't have a direct answer to the larger question but answers for some distinct parts of it.
