Is there anyone who has more experience with ZFS under Linux based systems ?
I can't comment on its stability or performance though.
Unfortunately, ZFS is really only an option on Solaris, its derivatives (Illumos (Shillix, OpenIndiana, et al)) and FreeBSD.
While ZFS can be used on Linux systems via FUSE, it's very slow, and since it's a blocking process there are some gotchas.
While it's nowhere near as feature rich, BTRFS seems to provide some of the functionality found in ZFS, and I suspect it would perform better and be significantly more stable.
To me, that means it's still squarely in the realm of interest to filesystem developers, and nowhere near the quality or stability that I would require for my personal play boxes, much less anything that had data on it that I actually cared about.
Interested in it too but the only real option is export iscsi zvol from solaris to linux of share zfs via nfs to linux.
Also, zfs send piped to zfs receive in the same box works correctly:
If you give it plenty of memory (ARC > 1GB) it works surprisingly well as a primary filesystem (for home directories/etc).
For instance, if you're used to doing a zfs send | zfs receive on the same box, that will not work on ZFS-FUSE.
From my experience testing ZFS on FreeBSD, I suspect there will be some kernel tuning issues and NFS mountd issues compared to Solaris.
And while there is the zfsonlinux stuff, that is hardly more than a "look, I got it to work" effort.
ZFS needs a special mountd if you want many subsystems shared via NFS.
I saw ZFS fuse library, but I don't know it;s worth a test or not.
I would say it's only for testing or non-io-intensive tasks.
KQ Infotech has a beta version of their port available since January at http://kqstor.com/ .
zfs-fuse works pretty well on Linux, and for many workloads the bottleneck will be the disks and not fuse.
