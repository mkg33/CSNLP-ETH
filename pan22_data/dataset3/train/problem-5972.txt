you can use 10.0.0.1 for the desktop and 10.0.0.2 for the laptop, as long as nothing else on your network uses anything in that subnet).
your computers will be connected just share the drive in which data is present and copy data.
As an alternative to Dropbox you may want to try MEGA which gives 50GB capacity free of charge.
From your questions, it seems that you are looking for a cloud backup solution (instead of sending data between two computers) with 50GB capacity.
Based on your edit, it looks like the cheapest and fastest way would be to use an Ethernet cable.
Both computers should now be able to see each other, and you can transfer files between shared folders (or use FTP, etc.)
If you have a spare computer with enough capacity, you can copy your file through network, either by Windows file sharing, FTP or any file transfer tools.
(I would note that I haven't done this on Windows since I was running 98SE, but I never have any problem on Linux).
However, cloud solution is definitely not a good way to backup 50GB of data - uploading 50GB to the cloud can be time consuming and painful (e.g.
Even when direct RJ45 cable method responses are rather preferred in this case, if could be useful to know about any method capable of resuming and working via internet:
the best and fastest way of data transfer between two pc or laptop is Ethernet cable.
To do this, connect the laptop to the desktop, then go to the TCP settings (should be in your network card's properties page) and set a static IP address (doesn't really matter what you pick, as long as you use an internal address that doesn't conflict with anything else on your network - e.g.
By the way, a local (LAN) transfer is faster, but the two above methods are worth the price configuring, because:
Cheapest way would be to copy everything to DVD-ROMs; a convenient way would be to copy everything to one or two big SD card or USB drive (they doesn't cost much!
