In this case, the LAN ports will most likely behave as an unmanaged switch.
one Metro Ethernet service by carrier "A", one MPLS based L3 VPN by carrier "B"), we usually deploy  routers with at least three ports, to connect...
(Note: consumer grade products are explicitly off-topic here)
A more generic router would just have interfaces, which can be configured in many ways and connected to multiple LANs, WANs and other networks.
Are LAN ports on routers similar to the capability of a managed switch ?
what is the typical purpose of 3 LAN ports on a router ?
Please be specific if you have a particular device in mind.
A router with "LAN ports" (and probably one "WAN port") sounds like a router designed for a specific use case: providing NATted internet access to multiple devices over a connection with one public IP address.
There's a few catches to avoid (like making sure that the crosslink is never used as transit by other sites or even considered as backbone link), but overall, we've seen improvements in resilience and failover times over our  previous FHRP-only based designs.
At my employer's, when we connect spoke sites with dual WAN connectivity (i.e.
That A-B cross-link becomes part of the dynamic routing environment of the WAN overlay service (mostly MPLS-o-GRE-o-IPsec) we provide.
Like if you want to connect three PCs via an ethernet cable to your router, you'd use those ports.
