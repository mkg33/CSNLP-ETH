You won't see it unless the taskbar height is big enough.
You can include the DoW name in it (by specifying ddd modifier), so in taskbar you will have "Thu, 21.01.2016" as date and don't need 3rd row just for the day of week.
2) Another option is to change the Short Date format in Regional settings to include also the DoW name.
Once you change the Short Date you will see it mirrored in the bottom right corner.
You can't change the text color, but I solved this by going in Personalization > Colors and setting a custom accent color for the background.
Then this morning suddenly it was back to time-only.
I had both the time and date displaying fine when using large taskbar buttons.
On Windows 7 it was enough to enable 2 rows taskbar and the DoW would fit.
When I dragged my vertical taskbar to be 5 inches wide, it overlapped a white window and I was able to see that the clock was enabled, but in black text on a black background.
The remedy turned out to be to right click on the time display on bottom right and choose "Adjust Date/Time".
Never mind that it seems that you have it all set correctly.
There are 2 ways Windows shows day of week on the taskbar.
If you have enables small icons, there won't be enough room.
You can widen the task bar by going to the edge and dragging the little arrow.
1) Separate Day of week (DoW) is showed in 3rd row after time and date.
If you disable small icons in the taskbar settings, it will fit (at least on my 24" with full hd resolution and default dpi).
Windows 10 shows the date in taskbar using the Short Date format.
