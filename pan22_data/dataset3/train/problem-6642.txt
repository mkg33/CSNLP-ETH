Only Google chrome browser is allowed to be used with some terms and condition related issue)
Find out where the dictionary of that newly created profile is and what name it has.
Once you have the name you have to add following parameters to the Google Chrome shortcut:
each screen uses camera for left screen camera1, for right screen camera2.
Now when i run Google Chrome 2 new windows the main problem is that it always using camera1 as it remembers.
Open your default profile browser in monitor 1 and your newly created profile browser on monitor 2 (or vice versa).
I have one PC which has dual monitor on left monitor it has to show www.example1.com and on right monitor it has to show www.example2.com, where the left screen is touch input and the other one is not.
Perhaps, I misunderstand the question, but how is this problem not resolved by setting a different src attribute on the html element on the page responsible for displaying the cameras on each different site?
(so that i can tell Google chrome on left window follow camera1 never use camera2, and on right screen Google Chrome always to use camera2)
Now copy a shortcut to your Google Chrome Browser and go to its preferences.
How can i run two separate Google Chrome on same machine with there own custom settings?
Go to "%localappdata%\Google\Chrome\User Data" and find it out ("default" is the default user).
