If the application is written in such a way that there are multiple discrete windows that are not related in the OS as belonging to the same application in the way ALT-TAB handles, then the only way to accomplish this is by re-writing the application (hard, but probably the best solution) or by containing the application within another application that works as the "window" the OS (and ALT-TAB) handles.
That's way too many keystroke to switch a program.
Running the application inside a VM may cause difficulties with copy/paste, if that is a necessary part of the application function, though that is not insurmountable.
I could move the program to a new desktop (workspace in linux word) so it doesn't interfere with other programs but windows 10's desktop shortcut isn't particularly easy.
Also, you would have to switch OUT of the VM in order to ALT-TAB, but that would only be a single mouse-click or whatever keyboard shortcut works for the chosen hypervisor, which, even combined with ALT-TAB, would still be less than the workspaces solution you're currently hoping to avoid.
It has multiple child windows like photoshop and alt-tabbing will only switch out the background windows but all the child windows will stay in front.
I have a production program that doesn't play well with alt-tabbing.
Is there anyway I can contain all of that program's child windows in a window so when I alt-tab, they don't stay in front?
If I click that program's icon on the taskbar, all of its windows minimize.
Or is there a way to quickly switch between windows' desktop eg.
Imagine switching to excel from Photoshop but all the photoshop's layer windows or paint brush windows were still in front.
The sequence would be Win+Tab > Tab > Left or Right > Enter.
