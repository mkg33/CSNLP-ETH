So I tried to reach my ipv6 address outside my LAN and I got success, so then I set a simple apache webserver on a raspberry pi (who has an ipv6 too) and expose it to different DNS providers: dioniso.ddns.net, dioniso.crabdancer.com and dioniso.dynv6.net.
My situation: I have a public ipv6 and a local ipv4 at home.
Some topics are saying that I need a proxy to "translate" ipv6-ipv4.
Many thanks to Sander, his answer guides me to this solution:
So, I can access these websites only in PCs that have ipv6 or ipv4 with tunneling.
At Raspberry IPV6 website, just set apache to listen port: 666
I tried hard to forward a port, but it looks like I'm into a NAT, behind another NAT (?
At my researching time, I found these relevant topics: access ipv6 website over ipv4 network and IPv6 Webserver reachable for IPv4 only Clients.
So all incoming data from IPV4 port 666 will be redirected to my IPV6 port 666.
At my VPS with a public IPV4, installed socat on it and ran this command:
Its not the professional way to do it, but works for me!
