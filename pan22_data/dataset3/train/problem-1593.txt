Perhaps your /bin/login has been replaced by an evil twin that ships your passwords offsite.
Perhaps your user's (or system-wide) shell profile/rc is running something slow
Since the file is read at login, this was causing the login delay.
It also points to some other possible delay causes.
if so, try going to runlevel 3 (if you can) and see if there's a change in login speed.
If it is set to Yes there is a good chance that a delay will/can occur.
If such a program is poorly written, it could be hanging and/or timing out.
My problem (took about 1 minutes to ssh login into my raspberry pi), was due to a corrupted .bash_history file.
Quite often this is due to a reverse DNS lookup of your host IP.
This thread is old but I felt onto it seeking for answers.
Make sure your client IP has a reverse IP DNS record.
 Take a look here: OpenSSH FAQ especially chapter 3.3.
See this link for more details of a work around if setting up reverse records is out of your sphere of influence.
Are logins also slow in single user (runlevel 1) mode?
Once I removed the file, login time went back to normal, like instantaneous.
If it does get better, do rm /var/db/nscd/* and start it back up.
Take a look at the UseDNS [yes|no] in the sshd_config file.
