(tethering a Wifi _ connect the pi through ssh _ run vnc client and connect to the Pi address).
Then, you can connect from your tablet to the Pi's network, and use a VNC Client to remote into it, effectively using the table as the Pi's monitor.
Or to use a capture card takes feed from the Pi HDMI out put and transfer it into data throught USB.
Or to program the Pi as capture card so it transmit it display through USB.
It uses WiFi to connect but differently, you don't need to join the local WiFi network, or know the IP address of the Pi.
I wanted to do that so I can avoid the constrains over the the Pi and the Tablet Wifi.
With this, the Pi acts as a server, and from the tablet you select the Pi's WiFi network and would always to connect the same way no matter where you are, even where there is no regular WiFi.
In addition to that I wanted easy setup so you can display the Pi over the Tablet with a single click if you moved to different place where it has a different WiFi.
I have used an approach to access a personal Wiki running on the Pi from other computers that might work for what you want to do.
And to have application on the tablet that reads that feed from the capture card.
Or to direct the the VNC server towards a USB port and the Tablet reads the VNC from the USB.
So I was thinking if it is possible to Bluetooth pair the Pi and the Tablet and the Pi VNC server linked to Bluetooth and the VNC client on the tablet read the server from Bluetooth.
Also it would be easier for a user with little knowledge of networking and vnc to use the Pi without  going through a setup.
Is it possible to display Raspberry Pi through android tablet without WiFi?
This approach also allows me to remote into the Pi from a tablet, basically using the tablet as the monitor of the headless Pi.
Second, you need to setup the Pi to be an Access Point (AP).
