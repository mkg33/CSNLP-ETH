I just made a test by removing the hostapd internal DHCPserver (DHCPserver=no in place of yes in /etc/systemd/network/12-ap0.network) and by installing the isc-dhcp-server package.
I would like to edit a comment or a reply on the original post, but my profile is too new for it.
I have searched in the systemd.network man page in section dedicated to DHCPserver and more specifically the EmitDNS item.
Something draws my attention on Troubleshooting section.
May be a problem linked to the fact the ap0 is on the same internal wifi adapter than wlan0 ?
I still need to find how to set the dhcp.conf to propagate the DNS server address received on router side
Like you, I followed every steps and I noticed that a device connected to the extended WiFi network couldn't get any DNS address from the primary Wireless router.
I was redirected here from the excellent thread of Ingo because I'm trying to make my RPi3 to act as WiFi extender.
Do you have an idea on how to fix this DNS problem ?
I have attempted to set-up a Wifi repeater on a Raspberry pi zero W using this very good tutorial :
The wifi client connected to the ap0 AP now gets an IP address and the DNS server address.
But i dont find where this uplink data is taken from as they say this is not from /etc/resolv.conf.
But I think Ingo may have mixed the 08-wlan0.network and 12-ap0.network file.
And that is OK when i configure static DNS addresses in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.
Access point as WiFi repeater, optional with bridge
Once modified and rebooted, everything seems to work fine, no need to install and set up isc-dhcp-server package.
@Ingo explains that hacker should modify the /etc/systemd/network/08-wlan0.network file.
They speak about the propagation of the uplink DNS address.
