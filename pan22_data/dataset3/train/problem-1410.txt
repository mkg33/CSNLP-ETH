If you've chosen Single/Class C affinity, all users from the same IP / IP class C range will hit the same server (beware proxies & internal network topologies in this case).
The NLB is a software NLB configured on Windows Server 2008 R2.
NLB will distribute the load according to the chosen filtering mode & affinity settings for your NLB cluster.
Now how showuld we configure sticky session on NLB?

If you've set "Single" filtering mode, all traffic will go to a single server.
Furthermore, even in multiple host mode, you can choose a distribution factor under the port rules so one server may be at 100% while the other is at 0%.
I've got a short video on my blog on how to setup a simple NLB cluster that shows the filtering mode & affinity settings:
Comments from Mark S. Rasmussen helped in configuring NLB properly.
If you've selected "Multiple host", the affinity decides which host will receive the traffic of recurring users.
For a request of 5000 users, all my requests are going to one web server.
NLB usually balances requests based on the client IP address (although this can be configured), so, if f.e.
you're stress-testing it from a single machine, or if you have a reverse proxy which doesn't pass on the original caller IP, your requests will always be handled by a single server.
