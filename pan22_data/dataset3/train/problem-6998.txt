Recently, a group of programmers have released a kernel patch for Windows 7 to allow the usage of more than 4gb of RAM under Windows 7.
For more information about why Microsoft implemented this technical limitation, see this article.
Does anyone have any notes i should be aware of, before buying this?
You may need to reactivate Vista after changing the amount of installed RAM, depending on what other hardware changes you have made since activating.
Not that this is a problem, per se, but it could be rather surprising.
The patch basically modifies the Windows 7 Kernel to be more like the Windows Server 2003 Datacenter Edition, which is compatible with up to 8gb of RAM under 32-bit mode.
Nope, Vista and 7 can see the "extra" ram, but won't use it.

As i understand it, i would simply only be able to utiluse ~3,2 GB of them.
Note that individual processes will still be limited to 4gb even if the system can access more...
Although if you had 8gb of RAM, then at least you'd still have another 4gb for other processes ;)
Is there any problems with having 8 GB ram in a 32 bit Windows Vista?
The patch allows you to extend the PAE well into 8gb of RAM under Windows 7 32-bit.
Yes, the extra memory will be physically present, but not usable by a 32-bit OS.
