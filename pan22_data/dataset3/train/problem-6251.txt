If your domains and subdomains have relationships like that example, where two domains should always have the same IP address then a CNAME is appropriate.
If that is the case, you should definitely create new A records for server1 and server2 for each of your Kloxo installs.
CNAMEs are more for logical ordering than any fundamental part of how DNS works.
Clients such as web browsers have no idea whether the IP address came from an A record or a chain of any number of CNAME records.
(There are some exceptions to this regarding MX records.)
Lets say your example.com website itself is hosted on 192.0.2.1,
Do you have two A records for the same domain with different IP addresses?
The idea is that because the URLs http://www.example.com and http://example.com will always both be served by the same webserver, you will always have to update the IP addresses of both at the same time.
You would want something like the following in your zone:
So a CNAME says that www.example.com should just use whatever IP address example.com has.
and your two Kloxo servers are on 192.0.2.2 and 192.0.2.3, respectively.
