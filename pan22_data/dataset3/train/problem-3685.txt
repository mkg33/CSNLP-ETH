On my RPi1B I have the following configuration files:
I also thought I could just setup zone transfers so I don't have to fully configure all the names twice everytime I want to make a change or add a new host.
By the way, this server does everything its supposed to do when it's up: provide local DNS names for hosts on my LAN.
In the Name Servers tab, 10.0.0.3 won't validate The server with this IP address is not authoritative for the required zone.
I have a decent amount of networking knowledge and a basic familiarity with linux command line but I am completely new to DNS.
In Windows DNS Manager, I have A records, CNAMES and a reverse lookup zone.
In Windows DNS Manager, I changed the properties for home.local and 0.0.10.in-addr.arpa as follows:
All local IP addresses are in 10.0.0.0/25 (255.255.255.128)
I've got Windows Server 2012 R2 as a local-only AD/DNS server which needs to be shut-down at times for personal reasons.
I'm trying to just add my RPi1B running dnsmasq on OpenWRT as a secondary DNS server for when I have to shut down my Windows server.
