For example in Flow it's available in the Editing section of the preferences window.
There is this utility magic-launch that lets you set up rules for what you'd like done with certain files.
If you're having issues with file associations, I reccomend installing RCDefaultApp.
It isn't quite what you want (and would only allow you to edit in TM, not other editors, for instance), but may solve the problem for now.
This is managed by a system service called LaunchServices.
There is no direct UI to make bulk changes, but you can adjust a single file type at a time as follows:
For changing the system default your best bet is to try updating the Launch Services database using peterb's answer.
TextMate allows for editing files within other apps using the "Edit in TextMateâ€¦" plugin.
It installs to System Preferences, and provides an easier way to set file associations than via the file type (which may or may not hold in some cases).
You can install this, and then the menu will appear in all apps.
(I assume that if I threw TextMate on the system, it would also show up).
On my installation of Coda, TextWrangler appears as my preferred editor of choice when selecting an external editor.
You should be able to add TextMate to the file types you want to edit, and then it should show up when you right click on a file.
Each of those appropriate applications (Coda, Espresso, Forklift, Flow) will have a preference to say which external editor to use.
