I'm puzzled at the moment, and I'm hoping you can help!
The problem is that I'm experiencing on/off connection issues through my current setup and I'm assuming it's because my configuration isn't correct.
The building has a primary router from the ISP (HITRON CGNV4).
The problem is that this doesn't quite work right.
Since you have a managed switch, which has a web interface with statistics (and possibly error reports), try taking a look at those.
The wireless connections sometimes stop working (however they will stay connected, just with no internet).
Does it start working if you disable and re-enable just the single port through webUI?
My expertly drawn diagram of how everything is linked...
This router is connected to one of those aforementioned cat6 wall sockets.
To provide Wi-Fi in the areas the primary router doesn't reach, there is a router (TL-WR841N) that has been configured to be an access point, offering further wired/wireless connections.
But I don't know why it would happen with your relatively new one.)
(This is not uncommon, especially if the switch happens to be âª†10 years old.
Does the port connected to this particular apartment report many receive errors, or something similar?
This router has one ethernet cable connected to the network switch (TP-LINK TL-SG1016DE), and then there are 9 other ethernet cables coming out of the network switch which are wired to 9 cat6 wall sockets (one in each apartment).
I'm guessing it might be due to some internal IP conflicts but I know very little about this subject.
