So neither zcat or gzcat will work in osx, what can I do?
I expect this is a fairly routine workflow so must have been sorted out by others.
Third parties have packaged GNU gzip for Mac OS X; you can find these from a web search.
However, I found a solution from an even older github thread.
I just gave this a try and found something very interesting!
I have a medium sized script in in bash which uses, zcat/gzcat, sed awk and other basic utilities to process a number of files.
Various people suggest replacing zcat with gzcat; however, gzcat complains that the file is not in gzip format!
For gz files, we are expected to run gzcat on Mac OS.
Funny, I had the same issue when executing a bash-script, bash somescript.sh, which executed a for-loop with gzcat inside it.
In osx, zcat seems to automatically append .Z to the file name.
I don't know why - I'm not an expert macOS-BASH-techie - but it worked in conjunction with my original code ...
Any general suggestions how I can avoid such pain?
gzcat file.txt.gz | awk '{ print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6 }' > ${SOMEDIR}/new.file.txt.
I'd like to duplicate that environment on my osx laptop so I can work offline.
Which is interpreted as /Users/someuser/DIR1/DIR2/DATA.
Which is interpreted as ~/DIR1/DIR2/DATA and apparently doesn't work within the bash-script within macOS.
You can simply use gunzip -c that works similar to zcat without the errors on Mac OS X.
The Mac OS X version of gzip(1) doesn't support reading zip files.
But trying these things inside the somescript.sh-script ...:
