But don't ask me why, it is just one of those "unexplainable" things in Oracle.
First, a self x NATURAL JOIN x should return the same number of rows and columns as the original table.
The 2nd query, that returns 4 rows, seems to be doing a CROSS JOIN instead (if you try with a table of 3 rows, it returns 9).
Oracle database does not understand ANSI join syntax internally (except FULL OUTER JOIN), it rewrites such queries to its own, old join syntax.
See the tests at dbfiddle.uk, where cross joins return this error message:
Second, the query should have given a "ORA-00918: column ambiguously defined" error or something similar because it is not allowed to have 2 tables with same alias in the same FROM clause.
So, the last query that returns 2 rows is correct.
I have seen a case, where the transformation resulted in a similarly ambigiuous final query, and there was an actual error message in the trace file, still, the database returned wrong results and no error to the client.
And run the queries, in the generated trace file, you can view the final form of the query that is executed.
