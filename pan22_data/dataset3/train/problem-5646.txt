In our EDU environment this is typically the result of routine web browsing to reputable sites where an advert exploits a hole in a browser plugin (typically for us its Flash or Java).
For a knowledgeable user who manages their own Windows environment I would recommend that you have multiple accounts on your PC.
The holes in the software allow even with standard user access to a machine the "install" of these fake AV applications.
I state "install", because they are actually user based running from the user's profile space - in this case running as a limited user is not going to stop this.
In our facility we've implemented AppLocker in Windows 7 to address this.
Keep all data outside a specific account to facilitate this.
As mentioned above standard virus scanning applications will not be able to prevent this type of attack.
You have found your self the victim of what we describe as a drive by attack.
An administrator account (which can be used via UAC) for admin task and a standard user account that you could treat as a throw away.
