Now, I'm new to all this server configuration so forgive my naivety.
Or do I have to put that at the top of every web accessible file?
I placed my config.inc.php file into home/ec2-user/.aws/sdk/config.inc.php (.aws I had to create).
I've set up an instance running Amazon Linux AMI x86_64 EBS.
But the crux is this: http://aws.amazon.com/articles/PHP/4261#configurecredentials states I need to
Do I put the putenv('HOME=<your-user-path>'); into my php.ini file?
The only reference to the AWS SDK I can find is at tmp/pear/download/sdk-1.4.7 - I'm confused by this, it seems to me this tmp folder is is a temp directory so is the SDK installed somewhere else and i've just not seen it?
If I try and navigate to /root through FTP I get an error 'could not retrieve file listing - make sure you have permission to modify...'.
I installed httpd, and PEAR, then installed the AWS SDK.
The first option could work for me, but the folder is not writable.
Then on my webpage echo getenv('HOME'); returns /root.
I'm unsure if sudo chown ec2-user /tmp/pear/download/sdk-1.4.7 would be safe to do.
If someone could guide me a little I'd be most grateful.
