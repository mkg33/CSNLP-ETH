I cleaned cookies and everything and I disabled all extensions.

It appeared to be something wrong with my DNS provider (Open DNS), as quick switch to Google's ended up fixing it.
I bought the Netgear DGN1000v3 router and after that Chrome slowly open pages or partially load them.
I tried from the macbook pro too (which have 10.9 too) and the same problem.
The easiest way is to clear the cache through the command line per OS.
I finally narrowed down the issue to my DNS cache.
But again whenever i try to load Facebook or Google it won't load the css files and many times the js files.
All browsers implement the caching differently, therefore a generic solution is best.

So this is one of my first steps to fix the issue.
With Safari and Firefox I don't have that problem.
I don't know if this is a router problem but it started when i changed my router.
But most of the time my Internet issues are due to dirty DNS cache.
Sometimes the DNS cache get dirty for some reason.
