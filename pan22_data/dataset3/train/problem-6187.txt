Next, run the User Accounts control panel by typing control userpasswords2 in the Run command.
This should work-or at least it always has for me.
On the Users tab, uncheck the box "Users must enter a username..." and then add the username and password to autologon with.
For a Windows 2008 domain member, add AutoAdminLogon as a string value (REG_SZ)  with a value of 1 to the key
Can't you just schedule a task for that program and use that user's credentials?
If you need to start a program or something that is not available as service, have a look at Group Policy (Active Directory) or the Local Security Policy (if not in a domain).
It's always a security risk to have a user (or administrator) logged in locally to a server.
You say you need the program to run in a specific user session.
It permits you to make windows logon automaticaly under a specified account with the credentials encrypted.
You can define scripts that will be run after boot (or before shutdown, after login/logout, etc) without user interaction.
You'll get the whole user settings: my documents, settings, etc, just as if the user was present.
