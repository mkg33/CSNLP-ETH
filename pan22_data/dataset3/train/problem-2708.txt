I've only found one fool-proof solution if you have so many groups that there is no whitespace you can click.
Finding the 'empty' whitespace is difficult when your groups already appear to fill it.
Not ideal but is a solution, hopefully this could be fixed at some point.
It's good, but there's one thing which I really struggle with.
So how do I create a new group at the top level, in Password Safe?
In the end I simply chose Add Entry from the Edit menu, and then on the dialog I overwrote the Group name with my new Group name, and made a dummy entry.
Right-click an existing top-level group and click "Duplicate Group".
Only thing is that, as far as I can determine, the only thing Password Safe allows me to do is select an existing group.
I want to add a top level group within Password Safe, like "Work", so that I can place within that the sites I log into for work, the passwords I use there, etc.
No matter what, I could not create a group at the top level, despite there already being many such groups in our team database.
My solution is to maximise window and scroll as far as possible and click right at the very bottom, under the last entry.
I am using Password Safe 3.35.01 and found the same problem.
Password Safe is an application to help you track all of the passwords you use at various sites.
Right clicking anywhere else just brings up the dialogue box as it would right clicking on a group.
And if I do and then issue the Add Group command, it puts that under the group I've selected.
The other solutions I found (right clicking in whitespace / selecting a top level group and choosing Add Group from the Edit menu) did not work for me.
