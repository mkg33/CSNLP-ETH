It doesn't work dragging from the Bookmarks drop-down list (doing that will just go to the bookmarked page).
As far as my knowledge and research over the net, there is NO SOLUTION for this.
I have tried in fresh OS installation with latest service pack and Windows Update and in latest Firefox versions many times.
I just did this and it worked for me: I went to recent history and dragged the site I wanted over to an empty thumbnail spot after I deleted a bunch I didn't want.
next in the search bar that appears type browser and press enter
There is no need to add it to your bookmarks prior doing this.
next with the page down locate the browser.newtab.url
The link in the answer by Sheldrake/Avirk does work, but be careful to do it exactly as described.
You have to select the "show all bookmarks" from the bookmark drop-down to get the bookmark organizer window with the tree-type navigation to open up.
Just select, drag and drop the full url address from browser's address bar on top of one of the empty cells in the New Tab tab.
The method, the Firefox mentions, doesn't work at all.
It was a lucky try after trying many other things.
what you need is to type about:config in the url and press enter
once on it press enter and replace about:blank with eg http://www.google.co.uk
Bookmarks can be dragged from the list in that window to the thumbnail page (assuming you went to that new tab page first).
from then on every time you press the + you get that web page.
I don't know why there is still no link or instruction for this on the actual thumbnail page.
