(if your paper format is not in the list, in the General Configuration --> General settings --> Paper, you can define custom paper formats)
Now can I select all PDF files, and hit the print button from the windows explorer, but this does not automatically send the files to the correct printer.
Example video that does print job routing based on number of pages: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03RbCbBkAL8&list=PLDF2C2AD95B2B2FC2&index=2
There is a commercial tool (30-day trial) that is capable of doing this, not only on the size, but it can also check on how much colour to route the print job (or number of pages).
Is there any way or tool to automatically select the right printer based on the papersize in the PDF?
I want to print all those pages, and not have to manually select the correct printer (normal printer for A4 and A3, plotter for A2 and A0).
Configure each Printer Channel so that only selects the pages that are needed, in this case printer channel 1 only needs to select A4 and A3 pages and print these, others should be deselected and ignored:
Maybe there are other ways to do it, but that is how I would quickly do it.
I regularly find myself printing like 10 PDF documents , all 1 page per document with various page sizes.
