IMO neither of those should be part of your initial calculations.
But I was more concerned with performance/features.
In this particular situation dev version was helpful.
I'm not a big nginx pro, but in my experience development version is usable enough(no chashes so far) and it also had a fixed bug with 201 response code while the stable one hang when i was trying to give 201 from the backend server.
According to Nginx (quoted repeatedly on their site, here is one example)
While stable is theoretically more likely to be abused by a minor bug that hasn't been back-ported, mainline is theoretically more likely to have a 0-day or overlooked bug that made it through testing and early deployment.
You should have a backup and ideally a rollover server in any case.
Anyway, potential risk of bugs I think is a serious reason to go and stick with stable version, even if it might be less performant.
The reason to use the stable is mostly for plugins - the stable won't change anything a plugin might be relying on.
The "development" branch is also called "mainline".
Does anyone know the major differences between the Nginx Development and Stable editions?
