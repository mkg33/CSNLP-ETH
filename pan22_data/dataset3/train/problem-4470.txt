With apache, I just set my browser to send a custom header that acted like an access password and apache would allow access if that header value was correct.

Nginx location exact match matches beyond arguement
I tried all the answers here and nothing worked how I liked.
Basically I have a dev server that should be accessed only by me, but I have dynamic ip and have to change config file everyday.
Is there a way I could allow access to a directory only if certain custom header is present and the value matches?

I researched a lot to solve a simple problem: Only allow proxy_pass if request have a specific token in the header.
That makes it a password, instead of acting like one.
