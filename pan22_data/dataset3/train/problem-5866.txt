Or just open your computer take out hard disk and open up the other computer and connect you hard disk.
it is in the partition next to C: that I tried to shrink.
Connect your hard disk to another computer as an external hard drive and open dive C or any drive that you had you document and just copy everything to the other computer and when you are than just re install windows but this time do it a clean installation.
But with the bad windows hard drive it just doesn't boot.
take the front part and connect it to your hard disk and use the USB cable to connect to your computer.
I connect this hard disk to another working windows computer, boot from the hard drive that has the working windows, and it gets stuck at 'starting windows' screen.
And it is not a device selection issue as the grub screen doesn't show up and it goes straight to starting windows screen.
The other options don't work as well.. safe mode/repair etc.
Trying to access the drive I was trying to shrinkfrom ubuntu says I need to run CHKDSK /f on it from windows.But I can access the C: partition from ubuntu fine.
The grub screen shows up(dual boot win7 and ubuntu) and when I select windows it hangs at 'starting windows' screen.
Do not connect the hard disk to other computer as a primary hard drive.
Second take out the front part of hard drive that connects hard drive to the cable.
I remove the hard disk with the bad windows installation, it boots fine.
I got a windows 7 CD and made a bootable usb flash drive with it.
I tried to shrink a partition(not C: drive) from ubuntu using gparted so that I can allocate more space to C:.
They boot, but when I enter system repair, it gets stuck at 'System Restore options' screen where it detects the partition with the faulty windows but I can't click next or anything.
