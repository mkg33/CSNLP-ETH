I'm always using the latest version of Firefox, currently that's 54.0.1 32-bit on a 64-bit Windows 7 OS.
After having my last PSU die on me, and then running on a borrowed 250W one for a few months, I finally got round to installing a new one.
When opening Task Manager during or just before the freeze, Firefox shows around 25% of total CPU, although it has been as high as 60% in the past, and the first of the four cores of the CPU (two physical, two virtual) in particular seems most affected, rather than all of them taking equal strain.
If it's none of these, does anyone have any idea what could be causing it?
Memory is usually hitting around 4-5GB, though this has never really been a problem as I have 16GB installed.
Since about a week after installing the VS550, CPU usage started to peak to crazy levels when using Firefox, after which it'd freeze and require a kill in Task Manager.
This is usually triggered by either having a large amount of tabs open (usually more than 15) or just one or two on a really slow site.
To play it safe, I decided to buy a 550W Corsair VS550.
It was also my first time installing one, so is it also possible that it could be a bad install on my part that's at fault?
No other program registers as using significant amounts of CPU when this peak happens.
I inputted the wattage of all my current parts into a few sites and consistently kept coming up with 300W figures.
I can't recall having had this behavior happen before I installed the new PSU, and if it ever did happen it definitely wasn't as consistent.
Is it at all possible that the PSU could be causing these spikes/freezes?
