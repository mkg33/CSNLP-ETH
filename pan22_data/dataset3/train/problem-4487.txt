It was nice for grouping ip ranges and you could look at an IP and know exactly what it was..  Oh the 10.4.20.Xs are all databases, etc...
You might expand, you might want to set up separate subnets for some parts of your network, and so forth.
It's a lot easier to do a nmap ping scan of a /24 than a /16.
One network I inherited was full of /16s.. ie 10.1.x.x, 10.2.x.x..
You may only need one subnet now, but who's to say you won't need more in the future?
Depending on the size of your subnet broadcasts might be a problem, although depending on the speed of your network they might not.
Eventually we had to clean it up, and finding all the random one off IPs was a chore.
If you picked /22 as your mask you would have 16,384 networks that could have 1022 devices:
I think a general rule of allocate for what you need today with a healthy overhead to grow in to is a good practice.
As well you would see a lot of gratuitous ARP on your Broadcast Domin.
Well, The Switch connected to your Uber-IP server does have a limited Number of entries available in the ARP table.
One disadvantage however is that you're limiting your future expansion capability.
A good rule of thumb with these things is to take what you think you need and double it, so if you have 50 hosts (and don't forget to include servers, printers, switches, etc here) a 25 bit netmask (giving you 128 hosts, less 2 for network and broadcast) will cover what you need and give you some headroom.
I would start with the max number of devices that would ever be on a network, and double or triple it, and then see if I had enough networks.
I'd also drop the "class" thinking and use CIDR for your subnets.
Classes don't really exist anymore outside of university courses and history books, and CIDR just gives you so much more flexibility.
By using the TEN net it shouldn't be hard to find a balance.
