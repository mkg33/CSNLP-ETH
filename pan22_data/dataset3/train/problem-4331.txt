Again, just a work around I'm afraid but it saves a reboot or two.
Untick the Persistent Bitmap Caching box to disable bitmap caching.
Keep windows logo key pressed and hit p until the login screen shows up.
Set time limit for disconnected sessions (set this to Enabled and make sure the option is set to Never end a disconnected session)
There are a few issues and workarounds for this, so I will cover the most common cause of the problem (especially when connecting to Amazon Cloud servers):
I then seem to have only two choices: rebooting or working from a remote desktop connection, which works fine.
After connecting from my home via remote desktop, both my screens are black when I arrive at work.
However, I did the same from my laptop in a meeting room today, and I didn't have any problem.

It looks like in our case this was related to desktop extension and multiple monitors.
Use the keyboard to log into your account (we press Esc a few times, then ctrl+alt+delete, then enter password and hit enter) you will log in and the monitor that wasn't showing the mouse cursor will come back to life.
I could eventually fix it by pressing WINDOWS-P and ENTER, to choose the active screen.
The only thing I can see is a mouse pointer on one of the screens.
While not a fix this is the work around we found to avoid restarting: While one of you screens is black and not showing the mouse the log-in screen is actually there.
Edit Group Policy (not sure where it is at in the start menu, or if it is in the start menu, but the type to find worked)
Hope this helps, but let me know if you need any further info!
