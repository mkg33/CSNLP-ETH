I believe that since you already have 4GB of RAM, you will experience any noticeable increase in general performance if you add another 4GB of RAM.
If you're waiting for the disk (the light is blinking) while you're lagging, you want the SSD.
In addition, by swapping out a rotating disk with an SSD, you get a less noisy laptop and can get better battery performance since the laptop doesn't have to worry about spinning up and down the drives platters.
That said, which of the two options, adding a 4GB DDR3 or a 100GB SSD, would better facilitate the notebook in my case?
The notebooks bears lots of computing and programming tasks and I need to alternate between vmware guest os(linux) and my host win8 quite often.
If you run a large application or two and don't use a lot of data constantly (such as photo editing), the RAM will make a bigger difference.
In that case you would of course get better performance by adding more RAM to the system.
Examples are when you boot your computer and when starting larger software packages like Photoshop, the Office suit and similar.
I am using thinkpad E430 with win8 as my primary workstation.
Note that I put to ground that you do not use software that has extreme memory requirements.
I currently have a 4GB RAM and a 500GB HDD, but I can still feel significant latency when alternating working os in VMWare, and hence want to invest more in the hardware.
As a result, I am very concerned about the speed of the computer(especially in VMWare).
Moving to 8GB of RAM from 4 will yield noticeable improvement as you will not be paging as much.
However if you swap out the hard drive, you will see a general performance boost whenever you are reading a lot of data from the drive.
However, a SSD will also increase speed in that your machine will be paging, but it will be able to read and write faster.
