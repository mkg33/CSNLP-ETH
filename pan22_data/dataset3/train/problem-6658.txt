Do not attempt to backup a filesystem that is currently in use.
The free version should be fine if you're not in a hurry.
As such, your image can be restored to a partition and will be bootable.
You can also use Disk Utility to restore from an existing partition.
The paid version can update your backup very quickly with the "smart update" feature.
Carbon Copy Cloner is free and easy, and will make disk images.
Do I need to use some 3rd party software like CCC or Disk Utility is just fine?
Yup, you can restore to a bootable backup from an image created with Disk Utility.
That includes whichever filesystem you are currently booted from, for example.
The partition includes the filesystem, and the filesystem includes the "blessed" system folder and "blessed" startup file.
Some years ago (before switched to Mac) I have used Acronis True Image for creating/restoring full image of NTFS partitions.
I've noticed that it's possible to create/restore images using Disk Utility when booting from Mac OS X Install DVD.
If you boot from the OS X Installation disc, you can certainly use Disk Utility to back up a partition on the internal HDD.
What I want to do is somehow fully backup my bootable HFS+ partition, store an image (not obligatory an image, because if I understand correctly CCC, for example, doesn't create images) on external USB drive, then do some repartitioning on a disk and finally restore backup in one of newly created partitions.
But I'm not sure about whether this tool creates full (bootable) backup or not.
I have tried many solutions and came to the conclusion that the best one, by far, is SuperDuper.
