The 192.168 address is the IP address of your machine in relation to your local network.
For example, if I have my PC, my mobile device, and a console connected to my router, my PC might be 192.168.0.1 , my mobile device might be 192.168.0.2 and my console would then be 192.168.0.3 and so on.
This is how other websites see your IP address - they do not care about your local IP address which is only important to your router, they want to know to which ISP the content should be delivered, and which user of that ISP, more specifically.
On the other hand, the other IP address you gave is probably much greater than 0.1 or 0.2 , because that's the IP address in relation to your ISP.
The router is then free to dispatch traffic to a set of private IP addresses to allow multiple computers to use the same public IP.
If you were to go to someone else's house you'd probably find that their local IP address also begins with 192.168 starting with 192.168.0.1 and going up one by one for each device connected to the router.
The IP shown by a website correspond to the IP of your connection endpoint.
This is not a question for http://security.stackexchange.com.
This mean it's not an address that can be seen from "the outside".
Your local IP address only matters to your own router.
Typically this is the IP given by your ISP to your modem/router when it's connected to the internet.
If you do a little research about IPs, you will quickly see that 192.168.0.0/16 range is reserved for private networks.
