If you want full screen mode, set the slider all the way to the right.
I am Using Dell Latitude E5450 Laptop with windows 7.
I've also seen users not being able to maximize because of the Screen setting "Use multiple monitors for this connection" - when this is checked, the Full screen slider remains locked.
I solved this problem by going to the icons on my local toolbar and unpinning the most recent ones from my toolbar.
Then, I opened the saved .rdp file in a text editor (Notepad or Wordpad will work.)
Setting my RDP to full screen mode and having the session maximized did not prevent horizontal and vertical scroll bars from appearing.
When you launch RDP dialog and before you logon/connect to the remote computer, select the Display Tab and set your display configuration.
To get rid of these bars, I saved my RDP connection settings by pressing Save As... on the first tab of the configuration.
Immediately, upon unpinning a password manager, my remote toolbar appeared.
I am using Windows 10 and RDPing into a Linux box.
I then added this line to the top of the file, saved it and used this .rdp file to successfully log in without scroll bars:
