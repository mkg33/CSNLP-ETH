If you have an existing wildcard cert (the csr was generated from another host) you will need to download or generate the wildcard cert in pfx format.
I have a wildcard Cert from godaddy that is installed in our network on  a 2008 R2 server running IIS.
My Issue is that I now have a windows 2008 R2 server running JBoss as its webserver and i need to import this wildcard cert into this webserver.
From here you need to change your server.xml connector node to keystoreType="PKCS12" and point keystoreFile="myCert.pfx" you will also need your keystorePass="mypassword"  with that updated restart jBoss and it should be working.
I have several windows servers now using this wildcard cert and importing into IIS was very straight forward.
There might be another way to do it but that is my experience.
So, for your first step you probably need to import your certs into a JKS keystore.
Can someone provide help in importing my wildcard cert into my  5.X JBoss server
Well, for one thing, the biggest difference is that JBoss reads the cert from a JKS keystore.
See the JBOSS server.xml and there is a config section for the keystore in the SSL connector.
Now that I think about it, you'll need to import the signed cert into the very same keystore (forming a chain) that you used to generate a CSR from when you initially bought your certificate.
