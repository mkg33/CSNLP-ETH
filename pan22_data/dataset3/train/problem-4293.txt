1, Halve the size of the active interval by flipping its middle coin a couple of times.
A good old trick is that it's sufficient to give an algorithm that achieves this with $O(\log n)$ expected number of coin flips and $99\%$ probability, as if we are exceeding the expected running time a lot, we can just output anything, using Markov's inequality this won't ruin our error much.
We can check this coin with $\log n$ further coin tosses (though I'm not sure if this is necessary).
Always keep an active interval that is supposed to contain an approximately unbiased coin (but might not).
Thus, in $O(\log n)$ expected time, we reach size $1$, which means one coin.
This way, with a constant number of coin tosses we halve the size of our active interval with high probability and double it with small probability.
2, Flip both ends of the active interval a couple of times to check that we made no errors.
Update the active interval (if the middle coin showed no bias, then arbitrarily).
If an error is detected, then go back to the previous active interval.
