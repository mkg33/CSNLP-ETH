If you have a column for the various balances in one row, you will improve performance when looking up this information.
As you will likely be adding various units over the life of the game, having to change a similar table every time to create a new "totals" can be painful from a maintenance perspective, especially when the alternative allows you to create new options without touching your tables at all.
I would suggest to add balances and resource rates to the table for towns and make the general values of the resources part of your PHP code base.
This suggestion is based on a number of assumptions, though:
A design like this does become a problem if you are changing values or creating a large number of them.
For resources, this likely isn't an issue... but take a look at say units instead.
Resource balances for a given town seem to be the kind of information that you will have to retrieve regularly, so improving the performance of this data retrieval is desirable.
Looking up and returning 1 row is faster than returning X rows and generating the totals from the compiled results.
Design Wise: Academic DB design will say that this isn't a good thing to do.
