If you already have hardware, you can find a compatible 20 bay chassis that supports your drive needs like this.
As Keven suggested it’s possible but you’re obviously going to be limited on case space if you don’t want it all sprawled out.
and the only reason for that is if you had a drive size limitation recognized and dozens of 200Mb drives to be used (but then again those would be IDE (parellel) not SATA interconnects.
A typical desktop motherboard usually has much 4, 6, or even 8 SATA connections.
Considering if your hard drives or lff or sff, you can fit 12 or 24 sata hard drives into this chassis, for example.
you can easily do 10 to 12 per MB with a big enough power supply and a pair of PCI SATA cards.
alternatively USB through a hub can stack (daizychain) up to 127 devices through one USB port, but that's a lot of wiring nest, NAS w/4 drives per device would be a better alternative.
Typically that many hard drives in a single device isn't marketed to the general public.
then you just network them together as shared access.
The chassis you will want will need to be a server model or custom fabricated one.
some motherboards have a native support for 4 or 8 SATA drives, and i'd look for one that has 3-4 PCI expansion slots so you can use atleast 2 of those for cards.
possibly considering speed as they could be used for data cache buffers if you were working with huge image files, but still one is good enough for that.
Then you will need to purchase a powerful enough power supply(s) and you may want a raid card as well to connect all your hard drives.
so knowing WHY matters unless it is just for storage, then a raid array is only 5 drives at maximum per array for 3x redundancy (2 striped pairs and a third as backup to those).
You can add expansion cards to increase the number.
now you havent explained what the purpose for so many drives when 4Tb drives are available, so WE can only guess what your up to.
NAS is a good idea but you’ll need more hardware, so you could look at RAID arrays or cards for your PC if you have a case big enough.
The first thing you want to find is a chassis big enough to support all the hard drives you want.

10-20 drives is likely not to have the physical space to put them in.
