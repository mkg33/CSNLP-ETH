I was finally able to restart my instance by creating an image via the Amazon console.
Worked fine after rebooting again using the EC2 Management Console.
I found I was able to resolve the issue by completely stopping (not rebooting) my AMI using the AWS console and then starting it back up.
Right click on the instance name and click on "Change Security Groups".
Make sure that the Security group you created that allows anyone from anywhere to Port 22 is checked and applied to this instance.
I had the same issue after running a vanilla sudo reboot command.
No SSH access, stop/start/reboot commands from Amazon admin console gave me no result too.
In my case I'd set up a security group to allow port 22 connections from my IP only.
For whatever reason, restarting the AMI from the AWS console, as in clicking the restart action as opposed to stopping and then starting the instance, did not fix the problem.
The image creation process seems to fix the instance state.
Some days later my ISP has changed my IP address, hence the security group needs updating.
I got this problem after doing sudo reboot now via SSH on my EC2 server running Ubuntu 14.04.
I had a similar problem, my EC2 Amazon Linux instance was not reachable anymore after running sudo reboot.
