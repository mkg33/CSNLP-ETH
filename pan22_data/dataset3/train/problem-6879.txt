The best approach, which I have tried successfully, is the Microsoft Diagnostic and Recovery Toolset:
If you have admin, just go to UAC and change the password.
You should try your common passwords with and without caps-locks on.
Or, yet again, as admin, just steal the files and put them in a new different account to which you can create a new password for.
Formerly known as ERD Commander 2005, this was absorbed by Microsoft when they bought Wintenals.
On a more serious note, the official word from Microsoft is:

If not, just ask to borrow someones account to fix the one you forgot the password to.
You could also try a third-party reset utility, such as the Offline NT Password and Registry editor: I have not tried it on Vista, but it worked fine on my XP box back in the day, and claims that it now supports Vista.
It's a long shot, but try "John the Ripper" from insecure.org.
I was trying to take the whole Windows Security thing seriously, and managed to mistype my password the same way in the password and confirmation boxes.
My solution then was to keep retyping my password as fast as I could, and I eventually hit on the right combination of sloppy keystrokes ;)
You can enter a new password, but you will 'lose access to its encrypted files, eâ€‘mail messages that are encrypted, and stored passwords for websites or network resources.'
...which boils down to 'make a password reset disk'.
