Windows 10 was installed from iso, not updated from previous version.
I had the same problem for a while, eventually installed new drivers and it got fixed.
In this state nothing helps — rebooting the router, restarting wireless adapter in device manager manually, deleting network from known — except restarting the PC.
Otherwise all i can recommend is reinstalling the Drivers or in the end windows 10 again.
After the disconnect it behaves strangely: when I try to connect, the wireless network adapter seems to get disabled and reenabled back.
as a workaround what i did was disabling the Network adapter from Devices and then enabling it again.
The device is Qualcomm Atheros AR956x Wireless Network Adapter, with latest drivers.
Since I installed Windows 10, with the last 4 wifi networks I used the same problem happens: after a while (several hours, varies) system disconnects and then it cannot connect back until I restart the computer.
This question is similar to various other questions.
Is there a way to get it connect back without closing running apps?
