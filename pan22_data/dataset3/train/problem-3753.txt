All the online help I fine says to create your partitions and then create an md0 raid volume using something like sda1 and sdb1 for the raid.
If you want to be able to boot from your linux raid1 device, you need to do the following:
And that mdx device will stay available even if one of the drives of the array fails.
Install grub on BOTH sda and sdb, both times telling grub that THAT disk is hd0.
If that does not work pull the broken disk, especially if it is a SATA disc and not a SAS disk (SATA does not always fail gracefully).
No partitions on the disks, add (for example) /dev/sda and /dev/sdb to your raid1 device.
I want two 100% identical drives so that if one fails, I can install a new drive, repair and run without any loss of data.
I've tried things like making sure to install GRUB on both disks, making sure the drives were as identical as possible...
So my question is, what if drive sda goes down...how will drive sdb boot up?
Create a regular "MBR"-style partition with fdisk on the raid device and use that either as your root filesystem (or /boot, if you want encrypted root).
This means that whatever disk the BIOS things is 0x80 will be read and booted correctly.
I am setting up a linux server with two drives in an mdadm created raid 1.
It should just give up on a disk and continue searching.
Use --metadata=1.0 when you create the raid (to store the raid superblock at the end of the disk.)
The only exciting part is if you want to boot and your firmware want to find a bootsector or EFI file.
The re-synchronization is also harder than it should be / seems, so make sure you document that part.
If you do this and you're serious, you should test to see if you can boot the system with either disk and re-synchronize the mirror once it is back up.
If you installed a mirror then you are not using sda nor sdb.
Practically speaking, the SuperGrub CD (http://www.supergrubdisk.org/) is likely to be able to help you recover when this happens.
