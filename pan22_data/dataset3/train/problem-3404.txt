since i think group by itself is actually translated to the same nested selects later and then executed.
If you want to know how many orders each buyer placed, you would use GROUP BY along with an aggregate function (SUM(), MAX(), COUNT(), etc), like this:
If you want to see the number or purchases per buyer and date, you would add the Date column to the SELECT as well as the GROUP BY:
Now i want to show the list of purchases along with the associated names of the seller and the buyer
GROUP BY, on the other hand, is used to aggregate data.
.. with one exception: Your subquery won't work if it returns more than one record (i.e.
Since sellerID and BuyerID refers to the same table, i need two nested selects to fetch their names, so i would write:
this is the first method, and i guess it can be done using group by statement as well ( though myself couldn't do it, since both fields refer to one able, i got stuck at the join section!)
Is there any difference between these two statements ?
I am curious to know about the differences between using group by statement and nested selects to achieve the same result.
