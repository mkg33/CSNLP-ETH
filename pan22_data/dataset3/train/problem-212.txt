smartctl -a /dev/sda which will produce a lot of information including manufacturer and model number; cross-referencing that on the manufacturer's website is usually fairly simple.
But the surest way is to open the case and look at the cable.
For modern systems all PATA/SATA drives will show up as /dev/sd because the new ATA layer uses the sd prefix.
You don't necessarily need to shut off the machine to do that, depending on the system you're looking at and what kind of tangled nest of cables you have around the case.
If the system can be rebooted you could use the Ultimate Boot CD to run a hard disk diagnostic, they normally identify the drive type and model.
Even the BIOS might tell you at reboot what kind of drive it is.
If it were IDE, it would very likely show up as /dev/hda.
Not got IDE or SCSI I can test with, but should be different on them, as SATA has different speeds.
MadHatter is right in that the designation difference would be /dev/hdx versus /dev/sdx.
I realize this post is old (Linux now lumps IDE/PATA drives in with /dev/sd?)
Which gives the following output for a system with one SATA and one PATA drive:
You will only see /dev/hd if your OS uses the old deprecated ATA drivers.
If you run sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX | grep Gen, it should give you output something like this on a SATA drive.
