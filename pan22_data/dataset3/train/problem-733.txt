I am setting up a server and I have the choice of installing qmail or postfix.
Exim is installed by default but a pain to configure and has suffered from many security holes.
Performance is quite good even when running it in an OpenVZ VM.
I also set up SqlGrey, ClamAV, SpamAssassin and Maia Mailguard (http://www.maiamailguard.com) to keep the malware and spammers at bay.
The IMAP server is somewhat well know, I just know it's fast and reliable.
Dropmail delivery agent has a rather expansive scripting language (very similar to C with RE).
No doubt about it, Postfix is MUCH easier to set up and is also more actively maintained and developed.
That sort of competition is just bound to result in good solid software on both sides.
I can install it from packages, but I prefer to compile it myself to get the "-O2" flag in there.
Postfix is beauty incarnate, I've been using it since 99 and have never had cause to complain.
In fact, the Postfix author (Weitse Venema) and the qmail author (Dan Bernstein) had a sort of "feud" going where each was trying to prove that their software was better and more secure than the other.
And as another response mentioned, Postfix is also designed to be secure.
Qmail is crippled by Dan Bernstein's weird licensing which prevents any of the Linux distributions from shipping it.
Also, the Packt book Linux Email is awesome, buy a copy!
I like it, it's quick, reliable, and well documented.
