dcpromo will fail if the schema needs upgraded (and will cause no harm in doing so).
In either case it is not necessary to join the computer to the domain before you run dcpromo.
If the schema needs upgraded then you'll need to run adprep against the existing domain first.

I did this a week or two ago (except 2003 which has minor differences) below are links that helped me do this.

So long as the machine is configured with DNS server(s) that can resolve records for the domain you can run dcpromo straight-away after installing Windows.

I don't understand what you mean by "I want it to be the forest root".
Perhaps you mean "I want it to be a domain controller in the forest root domain" with, perhaps, the added "I also want it to hold all the FSMO roles."
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/238369 (scroll down to removing)  It's essentailly just running dcpromo and following the prompts.
The forest root domain is just that-- a domain-- and not a particular server.
I didn't demote the old DC though but i included a link for that
adprep is only necessary if you're upgrading the schema of an existing domain to the Windows Server 2008 R2 level.
You can join the domain, if you like, but you don't have to, either.
