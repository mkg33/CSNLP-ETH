Statement 2: "Sorry I'm late, somebody slashed my tires."
Tell them the truth, and divulge as much as you feel they need to know, without getting too technical.
(note: if you had been hacked and user data was at risk, that's when I would switch over to a more up-front tell-all policy)
Just don't offer too many details unless you're pressed to do so.
This is why corporations never tell the whole truth even though we demand they do.
Tell them you had a big network outage and that you really worked your butt off to get it worked out.
