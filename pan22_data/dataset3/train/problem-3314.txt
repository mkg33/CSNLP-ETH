The main feature I'm missing on these switches vs our nicer (but old) 3Com equipment is the ability to trace a mac address down to a specific port in the address tables.
I have no idea whether or not Netdisco supports your devices, but that's the tool I've turned to in the past for keeping track of the physical location of MAC addresses on my networks.
I agree with him, you need to find the mac address first, and look for it ini your 3Com switch.
Now that you know the MAC address, search the mac address table:

To make a long story short, I have some newer off-brand switches in just a few locations.
You could do something like (I know it's cisco, bear with me):
