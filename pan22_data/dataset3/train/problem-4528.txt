I upgraded my development laptop from Vista 64 to RC1 with no problems and have upgraded my wife's Tablet PC from Vista 64 Ultimate to Win7 64 Ultimate with no problems.
The upgrade adviser was very good - it asked me to Deauthorize iTunes before upgrading and showed the OneCare installation would have to be removed before continuing.
Several other individuals in my office have upgraded with no problems to report.
"Upgrading" requires a copy of Vista, just installing it can be done with a blank HDD.
Generally it's better to install it fresh, but Upgrading keeps settings and programs installed.
Just to chip in, do not upgrade from one OS to another.
I recommend fresh-installs for major updates like this, but if you want to upgrade, the (ridiculously complex) upgrade matrix is available from Microsoft here:  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/discover/blog.aspx?p=c3d7d289-3ae2-43ea-b275-2c7773d0f9a2
Any other combination (switching 32-bit to 64-bit, upgrading from/to a combination not listed above, or upgrading from XP or prior) becomes a "Custom install" (ie, install from scratch).
It'll probably work, but the experience is never as good as a fresh install particularly if the base OS has been in use for some time.
