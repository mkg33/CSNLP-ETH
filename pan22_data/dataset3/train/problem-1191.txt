A quick test would be to take a machine that has never had the issue and hook it up to the same connection as a machine that has had the issues and see if you get duplicates.
Turned out someone had been doing some "creative redundant wiring" (they figured the more cables you run between switches, the more bandwidth between them!)
On the other hand if it only happens to specific machines no matter which user is logged in, then it is machine or network connection related.
The first thing to determine is if the problem is with the user or the machine.
I've had problems like that, usually caused by skewed clocks.
If you move a user to a machine that hasn't had the problem before, and the problem follows them, then it is a user based issue.
I think I would want to see if you can replicate the problem on a completely clean install of windows.
Had a similar problem with a remote site once that turned out to be a wiring/switching/networking issue.
Check the time on ALL your servers / clients and make sure they're no more then 5 minutes out of sync.
You mention that it only happens for Windows XP and no other operating system.
Apply all the patches, do not install any software.
First steps in trying to diagnose a problem quickly is trying to duplicate it on demand.
Since it is linked just to XP, I would be tempted to do a clean install with original media (avoid slipstreamed, or vlite media).
No answer per se, but please check the Server Event Logs for any errors when this happens and I bet you could get a good idea.
