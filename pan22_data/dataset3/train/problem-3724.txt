You can work around that by sourcing ~/.bashrc explicitly at the start of your webpack.sh script, assuming everything in there is safe to run in a non-interactive shell.
That means that the yarn command is only available if the user is logged in as kenny.
So consider adding this line to the start of your script:
Considering systemd is only running bash as the interpreter of the webpack.sh script (in fact, it doesn't even know that bash is involved, the kernel executes it as the interpreter from the #!
That tool adds a directory to the PATH env variable by editing '~/.bashrc'.
kenny has a tool called nvm installed that manages nodejs versions.
bash will only source ~/.bashrc if you're running it as an interactive shell, it won't do that if you're simply running bash for a script.
Is there any way that I can import kenny's PATH variable into the systemd unit?
line), then it's not an interactive shell, and no startup files are read.
I was left with the impression that if I set the systemd's unit's user to 'kenny', systemd will take care of the rest, or I don't know what I was thinking.
