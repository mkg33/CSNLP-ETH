On the other hand, it would be important for other security mechanisms beyond ACLs, for example, mandatory access control such as SELinux or AppArmor (both on Linux).
There is a hidden Explorer setting, ForceCopyAclwithFile, that would tell it to copy the ACLs as well.
That is, SELinux attaches MAC information to files, and it is preserved when renaming a file; meanwhile, AppArmor rules are written based on literal paths, no matter what file is there.
If the settings were on a file, it doesn't mean they'd be copied automatically.
In practice, the copy function first duplicates the contents, then adjusts timestamps, then duplicates ACLs...
So, the closest approximation of an answer to your question would be that the file would take "the copied file's permissions."
And if the settings were on a location, it doesn't mean they couldn't be copied.
If you're making a new copy, it inherits the destination folder's ACLs.
On the one hand, your question's title â€“ "Are windows security settings on the file or on the location?"
For instance, a file C:\Temp\temp.txt with an explicit Write permission set for a certain user, will not have this permission on it's copied instance.
By default in Windows, copied files will not retain permissions set to them explicitly.
The copied instance will receive any inherited permissions applicable for its new path.
For instance, any inherited permissions on C:\Temp will still apply when temp.txt is copied as temp2.txt.
