If you're running Windows 7 or 2008 R2 this is called Credential Manager and can be located by entering that into the start menu.
If you have that open, under Windows Credentials, you can create new saved credentials for basically anything you like.
It can also cause slow authentication if you don't have a domain controller on the same local network segment as the machine, as it has to authenticate against a domain controller on the remote network.
I assume that the remote machine is on a VPN or can somehow access the resources of the office network?
Joining the machine to the domain is by far the easiest solution, but it can present problems of its own, especially if the machine is going to be away from the domain for extended periods of time.
Note that example and example.domain.local can result in different authentication matches, so make sure you're consistant in how you access the resources.
If you don't want to go this path, you can manually enter credentials for each network resource you want to access.
