For instance, if you change the direction every turn, well, your river feels weird, so you should change the direction only after a random number of steps.
This way, the rainfall map shows where lakes will be.
What is great about rivers is that they make your landscape feel less flat, as if there is some hidden height, even if everything is flat.
Now, for beginners, you achieve natural rivers without using Voronoi diagrams, if you generate a height map and then plot the river from the river source to the sea or ocean (basically the lowest point on your height map, which is the river end, so to speak), like so:
And, lakes and random "river sources" are then where I start rivers.
I am sure that SimCity generates additional height maps in order to make rivers more natural.

If you lack a height map, because you are in flat lands, well, just create a fake one and see how the rivers behave.
There is a well-know article on how to generate terrain from 2010, here:
Lakes and ponds are different and done in a second step.
I always work with the combination of height, rainfall and temperature (and wind too, actually).
It means, when you look closer, you see that the SimCity rivers work without lakes, which means that lakes were either added before or after the river creation.
