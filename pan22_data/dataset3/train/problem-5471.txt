I can't provide you with precise instructions because you haven't specified you router's model, but what you want to do is to download a backup of your settings.
A PPPoE password is usually the one from your internet provider.
Next, after you download RouterPassView, open it, and import your router backup file called config.cfg
Search for <input type="password".... and remove that bit.
I Know how to reveal that password in GPON ont, i was recently looking for PPPoE password too, i'm trying to change html code in inspect element, not working.
Then, find your PPPoE username and password using CTRL+F In this case, im using keyword "pass"
It is unlikely you will be able to "hack" this password, as the router will not show it to you, but will only allow you to change it to something else.
Right click the password box, select Inspect element.
You can then change it there to what they've given you.
Passwords can be extracted from some routers by making a settings backup and decoding it.
To make this app work, you need to backup your router setting first.
 file, after that you'll see a lot of xml data like this
Then you'll have to search for a tool or website that will allow you to decode backup file.
I'm trying to access telnet on router, not working too, then i found 1 app for Windows, here it's called RouterPassView.
I would contact them so they can reset the password.
Open the router configuration page using a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox.
