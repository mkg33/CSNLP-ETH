Using the 2D skeleton will allow you to attach the same animations to multiple characters.
Ultimately, it depends on the aesthetic you want to achieve.
The other method as you mentioned, would be to make 3D models and export their animations individually for use in a 2D medium.
If you are familiar with 3D modeling, this approach can be a lot quicker.
However, from the looks of it, Hero Academy looks like 2D art that's been attached to a skeletal system and animated.
They only rotate around an axis normal to the screen.
However, as they said in a post about animation, they indeed use 3D models to generate their animations.
After looking at the trailer in your link, they are indeed hand-drawn sprites.
Project zomboid, while not really cartoon looking, doesn't look very much like 3D models when their animations are playing.
A 3D model with the combination of cell shading could easily achieve this effect.
The animation seems smooth, so I wouldn't be surprised if they used some sort of skeletal 2D animation.
You'd make your keyframes and tween them as usual but you will be able to export the entire animation as a sequence of images ready to be used in your game.
This style involves drawing the movable parts of the character separately, so limbs, head, etc are separate sprites and they are posed and rotated accordingly to create keyframes, and tween the animation by code.
Skeletal animation isn't suited for complex deformations.
For example, their appears to be no 3D rotation of any of the limbs or head.
