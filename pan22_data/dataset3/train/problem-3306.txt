The illnesses are exactly the same, but require antibiotics for treatment instead of bandages.
Represent Wound's and Illnesses' severity as a double ranging from [0.0, 1.0] where 1.0 is the worst possible illness.
If the medic's skill is not enough, they can still apply it, but it's effectiveness should be decreased.
I know "This War of Mine" has a really similar behavior, but I just can't wrap my head around on how this should be designed in a tick-based game.
The wounds will require bandages to heal and a medic to apply them.
The medic's skill should affect the effectiveness, "advanced" bandages should require higher skill to apply.
Is my idea too complicated and I should simplify it a bit?
Each tier of bandages are effective up to a certain severity of wounds, after the severity passed that threshold their effectiveness should decrease.
The rest of the game is tick based, and I can update a character's state every tick.
The problem with my approach is that I think it's way too complicated to fit into a math formula that computes the delta recovery chance.
I want the behavior to be something in the lines of
After a set number of ticks the recovery chance will "proc" and either completely heal the character or make the disease worse and remove any applied bandages/meds.
The characters will also have a recovery chance, that will change every tick based on their state (severity, bandage/meds eff, HP, nutrition)
There are multiple tiers of bandages, from basic cloth bandages to sterilized bandages.
A bandage efficiency and meds efficiency will also be present on the character's state, again from [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 means no bandage/meds and 1.0 means top tier bandage/meds applied by a skillful medic.
I came up with an idea, but it seems needlessly complicated to do.
I want to have a health system in my game and I was thinking that every character should have the following
