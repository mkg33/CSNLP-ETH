Long story short - user can connect to a virtual machine (with windows guest os) using vnc and use some specific software for some specific time (eg., 1 hour).
I have already considered VirtualBox, Xen and some other, but maybe somebody has a better idea.
Some versions of it are free, you could check those out.
2X Software just released 2X ApplicationServer XG with a SaaS licencing model.
maybe you can use a solution from 2X which is much more affordable compare to Citrix.
VMWare Server supports using VNC as a remote console.
I have used keyserver extensively in public companies in the US and UK.
I am currently trying to figure out which solution would be best for software renting service (with proper licensing and stuff).
When you plan to have the service delivered to your client desktop then you may consider to publish only a fraction of your application using Application Server schema which is provided as one of the software solution on 2x
I know its kinda stupid and so on, but I just have to develop it.
I haven't looked at their API or extensions, though.
