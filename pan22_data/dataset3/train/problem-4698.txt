When users click on their Calendar, they get a new button on the toolbar called "View Group Schedules."
If someone is handy with programming, you can also scrape the free/busy and make a webpage out of it - I'm sure there's a handful of free programs/scripts out there to do exactly that.
Ideally, the subject line would also include the user's name, but this would not be 100% necessary.
For example, we would create a view with all the departments' users calendars combined, but only those marked "out of office".
This requires duplicate entry for those of us who keep all our info in our own Exchange calendar.
My department creates a shared calendar for everyone to enter their out-of-office times.
There's a way to do it in Outlook and has been for years.
Is there a way in Exchange to create a View that's simply a combination view of multiple users' calendars?
Then, they can make groups of users that they care about and view their free/busy times, and if they have reviewer or better rights, they can see details.
