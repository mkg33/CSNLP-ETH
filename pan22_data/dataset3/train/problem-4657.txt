Some methods can improve these artifacts in some cases, see the methods mentioned already, or for example "light-perspective-cascades", "variance shadow maps", "shadow atlas" (compute optimal resolution for shadows of each light given available memory, and arrange them accordingly in a big buffer), "moment shadow mapping".
I am missing a lot, but don't recall seeing a solution that works well when resolution / number of filtering passes / samples is restricted...
Percentage Closer Filtering with some amount of blur (ie.
I would like to learn "go to" technique to resolve this issue.
They still are bothering after so many people spent years trying to improve them.
The low resolution depth map results in rigid shadow like this...
Whether your engine is deferred or forward, the shadow pass should be quite the same, and suffer the same issues.
a minimum filter size in texture space) is the most basic method I know of.
One technique is adaptive shadow maps where you use a low resolution map for shadows that are rendered far away from the camera, a mid-resolution map for stuff that's in the mid range, and a high resolution map for stuff that's close.
Some other workarounds are "baking" the shadow maps if light and object do not move.
My depth texture is significantly smaller than that of the screen.
