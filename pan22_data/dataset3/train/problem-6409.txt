Storm-control was in place and caught the broadcast storm in both places.
The printer worked great for a year until the business needs changed.
The printers were plugged into the new switch -- which was plugged/uplinked into the LAN from the new runs.
With both the access point physical Ethernet interface and the radio interface connected to the same broadcast domains -- a loop was formed.
Instead of running a physical cable to connect a printer on a shop floor, an access point radio was configured in what is called "workgroup bridge" role.
In most deployments it is not necessary to configure STP on an access point.
However, if it was not in place that would have been a very tricky loop indeed.
At some point additional printers were needed and a few physical cable runs and a switch (as part of an intermediate distribution frame) were installed at the shop floor location.
The access point physical Ethernet interface that was once plugged into a printer was also plugged into the new switch.
However, there are several deployment scenarios where it is advisable.
One such scenario I encountered in production when it was biting the network in the proverbial posterior.
In this case the radio interface plays the role of uplink to the LAN (associating to another access point that is actually plugged into the LAN) while the physical Ethernet interface connects to the printer.
