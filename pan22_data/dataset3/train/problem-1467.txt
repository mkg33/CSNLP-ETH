I'm guessing that if your image doesn't come with the driver, you can download it again.
I downloaded file from: https://downloadcenter.intel.com/detail_desc.aspx?agr=Y&DwnldID=18717 then transferred to the VirtualBox and installed.
So the issue was that the driver was not installed.
Those are the settings I see around the internet as being correct, but I still can't ping anything.
On my Mac I have internet sharing via Ethernet enabled (not sure if that matters).
As I understand it, VirtualBox should handle connecting to your host's Internet (wifi in your case) automatically.
If you haven't installed the VirtualBox Ethernet device drivers on the guest, then the XP install won't be able to use the network.
Do I need to install any ethernet card drivers in order for the internet to work?
The Internet connection appears as a wired network connection in your guest (Win XP) regardless of what kind of ethernet connection your host (Mac) has.
If it's working on your host OS (Mac) it will work on your guest OS (Win XP).
My Windows ISO I downloaded didn't have the XP controller installed.
The image I downloaded did however have a driver mounted to a separate drive (for the intel pro 1000/mt network card).
I installed VirtualBox with a Win XP VM on my Mac running OS 10.7.5.
Install the necessary device drivers per the VirtualBox documentation (probably an "Install VirtualBox Additions" menu command or similar), and you should be good to go.
My Mac only has a wi-fi connection to the internet.
When I start up my WinXP VM, it asks me to install a bunch of hardware which I don't have any drivers to.
You shouldn't need to mess around with any settings to get your Internet connection working.
