To me, this sounds far more likely to be a wireless problem than a DOCSIS problem.
To test, leave a machine plugged in via Ethernet to a LAN port on the E1200, make sure you've turned off wireless on that machine, and leave it doing once-per-second pings of an IP address of a reliable box somewhere at your ISP or elsewhere on the Internet.
You need to do a little more of your own legwork isolating the cause of your problem before anyone else is going to be able to help you.
If the wired connection isn't getting interrupted, then the problem isn't your cable modem, it's probably your Wi-Fi AP or the wireless medium itself (i.e.
severe acute transient 2.4GHz radio interference).
Make sure you do, because maybe there was a bug that made E1200's flake out or crash and reboot that Linksys already fixed.
Then, after the next wireless drop happens, see if the wired pings were interrupted.
Does the problem happen when the AP is on other channels?
When the wireless drops happen, does wired Ethernet access to the Internet still work the whole time?
Your current problem description leaves too many variables in play.
Do the drops correspond to when someone uses the microwave oven or the cordless phone?
If the wired connection is getting interrupted at the same time, it might be that your E1200 is flaking out and/or spontaneously rebooting, or it might be that your cable modem is doing the same, or it might be that your cable line is having problems.
(I'm talking about normal TV channels, not IP-based streams like on-demand, Netflix, Hulu, etc.)
I guess the gist of my Answer is that there are a lot of different things that may have gone wrong, and it seems like you jumped to the conclusion that it's your cable modem without actually doing any kind of normal process-of-elimination troubleshooting.
Do you live in a dormitory, apartment, condo, townhouse, duplex, or semi-attached house or other kind of relatively high-density housing situation?
