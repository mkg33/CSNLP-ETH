It depends on the machine, why not setup a some kind of scheduled performance data collection (perfmon, atsar) to collect data so you can figure out what the bottle-necks are.
While RAM, Disk Drive speed, CPU cores and clock speeds are important, I suggest upgrading your network connections, including your internet connection.
(And I do own both and am talking from experience)
Many sites are extremely slow when I log on from work.
You'll go through more CPU cycles before you start using up all your memory.
Personally, I like to be able to run a couple virtual machines and several instances of Visual Studio, so I'd go for RAM or a faster disk before I worried about CPU.
I realize that not everyone works in this type of environment, but I work for  a multinational company and often have to access files in Europe.
The exception would be if you're running virtual machines on the same machine for testing.
It often take several hours to download the CD image I need from the European server.
