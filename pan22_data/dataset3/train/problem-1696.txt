It's actually desirable then, unless you want to stay up the entire night.
You could try booting a different Linux distro, such as Ubuntu, just in case the one you tried had some very poor hardware support.
Did you try updating your motherboard's firmware (bios/efi)?
Night light sometimes doesn't turn off in the morning (seems to be a software glitch), you can then turn it off manually.
If it were me, I wouldn't put much more effort in before calling up ASUS.
It's possible to still be a software matter, perhaps due to some very new hardware in there that's poorly supported?
I realize that this wasn't the source of the problem back in 2014, but today the first culprit would be night light, and then it's a good thing.
This sounds like a hardware fault to me, or perhaps a low-level firmware problem.
Press the Windows key, type night, select night light from the list, press Enter, and you'll be taken to the night light Settings page, where you can turn it off until sundown.
Lack of blue light helps with keeping our day-night cycle in the "night" mode.
Either way, your machine that you paid money for shouldn't have this issue.
In Windows 10, if this only happens after sunset and before sunrise, then it's due to night light.
