Combined with a merge tool for handling conflicts you have all the power from your keyboard.
Probably not the answer you look for, but the Subversion does include a client when you install it: the svn command.
It is an excellent client when you get used to it.
I use this in addition to GUI versions, I have run into too many instances where the GUI version has a problem and I have to resort to the command line to fix it.
The GUI is a little non-inutitive at first, but it works great otherwise.
This has some benefits, in that it will monitor and show you all your current changes and those pending changes.
Subcommander has been very helpful for me; it too is a full-on client as opposed to an Explorer extension.
It is more of a full fledged client, rather than an extension to the explorer.
Having both is not a problem, and many environments, such as Netbeans, will take full advantage of the command line interface if you have it.
There is always the trusty command line version of svn.
I have also used SmartSVN and been very happy with it.
