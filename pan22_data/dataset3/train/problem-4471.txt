Memory will usually be in the socket corresponding to 1A,1B and 1C, alloing all the memory parts to be used simultaneously.
During this check it discovered errors when accessing the DIMM in bank2.
Most Nehelam boards come with 6 DIMM sockets, and their layout might be described as:
And since it is part of the CPU that means replacing the whole CPU.
This can have multiple causes, but the most likely ones are:
It made the choice of using both working DIMMs and ignoring the third, which is why you now have 2x4GB to work with.
You have a Xeon W5590 CPU which uses triple channel memory.
If it is the motherboard then best you can do is try different configurations.
If it is dirt then you are lucky, Cleaning the contacts might help.
May since the only Nehelam boards I owned only supported very specific memory fill sequences.
When your system powers on its firmware (either BIOS or UEFI in a PC) determines how much memory is present.
That leaves the memory controller and the physical path between the memory controller and the DIMM.
For this reason your system also comes equipped with 3 memory modules (DDR3, 667MHz)
If it is the memory controller then there is nothing you can do short of replacing it.
That means it can utilize 3 banks of memory at the same time for higher performance.
Since you already moved the DIMMs around and always got the same error we can assume that it is not the DIMM itself.
