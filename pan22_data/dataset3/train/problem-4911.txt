This allows BackExec to connect to and use the SPN storage directly as a distination for backups that are fully managed from within BackExec.
Then we changed their backup time from midnight to around 3 and 4 AM.
Backups were constantly failing / getting disconnected.
I recommend Iron Mountain ... it is quite reliable.
I have heard a lot of good things about Backup My Info, http://www.backupmyinfo.com/, while I do not work for them so this is not a marketing pitch they are very competitive and offer a great service.
Symantec has an online backup offering called SPN (Symantec Protection Network).
They have a few differnt flavors available: an online backup product, and a version that integrates within BackupExec.
If you decide to reach out mentionn Nick O'Neil from Logicworks for a discount.
I had a client having miserable luck with Mozy Pro.
Be aware that they are more expensive than Mozy or Carbonite, but I imagine that the corporate data is more important than Joe Consumer's pictures.
You should have no availability issues and get the info that you need from them.
So if you have a couple sites or locations (or an office and a colo) with some extra storage at each you can easily and cheaply do offsite backups over the wire.
That being said, I've had good luck with the LogMeIn Backup solution.
