I cannot keep the same IP between my new account and the old one and I'm a bit at loss as to how to minimize user downtime while the new IP is reflected in all DNS caches.
Or even redirect all requests at the old host, to the new one (again by ip) ?
Would it be a good idea to have a link on the page in (1) that opens the new site but using it's ip ?
They really do appreciate it, and it'll minimize your emails from users regarding the downtime.
Then, make the move and DNS change as fast as possible.
Note I cannot have the site running on both accounts at the same time as it's a dating site and this would cause data inconsistency.
That would minimize downtime and the risk of surprises.
See the Apache redirect docs to learn more about how to redirect and optionally rewrite the redirected location.
If you only have one main site and it will be served under a new ip address, you can run both sites concurrently, but redirect the old site to the new one by using the ip address as the redirect target.
Then when you make the change, the old IP should only hang around for 10 minutes (plus whatever was cached before you made the change if you had a really long TTL previously).
Honestly, it sounds like you've got it planned out right, the only thing you'll want to do is ANNOUNCE ahead of time to your users the scheduled maintenance, migration, and downtime.
Good luck, and let us know if you have any other concerns!
my site has outgrown the shared hosting account it's on and i've setup a VPS that i'll be moving to soon.
Don't worry about linking by IP, it could end up confusing your users.
One thing you can do is go right now and decrease the cache time (TTL) of your domain's records to 10 minutes or so.
Other than that, the only thing I'd say is that I'd do it this way:
