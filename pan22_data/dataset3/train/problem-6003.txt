Upgrading the OS (to Linux) is more likely to speed up Firefox than anything else, and it's free.
If you'll excuse the personal story, I've a few P4 machines running alongside more recent machines.
A CPU upgrade probably won't be cost effective, they're are that much faster P4's out there .
Agree with Tobu and Xiuhtecuhtli, but you may want to try the following
Hardware wise my first recommendation would be more RAM - you'll find that Firefox can take a couple 100 MB's just by itself.
They're certainly good enough for daily use - XP and Ubuntu are fine, but I had to upgrade the RAM recently for higher performance.
Certainly don't upgrade to another windows release, the increased footprint would be fatal.
Typically if a computer Was Fast and now running the same programs more or less it is slow, I am going to point my finger at MALware/Junk or Lack of Swap space on your Drive.
Newer hard drives are not just larger, they are faster.
If you do a Windows reinstall, reinstall to that newer hard drive you mentioned - it's most likely faster than your original drive.
If you have a newer socket 775 board that can run Core 2 Duo's, then that might be a consideration.
But if you want to stick with Windows, the most effective upgrade would be another GB of RAM.
Adding a new hard drive shouldn't make your computer slower - if windows are drawing slowly then you've got a pretty serious problem.
I'd recommend re-installing Windows - you'll be surprised how much faster your system will be.
Having a fast hard drive makes a huge difference in program loading and a large number of slowdowns are from hard disk reads.
Make Sure you have AT LEAST 512 MB of space free for items like SWAP files.
