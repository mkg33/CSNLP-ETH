If you wanted to automate it, you could search for dynamic SQL, and EXEC (@var).
I'm purposely not adding code to automate the last part since this could easily be used to lock yourself out of your SQL Server.
The following code will generate T-SQL statements to disable the logins for every Windows User, Group, and SQL Server login that is not the 'sa' user:
Restricted means only users in sys_admin and db_owners can connect to it.
Single user as the name suggest means only one user can connect to it.
To force these scripts add the WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE clause.
I'm reluctant to provide this code since it could be used to incorrectly deny access to everyone, if you don't have the 'sa' password, or if the 'sa' user is disabled, or if SQL Server logins are not permitted.
In order to actually revoke access to these accounts, you will need to copy-and-paste the results into a new command window and run them via F5
A SQL-server database can be put into single user and restricted user modes.
Helped me a lot years ago when two disks in a RAID 5 went sour.
The following is not exactly a match for you but it might be useful.
Keep in mind these scripts will not execute immediately as for example the single user one will be blocked if more than one user is connected.
It will have to wait for all users to disconnect before going into SINGLE_USER mode.
These scripts can be used in emergencies to block access to the database so you can get in and fix things.
