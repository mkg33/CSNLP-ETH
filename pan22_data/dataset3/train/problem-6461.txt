It sounds like the heatsink isn't conducting heat properly.
Please post the make and model of your PC and what processor it has.
Again, if the heatsink wasn't working (read: not attached to the CPU anymore), it wouldn't get hot at all.
Thought I'd see what you think before I buy a new heatsink/fan unit.
If it didn't, I would begin to worry where that heat is going.
There are a lot monitors, even Speccy will give you temps (and more)
You can use a cpu monitor to check the temperture of the cpu.
The fan works, so I think the problem must be with the heatsink, even though that seems very unlikely, since it's passive.
Before you buy a new heatsink, try cleaning the old thermal paste off and applying a new layer.
"Too hot" depends on your CPU, so look it up on the manufacturer's website.
All that heat would be trapped in the CPU die instead.
There you will find the maximum operating temperature (either on the spec sheet or datasheet).
My computer gets extremely hot where the fan and heatsink are.
Your CPU generates a finite amount of heat, so your heatsink can't magically "get hotter" then normal.
Typically heatsinks do not go bad, sometimes they do come loose from their mountings and no longer make tight contact with the processor.
If your computer is running fine with no abnormal reboots and shutdowns then everything should be ok. And as long as there is thermal paste between the cpu and heatsink.
Download a hardware monitor (HWMonitor, HWInfo, Speccy, etc...), check your temperatures.
Or the heatsink is clogged with dust bunnies and need to be cleaned out with compressed air in a can.
There are widgets if you are using Vista/Win7 to keep an eye on cpu temps too.
With a monitor you can make sure the cpu is running within the correct temp range.
