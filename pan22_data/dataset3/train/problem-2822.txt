Does it mean I bypass all the layers after it except the Physical Layer?
It does not matter that the data happens to be HTTPS protocol, with its own added features like TLS encryption.
It could just as easily be the archaic Daytime Protocol, very simple and probably just one packet.
Let's say I have an IPSec (Network Layer, L3) hardware on an FPGA.
Every explanation about the OSI Model (or other Models) always gives me the impression that the data (PDU) from the top layer (Application Layer, L7) always go through all of the layers until the bottom layer (Physical Layer, L1).
Note how the VPN routes without caring about the higher layers of the application.
So, you might have Ethernet, containing IP UDP, containing an encapsulation header, containing IP TCP, containing data.
You will see encapsulation, the data contents of the lower layer containing the necessary upper layers.
Does the PDU always go through all the 7 layers in the OSI Model?
These examples might explain more about my confusion.
Capture some actual packets on a physical interface with some VPN traffic.
Another example is when we are communicating via SSL.
Or we can choose until which layer we want to apply our communication protocol?
