This is wrong, as nobody is yet using IPv6, and certainly not the campus.
Go to Network Connections, right-click your connection and choose Properties, clear the check box next to Internet Protocol version 6 (TCP/IPv6), then OK.
You should be able to do some comparisons between your Vista and Fedora systems using nslookup from the command line:
Is it receiving these dns server addresses via DHCP?
I'm kind of guessing, but is your DNS set to an outside DNS server?
This command should provide similar results on both the Fedora and Vista systems.
Specifically you will want to look at the Server and the IP address that gets returned for the host you specify as "intranet.site".
If you disable this and go straight to the IPv4 address (172....) then probably the addresses will resolve properly.
It might be that internal resources aren't public facing so they won't show up on public DNS servers.
DNS is trying to connect with an IPv6 address (fe89:...) and it's timing out.
I avoid Vista like the plague so hopefully another commentor can help out.
Normally companies, universities... that have lots of internal sites ask that you set the DNS to their DNS server.
I see that "ipconfig/all" shows that IPv6 is on, and is even marked as preferred!
