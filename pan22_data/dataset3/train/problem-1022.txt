As long as you make sure that filenames and directories are unique, you can have several servers writing to the same NFS export at the same time.
1) The sum file-size of all the uploaded files are several GB.
If I had a dozen "Work" servers with just PHP-FPM (with other Nginx servers in front), is it possible to setup PHP to store user uploaded files on a different server?
These "Work" servers should only contain the application code and do the work.
With files that need to be accessible to the public, they could be distributed through a CDN.
I'm looking to avoid syncing user files on each "Work" server.
If I add another "Work" server, I'd rather not sync those files to another server.
My company puts image/video uploads directly onto Amazon S3 using their HTTP POST interface.
I want to keep user uploaded files on an isolated server.
From your storage server, export an NFS share to your "Work" servers, then mount to whatever location on the work servers you need.
99% of them are jpg/png/pdf, but there are thousands of them.
2) From a security standpoint, I don't want user uploaded files on these servers.
So I basically want to avoid writing these files on the hard drives of the "Work" servers.
