I recommend using dvdisaster to add recovery record into the ISO image before burning it.
Clean the disks very carefully, use a light polish like Mr Sheen on scratches or I have used car polish on deeper ones.
I do not recall if the limit was 2 GB or 4 GB, but regardless, pretty small in this day and age.
DVDs that have been "enhanced" with dvdisaster can withstand multiple sector errors and still be recovered.
Only drawbacks are that you lose about 5-15% of storage capacity per disc depending how much you add recovery info and you need to create an ISO image first.
When I have burnt disks for archival purposes, I have tended to go with fairly small files (~100 MB each), and enough recovery to rebuild even if three or more of the files on each DVD are bad.
And you sleep better as you know the media will still be readable after couple years.
Clean off well before use and use good quality reader.
As per WilHil comment Magic iso is good for mounting cd's etc http://www.magiciso.com/
Also, QuickPar has issues when you are dealing with sufficiently large files.
If you insist on burning to optical media, I recommend using a tool like QuickPar to generate parity archives.
This has worked well for me in the past, but it is fairly time-consuming.
It can take quite a lot of CPU power to create the PAR2 files, however.
Fortunately you can easily create a script that will enhance the ISO and then burn it automatically, so the inconvenience is minimal.
Also you can verify that disk with the application.
With carefully chosen settings, this will allow you to recover data even if chunks of your disk are bad.
