If that isn't a huge concern it makes diagnostics a little easier if the F5 handles both parts of the connection by having your hosts route through it for both the request and the response.
Regarding load balancing you have a couple options.
If you setup everything in a bonded scenario and you experience either a configuration mistake or a software bug it is possible your entire site will go offline(because the bond will not negotiate properly).
Either is valid and both have pros/cons that you will want to weigh specifically to your environment.
Regarding 802.3ad there are times when it can be beneficial.
That said it is usually easier to diagnose a 'standard' approach of using bonding with contractors and Cisco TAC staff.
This is the standard 'fail safe' vs 'fail over' approach.
Where as with a separate network connection and two physically diverse network paths if you have a configuration error or software failure in one, your other path should continue to function.
If you plan to use a lot of capacity for sending responses you probably want to investigate direct server return and wire your hosts up so they don't always have to route back through the F5.
