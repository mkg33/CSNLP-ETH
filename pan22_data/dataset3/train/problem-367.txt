For example result of rotation of basis; Or you can render 3D sphere and paint it by layered 'temperature' of rotation by each axis; Good luck!
When you visualize your rotation matrix as the 3 axes gizmo, what you're really visualizing is an orientation.
You do not necessarily need an alternate visualization technique for quaternions versus matrices.
And one and only one choice will be visualization of result of rotation.
Rarely, for both quaternions or matrices, do you need to relate the actual component values into your visualization, so just because the component values of the quaternion do not relate to your 3 axes gizmo doesn't mean it can't be used for visualization purposes.
It's a common way to visualize rotation vector in physics, but the name escapes me.
As you know, Quaternion is based on complex numbers and represents rotation of 4D sphere in 4D dimension.
Since the quaternion also represents an orientation, consider continuing to use your 3 axes gizmo as your mind's eye visualization object.
I visualize my quaternions as three-dimensional vectors (direction + length) with a bit to the side to be able to show rotation along the vector's axis.
