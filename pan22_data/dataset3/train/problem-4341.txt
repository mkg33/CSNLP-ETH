I regularly delete "shadow copies" and get back a few gb from time to time, use C-cleaner, do disk defragmentation and every suggested maintenance procedure, nevertheless the space used is still going up.
PS: I do not intend to pick on Windows, since I grew up with it and still use it heavily with some specialized programs and find it really good at performing most of what I need, however this thing really bugs me.
Furthermore every two weeks or so, Windows eats up another 5-6gb and fills it with who knows what.
Shadow copies and backups within the pc in my experience are pretty much useless since when it crashes it goes all the way down and the only thing you're left with are the file in the hard disk if you're lucky (external backups are usually the way to go IMHO).
I do not have loads of files on the hard drive (around 20 gb programs included) I was wondering how is it possible that the used disk space is around 120 gb?
I have a standard personal computer, (450Gb hard-disk, 8 gb of RAM) with Windows 8.1.
What can I do to free disk space and, more importantly, stop Windows from eating it all up?
How is it possible that a fifth of the hard disk is used by Windows only, when Linux (on another machine I installed Linux for me to try) on the other hand uses much less than 20 Gb??
