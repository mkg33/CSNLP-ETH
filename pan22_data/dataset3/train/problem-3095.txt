After two hotfixes and numerous fruitless netsh command tweaks I was seeing very slow download speeds and fast upload speeds.
NetworkThrottlingIndex=ffffffff  (DWORD, default: 10, recommended: 10 for media sharing, ffffffff for gaming and max throughput, valid range: 1 through 70 decimal or ffffffff to completely disable throttling)
A value of zero establishes a cache of ~8 MB, a value of 1 allows the cache to expand up to the amount of physical memory minus 4 MB, as necessary.
LargeSystemCache=1 (DWORD, default value: 0, recommended value: 1)
My speed was 10Mb/s for wireless or wired file transfer to the NAS.

I did this on both windows machines, I did not have to restart, and I did not have to disable LSO V1
Turned out the Intel NIC update from Windows Update had affected the driver settings.

Size=3 (DWORD, default value: 1, recommended value: 3)
So I don't know what setting or registry entry fixed the problem.
I did all of the following testing the wireless with no success, at the end I tried the ethernet and I got 63MB/s NOW!!!!!

3 - optimal setting for file sharing and network applications
One thing that is worth a try before going crazy with anything else is to switch the driver to not use Auto Negotiate for the speed but set it to 100MB/Full Duplex, test the transfer speed and then set it to 10MB/Full Duplex and test the transfer speed.
