AWS has a tool to convert EBS volume device names in /etc/fstab to their UUID values: c5_m5_checks_script.sh
I rebooted a m5d.xlarge EC2 instance running Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS (xenial) using shutdown -r.
The script also checks that the NVMe module is loaded in your OS image, but your newer instance type would not have launched if that was not present.
This caused various services to fail, which rely upon the drive mount with the assigned name containing specific data associated with that name.
In this case, /data needed to contain what is normally expected to be in /data, and not some other drive mount, like /foo or /bar or /whatever-else.
Running lsblk helped with manually redefining the /etc/fstab file to reflect the new device assignments and bringing services back online.
Problem: My worry is that rebooting will randomly reassign device labels to drive mounts, and this problem could or will occur again when the server requires rebooting.
Upon reboot, various drive mounts defined in /etc/fstab did not line up with the device assignments given to them initially.
Question: How do I ensure that drive mounts and their respective device paths are preserved between reboots, without needing manual (re)intervention?
