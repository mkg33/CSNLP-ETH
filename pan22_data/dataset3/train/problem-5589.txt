It was called the 'explicit' deny all rule.. googling
Assuming your inside server is 10.0.0.10 and a host on the MPLS network is 192.168.99.10, and your inside interface is called inside then the command would be this:
Another which is a Cisco Firewall, on 10.0.0.1, with a WAN Connection.
On the firewall there is a route that tells says anything destined to one of the MPLS subnets (192.168.99.0/24) to go to the MPLS router (on it's LAN IP).
However, I cannot ping anything on the MPLS and the logs on the Cisco show the "Implicit" Any,Any Deny is dropping the ping traffic.
Two Default Gateways exist on the network - one which provides connectivity to the an MPLS with several subnets.
That should tell you exactly why the packet is being rejected.
You can use the 'deny all log' command in the ACL to see the realtime results of the 'implicit' deny all rule and go from there.
You can ping from Inside to Outside, but the echo traffic must be allowed to go back to Inside.
Assuming you've checked the basics like ensuring that the access list is actually bound to the interface with the access-group command, if the logs are showing that the traffic is being denied, you can find out more information by simulating a packet with the packet-tracer command.
On the INSIDE interface, there is any Any, Any, IP allow rule (all traffic).
A server exists on the LAN with it's DG as the above Cisco Firewall.
