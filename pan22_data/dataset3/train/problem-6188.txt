I have tried grouping but this doesn't work, and looking up 'how to' on internet has suggested that having a helper row might assist but I can't work out how to do it.
I am not a 'superuser' by any stretch of the imagination.
My suggestion would be to copy that identifier into column K of the first and second rows also.
You can then highlight all of the data and run a custom sort based on column K.
You can use a formula just based on positions of data (supposing again that your data starts in second row) = indirect("k"& row() - mod(row()+1,3)+2,true).
I want to keep the data sets together, and in row order.
I want to sort the data based on the value in column K, which is in the third row of each data set, there are no values in rows 1 and 2 of each data set.
I have an excel spreadsheet where each data set covers three rows.
I'd you have an "ID" column which is unique for your the row data (let this column be "A" and suppose you enter your data from second row): =sumif(a:a,a2,b:b).
(I know max with array formula would be more elegant but sumif is easier to understand and also it's quicker in big datasets).
This has the drawback that if you sorry your data to split your groups then it'll be corrupted, SDHI you may want to convey your formulas to read values.
If I am understanding your spreadsheet layout correctly you have three rows of grouped data is columns A - J and then some sort of identifier in column k of the third row.
