If I could, I'd run a cable to the metal building, but the connecting conduit has collapsed and we'll end up spending more money than it's worth to repair it.
The place that I work at we have two buildings next to each other and one across and in-between the two that is made out of metal.
As you can see the WiFi AP is attached to the corner of one of the buildings and aimed at the metal building.
To one connector, connect an external directional antenna aimed at the other building's AP.
Why not set the AP to bridge mode and mount it to the outside of the metal building then hardwire the PCs?
I would use a wireless range extender with two antenna connectors.
We've got it mounted and facing in the direction of the metal building, but I can't seem to get the signal to stabalize inside of the building.
I'm attaching an image to better illustrate how we're setup:
To the other connector, connect an internal omni-directional antenna or a directional antenna aimed towards the area where the computers are.
Is there something I should do to make the signal better?
As of right now if I sit in the room with the X with my laptop I'll get 1 bar of signal strength and PINGs are 50/50.
Right now I have the AP configured as a Universal Repeater, and I've also had it as an Access Point, but neither seem to be providing good enough signal.
The X in the image is where the computers will be residing that need the WiFi.
We want to extend our WiFi coverage to the inside of the metal building so we purchased a Hawking multi-function access point (HOWABN1).
