Knowing basic calculus will help, as you'll want to know what derivatives are and how they relate to position, velocity, and acceleration.
AI in game development is often made of behavior trees, or logical paths that are chosen between based on previous choices, with some slight randomness.
If you use an engine, depending on the engine, usually most of the physics will be taken care of, especially if you use a physics-based engine like Box2D.
Also, there may be some modules (like the math module in Python) that will take care of things like rounding algorithms for you.
Very strong knowledge of algebra will help, as you'll need to construct formulas for things.
To answer your main question: most game developers are slightly better than most at math, since they use it more than in some careers, but it should not be a problem for you if you manage to pass all of your high school and college math courses.
As Almo said, 3D game development requires some basic algebra, and so does 2D, but most of the actual development is just writing algoritms and loops.
If you get into 3D game development, you had better know the basics of Linear Algebra so you can deal with vectors and matrices well.
Especially if you use an engine, you will not have to deal with most of the math.
