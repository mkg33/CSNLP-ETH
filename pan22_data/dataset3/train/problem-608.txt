When I personally visit the first URL, I get redirected and then when I get the homepage, I get the regular HTML content and then download all the usual page assets ( js / css / images, etc ).
Are there any outside influences that could cause my server to do a redirect?
1) The visitor hits my site at the affiliate's special location, which performs a 302 redirect to the homepage of the site.
But these visitors, and there are hundreds of them all with varying ip addresses and user agents, etc, all follow this strange pattern of two 302 redirects and then poof.
2) The visitor follows the redirect to the homepage of the site, where they are served another 302 redirect and then disappear.
But in that case, I would see a whole series of requests before the browser timed out due to the 'this site is redirecting in a way that will never complete' issue.
Following the referer of some of the visits, the source of the traffic looks pretty bad.
Is there anyway to configure apache logging to include the location that the 302 points to?
An affiliate marketing person has recently started sending my website strange traffic.
The only thing in the code that would result in a 302 redirect from the homepage would be if the visitor has cookies disabled.
Regardless, it's unlikely that all 300+ visitors who came in like this would have cookies disabled.
My primary concern is, what is happening to these 'visitors' with that second 302 redirect?
(Basically, if I don't see they have a site cookie, they get redirected to 'refresh' the session which then lets me see the cookie.)
