Within Hyper-V we have created a virtual machine running Windows Server 2008 R2 with 4 virtual processors.
We will be running a few other virtual machines, but this one is for SQL Server and we'd like to throw as much horsepower at it as possible.
We have recently purchased a server which is running Hyper-V 2008 R2 bare metal.
you can locate the vm xml configuration file under the "Virtual Machines" directory of the VM's VHD directory, the configuration file will be named under the VM's id.
Does this mean that the remaining 75% can not be tapped into by the virtual OS?

The server has two quad-core Intel Xeon processors with hyperthreading, so if I'm understanding correctly this gives us 16 cores.
make sure you edit the VM xml configuration file with notepad/notepad++ opened under administrator privileges
The processor settings screen is telling me that this represents 25% of the total system processing power.
