I work on several different machines (office/home/laptop) and I like to have my whole development environment with me and in sync all the time.
If I am done with work on my laptop I simply click "SVN Commit" and after confirming the changes it instantly uploads to unfuddle.com (it's really fast with small files!)
I am not sure if this is what you want since you want to detect changes on the fly.
I suspect it has to do with each file getting a separate request, and then the http overhead just piles up i guess.
But for my own project I use turtoiseSVN with www.unfuddle.com
I've used dropbox for a while, and while it works okay, it's not fast.
It's dominated by a very very large number of small files in the 4-8K range.
2nd step is to install a virtual machine server where you can remotely access your vm thus you don't need to copy the vm again and again.
I tried running succesfully it from a fast usb stick/disk, but I'd like a cloud sync solution instead.
In my development environment I have a ton of tools and a lot of source code (don't worry it's in SCM's too), as well as documents and so on.
I would suggest you to use a virtual machine for your workplace.
Some of them also change quite frequently, since I'm doing compiles.
At home I click SVN Update and it instantly downloads the new files.
Personally it's the best way to separate my computer from the work files and to backup my work files and to test new program or os.
This is way faster than dropbox and also creates no conflicted copies.
and a few more, and they all have the same problem: uploading small files is too slow.
A virtual machine is just a bunch of files you can copy, move and backup.
So I'm looking for a very fast cloud sync tool that will detect changes on the fly and work well with a huge number of small files.
A few well crafted batch files set up all my paths for me.
That enables me to be productive right away without forcing me to install things.
