Find out the last available package : go in your WindowsApps folder, and find the folder with the last version of calculator (the one with "x64" in its name), in my case :
From a elevated command prompt "reg delete HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModel\StateChange\PackageList"
You can follow this simple procedure if you are in the same situation :
After an update, Microsoft Store and several other apps such as Photos and Calculator stopped working.
There might be an automated way to do it with a powershell script, but I don't know about it.
I also noticed that in the pictures' properties, at the "Open with" line, Photos had been replaced by "TWINUI".
After a quick googling it appeared the problem was related to incoherences in the apps packages, however none of the guides I followed worked for me.
And if you didn't get any error message at this point, your problem should be fixed !
Update the app : Simply launch Microsoft Store, click the "..." on the top right corner, then "Download and Update".
Unregister the broken version : back to the powershell, enter the command :
Those symptoms were caused by the fact that the registered packages had a higher version than the packages actually available in "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps".
Clicking on them would open a window's frame for a split second, then immediately disappear without any error message.
To fix it, I had to manually uninstall the packages in Powershell, then install the versions available.
Find out the registered version of your broken app :
I had this issue with several machines, some apps (calculator, sticky notes, gallery) from Microsoft Store were "marked" as corrupted.
The simple way to fix is by deleting all keys in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModel\StateChange\PackageList
Another symptom was that the app's names weren't displayed in Windows' program list, instead they were shown as follow :
Note : I will take the calculator as example, you have to repeat the following procedure for every broken app.
Note that if the store itself is broken you can fix it the same way than I showed you with Calculator.
Then click "Get update", and the store will update your app to their last version.
There are different suggestions that I found on the Internet, but none of them are relevant in my situation :
(Obviously replace the package name depending on your situation)
