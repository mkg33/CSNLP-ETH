Whoever provided you with the configuration information should know that you do not want to enter two gateways, and should have  told you to choose one or the other.
when i don't config default gateway for NIC2 vpn works fine but proxy doesn't.
Configure the two nics with an IP address and mask, then decide which interface is most critical to your needs and add the gateway information to that nic.
May be policy routing (aka policy based routing) is what you need here.
if the otherone is 192.168.55.55 to gateway 192.168.55.1 put only the ip in nic2
and when i config default gateway for both NIC (even though i know this is wrong), windows shoes me a warning and both vpn and proxy server works randomly and very slow.
I don't know how to config my adapters for this specific situation as i explain below.
when i don't config default gateway for NIC1 proxy server works fine but vpn doesn't.
route add 192.168.0.0 MASK 255.255.0.0 192.168.55.1
Mike gave you the best response by pointing out that you cannot have 2 default gateways.
i have two NICs, one for web server and internet vpn and another for internet proxy server.
Also consider that i enabled routing and remote access for NIC1 and in NAT/Basic firwall i added my 1st NIC and selected public interface connected to the internet and just checked Enable NAT on this interface.
You should not have to modify the routing table to pull this off.
If your net is 55.55.55.55 to gateway 55.55.55.1 place that in one nic
So here is the question: how do i config my gateways (or maybe add static routes i don't know) for my NICs to both vpn and proxy server working correctly?
Routing will still take place through both nics as needed so if you made any changes to the roouting table, remove them.
