I feel silly, but I decided to write this anyway in case it helps someone else.
I tried everything to get them to connect, to no avail.
Under available or hidden icons by the bottom right side of your taskbar in Windows 7, there is a Bluetooth icon where the adapter may have been disabled.
For me it's because the headset was set to "Handsfree Telephony" only.
Uninstall all previously installed Bluetooth drivers, reboot your laptop and install drivers from the link below.
Switch to the services tab and check "Headset" also.
After a good two hours playing with all kinds of settings and following (or trying to follow) each suggestion above, it turns out my speaker (Philips SBT75) can only be connected to one device at a time.
Right click your headset there and click properties.
In the end it was just a matter of clicking on "disconnect" on my iPhone Bluetooth settings, and voil√†!
Also, the HP Connection Manager could have the Bluetooth feature disabled or turned off.
This explains why when I started a skype call the headset would suddenly appear but then suddenly disappear later.
I had already tested it successfully with my iPhone and was puzzled that both my iPad and my PC showed as paired but disconnected.
Just simply right-click the icon and a box says "Turn Adapter On."
For windows 7, go to Devices and Printers in control panel.
A place to check is Bluetooth settings and be sure Allow Bluetooth devices to connect with this computer box is checked.
