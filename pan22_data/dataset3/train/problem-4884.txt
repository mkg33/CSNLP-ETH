tl;dr Why would I get a relay access denied when trying to send an email from an external server?
And the weird part is I can send an SMTP email from the server itself through telnet, but it's only when I try to telnet into the server from another server or when I try and send an email through a desktop email client that it fails.
I looked through nmap and it looks like port 25 is open for everyone.
(the desktop clients don't even register in syslog even though I have logging enabled through iptables)
Any additional information can be readily available as needed/requested
I tried altering some of the relay parameters in main.cf but nothing seemed to change things.
Also, I tried telnet from another server and I got the following error:
I'm not that experienced with mail servers so I'm at a loss as to what to even ask.
When using a desktop email client (eM client and thunderbird both fail) I can't get it to hit the server at all.
Courier seems to be working properly (I'm able to imap correctly) but it's just SMTP that is failing.
I used to have dovecot, but have switched over to courier.
Also, I still can't get my mail clients to properly even access my server for some reason even though it was working before when I had the params in place for dovecot (which have still been left in the main.cf but commented out)
Also, why would I not be able to access smtp through my desktop email clients?
(eM client is trying to hit: smtp://xxx@mail.xxxxxx.com:25 if that helps)
