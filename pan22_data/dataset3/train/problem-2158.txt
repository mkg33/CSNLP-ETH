Motti, I'm having the EXACT same issue with Hebrew Word 2010 and my newly installed Windows 8 (installed during the snow day!).
Most probably, your version of Word has some "custom" shortcuts like that, overwriting basic stuff.
Pretty weird that the basic Ctrl-C/V things won't work, but such problems aren't unheard of.
Regional settings - all needed settings for Bulgarian , Keyboard for English-US, Default input - English-US.
That's it -  shortcuts work Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-X .
Look for whatever the usual "Edit" menu is in Hebrew and you should find it.
For example, I do Ctrl-Alt-, for the character "<", but in Word, this is "font size down" or something like that, so I have to disable that shortcut or I can't type the character.
When I went into the customized shortcuts, I chose to save these settings for THIS file (rather than for Normal, which always seems to give me trouble).
I see same problem with Windows 8 Ent & MS Word 2013 Ent.
If you're looking for Undo and Redo, well, it's hard to say since they translate most things in the software, but in my French version, when looking at all commands in the shortcut customising dialog box, they were named "ÉditionAnnuler" and "ÉditionRétablir", which would be "EditUndo" and "EditRedo" in English, I guess.
