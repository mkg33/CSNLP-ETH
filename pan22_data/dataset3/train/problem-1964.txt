Some packages allow you to specify the locations of their dependencies at compile time (via flags to their configure scripts).
Try adding it before you run the passenger install script.
That gives you the advantage of using the system package manager, and the passenger installer shouldn't have any more difficulty.
If you installed one package outside of the package manager, you might need to install other packages outside the package manager.
It mostly depends on the packages involved, and where they are installed.
If you really need Apache2 2.2.14 instead of 2.2.12 (as is available in the Karmic repositories), consider downloading the newer version's source package from the Lucid repository and building your own packages for Karmic (or whichever Ubuntu version you're using).
If you installed Apache to the default location, it's probably in /usr/local.
Often, a configure script will have options like --with-apache2=/usr/local/apache2 or something.
Try running ./configure --help from the source directory of passenger to see if these options are available.
