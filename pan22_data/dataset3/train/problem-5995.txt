I would like it noted that I haven't noticed any of these issues with the commercial nx server or client.
I would recommend moving to a newer, or at least better supported, distribution.
Yes, this base is also dated ('06 or '07) but RedHat is more actively porting fixes to this distribution.
If its a production machine it might be worth going the commercial route on this one.
Our NX server configuration is the default except that we've enabled logging level 7 to /var/log/nxserver.log, and set the font server to "unix:/7100" so that it uses xfs.
It might be caused by the NX client, which client are you using ?
I'd suggest using neatx as FreeNX tends to be unstable and is less actively maintained.
Freenx on the other hand has had numerous issues, and neatx although a good alternative had some annoying quirks as well.
We run the FreeNX server on CentOS 5.x with good success.
My shop has been using the FreeNX server on Fedora 11 for a while now and mostly getting good results, especially with performance, but we have some annoying problems with client connections.
If you use the nomachine client, it might cause problems since you also use the freenx server, which isn't as up-to-date as the nomachine NX server.
At this point (March '11) the "current" Fedora Core is 14, 11 is somewhat dated.
Does anyone have any ideas for making things more stable ?
Maybe a rollback of the client to a know working version could help ?
