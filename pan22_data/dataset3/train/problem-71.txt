One of its prorogation methods was via open windows file shares.

I can't remember the exact details, (and can't find a link in the time I have), but from memory, the file needed very little interaction via Windows Explorer for the code to be executed on the target computer.
Viruses specifically require the user to run them.
The propagation vector here can be JavaScript, Java, ActiveX, Flash and other plugins.
From memory, it copied itself as an .eml file to open network shares.
Such viruses are capable of downloading themselves to your hard disk without your cooperation.
