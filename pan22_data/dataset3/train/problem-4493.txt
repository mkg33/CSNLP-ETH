Fairly stable is not the same as completely stable.
I am looking for memory for SUPERMICRO MBD-X8DAH+-F-O Dual LGA 1366 (http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/qpi/5500/x8dah_-f.cfm).
It also allows the server to watch for RAM that is starting to fail.
The performance difference is fairly small - 2-3% or so I believe.
For a server, this is important, because it can mean the difference between continuing to run or crashing.
But for most applications, the extra expense is worth it for the added reliability.
Or the difference between your paycheck being $1000 or $100.
If you want the cheapest option available, you should get non-ECC.
Basically, I am looking for the difference between ECC and non-ECC memory.
ECC RAM is designed to be able to catch those failures and fix them.
You should get ECC memory if you are using this server for "mission critical" or "too important to fail" tasks and EVERYTHING should perform flawlessly.
If you don't want your OS or applications to crash because of transient memory errors, then you should get ECC.
It may only mess up one in a few trillion trillion times - but RAM is reading and writing millions of bits a second.
Lots of things can mess up in RAM - heat, failing chips, cosmic radiation, gremlins, unstable power.
I have googled it, and it appears that it is better to get non-ECC memory, because:
If it is not a critical system - doesn't process financial records, some downtime or even data corruption is acceptable, etc, and you are on a budget, Non ECC RAM is fine.
Your server crashing because of bad RAM is however very noticable.
