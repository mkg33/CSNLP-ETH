Some variation on that fix might be just what you're looking for.
A quick Google search shows a few people with this same issue in Windows 7.
The fix seems to be restoring backup copies of corrupted registry files.
I then typed "cd\  windows\system32\config" to get to the registry file directory.
"I first booted from the Windows 7 install disc to get to the system recovery console.
I would suggest you execute the "ren" then "copy" commands as above for any other hives that have "rmbak" backups with the same date/time stamp.
Excerpted from a conversation on social.technet.microsoft.com:

You can now reboot and see if your computer comes up.
By typing "dir" I could see that two of the five hive files (default, sam, security,  software, and system) had recent copies with an "rmbak" extension: default.rmbak and software.rmbak.
