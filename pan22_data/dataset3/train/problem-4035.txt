IIRC the problem we found is the software raid is only for 'data protection', according to the KB article.
Hardware raid will do it properly and support hot swapping.
(The software RAID just keeps the data on the two drives in synch and allows the filesystem to recover with just one drive.)
Based on the the description so far this is what I assume you have: Windows OS.
The physical placement of drives within the server do matter for the bootloader, which may cause issues.
Admittedly this is a stab in the dark as I haven't had to do this before.
Most likely the problem is in the BIOS it is set to read the first raid controller.
You can try with modifying boot sequence and add secondary plex.
If you want to make the secondary drive bootable, you can do that, but the software RAID has nothing whatsoever do with that process.

The second disk will not for boot by itself, you had to jump through some loops with boot records.
You either need to move the disk over to the other controller (only if they are the same card) or change which raid card is used to boot from.
Have you tried placing the secondary RAID controller in the same slot as the first when disconnecting the primary?
After encountering the limits of software RAID in w2k3 we moved to hardware RAID.
We get good off lease/used RAID cards cheaply, only get the well known names.
