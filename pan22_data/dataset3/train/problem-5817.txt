It would free all of apache's workers to deal with just the dynamic contet.
Total Memory (in MB) / Total Memory per Process = MaxClients.
Tuning the apache children is one of those things like custom compiling a kernel where people overwhelmingly do more harm than good, even if the harm is just wasting an afternoon for no benefit.
It turns out the httpd project guys over at apache are pretty good at what they do!
You could also consider using a http proxy like Varnish or Squid.
Usually, static content will use 2/5 MB, and dynamic 20/25 MB, you have 36/40 MB
If you are in a tightly memory constrained situation (VPS) then you may need to lower the default maxclients to prevent swap death.
Supose you are going to reserve 512 MB for OS, you have 2584 MB for other purposes like apache.
You have to ensure memory for the OS, if you consume all memory available the system will hang.
You can use memcached to store the documents in memory which will allow it to scale considerably (eliminating a disk bottleneck) but it all depends on how much RAM you have and if the content changes much.
But once again, you need some RAM for this one too.
Answer depends greatly on the type of content you are serving.
I have 1 server with similar configuration, with 3 million monthly visits.
ServerLimit limits MaxClients, use the same value, but do not use arbitrary numbers.
It is a wide-range of content or a single document?
Have you considered using nginx in front of apache to serve all the static content?
Use binary numbers, or try to approach to them based on your results.
