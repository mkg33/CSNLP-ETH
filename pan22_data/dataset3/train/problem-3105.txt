Xmarks has an add-on for both browsers and offers an option for password syncing.
Mozilla does encrypt/decrypt saved passwords using the Master Password.
Manage passwords were empty- even previously saved passwords from Opera were gone.
There is no good way to export passwords between most browsers (except between Firefox and Chrome, it seems).
Shut down Opera, and restarted: Checked settings and....
It may seem silly, but I will print out all my passwords and keep the hard copy at home in a safe place.
That way, not only do your passwords remain free from browser data liberation problems, but your passwords are infinitely more secure too (there is no encryption on any browser's password manager except maybe Opera's, and Firefox's password manager has no encryption even with a master password, so it's interesting that they even have that option).
My solution is to use a browser-independent password manager like KeePass, LastPass, or 1Password.
However, I am considering using an independent password manager as a precaution.
Opera would not import Mozilla passwords despite the option (apparently).
Opera has a import option to import all data - including passwords - from Firefox now.
