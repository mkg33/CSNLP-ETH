In the router :  Change 802.11bgn to just 802.11bg.
However as you have not run the suggested wireless information script, it's hard to know.
So check to see if any of your modprobe.d files contain config options for cfg80211 and try commenting/removing them.
In Network Manager at top right corner of the screen, click on Edit connections -> Wireless tab, and set IPV6 to Ignore.
For more details see Linux Wireless Regulatory info.
In particular, you've not specified what wireless card or driver is in use, but the last link refers to a Lenovo T440s which may have similar hardware.
This is most likely a configuration issue or a software conflict on your client.
Suggestions include misconfigured supplicant software, or having multiple applications trying to manage the wireless at the same time:
I saw a similar issue which turned out to be down to an old modprobe config file (in /etc/modprobe.d) I had installed a few years ago.
In the driver : Depends on your WiFi card (but the above might be enough).
Set the wireless channel in the router to 1 or 11, then save the router configuration and reboot it.

Also it may help to check to see that the REGDOMAIN is set in /etc/default/crda.
This means your wireless software is deliberately choosing to disconnect from the access point.
Specifically it specified an option for the cfg80211 (WiFi stack module) options cfg80211 ieee80211_regdom="EU"
After commenting/removing the option and rebooting it was fixed.
Change the router WEP encryption to just WPA2 (CCMP)(AES) not (TKIP), if you have that option.
