It's written by Microsoft so the quality is quite high.
Just for the record audio playing through Snow Leopard and these headphones is perfect.
This is a totally different driver than the Realtek driver and so is unlikely to have the same issues.
To be honest though, this sounds more like a hardware issue than a driver issue.
Should already be installed or just run your driver cd not dvd you should have.
They're on your Mac OS installation disk (simply insert the disk while under Windows and run setup.exe).
You probably did that already, but just making sure (since you don't mention it in your question).
Rather than try newer drivers from Realtek, I would try using Microsoft's HDAudio class driver.
I've tried downloading the latest drivers from Realteks website, but to no avail.
If that doesn't fix the issue, try you Mac OS again with the same headphones.
The only problem I've been having is with the audio, I seem to get a low hissing noise which is more prevalent when wearing headphones.
Whilst it's not stopping me from using Windows 7 it's something I'd like fixed.
Right click the speaker icon on the bottom right, click playback devices and again make SPEAKERS the main playback device,  Yes it works with the latest driver by cirus logic.
I've been using (and enjoy using) Windows 7 through bootcamp on my mac for some time now.
This appears to be a problem with Bootcamp and unfortunately has changed with the new BootCamp update.
I used to have a few sound problems too, and they were solved by installing the Apple drivers... (I didn't remember to install them right away... completely forgot actually)
