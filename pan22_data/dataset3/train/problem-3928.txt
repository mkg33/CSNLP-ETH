Both should accept emails for both names, but internally redirect email to proper server using aliases behavior.
Is it possible migrate this all at one step with service downtime?
Worse situation is when you cannot do some breakdown service, then you should migrate mailboxes user by user.
then you'll increase chance, no one will visit you equiped with sharp fork and burning torch :)
When you'll migrate lat user, you should point MX only to new server and wait until mailqueue on old will empty, and power down this.
you decision you leave this emails, or migrate to new server.

If you never have done it, better do any tests on any virtual copy with some set of mailboxes.
test it for one mailbox, it sync only needed information, or rewrite all.
But better way is rsync mailbox on the fly, and at service downtime you do rsync again for update.
you can silently test for specified user, all is ok or not.
