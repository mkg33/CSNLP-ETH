I am worried that power saving protocols on the phone may break the connection before it has finished "loading".
Once I can get it to connect via wifi repeatedly, I shall activate these and see if they are a problem.
I feel the purpose in my life has been fullfilled...
In addition I have toyed with WPS on the router and gone over the network and service configuration as stated in the samsung tutorial.
Kies Air CONNECTS your device to the PC via the web-browser, allowing you to manage the information in your phone, but without the posibility of syncronising with Outlook and other programs.
8 minutes to "load" is too long... On USB cable or with Kies Air it is instantaneous...
I have just had it connect again, it took 9 minutes, from 11:17 to 11:26.
I have a 32GB SD card, half-full with a few movies.
At least I have "seen" the smartphone sync to outlook :-)
The main issue I have encountered is that "loading" takes 10 minutes.
I've been having the same issues and finally got the SII to sync via wifi with outlook.
Most of them where correct on the 3 PC I have tried.
