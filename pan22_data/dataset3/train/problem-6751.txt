You can buy a server and stick it in a colo and rent their bnadwidth and point your domain there.
Suppose I want to host some web-service - a bunch of code that will accept HTTP requests, do something useful and serve results as web pages.
You can rent a server at a hosting site and point your DNS there.
Or I could rent a virtual machine in some public cloud service like Amazon EC2 or Windows Azure.
What exactly are you trying to do or want to do that doesn't involve either buying a server or renting a server?
You can bribe a friend to host it at his or her own site.
I could buy a server and host it at my office/home/whatever or at a colocation facility.
You can rent a "cloud" machine and point your service there.
It just runs code for people - Google take care of the rest, the scaling, the bandwidth, pretty much everything.
You can own a server, buy an IP off your provider that's static, then redirect your DNS to your office/home/etc.
That kind of limits what you're going to be able to do without one of those two things.
