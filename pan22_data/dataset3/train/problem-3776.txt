At the end of the process, a DYMO label printer connected to the network is supposed to print out a label that will be stuck to the bike.
If it helps, here is the line in PHP that calls the VBScript:
Since you already assumed it to be the problem - I think you should check if permissions are an issue here.
If the php script is starting the VB script, then the user running the webserver will run the VB script.
The easiest test would be to allow access to both files to everyone (which must be reverted after successfull testing!)
And this user then needs access to the script location and to the csv file.
You could also test both parts of you problem individually:
If I manually run the VBScript, it will open Word, load the CSV data, print a label, and close Word.
The web server is Windows Server 2003 running XAMPP.
I think it is a permissions problem, but any ideas would be appreciated.
Likewise, if I add a bit of code to the end of the VBScript to write a .txt file (for testing purposes) the text file gets written whether I run the script manually or allow it to be run by the website.
The university I work for allows students to register their bikes for indoor storage during the winter.
As such, I suspect there is a permissions problem preventing the VBScript from accessing Word and/or the printer when run from the web.
