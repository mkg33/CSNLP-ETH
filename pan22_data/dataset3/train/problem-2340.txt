When an enemy spawns, the script will detect this and perform an action, for instance playing a sound locally on the computer.
For instance, hitting the Q key will normally make my character use an ability, but with my Lua script running in the background, will cause a sound to play on my computer (or something).
Is there a way to do either events OR hooks using lua similarly to how C/C++ can connect to a game using WinAPI dlls?
I would like to do both, but I know for games like Garry's Mod, the game already has built-in support for running lua scripts.
For instance, the game spawns an enemy every minute.
The reason I ask is, I am trying to create a background application that will perform events and hooks on a particular game that does not currently support lua in-game.
Does a game have to have built-in functions to accept and run lua scripts, or can I design Events and Hooks using Lua on any game I please, akin to the days where C code could be used to hook into the WinAPI using dlls?
