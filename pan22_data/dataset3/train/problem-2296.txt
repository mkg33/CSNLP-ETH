In any case, different subnets require a router for communication.
192.168.1.1 for 192.168.1.0/24, and 10.0.0.1 for 10.0.0.0/24.
The primary address is on one subnet; the secondary address is on the other.
In your case, the router needs to be configured with multiple IP addresses on the single interface, one address for each subnet.

For efficiency, you should attach the router to the switch that is likely to carry more routed traffic.
The router needs to be attached to each VLAN - since you've only got one, it'll just use a single interface.
(It'd be very inefficient to receive a packet on switch 1, forward it to switch 2, forward to the router, and all the way back to switch 1.)
The router addresses need to be set as gateways, e.g.
There are exceptions, but this is a general good practice.
Normally, you put nodes from different IP subnets in different VLANs (L2 segments).
It may also require explicit configuration to route back to the ingress interface (router-on-a-stick).
In your case, you need to configure a secondary address on your router.
Be aware that some routers do not operate the same with secondary addresses as they do for primary.
This is another reason to avoid secondary addresses if possible.
Generally speaking, having multiple subnets on a single VLAN is not a good idea.
Usually you have one subnet per VLAN (and vice versa).
