vi can be very feature reach, and you definitely might not need to use all those features, but knowing how to search for text, edit, delete, copy/paste, save files and abandon changes is definitely more than useful.
Yep, it's on everything, I came across it as the only editor on a system that I was trying to recover and had to grope (grep???)
Takes about 20 minutes to learn all of the above, and you're good to go, and use vi for sysadmin tasks.
Furthermore is one of the more powerful editor in the world, so learning al least its basis is worth the effort, ever ...
I think that knowing vi for a sysadmin operating on unix environments is almost indispensable (a must know) because it is present on nearly all Unix variant and "descendant" out there, so if you know vi you can edit files on any system without the need of installing new packages.
I resolved to learn it and it's now my goto editor, I script in it, edit windows config files and of course edit Linux config etc.
around blindly whilst trying to get my head around the different modes.
How important is it to learn something like vi if I am to do more sysadmin related stuff, mostly involving ssh?
