If you do plan on using an existing router, make sure you plug into the LAN, not WAN.
However I cannot access the 2nd routers setting page to change the wireless password and what not whilst it is connected like this.
I just have an ethernet cable connecting the 2 routers and even without changing any settings the one without the internet connection just changes into an access point automatically.
They are a breeze to setup and offer pretty awesome coverage.
While there is nothing wrong with having a router act like an access point; access points often offer the advantage of being smaller, POE, and can extend your wireless range considerably.
I recommend PoE - there is an adapter which will plug in elsewhere in the house and give you good wireless coverage there - with another adapter wired into the router.
A wireless router pretty much is just a router and wireless access point in one.

I use a spare wireless router in my home and it works fine.
I've never had much success with wireless extenders and so on but I am very happy with my (3) Solwise adapters.
Wireless access points were designed to be cheaper but because of the massive boom in wireless networking and the sales of wireless routers, routers seem to be even cheaper now.
You have to disconnect the 2nd router from the first one to get so it swaps back to being a router, then you can get on it's settings page.
