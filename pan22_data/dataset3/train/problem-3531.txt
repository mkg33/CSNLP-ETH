I suspect you may have a port(s) that is flapping and the TCN message should lead us directly to the culprit.
Yeah you know you can set it up for switchport voice vlan.
TCN's are generated when a port transitions from one state to another assuming you are not changing the priority values.
There is a lot of information I would need to see to better understand the topology and what spanning-tree mode you are running in (PVST+, RPVST+ or MST).
However being setup without the switchport voice vlan, I do not see this being an issue with TCN's.
The portfast trunk configuration should be applied to hosts that you are trunking with, for example an ESX host or a Load Balancer.
So you have a VoIP phone plugged into a switchport that is configured switchport access vlan  and computers/hosts plugged into other switchports with switchport access vlan ?
I suspect from what I've read you are running PVST+.
I would like to see the documentation you are referring too regarding the portfast trunk command.
This post is older in age so I'm not sure if you are still experiencing this problem.
For switch to switch, this configuration should not be there.
I would like to first start with the output of show spanning-tree vlan x detail and a snippet of this TCN you are seeing.
