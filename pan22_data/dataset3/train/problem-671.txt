Currently RAID is configured through the BIOS and it works fine, but I have no way to monitor the status of the drives.
In most cases you would use the OpenManage Server Administrator to monitor Dell hardware.
This is available for download from Dell's support website for Windows and Linux.
Is there a command to show me the status of the drives?
I have a PowerEdge 2650 with the PERC 3/Di RAID controller.
I do not know if they make a version compatible with Solaris specifically.
Here is a guide to get OMSA on to a 2650 running CentOS 5 - http://stevejenkins.com/blog/2010/10/how-to-install-dell-omsa-5-5-on-a-dell-poweredge-2650-with-centos-5-rhel-5/
In a supported OS you can use Server Administrator but I don't think there is a version for Solaris, at least now there isn't, you probably could find more info in linux.dell.com, also you have the option of the original manufacturer of the Raid controller, Adaptec, but now I can't remember the Adaptec model, probably a google search will help.
I believe Solaris has some level of linux compatibility, but I cannot verify whether this will work.
The 2650 is getting old - even on a supported OS, you may encounter difficulties trying to install OMSA.
