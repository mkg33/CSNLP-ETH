I think it's actually a good thing as you'll get surge effects as water floods into an area like you would in reality.
A block generates a pressure equal to it's own weight (how much water is in it) and applies it to the blocks below and beside it.
You will get loops where the water pressure flows too far one way and then has to correct but since you don't move the whole amount of water per tick these will be damped.
why cant you define another type of block that acts as an immovable amount of pressure?
On each tick move water from high pressure to low pressure but move only a fraction of the water needed to equalize.
If you cannot find, then the tile stays on the current position.
Water can also be pushed up if the pressure in the block is too great for the pressure being applied down on the square.
I sort of agree with Sean but I would do it a bit differently:
Therefore when you use your way of normally moving the water blocks and checking whether it can move up, it cant.
Even better would be to add another definition to those blocks that allows the user to enter the amount of pressure per block, increasing the pressure according to the amount of water blocks adding to it.
I see no reason it's position in the world is relevant.
If you find, then the another rules will guarantee the replacement of the moved tile (if necessary).
You can add a rule that try to go left or right (through the walls) with the tiles until you find a free spot, starting with the layers on the bottom.
