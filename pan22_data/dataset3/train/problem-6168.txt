The solution for me was to uninstall the virus checking software that came pre-installed with the PC.
Googling the hex error code led me to a Windows 7 KB Article regarding Windows Update failure due to locked files.
Or will I have to get the sledgehammer out and do a clean install?
I have a Lenovo laptop which upgraded from Windows 8.1 Home to Windows 10 Home.
It appears that an active virus checker can prevent the upgrade process from Home to Pro to complete.
I suggest to try clean install and see if that key works or not.
After a reboot I get an error which states "We couldn't upgrade your edition" and asks me to try again or seek help from my system administrator (me!)
I have a (legitimate) Windows 10 Pro key which I ran through the "Change Product Key" wizard.
After doing this I then repeating the attempt to update to Pro (with legit key) via the store.
There is nothing in the event logs except Info entries in the Setup log stating it failed to change the installed state to Pro Edition with a hex error code (I don't have access to the laptop right now, I will update later with the full log details)
I had a similar issue when trying to upgrade a newly purchased PC from Home to Pro edition.
Since key is checked at early stage, you don't need to worry about your data, formatting partition... etc.
I tried to swap the original OEM key with another Home key, and still couldn't do the switch to Pro afterwards.
The article stepped through using MSCONFIG to perform a clean boot which I did, but still got the error.
I solved it buy obtaining a new Windows 10 Home key from msdn and then changing the product key (also via the settings-> Activation window).
My guess is that whatever I had as a key was not eligable for the upgrade combination i was trying via the store.
Since you have legitimate key for windows 10 pro then why you did update to windows 10 home?
