When you are in active mode, the command connection is established on a server port.
However when I'm using simple commands like 'ls' and 'dir' doesn't work as expected.
You should switch to passive mode instead by establishing the FTP connection then typing passive.
This shouldn't be blocked by the server or any firewall or security software.
The server then connects to your machine on port 20 for that connection.
Explanation: When you start up FTP it comprises two different connections - one for the commands(the command connection) and one for the data transferred(the data connection).
The problem with this is that since attacks and hacking are more common these days than when FTP was invented, data sent by an outside source(the server) to port 20 on your machine will be blocked by your firewall, NAT, or other security software.
When you use passive mode, the client gets to be in charge of establishing the data connection.
The problem here sounds like the FTP client you're using is in active mode - which is the default.

It chooses a random port on the server to do so and then makes the connection.
I have a problem where in I am able to login as a guest ftp user.
However, the data connection is left up to the server to establish.
I had this same problem a while ago and although I wasn't connected via a guest account - I still got no data returned when issuing commands like dir or ls.
You should get a confirmation message that passive mode has been turned on.
