We currently use Microsoft Lync 2010 on the staff side to facilitate IM between staff members, and this includes the help desk techs.
They feel this will help increase their productivity in serving patrons.
The help desk techs are requesting an IM system such that a patron at a machine hooked into the public side VLAN can page and chat with a help desk technician, who's machine is hooked into our staff VLAN.
You can also federate your Lync with Skype or Yahoo or Jabber.
My workplace (a public library) employs two VLANs to service public machines and staff machines separately.
Consequently they wish to pursue the option to use an Internet based IM system to achieve this.
If there were some way to achieve them having IM access to patron machines and fellow staff simultaneously, without having separate software, this would be ideal.
So my superiors are wanting to avoid a LAN based IM system due to the difficulties of communicating across VLANs.
Also, your Lync Server paired with an EDGE server allows clients to connect from externally.
Discussion regarding either a VLAN based solution or an Internet based solution are more than welcome.
