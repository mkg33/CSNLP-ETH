If that doesn't work, try searching the registry for Windows Photo Viewer and photoviewer.dll to see if there are any references to photoviewer.dll being called directly (without rundll32).
I got mine to work, I think you have to successfully open an image with the old photo viewer once, then you can set it as default.
PS: Winaero Tweaker is a free tool, which can be used to tweak many aspects of Windows 10.
You can also use Winaero Tweaker to activate Windows Photo Viewer, as shown in the following screenshot.
Now my PNGs open with the old photo viewer by default, works great.
I think because of your first attempt to run the .dll directly, the entry "Windows Photo Viewer" still points to the .dll instead of rundll32, which of course you can't run directly.
Just follow the description (within the green box), and you're all set.
Then go to the image file and choose open with... and then choose the command you just typed:
I have followed TechnoCore's answer, but as the comments indicated, the second part wasn't working for me either.
Repeat it for all file types you want to associate with Windows Photo Viewer.
Once you did steps 1-4, you don't have to repeat them for other file types.
Unfortunately, none of the above answers worked for me, but they pointed me in the right direction.
Make sure you have the "Always use this app..." option checked.
I have found a solution without having to alter the registry.
