Make sure that the first 'Always Connect' option is chosen.
CoRD solved my problem, and some other minor problems too :) I recommend it!
It's a security risk having the password saved but the error message is so cryptic and my users just can't get the hang of not saving their password when it asks to save the connection at the end of the session.
Settings on the server were as user23294 mentioned, set to compatible, and the setup has worked fine up till now (many months).
After that, you might want to try CoRD (http://cord.sourceforge.net/), which is an open-source Remote Desktop client that has some better tweaks and error messages.
This resolved the problem for me but it's a security compromise to not alienate the Mac people.
We just had this same issue with a WS2008R2 and a Mac.
Solution was to logon from a windows client, close programs and log user off.
In Remote Desktop on your Mac open Preferences -> Security.
If you can accept the security risk of a saved password on the client end, then I turned off the "Always prompt for password" on the "Log On Settings Tab" in "RDP-Tcp Properties" of "Remote Desktop Session Host Configuration" -- Windows 2008 R2.
Apparently the user session became corrupted somehow, preventing access from a Mac, but not from another Windows client.
Subsequent attempts at logon from Mac gave same message and immediate disconnection.
The authentication would fail if the user had the password saved in the settings.
