The default gateway is presumably your ADSL router, so the packet disappear into the Internet and be lost.
Now, some VPNs change the default gateway when you connect.
You have to setup the routers to allow the traffic from the VPN Subnet to pass though the tunnel.
I have successfully set up the tunnel between the two of them so that when you are in either internal network you can ping and access the opposite network.
I seem to have ranted on a bit, however the point is that tracert will quickly tell you where your pings to site B are going and give you a clue as to what's wrong.
site A router) this is now a local address so no gateways are involved and the site A router should reply.
This is my first time posting here so please be gentle.
When you ping any address that isn't 192.168.16.xxx the traffic gets routed to your gateway 192.168.1.1.
The title describes my problem, I will outline the setup:
You see a list of all the routers the traffic passes through it it's attempt to reach site B (this takes a while to build up).
This address isn't in the local networks for either your real NIC (192.168.16.xxx) or the VPN virtual NIC (192.168.10.xxx) so the packet will go to the default gateway, 192.168.16.1.
If the first hop is to your PCs usual default gateway then you need to modify the routing rules on your PC.
), let's say your PC has IP address 192.168.16.2 and default gateway 192.168.16.1 (you can type ipconfig to get this info).
Firewall issue:  Just like the routes the traffic needs to be allowed.
If the first hop is 192.168.10.1 but the remaining hops time out then you need to modify the router configs.
To expand a bit (bear with me if you already know this stuff!
I have a site to site bidirectional VPN tunnel set up in two offices 100 miles apart.
When you connect the VPN you'll probably get a second IP address 192.168.10.something; in effect the VPN creates a second network card.
However, when I VPN into either of them completely offsite (from home, for example) I cannot see the opposite network but I am able to see the internal network I am VPN'ed to without issue.
Site A is running a Watchguard Firebox x20e, Site B runs a Cisco ASA 5500 (or something of that sort.)
In that case the default gateway would be 192.168.10.something so when you ping 192.168.0.xxx the packet should flow through the VPN and you should be able to ping site B.
Routing issue:  If your vpn subnet is different than the site you're VPNed to you'll need to tell the device at site b to route traffic back to site a for that subnet.
