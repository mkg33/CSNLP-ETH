If we are talking about linux here, lxc might be a feasible solution.
Don't know if this is convenient enough for you, but one possible solution would be to install IIS on the machine with the browsers and provide server side scripts (like ASP.net, PHP, Ruby...) that change the hosts file and then redirect to the actual page.
In your browsers, you then create a bookmark to that script, for example http://localhost/config_ie.rb which changes the hosts file (requires correct permissions on that file, of course) and then do a 302-redirct to the real page.
Or you could just name these server something entirely different in the hosts file so you never have to switch it to begin with.
I know this isn't what you're asking for, but a temporary solution could be to write a batch script to swap the hosts files and then claunch the browser.
At least it would minimize the the work you're doing.
So you would have one virtual machine for the staging environment, one for prod, etc.
Apart from that - even a full VM with a minimal X11-linux is not that big (max 2 GB disk) and does not consume that many resources (max.
One relatively simple solution (but maybe a bit resource heavy) would be to have a few virtual machines running in your host.
If a full VM is too much, a container-based solution might do.
