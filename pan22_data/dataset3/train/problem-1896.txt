I especially like the lists of jj33 and Murali Suriar.
The best Administrators I've known were those who stayed calm in a crisis, and knew when to admit they didn't know what was going wrong.
The difference between good and great administrators is not often seen until it's too late.
A good administrator will get the software or system up and running and it'll run great.
If they do break the great administrator will be able to fix or find a workaround very quickly due to his knowledge of the platform.
A great administrator will get the software or system up and running and again it'll run great.
Less important, but more valued by their superiors: The will to say "Yes" and help management achieve their goals, but recognizing when saying No is better for the company.
When You tell a moderate admin to do something, he'll do it and say "done".
He might even add "test it please as I am not sure if it works like it should".
Sysadmins who are obsessive about having things standardized generally will produce the most secure and reliable systems.
A good administrator will generally panic and start flapping at this point.
Unfortunately, as stated, this is all often found out too late .
When You tell a good admin to do something, he'll do it and say "done and tested, have fun using it".
However the great administrator will also have taken the time to understand everything he possibly can about the system and put preventative measures in place to make sure things don't break at the most critical time.
