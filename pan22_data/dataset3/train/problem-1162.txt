I have a progress bar that "ticks down" from a user specified amount of time to zero.
I am trying to figure out an algorithm for handling an otherwise simple animation.
I have tried too many things to list and all have failed.
If they waited 75% of the time, then there would only be 250 ms left to animate, etc.
I wanted a smooth animation, so I chose to update it in a timer class at approximately 24 frames-per-second.
I'm doing this in c#, but I am sure I can figure out any algorithm presented and translate it if needed.
This new rate would be as if the total wait time was 1 second.
To put it another way, if the user waited half way though the normal timer even and pressed "Update Now", then there would only be a half-second left to animate.
I'm sure this is easy, I just can't quite grasp the correct algorithm.
I'm sure the answer will turn out easy, but any help would be appreciated.
So, say the timer/progress bar is running down from a 10 minute wait and they press "Update Now", I want the animation to "hurry up" and complete.
The problem I am trying to figure out is how to speed up the animation at an arbitrary point in the animation cycle (the user will initiate it by pressing an "Update Now" type of button.
Most notably, the progress bar jumps to a later time, and then finishes the animation--I can't get it to animate fast from the point where it has left off.
