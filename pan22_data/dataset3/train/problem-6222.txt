In these cases, one might prefer to read a more clear version submitted to the authors' home page.
If you work on a university campus, there's likely a large building nearby full of study carrels and magazine racks called a "LIE-BURY".
(At least according to Wikipedia, this is the reason we call our research reports "papers".
Surprisingly, despite the crudeness of the technology that produced them, these so-called "books" are often significantly easier to read than their more modern electronic counterparts.
One serious disadvantage of this approach is that one must actually walk all the way across campus, but we all must occasionally suffer for our art.
However, I still can't find a workaround for other problems.
In the case of bitmap fonts, I found a good strategy: Find the postscript (PS) version of the paper, and convert the bitmap fonts to their vector counterparts using pkfix or a combination of pkfix-helper + pkfix, whichever applies (read the documentation).
From time to time, I have to read a paper with unclear typesetting.
My best bet is to use a desk lamp: I don't know why, but magically the words seem  larger under its light!
PS: Some months ago, I found an application which "splited" a PDF into several segments, so that they were easy to read on an iPhone or the like.
Deep in the bowels of such buildings, one can often find images of old research papers inscribed onto thin sheets of cellulose fiber extracted from wood and cotton, called "paper", and then bound into larger brick-sized objects called "books".
Unfortunately, the author version is not always available; and even in that case, they might be very lengthy (the so-called full version of the paper).
However, the output was downgraded to fit the iPhone small screen, and therefore it wasn't apt for computer screen or printer.
