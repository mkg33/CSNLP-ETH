Bright flash and cracking sound right in his face.
I've looked up on most of our servers that we traditionally use 110v for, however they SEEM to all support 208v as well (HP DL360 g4, Dell 2850's, and Dell 2650's).
We've had two ugly surprises with 110v-only equipment on a 208v circuit.
Is there anything wrong with putting all of these servers on 208v?
The guy who hooked that up connected the power cord to the strip first, then connected the cord to the machine.
If the servers support 208v (and most do these days) then you'll be fine.
All of our servers are 110v, however we're starting to purchase some new ones, and the datacenter tech recommended we opt for the 208v since it was cheaper for the cage we are getting.
One, an off-brand chassis hosting our voicemail system, simply couldn't take 110v.
When the gap between two voltages is low you will have low losses caused by conversion.
The datacenter tech is correct, this will save you money as most data centers charge per amp for power and running your servers at 208v will reduce the number of amps you'll need to power the servers.
I'm wondering why exactly 208 volt - from where came this digit 208 ?
While 208v is definitely OK for most recent Dell hardware, and probably most Cisco, etc., double check everything you're planning to add to the cabinet.
Why do you think that power supplies at higher voltage are more effective ?
The other was an older Dell workstation-used-as-a-server which had a physical switch that nobody noticed, which was still set at 110v.
If we speak only for the voltages (ignoring ampers) I think that more effective will be conversion from 110 to 3, 5, 12 volt compared to 220 to 3,5,12 volt.
Nice smoky smell, and a weekend without voicemail.
I've decided to move most of my servers out of our closet at work and into a datacenter.
As a standart it allows you to have a little deviation for example as a low minimum 200 volt and as a maximum 240 volt, but now one speaks about 208 volt as a standart voltage for equipment.
In most of the Europe the voltage is 220 volt and this is a standart.
