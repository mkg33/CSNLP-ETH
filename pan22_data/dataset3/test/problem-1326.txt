mysql-common is the base package used by both client and server components.
If things aren't working still, try re-installing this package.
If you have the mysql-server package on the system, you should make sure that's gone too before you attempt to reinstall.
dpkg -r --force-remove-reinstreq <package> removes a package without checking if it requires reinstallation.
After that you should be able to reinstall the package with your preferred package manager.
You might want to give aptitude a try, which has better handling of dependencies:
If its another package that is broken, try apt-get remove --force that package as well.
There will definitely be packages that depend on this; check using #2 above.
Also, do not forget to reinstall mysql-common, else your system will be very broken.
if you ask to install mysql-server, apt-get should tell you that it depends on mysql-server-5.0 and install both.
Also, I'm going to refer to mysql-server-5.0, but realize that there's a wrapper package mysql-server that always points to the latest version.
However, the package might still be broken, if you made any changes to files that came from the mysql-common package.
Simply removing a package does not remove the config files that came with it.
Purge mysql-server before reinstalling mysql-common.
