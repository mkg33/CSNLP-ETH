I've got most of my servers on a raid 5 or 6 setup so I don't notice the extra writes.
I've got a similar situation (more data less uses - around 60) and the benefits of having shadow copies available to undo mistakes is invaluable.
Shadow-copy generally doesn't do anything to your read-performance instead what happens is that whenever you write to a file that is considered to be part of a snapshot a copy will be made and your write will be made to the copy.
I believe the performance hit depends a lot on how much data is being changed between snapshots, and when/how often your snapshots are scheduled to run.
Until they did did something stupid with a file that is.
With mostly reads you probably wont notice anything.
I have about 100 users and around 600gb of data that is most doc, pdfs, xls and so on.
On one system I was responsible for I enabled shadow copy on our server, given your description I may have a roughly equivalent situation to yours and it didn't really seem cause much of a performance hit at all.
(akin to zfs if you've heard their marketing) Which means for each write to an existing file it has to write a new block and make a note about the old block being old.
A lot of different backup utilities (ghost, true image, and possibly Microsoft backup) leverage this.
That being said your question was about performance.
Microsoft doesn't say much about it because it's quite subjective.
There are so many other variables to network share performance (network, cpu, application) snapshots weren't noticed by any of our staff.
I wish I could offer you something more concrete, but since it is so dependent on your specific usage patterns, you may have to warn your users and simply try it.
It will be important to get some performance data on the server before you make any changes so you will have some data see what impact the change had.
You probably would want to start with a conservative one snapshot a day schedule, and then increase the frequency as needed/desired.
I also use the snapshots for backup purposes, I don't need to worry about open files etc.
It is possible to turn snapshotting on and then turn it off again later if there's a problem.
