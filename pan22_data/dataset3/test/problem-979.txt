Digi Edgeport, Moxa, but also cables with FTDI chipset should offer the full handshake logic.
In the recent years I have not run into any related issues any more.
These will also give you all signal lines including RI as well.
The problem was in the past sometimes that on the Windows driver side, more exotic things like BREAK states or "RTS On Send" (RTS_CONTROL_TOGGLE in Windows Communication API) were not supported.
I bought notebook few days ago and of course it doesn't have serial port :)
Can it completely "mimic" serial port which can be found on older PC motherboards?
Look at commercial grade USB RS232 adapters such as Edgeport by Digi, they are about 2-4 times as expensive as the cheap USB adapters, but they can give you as close to a pure RS232 experience as possible, even maintaining the same Com port regardless of the USB port they are connected to.
Since my notebook doesn't have it, only solution is to use USB to RS232 converter.
I'm interested in satellite technology and most satellite receivers use serial port for communication with computer.
