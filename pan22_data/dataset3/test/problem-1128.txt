After that I delete the problematic (domain) user profile, the "problematic" user logged on and I imported again the documents and Settings, autoconfigure Outlook, etc.
We had this problem on only one computer with Windows 8.1 64Bit Enterprise German (upgrade from Win7 and Win8 before) with Office pro plus 2013 32 Bit German and only with a "everytime everywhere problematic" (domain) user profile.
All Microsoft Office 2013 Programms (visio and projekt inclusive) ans " Save as" (speichern unter) are now working perfekt :)
But I found a simple workaround: Instead of selecting "Computer" in the "Places" area, just select "OneDrive".
This user had in the past very oft problems, on every workstation, laptop, etc... but this is another story... After trying everything the only solution was to save all documents ans settings of the user to another drive, log off the user and log on as local administrator.
Further down this article are some helpful bits on using filters if you haven't used ProcMon before.
There will be 1000's of entries, and pinpointing the real cause might be hard to do, but it's in the capture somewhere.
Start the capture, recreate the freeze, switch to another program (ex-Paint) and then stop the capture.
You could take a Process Monitor capture, and see what's actually going on to see if anything pops out.
All other users does not have any problem with office software nor with other programs in this computer and on other 200 domain Computers ans laptops.
This fixed my issue that was the same as you described.
Once the "Browse" dialog appears, just navigate to a location on your local machine.
Installing the latest update does not solve the problem on my machine.
Opening the "Browse" dialog using the "Computer" place just hangs up office (or to be more specific: The "Browse" dialog causes Office to become unresponsive).
Filter to include only the office process and post-process, and then look at what's happening before you switched.
Microsoft now updated their Knowledge Base article 2883052 with the information that a fix is available either via Windows Update or as a direct download.
