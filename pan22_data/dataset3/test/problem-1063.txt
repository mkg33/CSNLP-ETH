I'm fairly certain this only works, though, when all your machines are on the same subnet.
For instance, instead of vnc://1.2.3.4, you could do vnc://computername for Windows systems or (as Sable indicates) vnc://computername.local for Mac and Unix systems.
So you can use "myitunesmachine.local" in all of your services.
And then you can configure that ip with your DNS server and can use any name like www.yourchoice.com
Since you mentioned a DNS service, it is possible to set up a name server and allow all client machines to dynamically update DNS when they get their IP address, but it's usually not worth the training/setup/maintenance efforts for a small home network.
For This you have to Set your DHCP server RESERVATION Option.
It comes with documentation, but you would probably also need a book on bind (e.g.
This is because of broadcast packets on the network.
If you have a bunch of machines running Mac OS X on the same subnet each machine will be $HOST.local.
Use that particular Machine with DHCP Server but Configure DHCP Server to assign the Fix IP to that PC and everytime that PC will get the same IP Address.
On most OSes, I think you can just use the host name of the machine rather than its IP address.
I seem to remember that with Windows you could just use the NetBIOS name directly in MSTSC with no problems.
But if that's a route you're interested in taking, you can get the free name server software "bind" from http://www.isc.org/downloads .
