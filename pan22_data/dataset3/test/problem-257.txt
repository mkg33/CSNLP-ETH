Process Explorer can tell you what programs you are running are using the most of your CPU.
I was shocked at the performance of W7 on such low end hardware.
I have a similar system with 2gb ram and Z520 processor running Windows 7.
7 tends to not do as well at 2GB of RAM and below as XP does (though 7 certainly does perform well enough).
I can surf with Chrome or FF with multiple windows open and not have these issues.
But if you have enough RAM, I think windows 7 would do as well XP, even on the Atom chip.
Perhaps there are things running that are hogging your CPU.

Do You think that downgrading to Windows XP would provide better performance for the following tasks?
I am running W7 on my atom 230, it runs better than XP did on the same box, I have 2gb ram.
I had this PC triple booted XP, Vista, W7 at one point, W7 won out.
I suggest you use an utility like Glary Utilites and clean out any programs loading at startup that you don't need.
That does help my webpages load significantly faster.
Even though it is used for basic things (web browsing and simple photo edition in Picasa), its performance is totally bad - often hangs when 5 Chrome tabs and 2 Windows Explorers are open.
I've bought a netbook Asus Eee 1101HA with Intel Atom Z520 1,33GHz and Windows 7.
I do have an SD card installed that I dedicate to Ready Boost.
Although I'm curious why you have to have two IE windows open as well as Chrome.
