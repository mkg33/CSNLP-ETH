I have port forwarded my router to access a device on the local network via the internet.
-> From the device, I connect to "myproject.host.com/findMyIP".
With this setup, I am able to access my device without any issue.
My aim is to access the device using its global IP address, without having to set up port forwarding every time I use a different router, or when I use a hotspot.
-> I try communicating to the device using the IP address obtained from the above step.
This may be preferable if you wish to share the service with others.
This usually shows the device IP to be of the form 10.xx.xx.xxx.
Ultimately, the router knows that the packet is destined for the device if either there exists a rule (such as a port forwarding or DMZ), or if it has seen the device send a relevant packet the other way first.
Lets say that the domain given by noip.com is abc.noip.org, and the forwarded port is 9050.
The IP address is actually the address of your router's WAN network interface, because of this, the router has no idea that a new incoming connection is actually meant for your device on the router's LAN.
Ultimately, the options above are less preferable to port forwarding and only should be considered where you have no control over the router.
Many different methods for connecting to a server behind a SNAT exist, however one of my favourite is pwnat by Samy Kamkar since this does not require a third-party server, however, this will require that the client also connects using pwnat.
Alternatively, if you have a publicly accessible server, you can set up a SSH reverse tunnel.
Lets say the URL given by the hosting site is "myproject.host.com".
