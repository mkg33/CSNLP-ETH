You may experience the problem that is described in this article if the CcTotalDirtyPages value is close to the CcDirtyPageThreshold value.
May not be your best choice but should solve your problem, where to identify count of dirty pages , you will have to resort to the below steps -
Is there a way to view the number of dirty pages (cached file pages that need to still be written to disk) in Windows Server 2003?
Use the !defwrites command in the kernel debugger.
This command displays the values of the kernel variables that the cache manager uses, and it displays the values of the threshold and of the actual dirty pages that are in the cache.
A little search on the question brought me to this KB article - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920739 -
When you run this command, you may receive output that resembles the following:
In Windows 7, for example, I can use Performance Monitor and use the "Dirty Pages" counter (one of the cache counters).
This counter does not seem to be available in Server 2003.
Also on Windows 7 (and other later systems), I can use Sysinternals RAMMap and effectively see the dirty pages on a file-by-file basis.
