If you can install drivers on the Terminal Server Client machine and you install the Prolific driver, then you can enable Port redirection on the Client and the Port will be available and working correctly on the Server.
The client don't have a native mainboard COM port, but have an USB-TO-Serial adapter (Prolific USB-to-Serial), it is possible redirect this USB-TO-Serial COm Port ?
I have a client(Windows 7 Pro) that make a connection to Windows terminal server through RDP, i have enabled COM port redirection for both server and client side, but the redirection doesn't happen ...
I configured Remote Desktop to make ports available to the remote session.
Now if I connect to any terminal server while allowing ports to be mapped (Options > Local Resources > More.
If you can't install drivers on the client, you will need an external 3rd party software as it was linked by @TheCompWiz
It's not currently possible without 3rd party software.
Check "Ports"), that virtual COM3 will be available on the Terminal Server with no problem.
If you're running 2008r2 and win 7 ultimate, you do have the option to look at remotefx USB redirection... to redirect USB devices... or look at 3rd party software like this.
Windows sees this device as a USB device, not a COM port (yes I understand the irony).
Right next to me is a barcode scanner connected to a Prolific USB2Serial adapter connected to a Windows 7 client (with installed Prolific Drivers).
It did work, however, when I changed the port to COM2.
RDP doesn't currently support remote USB devices (hopefully some day it will).
I don't think the accepted answer here is entirely correct.
I had a USB-based serial port for a credit card reader that I needed to redirect through RDP.
Initially, I had the serial port to COM100 (to easily avoid potential conflicts), and it didn't work.
