Don't use root access unless your sure you know what you're doing.
Make a user or group that can only access files to certain folder, then set to log in to that user by default.
Most people who use such systems do so because they like to be in control of their systems - but "with great power comes great responsibility".
Set the permissions of the folder to "Access Files" rather than "Create and Delete files" for Others, the Group, or Owner; depending on your environment.
If you need special privileges, just elevate from terminal.
In the long run I'd advise what most other admins do...learn not to do it again, keep good backups, and don't run as a user that automatically has rights to delete key directories with a keystroke, but rather use Sudo so you have a slight pause before hitting .
Workarounds tend to cause some confusion down the road unless it's completely documented or they cause additional behaviors that are not welcome (like figuring out why you can't alter config files without additional commands)
I recommend using the Principle of Least privilege.
But, much better, is the the -I option, because it doesn't get in your way that often.
If its not, then there's something wrong with your setup.
alias rm to rm -i in your /etc/profile for system wide or just the .bash_profile in your home directory for just your account.
the /etc directory should only be writeable by root.
And on a non-MAC Unix / POSIX / Linux system root is god.
you may find that many distro's do this by default.
another more simple way to prevent this is setup a normal user account for normal user account things.
You should not be doing things like surfing the web with root.
additionally, I'd suggest  --preserve-root (if it is not yet the default on your system):
