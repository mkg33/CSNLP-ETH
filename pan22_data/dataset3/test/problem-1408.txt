There's a part two also, if you search that blog you'll find it.
While there are a number of reasons logons can be slow I've found that most of the time it's due to various kinds of network mappings that are unavailable at logon.
While you might be able to observe this through a sniffer it's going to be very hard to recognise.
It doesn't necessarily have to be Wireshark, I just need to figure out why some AD logins on my network are so slow and to do so I believe I have to look at what's actually happening over the network.

It's quite possible that you won't find any answers by watching the traffic.
This page seems to imply that Wireshark can only begin capturing after boot, but it looks like someone else has run into this problem before and didn't get anywhere.
The most common being a network share that no longer exists.
If the clients are Windows Vista or Windows 7 then I'd suggest looking in the Group Policy event log.
If the clients are Windows XP then I'd recommend enabling user environment debug logging.
Regardless, I wish you luck solving this all too common problem.
