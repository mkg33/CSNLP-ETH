Since the 7.6 upwards release the only difference between the two versions is the language they are written in.
However functionally and otherwise they are the same.
I manage my iPhone and my complete music library with it as well as running it for a Shared Library across my home network with absolutely no issues.
I use iTunes on both Windows and OSX everyday and apart from the Preferences menu being in a different place have yet to find examples of how they are different.
The mac version integrates naturaly with the mac os with iLife and software update.
Vista laptop is driving my living room stereo as I type.
iTunes on the Mac is written in Objective C with Cocoa and the Windows version in C++.
On windows, software update is a different application in itself.
Recently, I moved over to using Macs at home (I still work on Windows) and iTunes really fits well into the OS and feels natural.
OSX has always rendered fonts differently from Windows.
iTunes now runs much better on Windows than it used to.
Other than a few install options and os specific features/code, no, they are not much different.
My experience as a long time Windows user is that iTunes used to install a bunch of crap that ran in the background and it seemed to cause my systems to have problems.
