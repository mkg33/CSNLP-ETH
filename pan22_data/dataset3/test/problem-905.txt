I've also tried Microsoft's FilterKeys, but the repeat rate seems very inconsistent.
But as soon as I close the program, the rate goes back to 20!
But here's where it gets really weird: lately I noticed that when I start HeidiSQL (no idea why!
Anyway, my problem is that the keyboard doesn't respect the repeat rate I set in the Control Panel (I have Windows XP SP3 by the way).
With my old keyboard I get around 30 chars/sec (which is expected for PS/2), but with my new one, only about 20.
I've tried so many "tips" I found on Google or elsewhere to get the maximum repeat rate, but nothing seems to work.
In fact, I ran a little test by keeping a key pressed in an editor for one minute and counting the number of repeated characters I get.
I've always had PS/2 keyboards in the past, but the new computer I bought has no PS/2 input, so I had to get a USB keyboard (it's a "HP USB standard keyboard").
I set it to the maximum, but it really feels slower than it was with my old PS/2 keyboard.
Maybe HeidiSQL does some strange initialization with the keyboard or something like that.
I ran into a very weird repeat rate problem with my new USB keyboard.
But it shows that there is a way to set the speed up to 30 cps with my current keyboard.
It just doesn't work if I do it via the Control Panel.
), the repeat rate suddenly goes up and reaches the expected 30 cps.
Any idea how I could get the maximum repeat rate of my USB keyboard without resorting to leaving HeidiSQL running all the time?
