I have cables setup exactly like this in my environment because I tend to work on other people's PC's at my desk and I'm too cheap to buy a KVM for something I only use a couple times a year.
Another not very expensive option is to buy an extension cable.
Run this from your video card to and area on your desk that's easy to get to, and plug the monitor into the extension cable, You can get DVI, HDMI, VGA extension cables (Male to Female or M/F) fairly cheap from monoprice.com  If you go this route you "might" want to turn off the monitor and PC when switching the monitor cable from the extension cable to the friends PC.
I would definitely go the dual input route if your monitor supports it.
If your willing to take a slight quality loss, go with a simple mechanical VGA switch, something like this: http://www.allaboutadapters.com/2vgamasw.html
(I've done it 1000 times without turning it off, but due to different electronics and their sensitivity to ESD (static discharge) I'd be giving you bad advice to keep them turned on.
It's neater and you have less connections to troubleshoot if something goes wrong.
If it is this model Then it supports both DVI and HDMI - which means that all you'd have to do is switch between the input modes on the monitor itself.
A pair of extension cables is pretty inexpensive when compared to a KVM (Keyboard Video Mouse)
I assume the monitor itself doesn't have dual inputs?
The thing with these switches is that you can use them in reverse as well.
You can use them to switch one video source between two monitors or two computer sources between one monitor.

I have had great luck with their cabled KVM solutions.
