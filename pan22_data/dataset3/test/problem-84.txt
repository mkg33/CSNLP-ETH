The variable acl_m_sa is set to indicate whether this is a postmaster/abuse message or sent to a user.
Once you've installed clamav you need to uncomment the line in the main configuration reading:
These go in /etc/exim4/conf.d/main/00_local_macros or /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.localmacros depending on the configuration file method you are using.
I believe you need to install exim4-daemon-heavy for scanning to work.
The Exim4 Specification includes a chapter on Content scanning at ACL time that should get you started.
The easiest way to do scanning is to create a local data acl /etc/exim4/acls/40_local-config_check-data like this.
This will be in /etc/exim4/conf.d/main/02_exim4-config_options if you are using the split configuration, or /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template if you are using the single configuration file option.
This is documented in the notes for the sa-exim package.
The guidelines may be rather old, but the setup process hasn't really changed.
You may prefer using sa-exim rather than the EXISCAN portion of the ACL above.
