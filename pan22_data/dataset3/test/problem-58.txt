Aside from the last 4-5 months of research and my limited experience managing our local Windows Server 2008, I am relatively inexperienced when it comes to networking.
I have been researching and trying for months to get connected over the internet to this instance and have been unsuccessful at mapping a single drive.
It serves files stored by other users and by applications with user permissions, ect.
Using Office 365/Exchange Online to replace on-prem Exchange servers is probably the most famous and common example of this.
Just because you are using server on-prem for a service doesn't mean you want to replicate that server in the cloud.
Our 2008 server essentially has a file drive that all users on the network can map a drive to as a network location.
I am really looking for a good guide of what to do.
The problem I am encountering when trying to do this with an instance on the cloud is that the server is no longer connected to the same network, so it must be opened up over the internet.
(I am familiar with tools like server manager, windows server essentials, ect but not with specific services like AD, Direct Access, VPN, ect.)
This opens up a whole can of worms with security and networking.
However it has proven more difficult than expected to replace all the functionality.
my company purchased a Windows Server 2016 instance with AWS in order to replace our current Windows Server 2008 (which resides in a closet in our office).
Step by Steps are better than high level constructs.
One thing to be aware of when migrating services to public cloud offerings is that it's usually not best to go one-for-one VM to VM.
