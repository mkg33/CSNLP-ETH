There is provision to use ldap over SSL as well, but currently we are not using that.
As per instructions from the product vendor, we have changed the following properties to use ldap -
These are the only configuration changes done on our (client) side; and in fact the only changes done.
However, if we do use SSL, additional changes have to be made to the following properties:
We also need to make changes in the casAuthConfig xml file for the following properties (as anonymous search is not supported): 1. anonymousReadOnly, value is set to false 2. java.naming.security.authentication, value is set to simple
As the business requirement is that of authentication with Active Directory using LDAP, we have to modify the CAS properties file.
After restarting cas to reflect the changes, we encounter the error of bad credentials, although the values entered are correct:
I am working on a third party Java application for which I need to authenticate its users using Active Directory.
The application has one of its component as CAS, which is currently configured to use database as its authentication handler.
For the newer version, the vendor has laid out some steps to modify/configure the application files to connect with the AD server, and which are expected to help us authenticate.
This application is hosted on RHEL 6.5, and uses LDAP to authenticate with Windows Active Directory.
Nothing has been added/modified on the server (AD server), except another user, but that has no impact on the existing setup.
The AD server has been set up, and is working fine with an earlier version of the application (which was configured to enable the integration).
When we enter the credentials - username: abcd, password: samplepswd, we are able to login successfully.
