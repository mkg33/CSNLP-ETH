First thing I would check is the Hard Drive's health.
The other thing i actually had on my Windows 8.1 Update 1 is that Superfetch service was over-killing my HDD to 100% most of the time
Then open a CMD prompt and check the SMART status.
Check your background disk-intensive activities (file sharing/serving, disk indexing - especially image collections indexing) to avoid excessive load on the disk subsystem; possibly, do a through malware scan to see if it is some little pest running and bogging down your disk performances.
Since Ubuntu and Windows are experiencing the issue - drivers are not at fault.
If you see a poor health status - you found your issue.
Seems your HDD is Old and Slow try to get a better one
By the way this service is for ReadyBoost, and if you use ReadyBoost, you must NOT Disabled/Stop it!
working directories - but stay for HDD for the bulk of the data as SSD are not yet nearly competitive in terms of pricing per GB.
If the drive is in IDE mode things will crawl regardless of drivers installed.
And look up for Superfetch > Right Click > Properties > and set to Disabled
(NOTE: if you have a bad drive defragmenting it before checking the SMART status can essentially shred your data).
see Victoria HDD to Check HDD Health, this is a Low-Level tool, so careful some when you use it
you can turn off that service by Running the following command in a Command prompt, you can open a command prompt by press  Windows  +  X  and then Clicking on Command Prompt (Admin) , running without administrator permissions won't work :
This service starts everytime on boot, so if you got the problem fixed, you might wanna disable it permanently, open:
Go for SSD for system, software, swap (only if you plan to run memory intensive applications, otherwise modern machines' RAM is more than enough to avoid using swap at all), and for the data you access more often - i.e.
Check the BIOS for AHCI mode - yes you can change this after the OS is installed.
You will find the setting under Advanced in the BIOS computer setup menu.
also, HDD actually self-die over time, so a Core2Duo Laptop might be used a lot, and also, laptop Drops/similarities may cause a severe HDD damage.
Check your disk SMART statistics to check if it is healthy - regardless performances, it is a good practice every now and then to preserve your data.
