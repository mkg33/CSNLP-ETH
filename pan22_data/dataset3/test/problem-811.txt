But also slightly hint that you may buy an array or solution from a vendor.
Nexenta offers a good solution to build a storage system utilizing ZFS.

From my experience for that kind of production, I would recommend going with RAID5 SSDs since the implementation efficiently utilizes storage being still performant.
Some of your comments hint that you plan on building up some kind of home grown system to handle your office's needs.
ie:  deduplication, various compression options, snapshots, replication (to another pool or system for backups), ...  Another thing to consider with ZFS would be using larger non-SSD drives and adding a SSD for a read or write cache.
I agree with @pming on looking to use ZFS as a filesystem.
Also, the setup minimizes RAID rebuild since fast drives are used.
It'll give you some good options you might be interested in.
For the project, go with hardware RAID in case your production is more about 2-3 hosts and software RAID for 4+ nodes clusters.
Also consider using at least RAID6 (raidz2 in ZFS speak) over RAID5 (raidz in ZFS speak) if you go with RAID5 to help prevent dataloss.
