However, for the deepest forays into the theoretical graphics pipeline fundamentals, I would submit that books are still the best way to go.
Get the math down, and the framework you're using (OpenGL, DirectX/XNA, or whatever) will start to make more sense.
And another one that just came up but looks nice, Matrices ARE your friends.
In addition to the two links David Lively provided, there's an MIT Opencourseware graphics course here.
I am particularly fond of "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics, 3rd Ed," and "The Geometry Toolbox" (the latter is primarily a discussion of the linear algebra behind the graphics and not so much the graphics itself, though).
You can also find a fair number of references -- of perhaps unknown quality -- by searching for "computer graphics pipeline" and omitting specific references to APIs.
The thing to remember is that while references may show you how to set matrices with API-specific alls, nothing about the form or values in those matrices is API-specific -- it's all just math under the hood, and you can make it do whatever you need it to.
I have found that the D3D SDK documentation does have a reasonably good, and relatively API-agnostic overview of the transformation pipeline.
