I suspect that this is related to DHCP lease expiry but wouldn't that stop internal network traffic too?
They're having repeated problems where 1 or more clients lose internet connectivity.
(I'd love to recommend that they invest in some proper business grade tech but they don't have the budget so I am left to try and resolve with what they have.)
That gateway can connect to the internet but the hosts can't.
During these times all clients/servers can connect internally without issue, all clients and servers can ping the modem/router but can't connect out over any protocol (web, email or ping).
The customer had been restarting everything every time to resolve but the issue is actually resolved by performing a DHCP renew on the affected device.
Currently working with a small business which is using an ISP supplied domestic ADSL modem/router to connect their internal setup to the internet and this is also being used for DHCP.
In summary during the fault time all 192.168.1.0/24 hosts can connect with each other and to the gateway (192.168.1.1).
Unfortunately this domestic modem/router doesn't have much of an interface but during these episodes I can ping to a public IP from the router web console.
