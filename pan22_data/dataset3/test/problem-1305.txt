This seems to slow down my startup every time, be it a restart, crash or simply startup, by almost exactly one minute.

You should check that the delay does not come from a boot time or system driver with higher priority (parent driver).
Right after the error log, there's an information log, also with source set to Service Control Manager.
So you can exclude all drivers started in safe mode from check.
"The DAM is a kernel-mode driver that is loaded and initialized at system boot if the system supports connected standby."
My PC is a self-build, all updates are installed, running Windows 8.1 Pro.
(Having my Windows set to English I'm unsure why there's a German word included but well...)
Apparently - according to the system event-log - a service hung on startup.
Google has some sources for Windows 2000 and other outdated ways... does anyone know how this could be fixed ?
It seems that the self-build hardware allows connected standby and the kernel is trying to load the driver before any user process is started.
I'm experiencing a problem when my computer starts.
