Instead of making sure that it is very hard to prove your site that one is a legit user, you have to make sure that every spamming account that comes through is dealt with using harsh methods.
But captchas are a double-edge sword: a simple one will get broken by sophisticated bots (that use neural networks and other hi-tech approaches), a very complicated captcha will become an annoyance for regular users.
As suggested by other people, having a captcha is a thing to be considered.
Now I just have to finish pruning the thousands of messages and accounts that were already in the moderation queue!
- if not, definitely do so it should help a fair bit.
While User-Agent can be faked, not everyone who is spamming knows about it and does it.
Just add the this mod and it takes care of almost all spam registrations:
Use some kind of phpbb mod that gathers details about accounts registered from same IPs, collects User-Agent headers etc.
Chances are low that you would get legitimate users from there.
I had luck a couple of times with complaining to the hosting company that they host the notorious spam software XRumer.
The only thing I have found effective (and it has been almost entirely effective) is http://stopforumspam.com/.
While many advanced spam bots can use multiple proxies, very often script kiddies skip using them, because they don't have a proxy list.
Instead of using reCaptcha (which reportedly has been broken by bots now), I upgraded my phpBB forum to the latest version last week and then configured it to use a Q&A captcha with a few custom questions defined (in additon to requiring activation by user emails, and moderation all new users until they have a few approved messages), and haven't had a single spam account be registered so far.
Instead of blocking, you could redirect them to a honeypot.
It didn't work every time, perhaps because certain hosting providers never received a critical mass of complaints that would motivate them to do something.
If you see some clear signature in the spam messages about the app that was used to spam, please fight back.
I've got answers like "we are aware of it, since we've got complaints from other people" and the hosting account was soon canceled.
If you see many abuses from an IP that is geolocated to a foreign country that has little to do with your forum, block the whole network at firewall level.
