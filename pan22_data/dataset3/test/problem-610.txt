If you edit the header section of the document, it should bring up a "design" tab in the ribbon.
I've found out that inserting "Section breaks" instead of "Page breaks" at page endings did help out to split the document into different sections.
This way you still keep a TOC and page numbers which track the whole document but can break the headers into different rule zones.
I've found that I have to force the page numbers on some of my documents to get it to work with TOC.
Select the Page Number button on the left and click on format page number.
My main problem after this was that I didn't wanted the first and second pages to have the headers.
Then put the page number that it should be, and exit the header edit mode and it should update correctly in TOC.
This solved the "same page number problem" for me.
I had the same problem today and after some trials I deleted my headers completely, copy-pasted the headers from our template, and inserted "Page Numbers" at the top of my page from the "Header and Footer Tools" tab.
