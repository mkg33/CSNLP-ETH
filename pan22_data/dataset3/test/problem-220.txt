(sorry for the crap formatting.. editor is being wonky for me)
Most of them report things like normal behaviour from midnight until noon and DNS failures from noon to midnight.
Compare that with the four NS records you list above.
One of the moderators is experiencing this kind of error and sent me the following dig output:
They are also under corporate networks and are unable to change their DNS server settings.
I also have no idea where these ns-service.net come from and why some DNS servers reply with them.
Until you sort out your delegation, via your registrar, I'm slightly surprised your zone works at all.
There is disagreement between the whois and your own NS records:
Here, using google's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 the error never occurs and the output is
(And I also believe that solving this kind of problems by suggesting client-side settings changes isn't an elegant solution for a large-ish website)
The only DNS configuration I have access to is that the nameservers I should use are ns1.clubecetico.org and ns2.clubecetico.org.
;; Received 145 bytes from 193.164.133.22#53(ns1.clubecetico.org) in 102 ms
Is there any server-side thing I can do about this issue?
So then ask your own nameservers for the nameservers:
Since then, our users reported intermittent DNS failures.
In thecpanel` DNS setup, I added an A record with the server's IP.
I manage a VPS which hosts a forum and recently we migrated from one physical VPS host to another in the same company, with a downtime of about 48h and all configuration was made with cpanel full account backups.
But I really think that there's something missing because I'm not sure if the DNS client can query ns1.clubecetico.org to obtain the IP of clubecetico.org.
The whois information generally records the delegation information that your registrar will be putting into the .org zonefile, which will control which servers are asked for information about your zone.
