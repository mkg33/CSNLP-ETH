As Igal mentioned above, the reason that ping works against the FQDN is because of the round-robin A-records of domain controllers.
I'm guessing that your DNS suffix isnt correct on the client you're using ping from, as it fails to guess wich TLD "mydomain" is under.
The reason that pinging directly for mydomain.com is that you have an a record in your dns for the address mydomain.com.
Your local machine query the dns for hosta ( and fail) then try to append the domain name so it query for hosta.mydomain.com and every thing is fine.
I can get it working on one of domains who are named "lan.domain.com", but not a domain called "domain.local".
BTW, pinging the NETBIOS names of individual machines - including the DCs works fine.
You local machine should not ( and does not) append the top level domain (e.g com org) to the dns query.
EDIT: Actually, this only works if your AD domain is in 3 parts or more.
If you're not running wins, it won't know how to find the netbios name just like you mentioned.
Please run ipconfig /all and double-check "DNS Suffix Search List".
As part of testing I've discovered that I can't ping the netbios name of the site.
We are not using WINS - but internet searching seems to indicate that is only needed when trying to ping a NETBIOS name across different subnets - we are not doing that.
your machine query the dns form mydomain and fail then try to append the domain name so it query for
The dns and ping behavior in your domain are normal and usual.
Pinging is for machines not for doamins (who should answer the pinged domain?).
I don't know your exact domain name but here is what is probably happening.
and you have in the domain hosta.mydomain.com hostb.mydomain.com etc.
I've got some general slight network errors on a network.
