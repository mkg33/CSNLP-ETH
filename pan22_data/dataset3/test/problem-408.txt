Make /home/site1/public_html the root directory of site1.com in your Apache config.
I feel it's better to put the web root in a subdirectory of /home/site1, rather than in /home/site1 itself, to keep the site1 user's dotfiles and other potentially sensitive bric-a-brac out of there.
I have added a user named 'site1' to control site1.com.
Do the following as root (assuming the site1 user and home directory have already been created):
But the apache server runs on the www-data user, which will not be allowed to perform in actions on /home/site1.
I have Ubuntu 10.1 installed and I have setup Apache2.
I know I should change the root folder in my apache config to be /home/site1 for site1.com
This should allow Apache to have full access to it.
I am going to host about 4-5 websites on this machine, so I need to have a user that controls files/permissions for each website.
How do I add permissions for www-data to the necessary folders?
This creates the directory public_html and makes it readable and writable by the www-data group.
If I am getting this right, you need to change the owner of the
Any files or directories created there will also be owned by the www-data group, because the SGID bit is set on the directory.
