I am able to resolve and access the website just fine.
When submitting issues like this, always run ping as well as traceroute, and include both results.
Do ping and tracert have a place in your network toolkit?
If you can't ping it then you are probably blocked somehow.
The same goes for a lot of intermediate routers of a lot of ISP's.
Can they both be a red herring and lead you down the wrong troubleshooting path?
Ping and tracert are only good as general connectivity tests if you know that the target should respond.
Tracert is a better tool for detecting general network routing issues but can't tell me much about why I can't get to a web site, again because ICMP may be blocked somewhere along the path.
My ISP, router or web server may block ICMP but happily serve HTTP.
As @Michael Hampton said, traceroute is your best friend.
Yes, and I think they often do for those who don't understand what ping and tracert can actually tell us and when they're appropriate to use as connectivity diagnostic tools.
The problem with ping and tracert is that they are not service diagnostic tools.
Hurricane's webhosting servers don't respond to traceroutes.
