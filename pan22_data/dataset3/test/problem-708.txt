I tried resetting winsock, clearing arp cache, renewing and resetting/releasing leases via ipconfig.. nothing worked.
Anyway as soon as I try to connect to other pcs in the network expecting it to have that address, the connection results from 169.254.xxx.xxx where the xxx part is variable.
I reserved the ips by associating them with the MAC address in my home router and everything is working fine except for one wi-fi laptop.
I'd like to assign it a 192.168.1.9 ip so I did the same in the router and now the laptop says, with ipconfig, that the IPv4 address is 192.168.1.9.
I'm trying to assign static IPs to all the Windows pcs in my LAN network.
If you are using WiFi, disable the internal NIC to make troubleshooting easier, or vice versa.
I have a strong suspicion that you set a static IP address on the wrong interface.
One being the wired LAN interface and the other being WiFi.
I did read around that this is a sign of laptop making its ip address up since there are problems communicating with router DHCP, but then why does ipconfig show the correct one?
