Here is a good overall troubleshooting walk through to narrow down the problem:
However, that experience has all been with Rogers in Canada
some comcast cable modems have a backup battery and they memorize the MAC of the last device that was plugged into their Ethernet port.
Are you waiting for even the connection phase to finish?
If you have a 0.0.0.0 issue, have you even tried checking the drivers/settings on the computer?
I've gone through various combinations of cable modems, routers, computers, and apartments in my life, and one thing has always puzzled me.
I dread the days when I need to unplug my modem or router, because it usually results in something like this:
Why is it so difficult to get these things to connect to the internet?
Are you waiting for the router to fully initialize?
If you unplug a PC and plug in a router you also have to push the reset button on the cable modem to get it to accept the router MAC instead of the PC MAC, or you have to clone the PC MAC to your router.
I have often found that if you plug in the cable modem and give it a minute or so to fully boot and get the necessary IP info, then power up the router, things go more smoothly.
For me, when ever my internet goes down (most likley due to my el-cheapo router) I simply unplug everything, wait a minute, plug in in my router, wait for it to initialize, plug in in my cable modem, walk to my computer, and go to google.
Is this reproducible with other routers (borrow one if you have to)?
This has worked on two networks, one with 3 computers over wireless and wired, and another with 7 devices over wireless and wired and a vonage middleman device.
Is there a foolproof technique that I'm not aware of?
Once I'm connected, they work great, but establishing the initial connection is always painful.
