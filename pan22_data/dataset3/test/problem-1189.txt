Protocols may vary between your router and mine so you might need to substitute them with yours

wlan0 interface is set to connect to a hidden network directly for getting your own psk value which you can see the long thing at wpa-psk type:
The wifi network it needs to be on is on a hidden SSID that has no password for WEP or WPA (security is done through other means), and it needs to setup for a static ip address.
This is suppose to be a very lightweight install, so I rather have the setup done through the /etc/network/interface and /etc/wpa-supplicant/wpa-supplicant files if possible and not use any external network manager for it.
I am connecting a raspberry pi to help a friend of mine.
I can't have access to the router to make it static though DHCP configs, and the gui applications the pi comes with can't seem to handle hidden networks.
