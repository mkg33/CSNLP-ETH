Incidentally this same logic holds up for distributing across multiple rooms or colocation facilities...
Not unless the data center is not up to snuff regarding power distribution/delivery, power protection, and cooling
While it's technically true that a higher work load will consume more power and generate more heat, in a properly powered and cooled data center this shouldn't be a concern.
Ideally, you will have more than one phase available for power in each rack, so you can evenly distribute the power load over multiple legs in the same rack.
Note that there ARE benefits to distributing your environment the way you described from a power perspective, but not for the reasons you seem to be intuiting (In the event your datacenter was poorly planned and racks need to be re-powered to even out load across the phases it's often helpful to have your gear separated into self-sufficient racks so you can fail over to one half of your nice, redundant environment while the other half is being re-powered by the local electrician).
You should also plan for heat removal under maximum load.
While there is certainly no benefit to keeping database servers physically close to each other (assuming all other things are equal), your data center design should not limit your ability to do so.
For example, redundant power supplies in your database servers.
If it does, you have larger problems that could potentially manifest somewhere else down the line.
Yes - it might make sense to colocate master and slave database-servers:
If you use a direct crossover-network-cable for the replication traffic.
I tend to setup one of the power lines for each server running through a local UPS as well.
I would suggest addressing this by bringing redundant power to each of your racks versus moving servers physically from one rack to another.
