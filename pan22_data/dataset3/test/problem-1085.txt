Let's start by declaring a new member variable to keep hold of the parsed IP address:
We'll use this field in the methods that result from splitting up your monolithic function into several helpers, leaving us with the following:
Note that it would have been possible to set the instance variables (_broadcastListeningSocketand _broadcastSocket) directly from the helper methods, instead of returning a new Socket, however I find the above implementation more expressive because we seperate the concerns: The helper methods know about how to create a configured Socket, while the method that calls them knows about what they have to be assigned to.
Unfortunately, I'm unable to comment about the actual options you are setting since
What to do if you find out you need to set the options differently?
So, while I can do nothing about the first point (someone with more experience will have to help you out), we can certainly remedy the second problem by refactoring your code into a more readable form with less duplication.
