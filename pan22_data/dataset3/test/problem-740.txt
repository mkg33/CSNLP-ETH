The only real solution is for Microsoft to either:
by double click) you should transcode it to whatever the default encoding is that Excel prefers.
Ultimately it depends on how often you are receiving / creating these files, the best workaround to deal with this issue would be to create the files in the default encoding Excel expects, so you can just double click to open.
Otherwise a python solution is trivial, but again more work
Just open the CSV file in Notepad and click on "Save as" in the file top menu.
Other workarounds are less elegant and rely on manipulating the file:
Then in the Save as dialog box choose UTF-8 and save the file.
I had exactly the same problem you described when trying to use Excel 2010 to read UTF-8 MySQL data with multi-line Japanese text in some fields exported as quoted CSV with \r\n used for end-of-record (tried \r and \n also with no difference in Excel's behaviour).
Use LibreOffice to open the file, then save in desired format:

If you can control the creation of the file (or ask the creator to create it with the desired encoding), then it's easy.
To use the standard method of just opening the file (e.g.
If you created the file programatically you could edit it to omit the newline characters, if you received it from elsewhere it would be trivial to write a python script to strip the newlines characters out.
(HINT: you can find out which encoding Excel is expecting by opening the Text Import Wizard and seeing what the preselected option is)
To use the Text Import Wizard you would have to remove all the new line characters from your CSV file.
LibreOffice 4.1.3 imported the CSV file correctly, and I could save it in Excel 2010 xlsx format and thereafter open the xlsx file correctly in Excel.
Now you can open the file with Excel with UTF-8 encoding.
