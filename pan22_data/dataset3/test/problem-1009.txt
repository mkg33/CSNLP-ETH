As this isn't done all that often, It's unlikely you'll be able to use there nice automated forms, and will have to contact support directly.
This is about a glue record and isn't anything to do with reverse DNS.
If you want srv01.kaareskovgaard.net as a nameserver you'll need to give the IP as well as the hostname to your registrar.
Next when you go to your registrar and change your nameservers, you will enter srv01.kaareskovgaard.net, because the nameserver is on the same domain, you will then be asked to enter the IP of the nameserver.
If they do allow you to do this on a form and don't reject it if you don't give the glue record, you'll be wanting to move registrar.
To do this, you firstly need to have NameServer records setup on your own DNS server for srv01.kaareskovgaard.net.
It can point to the same DNS server, although best practice is to have a second backup DNS server for your sendon nameserver, but obviously if this is a hobby then its not neccasery.
You would also usually have 2 name server records, your registrar may require this, so you may want to setup srv02.kaareskovgaard.net as well, this should preferably point to a different IP to the first one.
