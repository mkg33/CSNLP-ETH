You need to make sure that the router running the DHCP server is set up with the right DNS address.
In a network like yours with two routers, typically you would only run one DHCP server.
I have a cable modem+router (let's call it A) and an RJ-45 cat 6 cable which originates from A and goes to another router (B).
Additionally, the ISP may have made that setting unchangeable.
Also be aware that you might have some clients that don't use the DNS address supplied by DHCP: either ones that have static IP addresses and don't use DHCP at all, or ones that have been configured to over-ride the address given to them by the server.
If your devices are connected to router B, then changing the DNS entries there will change the DNS on all devices connecting to that router.
In addition to this, I have explored all the possible settings of A and the default dns address in A's settings seems unchangeable.
You need to check the DHCP setup on both your routers.
So, should I change the dns settings of router A or B in order to achieve this?
If you arent using the ISPs for anything other than the modem, it may be possible to disable the router functionality altogether, leaving it is purely a modem.
With two DHCP servers running, a client could potentially connect to either one, regardless of which router's wifi it is linked to.
It's also possible that you have DHCP servers enabled on both routers.
Most of my wifi enabled devices use B's wifi netowrk.
This is assuming the devices are are set up to get DNS from the router, which they would be if they are set to DHCP.
Normally, when a client connects to wifi, it gets the address of its DNS server from a DHCP server (at the same time it gets its IP address).
As for your ISPs router, without knowing the make and model, no one can tell you if the DNS is changeable.
This will also show which DNS server the client is using.
In Windows, you can see which DHCP server a client used by typing ipconfig /all at the command prompt.
Before doing this, make sure you note down how the DHCP server on router A was configured, so you can set up router B the same way.
I want to change to a specific DNS server for all my dns queries that come at B, from the default DNS service provided by my ISP.
If you really can't change the DNS setting on router A, you might be able to disable its DHCP server, and just use the DHCP server on router B instead.
