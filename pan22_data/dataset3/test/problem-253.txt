You can increase this number by hosting Service Fabric across multiple regions:
This seems a little strange that i use a stateful service in azure service fabric which is supposed to be a distributed service mesh framework and the availability of the services built is so low.
Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSSs) don't have a SLA of their own:
This would give you system availability close to four nines, i.e.
Multiplying these two figures together you get, 99.985%, this is still kind of low, but higher than your 98% figure above.
In terms of the storage calculation, there are several parameters here:
Do I need to consider the number of replicas in my calculations in which case I have as many VHDs as replicas ?
Going by the answers in the question above, is my applications availability 99.95 % * 99%  = 98.9505 % ?
I have a service fabric application which has a stateful service which stores the data in the disks of the VMs themselves.
The above statement points to the fact that VMSSs are just an orchestration layer over the top of Virtual Machines and as you quite rightly pointed out results in an availability for a VMSS of 99.95%.
I have looked at the question and answer in How do you calculate the compound Service Level Agreement (SLA) for cloud services?
With the above two assumptions your storage SLA is 99.9%.
Service fabric relies on underlying Virtual machine scale set's availability, which is 99.95 %
