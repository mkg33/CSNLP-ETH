If configured correctly (perhaps in the default install?)
Is there anything similar for Debian based systems?
it will show up when you enter a command that isn't installed.
On RPM based systems they have the whatprovides option rpm -q --whatprovides /usr/X11R6/bin/xclock which will find the correct package.
Ubuntu has a command-not-found utility which will tell you which package to install to get a specific command.
This allows you, quite similar to apt-get, to just search for files in packages.
If the package is installed, you want dpkg -S /path/to/file.
Frequently I know the name of the command line program that I need but I don't know the name of the package that provides the program.
Ubuntu, as does Debian, comes with the apt-file application.
If the package isn't installed, then use the apt-file utility (apt-file update; apt-file search /path/to/file).
This will work if the Ubuntu maintainers haven't changed that much compared to the original Debian version.
If you're lucky, you can also use the interface at the bottom of the Debian packages site.
How do I find the name of the package that contains the program that I need?
You can also use apt-cache search [file] to check the local caches for the app.
