Obviously I don't want my mouse to be consuming the battery, while the computer is off.
I like to refer to this problem as "Mouse Insomnia".
One reason is, so that you can power on the computer, via USB devices, such as by pressing a key on the keyboard.
The problem doesn't reside in your computer, but rather in the mouse.
For my stationary, I was able to adjust this setting in the bios.
This is done so that the Power key on some keyboards can be used to turn the computer on.
He is clearly not asking why the light is red, or any technical details about how a mouse stays on, because it is being powered.
A lot of computers these days leave power to the usb devices.
It clearly shouldn't be on, when the computer is off.
If I plug in a Logitech MX Revolution to that port, it stays off.
It is blatantly obvious, that what he is asking, is why his laptop (or OS), keeps powering his mouse, when he turns it off.
The optical mouse's LED stays on because the mouse itself is still being powered.
This is one way for the computer to know it needs to wake up.
For example, on my USB ports, if I plug in speakers that power themselves through USB, the speaker power light stays on when my computer goes to sleep.
Another is, that you can keep charging devices, such as your phone/tablet, while the computer is off.
I have found that changing out the USB mouse fixes this.
There are several reasons, why some computers leave usb devices on, even though the computer is shut down.
Two, there is no standard on how much power is necessary to determine that the device be "lit".
By definition, this is insanity and thus there is little reason to believe there is an actual deliberate pattern.
For my laptop, I still haven't figured out how to change it.
If I plug my wireless keyboard into that front port, the receiver's LED flashes . . .
It is not relevant, if it really bothers him that much.
I have ran across this problem in other people's computers and have come to this one simple conclusion.
Your laptop or PC might have a USB port that supplies power(to charge phones or power devices like a battery bank) to it even though the system is off
Just because the computer is turned off it doesn't necessarily mean the USB power is turned off.
