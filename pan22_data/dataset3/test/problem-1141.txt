A year later someone else removes the tampered cables and puts them back into storage.
You want your installed fiber plant to be labeled correctly at both ends (Strand 1 at Site A = Strand 1 at Site B).
But this only works if your fibres were installed by a sane company.
We have a single straight through panel on site out of hundred of crossed ones.
StarLAN/10BASE-T accounted for this and defined the required signal crossover into the interface variants MDI (used on NICs, routers and such) and MDI-X (used on repeaters, hubs and switches).
Then someone starts flipping calbes somewhere to get the connections to work.
run cable between building terminations straight thru.
In addition to the already present answers here, the reason for copper being generally straight and fiber being generally crossed is fairly simple:
Depending on how the patchpanel is built you can maybe swap the fibres on one side.
Problem is if you have straight cables somewhere, even worse if it is your site-to-site trunks.
From patch panel to device cross tx rx on one side .
With fiber you need to cross transmitter and receiver in any case, so fibers were crossed - no need for defining two different interfaces.
This cabling already existed when Ethernet came along and it was straight through from end to end - analog POTS doesn't care for polarity.
If you can't you have the only choice to define a point of crossing - depending on how your other fibres are setup.
Fiber became popular with FDDI and it was for digital communication from the start.
Common practice would be just to cross everywhere since you will always get an uneven number of crosses which will result in an overall cross.
The major point of the initial twisted-pair Ethernet variants StarLAN aka 1BASE5 and its extremely popular IEEE successor 10BASE-T was the reuse of existing telephone cabling.
