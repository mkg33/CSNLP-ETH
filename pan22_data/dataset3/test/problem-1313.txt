Expanding on @Damien answer, I found this to work as advertised hence solving the issue with original question.
The amount of applications is big and growing (currently more than 20), the size of node_modules folder is usually thousands times bigger than the rest of the project: the size is huge and the amount of files too.
I am also fine with a cron script that searches for the new folders every N minutes and makes them to be ignored.
How to exclude all the node_modules folders within the whole system (like .gitignore but for time machine)?
I simply don't want to add the folder to excluded folders manually all the time.
The tool is open sourced on Github  and you can edit it to suit your needs.
Meanwhile I am developing lots of web applications where the project usually consist of a folder with the application files I want to backup and node_modules folder (external libraries) I don't want to backup.
By default, it scans your file system and excludes all node_modules, .vscode, vendor, .vagrant, bower_components, target, stack-work, Carthage, Pods and .build.
