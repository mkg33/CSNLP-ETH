Also, the user take-on is well put together and makes new user and migration of existing clients relatively painless.
Is anyone successfully running OpenVPN with Active Directory integration?
I have a stack of reasonably modern HP DL320 boxes laying around and that led me to the OpenVPN idea...

I have a very old Cisco Concentrator (3000 series) that needs to be replaced.
I never put it into production, but I did hack together a working script that authenticates users against my directory.

we require AD authentication for our openvn installation(which group/OU integration) and found the easiest was using the radius plugin using windows internet authentication services (i.e.
