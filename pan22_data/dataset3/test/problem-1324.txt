This applies regardless of whether the response you want to send is a redirect or not.
This will allow you to host both domains on the same IP address without relying on SNI.
Lets assume you are moving a site from www.olddomain.com to www.newdomain.com
On the other hand a request for http://www.olddomain.com/ can be responded to without needing any certificates.
The downside of this approach is that many CAs consider multi-domain to be a premium feature and charge accordingly.
Rather than having seperate certificates for the old and new domain it may be better to have a single certificate which covers both domains.
In order to respond to a request for https://www.olddomain.com/ without causing scary warnings you need a certificate that covers https://www.olddomain.com/ .
If your old site used HSTS then nearly all incoming requests are likely to be on https.
Users who just type your site name will likely end up making a request for http://www.olddomain.com/ (unless you are using HSTS) but if your old site previously redirected everyone to https then it is likely that bookmarks and incoming links will use the https url.
