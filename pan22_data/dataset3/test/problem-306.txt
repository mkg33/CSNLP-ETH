has no version pin for the extra-constrained cookbook.
Further, I'm not entirely sure, if all of this practically works good.
As we are, however, we also flip the environment of particular nodes from time to time and restrict production to version latest - 1, I currently experiment with the following that eases the use of multiple environments with the same settings (no guarantee that it really works well, I haven't tried that in production, yet):
If your tests are really lasting for weeks, you might think about applying successful ideas from the software engineering world, like Feature Toggles.
This file (that I upload through knife environment from file) contains some specific constraints, that don't hold for another environment, like pre-production, which i.e.
You have to ensure that every environment depending in production_settings.rb is uploaded, once this is changed.
Finally, the production_settings.rb (the parts common between all of these environments (for me, I'm only speaking of production and pre-production, not many more)) can look like this:
You know that you can also add data bags and also other fake nodes to your cookbook to test code that uses such search queries?
As you know, you then have to be careful, when searching for other nodes in the same environment.
regarding testability without Chef-Server: I seldomly encounter things that I can't test with test-kitchen.
This way, you could switch between the old/new code using such toggles implemented through role attributes or tags in Chef.
