Posting here, as I found a less kludge-y way to do this.
The most recently updated one is ProxyChains, and it's quite straightforward to configure.
I don't know about tunnelling with ssh -D but using something like
You can then do tunnelling by adding a new protocol to subversion with the particular port that the tunnel is on.
if your subversion repository host(s) are named proj1.svn.domain.tld, proj2.svn.domain.tld, etc., then add following to [groups] section:
And then in $HOME/.subversion/servers create a group for subversion hosts you want to check out from, e.g.
You are using SSH to set up a local SOCKS server that tunnels to your SSH server.
After this you should be able to operate on repository normally, as you used to work without SSH tunnel.
to switch the address the working copy is linked with without having to do a new checkout.
In the above example, the svn application was none the wiser that its TCP connects to the Subversion server were redirected down your SOCKS proxy."
To configure ProxyChains you just need to edit $(HOME)/.proxychains/proxychains.conf to have only the following lines:
You can use Polipo to use your SSH SOCKS tunnel over HTTP proxy, by adding following lines to its configuration:
Most socksifiers work in a similar fashion so these instructions should be a reasonable general case.
Or in a nutshell mostly cut'n'pasted from Oliver's page :
Instead of paraphrasing those who have done it before, I'll point you to their detailed explanations :
And finally specify a proxy configuration for the group of the hosts you just added by adding a block for the group:
in the [tunnels] section and then instead of svn+ssh://user@original.com use svn+pssh://user@localhost
Anyway, your problem is that Subversion can connect through a HTTP proxy or an SSH tunnel, but it has no idea about SOCKS.
So you need to SOCKSify Subversion by capturing all its TCP connects and redirecting them to the SOCKS proxy.
With tsocks, you configure it to use the SOCKS proxy SSH sets up then run svn like so:
All you then need to do is 'wrap' svn in ProxyChains.
Debian contains two socksifiers that are also available on sourceforge.
You mention that your reason for doing that is that "local connection is slow" but I fail to see how tunneling to a SSH server will make it faster.
