If you flash the system BIOS, those settings will be reset, but the IPMI LAN settings will not change.
It only affects settings within the IPMI environment, such as LDAP, NTP and any alert notifications you have configured.
If you access it locally you can specify a new password.
So I'm setting user id 2's password to ADMIN which is the default, but you could put any other password there.
Interestingly enough, leaving off the -c option does not cause IPMI static addressing to be reset in the BIOS.
Thank you to Insyte for pointing me on the right track of using ipmitool, after a few searches online I was able to find this working command.
I just had to deal with this same issue yesterday, I was not able to log into my SuperMicro IPMI web interface because I had not used it frequently and forgot the password.
If you normally save the config while updating, simply leave off the -c option yafukcs -full romfile.ima instead of yafukcs -full -c romfile.ima
This simple answer is different than then others which need some other formal OS installed to reset the password.
Boot a thumb drive with the proper IPMI firmware file and the proper flashing utility for your motherboard from SuperMicro's website.
Most of our systems are X8 based boards that have onboard IPMI.
This command worked to reset the ADMIN account's password:
You should consider flashing the system BIOS after the IPMI update, however it isn't required.
Hopefully it will help someone else that stumbles on this question.
The command in Insyte's answer did not work for me but it was close.
If you don't know which channel is your ethernet interface, just page through them one at at time, like so:
If you rarely use the IPMI interface it's possible it's still using the default username/password ADMIN/ADMIN (case sensitive).
If you already have the current IPMI firmware Simply flash it with the same version you already have.
