The following is the algorithm I'm using to determine the XP needed for each level:
Quests that take 50% longer should generally get a 50% boost in XP.
Use the Excel table from before and just add a column for Gold Per Hour.
Killing creatures probably contributes, so subtract out the amount of XP they are expected to gain in an hour of questing before you divide it up.
How much should difficulty factor into the xp for the quest?
So if your TTL increases by 20% between levels, your money gained should increase by MORE than 20% between levels.
Of course, take into account the other XP sources.
Generally the amount of money gained should grow FASTER than the TTL.
If you already have your content made, then you need to determine the points at which you want players to level, and use the amount of XP needed to get them to that level to determine what quests should give.
To use your case for an example, I did these columns in Excel from left to right, in order
Once you have established the GPH gained at each level, you can then use that to calculate the total gold gained in a given level.
After you have established how long a player is expected to be in a level, you can decide how much money they should gain in that level.
How do I balance the amount of gold you get for completing a quest vs the cost of items that can be purchased?
Do people just go by their gut feelings and then try to balance the values through playtesting or are there good rules to follow?
There are multiple ways to come at the question, depending on what you have already decided.
If I know roughly how long it'll take the player to complete a quest, how much xp should I award for that quest?
From that you can determine the curve of the cost of buying items of a given level, depending on the pace at which you want players to replace their items.
You might make Hard/Medium/Easy quest difficulties that get 150%/100%/50% XP respectively.
This process of filling out can be extended all across the creation of the RPG.
Where would I look to get guidelines for how much XP and gold/items to give as rewards for quests?
Come up with a formula for that with a slight exponential growth.
Otherwise it becomes more efficient to grind money by dropping to lower levels, and you don't want to reward tedious behavior.
If you are still making your content, then it is better to determine how long you want it to take to level.
If each quest takes 10 minutes, and you expect a player to take an hour to level, then it should take 6 quests to level.
