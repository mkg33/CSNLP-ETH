It's based on an LSI model, Dell sell an essentially identical MD3000 disk array.
You can build multiple RAID arrays on the DS3200, which would each appear as single disks to the server.
4 The DS3400 is the identical array with a fibre channel interface, it's benchmarked using SPC-1 and SPC-2 here, the performance will be very similar
2 They don't supply 2TB disks for it yet, but they likely will do and it will almost certainly support them
The IBM DS3000 series arrays are pretty good at what they do, they're also pretty dumb compared to most other arrays out there, but they are cheap.
3 Yes, you can put in as many or as few disks, though obviously less than 5-6 it doesn't make much sense to be using it
5 The server's SAS card sees the RAID controller in the DS3200 rather than the raw disks.
6 The full configuration guide is available as an IBM Redbook and includes multiple screenshots
