If it was all the systems, that would be one thing.
I've heard about issues with Advanced Format Hard Drives in collaboration with 7, but am unable to find any real evidence of this.
Although I had a call today to say 8 XP systems have gone the same way as the Windows 7 machines, so I'm now wondering if it's the HDD's.
There is not anything specific in Windows 7 over XP that would cause these issues.
They are all identical hardware, XP is fine but 7 is buggy.
I've heard 7's caching could be the issue, but again haven't been able to confirm this.
What's adding to the confusion is out of 14 new systems, 8 are XP, the rest 7.
Caching is the last thing for me to try this week, after that I'm out of ideas and it's time to call in Microsoft to work it out.
I would highly advise that you invest in UPSs (Uninterruptible power supply) which if you have not heard, are basically batteries for desktops - you can get some models which can connect to the PC and automatically shut down when the power reaches a certain level.
UPS's is something I've looked at, and may end up being the solution.
I think it must simply be either very bad timing or bad hardware that simply fails under these circumstances.
They refuse to boot, I've heard about XP being finicky of AF drives, I guess it is.
