This should start the system with no apps loaded (a barebone, "fresh install" osx).
You can use Tech Tools Deluxe if you have the Applecare - but it's not as good in my experience.
Boot into "single-user" mode by holding down CMD-S at startup.
Run the extended hardware test, it will take several hours so do it overnight.
If Disk Utility won't fix a fault, either re-install OS or use DiskWarrior (budget depending).
Run it a couple of times to be sure (I've had instances where it's fixed issues, I've run it again, and it's found additional issues to fix).
Run "fsck" (File System Check - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsck)
It will spit out a weird code (if it finds a fault), if it had HDD in it - your hard drive's faulty.
If you narrow the problem to a single app, re-install it (use something like AppZapper to clean out the preferences).
Hold that down and eventually your Mac will boot to a command line on a black screen.
and your computer will run through the check (takes a minute or two) and will eventually finish and give you a report of either "ok" or "the file system was modified".
Eliminate hardware errors first - put the system disks in and reboot holding 'd' key down.
I had problems in the past with unpolite applications spamming the logs (hamachiX in primis), so it might be worth taking a look there.
If it does not, add one app at the time and see which one causes it.
Then try running disk utility - it can do a check from a live instance of the OS, if it finds a fault you repair by using the system disks and booting from them holding down the 'c' key this time.
This is a good resource http://www.macattorney.com/ts.html
It might help also to open up a terminal and check if an app is trying to get the cpu undivided attention (i.e.
Then check the console for errors as suggested in another post.
100% usage); if not, note that the behaviour you're describing is often due to
And if you are not able to do it from within the OS, you could boot from an OS X disc and run Disk Utility from there.
Wouldn't hurt to run a Disk Utility check on your drive.
Repair permissions while you're about it, it can't hurt.
If you get this immediately clone your drive with SuperDuper or equivalent.
Open Console.app and take a look at the logs, if there is anything abnormal - a 15megabytes file filled with the logs of just one app IS abnormal, for reference.
