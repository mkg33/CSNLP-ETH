Take a look over here for an interesting overview.
You just have to pay and duties and, of course, VAT.
In Ireland, is is also legal to import US software.
The most restrictive export laws that I've seen is centered around strong encryption.
Lots of software licences prohibit you from doing this.
Similar to you, we have offices in many countries and often we make our purchases in the US due to the lower cost.
You need to check the individual licence because breaching the terms is as bad as using a pirate copy.
The US Government doesn't want strong encryption to get to the wrong place.
Also bear in mind that you may have activation/support/content issues with it being out of its natural region.
The typical Adobe licence has no further restrictions than the standard US export banned countries.
I'm UK based, it's legal so long as you pay import duty and VAT on the software.
It depends on the software and the license agreements, but it many cases it is legal.
I can't comment on importing specifically to the UK though.
