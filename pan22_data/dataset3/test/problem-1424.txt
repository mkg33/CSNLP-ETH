I have a vmware server that host several virtual machines and use the vSphere client to connect to the windows session and I can open a closed tunnel vpn connection out and not lose access to the windows session.
So the end result will be a default route 0.0.0.0/0 to the IP address of the VPN Gateway, and a static route to your machine using the default gateway.
What you have to do is set up a static route to your machine in Computer #2.
In windows what you would do is something like this:
or just a side effect of reconfiguring the network, but I have often encountered it.
This drops any currently open connections and changes the routing behaviour on the server, hence why your connection is dropped.
I had this problem before, and the solution is "split tunneling", this means, send the Internet Traffic to the default gateway, and the traffic to the VPN network using the Tunnel.
Its likely that the VPN client is configured to route ALL traffic down the tunnel, not just traffic to the networks that the VPN routes to.
Check the manual for details, and for how to fix this.
Hard to tell without more information, but many VPN clients have the nasty habit of (logically) deconnecting their host computer from the LAN while setting up the VPN connection.
Whit this information, we can help you up setting the "split tunnel"
If your VPN client does this, obviously your RDP session would be killed as a side effect of cutting you off from the LAN.
I'm not sure why VPN clients do this, whether it's an intentional measure (security?)
if you have physical access to computer #2, connect to the VPN and let us know the routing table of the machine:
I.e., you can be connected either to your LAN, or to the VPN, but not both.
This doesn't solve the specific problem mentioned but this is what I used to solve the same type of problem in supporting a variety of customers using a variety of vpn clients that are not all compatible and some that create a closed tunnel vpn connection.
This will ensure that traffic going to 10.1.1.140 will not be routed to the tunnel.
