The media contains social security numbers of your clients.
How fast do you need access to it, presumably for restores?
You company is now in the NY Times, Wall Street Journal, and CNN's main page.
Are you moving 3 TB offsite a month (a week, a day) or just one time?
Why do you need it off-site, and how are you getting it there?
Disclaimer - I work for Iron Mountain, but not in the divisions that stores tapes or does online backup software.
This way you wouldn't need to take full backups all the time and just sync up data, even daily.
I'm not sure where you're getting 1000$ per month for 3TB of storage, but it costs 360$ per month for 3TB of space over at http://royalbackup.com, though you will have to use free tools as they don't have any branded software to use.
For the best answers, you should fully describe the situation you're in and what a solution needs to accomplish.
The thing to remember is that you pack up all of the cables for storage, as there was once when we brought one back so we could re-image it, and it had used three little short firewire cables (so it was really just 4 disks chained together), and we had to go scrounging for replacement cables to make use of it -- in a disaster recovery situation, that would've sucked.
(I don't have anything more useful to say about this, it's that simple.)
We only run them every couple of weeks, though ... tapes would be easier if you were trying to do this daily.
Without this info, I am assuming you need safe off-site duplicates of your weekly backups.
If you can't get a full backup once a week, look into multiplexing to more than one drive, or backup software or storage deduplication so that you can do synthetic fulls and clone those to tape, for storage off-site with a reputable vendor.
Imagine you're putting it in your car to take to your house for storage.
Backup Exec 2010 with de-duplication option is a good example.
If you want to move things over the Internet in an encrypted fashion, why not use rsync and synchronize to another server?
You said tapes take to long, LT04 you can in theory get 140 MB/s I believe, so that is about 6 hours, and another drive and 3 hours:
Do offsite backup-to-disk with de-duplication (incremental forever) for disaster recovery.
