The millions of SBS installations out there don't seem to be heralding a wave of hacked servers.
You'll be able to configure it to support DHCP etc, and it will secure your web-server in a DMZ, allowing access from both internal and external users with differing security levels.
Edit: To the poster above; same IP subnet but separate VLANS?
- they are a tiny firm, and something I could conceivably setup).
Public aviable services should always be separated from the internal LAN (and above).
Then multi-home the main server so it can see the other subnet, too.
I think you are (or may be) worrying unnecessarily.
If you are just forwarding ports 80 and 443 you're going to have to work to introduce any serious security issues.
This server holds EVERYTHING for the company - their databases, documents etc.
I suppose there is a risk that the next Code Red virus will come along and allow someone to crack the server, but that seems to me a small risk these days.
Should I persuade them to buy a better router (which has to be CHEAP!
They aren't the cheapest around, but are reliable, and full-featured.
is that they have a website hosted in their office (publically accessible via a fixed-IP that is port-forwarded (80 and 443) on their simple Netgear Wifi AcessPoint/Router to their server).
What I was thinking of doing was putting the webserver on a different subnet (say 192.168.10.x instead of 192.168.0.x) and having the router forward 80 and 443 onto that.
I'd convince them to buy a cheap firewall with 3 interfaces (or two interfaces+vlan+a switch).
You can put them on the same subnet and use VLANs.
Fortigate make a pretty simple firewall/router that allows two internal networks, and an external.
Is there a way to configure this sort of thing using RRAS?
However the router cannot forward to a different subnet so I got a bit stuck and ran out of networking know-how.
If you think the web stuff will be a drain on resources, which is unlikey since they're a small company, you could put the web server in and keep it on the same subnet.
After all if you set up an SBS Server you'll find it's (intended to be) available from the Internet so that Outlook Web Access and Remote Web Workplace work.
You won't need to multi-home the main server then, it'll just be connecting internally as before.
Might be a good time to start discussing back-ups too.
I know Linksys has some very cheap business firewalls wich would suit their needs perfectly.
The databases are accessed by the website and internal users with an internal Windows application.
When I found out they were doing this I recommended they move the website to another server (they had a spare one), and keep the public access separate from their main server.
Or would keeping the webserver on the same subnet be ok, if some sort of firewall software were properly configured?
The main server runs Win2k3 SBS and the Webserver I've setup runs Win2k3 Web Edition.
I'm a developer by trade but because I'm therefore an "expert" at all things IT I'm find myself helping out at my wife's office from time-to-time... however I'm pushing my networking knowledge a little here so I was hoping somebody here could help me out a bit.
