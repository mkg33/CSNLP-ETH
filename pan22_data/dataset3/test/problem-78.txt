There are several firmware updates that just recently came out.
Double check that you are currently up to date on your Apple Software Updates (Apple Menu --> Software Update).
But, some disks make a clicking sound once in a while normally,
This is perfectly normal and happens because of aggressive power saving mode.
The smcFanControl application will allow you to set the minimum fan speed.
If "Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible" is ticked, the noise you are hearing is just your hard drive going to 'sleep'.
This happens when there has been no activity, i.e.
2 - http://support.apple.com/kb/DL853    Macbook Pro EFI Firmware Update 1.7
This is not supposed to be a problem (except for the annoyance)
In this case it often seems to alleviate the clicking, at the cost of some steady fan noise.
Some people have apparently had trouble with fans causing noise.
If the laptop has been with you for some time now and
1 - http://support.apple.com/kb/DL893    Hard Drive Firmware Update 2.0 which supposedly addresses this (or something similar)
hdapm allows you to manually send power management commands to the hard drive.
you have just started to hear these clicking noises,
3 - http://support.apple.com/kb/DL832    MacBook Pro SMC Firmware Update 1.3
The noise is coming when the HD parks its reading heads after usage.
The first one, may solve your issue, the others might help alleviate the symptoms, especially the SMC update....
