The drawback is that you need to make a full set of animations for each part, since every hat for example has to move the same in every animation, otherwise some combinations will just look weird.
You split the animation up into the parts that you want to combine and you need to remember a draw order for all those parts for each animation.
You can do the same thing when you use sprite sheets too, but it is slightly more complicated.
You already had the right general idea in your post.
(Since in skeletal animation systems your character is separated into parts anyway).
tl;dr: It is definitely possible and it is much easier if you use skeletal animation.
If you use skeletal animations (like when using spine), then you can easily exchange bits of your character by just replacing the texture of it.
But then you can draw each frame of an animation easily by just combining the parts together.
The long answer is that the specifics of how to do it massively depends on how you handle drawing your characters.
