WITH REPLACE replaces the old DB but I'm not sure if it explicitly searches for those DB pages on disk and tries to overwrite the pages even if the DB is different.
No backup, its almost a zero chance of recovering the original data:
Only thing can help if you have anyone of these like snaphsot, ,mirroring, LOGshipping or replication enabled for that database.
If so, obtain the printouts and get the temps typing.
If the data is only 'marked' for deletion from the OS then you can have a very expensive data recovery center look at it.
I do have to say though, I did have a client recover a QBooks database that way once, and I was really surprised that we got the data back.
If so, get the exported data back from where it went and get those temps typing.
Assuming that you can get these files from before you overwrote them - then create a new database and attach the db and log file to it.
You will most likely still have some problems but you might get some data back.
If so, retrieve the emails (from sent items or from auditing on the email system) and hire some temps to retype the information.
If the sys admin has a process of regularly backing up the location where the database files are stored then you might be able to get some of the data back.
Perhaps the system exports data and sends it somewhere else.
Have not heard, a roll back without proper backups!
Sometimes, and I mean with a lot of money, they can look at the magnetic residue and rebuild something from there but the odds of coming out of there without any issues are probably slim.
You might have used RESTORE .. with REPLACE which REPLACES the data in the database with the data from the backup that you just restored.
You should have backup of the database that you just overwritten.
The database has log and data files that are stored on the file system.
it seems like your only option is a super long shot hail mary.
