Also, if I can't get this to work, does anyone mind hosting a comp stomp?
I right-clicked on the network icon at the topright, went to Edit Connections, selected the Wired connection named "Auto eth0", clicked "Edit...", went to the "IPv4 Settings" tab, and selected the Method "Shared to other computers".
I set up the router to enable port forwarding for 192.168.1.131 (the laptop), but port forwarding still isn't available on the eMac.
Thus, packets coming into the router on port 6112 would be redirected to the laptop (by the router), then to the eMac (by the laptop).
The laptop is behind a router as 192.168.1.131, and the eMac is behind the laptop as 10.42.43.1 .
Because my wireless router's ethernet ports are defective, I set up a shared wireless connection from my laptop (which has wifi) to my eMac (which does not) via a crossover ethernet cable.
I achieved the shared connection through NetworkManager Applet.
I suppose I need to pretend my laptop is a router and configure port forwarding on it, indicating that incoming connections to the laptop (192.168.1.131) should be forwarded to the eMac on the shared connection (10.42.43.1 ).
There's a game I want to play that needs port 6112 forwarded (both TCP and UDP) in order to host games.
Your forwarding rules would be done using DNAT rules.
Consider installing the Shorewall package to configure your routing.
My question is, how would I do that on Ubuntu (in light of NetworkManager's presence)?
I would suggesst starting with the example 2 interface configuration.
