HP servers of Gen 8 variety and lower do not possess such ports.
Also someone mentioned USB 3.0 ports on the motherboard?
The optical SATA ports on this series of HP servers only run at SATA 1.5 speeds, as do the 410/420i SAS adapters when forced into SATA mode.
I wish to retain the SFF bays in SAS mode but need to add a single 10TB SATA III drive; with no ports or available power,this seems impossible... however, I'm adding a secondary pci SAS/SATA controller (the SATA only models are very cheap and have small cache reserves, a good SAS card will still support true SATA III speeds AND offer decent cache amounts) to get around the port limitation; for power, I purchased a spare SFF secondary cage power cable (HP 660709-001) cut the end off it and teased out which lines were 3.3v, 5v and 12v and installed a SATA power port (also added a single atx power connector as well... you never know).
I'm now in the process of modifying the optical drive bay to house the HD directly under the optical drive.
This makes it hard to see any benefit of utilizing that interface, save for the sole reason of having access to the disk.
I am dealing with this issue right now with a DL380p G8.
