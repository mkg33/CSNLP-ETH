: I find curious that a similar question does not exist on this website yet.
I suppose that there exist examples that are not related to polynomial factorization, for instance in other domains such as graph theory or formal language theory.
If you're asking for independent problems, how about:
The motivation of my question is that it is common to say that "there are few problems in $\mathsf{BPP}$ not known to be in $\mathsf{P}$", but I was not able to find a list of them.
Then one either uses the isolation lemma to produce a situation with only one smallest solution, or defines a large corresponding formal polynomial over GF$(2^\ell)$ and uses Schwartz-Zippel to test whether any non-paired term exists.
(There is a previous deterministic algorithm, but its dependency on $|K|$ is exponentially worse.)
There is a particular use of randomness that is fairly common in parameterized complexity, which involves either the isolation lemma, or the Schwartz-Zippel lemma.
of $R$ is deterministically reducible to some decisional problem in BPP, denoted $\Pi$.
I'm not an expert, but perhaps some (not-so-natural?)

When $|K|=O(\log n)$, this problem is in BPP by Björklund, Husfeldt, Taslaman, SODA 2012 (link).
The randomized algorithm runs in expected polynomial time; no deterministic polynomial time algorithm is known; but if BPP=P such deterministic polynomial time algorithm must exist (because it can be reduced to a BPP-decision problem).
The theorem can be extended to general construction problems, for example (see Corollary 3.9) consider the problem of finding a prime in a large enough interval :
Roughly, it involves defining a large enumeration of potential solutions, and arguing that all non-solutions "pair up" (e.g., are counted twice) while the desired solution(s) are counted only once.
examples can be directly derived using the technique of deterministically reducing BPP search problems to BPP decision problems, presented in:
More precisely, I am interested in independent problems, that is whose derandomizations are not known to be equivalent.
In particular see Theorem 3.5: (reducing search to decision): For every BPP-search problem $(R_{yes},R_{no})$, there exists a binary relation $R$ such that $R_{yes} \subseteq R \subseteq (\{0, 1\}^∗ \times \{0, 1\}^∗) \setminus R_{no}$ and solving the search problem
(I'm sure there's a good overview or survey out there, but at the moment it slips my mind.)
That said, I can only think of two cases where this usage would lead to a difference between BPP and P.
For any fixed $c > 7/12$, on input $N$, find a prime in the interval $[N, N +  N^c]$
My apologies if I simply did not find it (or them)!
Thus, one could define the problem "log-Steiner Cycle" (or whatever you want to call it), and it would fit your question.
In particular, if I have to cite problems in this category, I usually cite the factorization of univariate polynomials over finite fields, or the factorization of multivariate polynomials.
and the probabilistic time-complexity of the decision procedure guaranteed for $(R_{yes},R_{no})$.
It's overwhelmingly likely that if you actually had a polynomial algorithm to solve the first of these, you would have a polynomial algorithm for all of them.
The second is a parameterized problem -- find a simple cycle through a set K of specified elements in a graph, i.e., something like a Steiner cycle problem.
Furthermore, the time-complexity of the reduction is linear in the probabilistic time-complexity of finding solutions for $(R_{yes},R_{no})$, whereas the probabilistic time-complexity of $\Pi$ is the product of a quadratic polynomial
What problems are known to belong to $\mathsf{BPP}$ but not known to belong to $\mathsf P$?
For instance, it is known that derandomizing PIT and multivariate polynomial factorization are equivalent and I would count them as only one problem.
But I don't see how to formally reduce any of these to any of the others.
The first is the recent algorithm for Shortest two disjoint paths (author's PDF), Björklund and Husfeldt, ICALP 2014.
