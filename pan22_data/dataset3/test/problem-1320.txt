I then added the following to my sudo configuration:
I created an AD group called LinuxAdmins and I'd like to have a way for people in that group to either be able to su on certain Linux servers without the root password or sudo on those machines using their own passwords.
I keep getting "MYDOMAIN\djsumdog is not in the sudoers file.
I'm using openSUSE 11.4 which has Active Directory configuration built-in to Yast (which does all the pam_winbind, Kerberos, nss, Samba-client stuff for you) and I can successfully authenticate against my AD domain.
And sudo works fine now with the users in that group.
I've tried both single and double slashes for the user and group names.
I know sudo with the user's password is more secure, but I would happy if I could get either su or sudo working by validating the user against his or her AD group.
...and saw that my group was actually MYDOMAIN\linuxadmins, all lower case.
But this doesn't seem to work in openSUSE (even with local users), much less AD users.
The way openSUSE configures AD, it sets the username with the domain prefixed.
I know on my Gentoo box, the following line in /etc/pam.d/su allows users in the wheel group to su without a password:
If I try adding either of the following lines to the sudoers file, I still can't sudo with my user.
But I don't think that will work as the require_membership_of parameter seems to be for the primary authentication against the entire machine.
