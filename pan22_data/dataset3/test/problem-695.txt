Do you keep the counter ON during heavy production loads
CurrentQueueSize:- Number of requests in the queue
Requests Not Authorized: Number of requests failed due to unauthorized access.
Sql Client: Current# pooled and nonpooled connections:- Provides current number of connections, pooled or not.
Requests Total :- Provides total number of requests from last IIS restart.
Though a late answer, I am sharing here what we had done with production environment.
That way you'll have all the data you need when you walk into your manager's office and say "Our peak load has been increasing by X% every week for the last few months, and at that rate we'll exceed our current capacity in about 3 months.
Requests Not Found: The number of requests for resources that were not found.
 Scenario was we had to find out the number of request hits on our web server and how many are served/is there any thread starvation/resource bottleneck occurring or not.
RejectedRequests: Total number of requests rejected from the queue
Which performance counters do you find useful for ASP.Net/IIS 6.0 websites?
For that we used following counters with perfmon.exe
Requests Rejected: Number Of rejected requests due to application request queue was full
As a general rule you should be gathering performance data all the time.
