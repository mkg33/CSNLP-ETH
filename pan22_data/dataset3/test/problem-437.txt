I've had colleagues at work think the photos are real, until they work out the picture is different every time they look at it.
I bought an iPad and ended up using it for exactly this purpose, after two weeks of "oh man this is exciting".
Use a photo based screensaver to show the photos - Picasa has one, but there are others.
I used an old laptop I got for around 50-100 bucks on ebay.
hackaday has a few relevant tutorials, their latest and greatest is as follows:
I'm worried about the hard drive possibly not spinning up next time it gets power cycled.
I took the screen off the hinge and turned it around, if it were a tablet.
Having something flash based to store the photos together with an OS that does good power management and turns off the hard drive when not in use would last longer (and use less power and be quieter).
Edit2: Clearly buying an old laptop is a better option, but this does fit the requirements as you specified them.
Beyond that it became "oh man, in what way is this worth $800?".
In my case, I returned it after 30 days (Colorado law is longer than Apple's 2-week return period) and paid a 10% restocking fee.
Edit: Having reviewed Apple's processes for getting software onto the iPad, I wouldn't exactly call this a "Proper Computer", but if you want to cobble something together and can learn C++ or Objective C, I'm sure you're resourceful enough to figure it out :)
Without USB support, the only way to copy photos on is via rewritable CD.
Used FreeDOS as the operating system, plus a simple slideshow app I found online.

Drop the photos you want to display into the dropbox and watch them come up on the screen.
A bit of a PITA - having it on the network (wired would do, wireless would be better) would be much easier.
I then mounted it inside a shadowbox frame and cut matting to cover up the edges around the screen.
Instead of the photos being locked away in a folder and seldom, if ever, viewed, the photos on the frame get seen.
So, I'd suggest you find yourself an outdated (and therefore cheap) laptop that still works.
Even though the display is only 256 colours, it's good enough.
Took the surround off the screen and laid it on the back of the laptop, facing out.
Also, lots of examples of things others have done on Instructables:
Of course you can get the $500 model instead for around $600, but they're probably showing up on Craigslist by now.
(*) Yes, Linux would work just fine - but I don't have the skills to make that work without spending too many hours learning new stuff.
Set up a DropBox account or something similar, put it on the network and forget about it.
I'd look for one running Windows XP(*) as you get all the good application and hardware support, and there are lots of old laptops that will run it just fine.
Biggest expense was getting a nice wooden frame to mount everything in, so it looked nice.
Have to resize the photos to match the screensize (using Picasa) and upload files manually, but it works a treat.
I turned an old Thinkpad 600e into a photo frame a couple of years ago.
One personal caution: you REALLY want a quality LCD for this, so avoid TN panels like the plague.
