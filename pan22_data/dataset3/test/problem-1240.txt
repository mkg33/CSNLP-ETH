To get a summation of all the absolute values from the raw data, you need to add a new column to the raw data and perform the ABS function there:
Then we create a pivot table and add a Calculated Field AbsValue with the formula =ABS(Value) we get the following result
The formula you've entered in the question can be achieved by using a Calculated Field.
The problem is some of the sales person has the credit note.
I manage to do it by manual enter {=SUM(ABS(B96:B102))} As the image show below.
I would like the sum positive and negative number regardless their sign.
However, if your raw data contains both positive and negative values for a specific sales agent you need to take a different approach.
The above Calculated Field operates on the already summed raw data.
I did try with GetPivotData, but it does not support by range.
I would like to sum up the range of agent total sales.
However, My Pivot table is filter by monthly and product.
Different filtering will have different row records.
If I hard code the formula, it is not flexible as well.
Just define a new Calculated Field for your pivot table with the formula =ABS(Sales Amount) and display that instead of Sum of Sales Amount.
