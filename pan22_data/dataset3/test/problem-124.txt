My own FindFile.exe (this is a self made application programmed using Delphi 7) instead finds 23 files using the same search criteria !
and * characters) either doesn't work at all or has reduced support.
If you are familiar with the command line I would suggest using "dir file_to_search /a /s" or using alternative software like Locate32 (http://www.locate32.net/).
In my downloads folder I have a file called PB_2.22_b006.zip.
I cannot understand why Microsoft's programmers failed to implement the search function properly.
If I go to that folder in Vista Windows Explorer, and then type pb or pb* or anything like that in the search box, it doesn't find that file.
My own FindFile.exe corretly finds the keyword "MediaPlayer" even when it is immediately followed by "_TLB".
Now, here's a bit of opinion backed up by several other commenters on the web...
same extension) and the same attributes (none of them are hidden or system files).
But for some odd reason Microsoft's search utility gets confused about that "_TLB" and fails to find that file.
File searching in Vista and (and probably Windows 7 though I'm not sure) works differently to that in XP and older versions.
One of the best proofs of this that I've found on my own PC is as follows:
MediaPlayer_TLB.pas - in Folder S:\d7comp\activex\Wmp64
Windows, Messages, SysUtils, Variants, Classes, Graphics, Controls, Forms,
Windows XP search ALSO behaves wrong, although the search in Vista and Windows 7 is even worse.
I have stopped using the Windows Search thing since 2000/2001 :) :P
One of those 23 is S:\d7app\Testapps\msplayer1\msplayerMF.pas
MediaPlayer_TLB.pas - in Folder S:\d7comp\activex\msplayer64
- I have a folder containing several files of the same type (i.e.
On line 7, as part of the "uses" clause, you can see: MediaPlayer_TLB
"jsp"), and Windows shows some of those files in the search results, but not all of them.
Windows searches only for those file types registered for the "search" operation.
I'm not sure about the reality, but several pages I found via Google a few months ago imply that Vista searches for known words in file names, and wildcard searching (using ?
