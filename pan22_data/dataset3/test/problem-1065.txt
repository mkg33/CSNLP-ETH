If I click my mouse again, the alert dialog is displayed.
In other words, I click the button and nothing happens.
In an attempt to fix the problem, I uninstalled Chrome (as well as all the Google folders that are created in the Registry, Programs x86, AppData, etc.)
For example: This fiddle should show an alert dialog immediately after you click the button.
After much testing I was able to correct this by the following means
As you may know, when the alert() function is fired in the browser, a box will immediately be displayed in the browser window.
And, in fact, it works fine in my Firefox and IE browsers.
However, the alert dialog does not popup in my Chrome browser until after I click my mouse.
I'm experiencing a strange problem on Google Chrome 53.0.2 with the Javascript alert box.
Also, worth mentioning, this alert() problem does NOT occur on Chrome on my Mac.
- Also, I have disabled all my Chrome extensions and have tried using Incognito.
Strangely, in my Chrome browser, the alert box does not appear until after I click mouse.
