If that makes the problem go away you probably have bad RAM.
If you can, try a remote shutdown, but it sounds like you're at a point where the machine is totally unusable in its current state, so if it takes more than say 15-30 minutes to shut down go ahead and have it powered off.
You might do some damage, but honestly you may be doing more by letting it churn away with what is probably bad RAM.
As David said in his comment you should really do at least one pass through one of these tools whenever you install RAM.
Bad chips are not as common as they used to be, but they do still happen.
Second step: Undo the last thing you did before the machine started misbehaving (pull the RAM).
Run a memory test program (or this one, or many others) before booting the OS.
You don't know what's happening behind the scenes at this point, and a hard power-off is a relatively known quantity.
(I see you had the presence of mind to do a reboot test on the machine before you started mucking about with hardware updates...)
