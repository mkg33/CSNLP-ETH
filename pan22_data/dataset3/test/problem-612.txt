The hardest part is figuring out which house belongs to a particular network.
But your basically needing a directional antennae to make your work a little easier.
A buddy of mine used to make money by going to houses that had unsecured wireless networks, explaining the risks, and charging them $25 to turn on encryption.
Is there a better way to determine the source of the signal, or am I on the right track and I just need to tweak/invest more?
I bought a super cheap USB WiFi adapter with a place to plug in an external antenna, then I made myself a "cantenna", but when I use it with NetStumbler, pointing the can in different directions doesn't seem to give me significantly different signal strength readings.
I'm considering trying the same thing, but I don't want to buy that device; I'm sure the same thing can be done with my laptop.
He said he used some little handheld device with a semi-directional antenna and a signal strength indicator, I imagine something like http://www.hawkingtech.com/products/productlist.php?CatID=33&FamID=102&ProdID=198.
Possibly because my little USB device is super cheap?
