Right-click on the EFS folder, and select Properties.
On the file server, open “gpedit.msc” and navigate to Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Public Key Policies >> Encrypting File System.
I'm asking if there's a way to prevent files from being encrypted.
I want a way to tell the above server "don't allow files on the E: drive to ever be encrypted by anyone or any software/process."
Create (maybe through ACL) the ability for the OS to require a user approval when a modification is made to a certain file type (e.g.
I have yet to apply it since I can't duplicate the issue on our production server in our test environment.
When Microsoft completes the setup of a new server, regardless of that server’s role, the setting for EFS on the server (not the domain) will be set to “Not Defined”.
How is the OS supposed to know if a file is encrypted vs being of some format it doesn't "know" about?
Here's the suggestion from our Encryption software support team.
The behavior you are describing is most likely a setting on that file server.
No, you cannot prevent files from being encrypted.
Depending on the scenario, “Not Defined” could mean “enabled” or “disabled”.
But if clicking on an "OK" button will allow the write, it will also PREVENT a write to a file.
You can disable OS-level encryption, and perhaps some programs from running via GPO, but that cannot stop every program, nor users uploading already encrypted files.
By setting the EFS option to “Don’t Allow”, that will cause the prompts to reappear.
I've searched around online but get a bunch of EFS/bitlocker/ransomware links that have nothing to do with my question at hand.
If you have Active directory, you can try a SRP (Software Restriction Policies) GPO to block executables in this paths:
***Note: Before you turn off EFS on the file server, you should have the users move the data back to his/her original machine.
Since crytpo processes do these things rapidly, without user intervention, the encryption succeeds.
I'm not asking about ways to prevent ransomware, etc.
The other weirdness is that on my test Windows 2012 R2 server, it does not allow encrypted files instead it takes a long while to copy the file and when it is done the files is not encrypted.
It's probably not a perfect solution, but it's a start in preventing rapid file modifications from client systems on shared drives.
Users are coping encrypted file to our main Windows 2012 R2 File server and of course other users can't read the files.
We also recommend that EFS be disabled on all file servers that you may have in your environment.
After you have disabled EFS, the user can copy the data back to the file share.
I'm referring to some extent to ransomware, but specifically I want the following scenario:
A couple weird things are: it used to prompt the user when they copying the encrypted files to give them a choice of de-crypting first, it doesn't do that anymore and copies the encrypted files directly.
I can't find any way to do this at the NTFS level, short of "read" access.
What you want to do is ensure users are only putting files where they are supposed to - and no where else.
Change the option for “File encryption using Encrypting File System (EFS)” to “Don’t Allow” or “Disable”.
I'm running Windows update to see if "breaks" then.
