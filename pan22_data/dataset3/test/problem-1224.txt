For an intermittent problem, I'm willing to bet that it's not a software issue, but rather a hardware one.
I have a computer running Windows XP that is sometimes freezing during the shutdown process.
It may also be worth checking your PSU with a power supply tester.
I realize that a complete list of applications and hardware in my machine could allow someone to recognize what's causing the problem, but I'm really more interested in learning how to track the issue down than simply learning which program is causing it in this instance.
The freeze lasts at least over night (~8 hours) at which point I usually turn off the machine manually.
I had intermittent crashings for 5 months, and I replaced every piece of hardware - and then I checked the power supply, and it was causing erratic behaviour.
I would suggest running Memtest86 on your machine, and seeing how it performs.
The freeze occurs while the message "Windows is shutting down..." is displayed on screen, and happens approximately once a week (but not on a specific day/time).
I routinely clean up my startup services and programs, so there is very little unnecessary software running.
I would also reccomend running the following at a command prompt:
Because the problem is intermittent (and likely won't show up unless the computer has been in use for several hours), removing hardware or uninstalling applications isn't really a practical option in this case.
If there isn't anything useful posted within a day or two, I'll edit that information in.
I've checked the event log after a freeze and found no errors or warnings.
I also verified that the last message in the log stated that the EventLog service was shutting down.
