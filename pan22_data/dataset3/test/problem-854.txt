That said, I was at a DefCon presentation where the team showed exactly how they took it apart.
Consider soldering a large capacity capacitor to your hdd and ram, which on tamper detection (you decide method/sensors) discharges destroying data.
On others they removed chip layers chemically and read the chip with a electron microscope scan.
I'd like to offer a different approach, if you're willing to consider destructive preventative measures.
The issue is weather destruction of the device (or at least the data it contains) is acceptable.
I am pretty sure there are embedded SOC designs which encrypt everything and once you fuse it, is "impossible" to reverse engineer.
Timer based solution are also possible - unless the device can ping home every few minutes/hours/... it self destructs.
So it answers the question verbatim, while possibly completely missing your intent.
You'll never be safe from really dedicated hackers.
This "prevents" access in the empty sense of no one can access the system afterwards.
The rule I've always worked from is that once an attacker has physical access to your host, they can eventually break into it - unless, as kasperd says, you use strong all-disk encryption with a boot password, and are willing to be there to enter it every time the host boots.
In a lot of cases the chips hadn't been fused, or the chip design foolishly included an unconnected debug port.
