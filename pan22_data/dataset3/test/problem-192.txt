I'm running a debian Lenny VPS myself, and I'll say, I came in with a "basic" understanding of *nix based systems, but I've learned a lot.
The extra management, not least of which is looking after the security of the system, should not be discounted lightly.
I know enough about Linux to get by, or to be dangerous - take your pick.
Some context: I am primarily a Windows user, but have been tinkering with various Linux distros off and on for several years.
If shared hosting is meeting your needs then you would be well advised to stay with it.
From what I have gathered, a VPS allows you more control over your server setup.
If on the other hand you "just" want stuff to work quick, easy and without pain, then keep your current hosting / get a managed VPS.
go for it, it's fun, it's a learning experience and it's something to be proud of.
You have already stated that you are a Linux tinkerer, not an expert.
Despite the power and flexibility you get from using a VPS, you have to take care of it yourself.
You would do far better learning in a contained environment.
PS: I don't know if it's allowed or not but if your going to be going for a VPS solution I can reccomend Linode.com.
But at the same time you have to set it up yourself, and maintain it.
I am currently on shared hosting, and have been recently looking at the idea of switching to a VPS instead.
I've got my VPS there as well, and they are a pretty good company, lively community, good support, I've had no downtime what so ever since joining, except one reboot thus far, and that was it.
So, if you want to learn and sharpen your skills a bit, then by all means YES !
I've also done some tinkering on my current host, but have no serious sysadmin experience.
Only if you need something that the shared hosting doesn't provide should you be looking at a VPS.
It is therefore unwise to use an Internet facing machine as your plaything.
