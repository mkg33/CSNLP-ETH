All I would like to do is a fresh installation of the Application.
I checked if I can extract an uninstaller executable from the installer file, but that would have been too easy.
I have tried to uninstall the application properly.
Cmd args can be displayed by calling it with /HELP and it does offer a parameter to force a different install folder!
On a regular Windows 10 system, imagine you have installed all your applications on a separate hard drive.
While it sounds easy, the main problem is this: Various installers take the Windows registry information to determine the initial state they are starting in: New installation or change/repair mode.
MSI installers can offer context menu or command line uninstall options, but unfortunately the Applications I try to reinstall are not using these.
Thanks to this a post on silent install here, I found that both Git and Sublime use an Inno Setup installer.
The vlc installer does not reveal it's options this way unfortunately.
I thought about manually cleaning the registry, or install a third party "cleaner" tool to remove registry entries, however this might mess up the whole system even more and is not a very clean approach, which might work only partially.
I think git is using an InstallShield installer and vlc NSIS, not sure about Sublime.
(There are many questions on the topic of Restinstalling/Uninstalling applications, I am sorry if this has already been asked but I was not able to find a similar question with the same problem/goal).
But I have around 30 applications in total affected by this problem - it sounds easier (and faster) to reinstall Windows.
Now, this hard drive fails and you want to reinstall the applications on a different disk.
However, the uninstaller file (which is also called by the windows remove application tool) is usually located in the application directory, and therefore not available.
In the latter, they won't let you change the installation location, but immediately fail on processing the operation, because they try to access the lost disk.
to force an installer to do a new installation, even if it finds an existing one?
I found the install script file for Git on GitHub, which contains a lot of registry key checks, I could manipulate these to try get the installer to a new installation.
I was able to install git at a different location.
Quite easy with this Inno Setup, looking at the other applications now.
The setup complains "could not uninstall previous version, continue anyway", but succeeds.
