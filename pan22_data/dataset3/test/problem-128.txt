I have seen such "wrong alarms" many times in Avast and Kaspersky after removing a virus.
Or is that something I should be cautious when it happens (aka a behaviour that could point to a virus infection that has affected avast itself already)?
Remove it manually from inside the program or clear all logs.
Sometimes they don't get removed, but in my case they disappear after some days.
C:\ProgramData\AVAST Software\Persistent Data\Avast
But as I have not seen the whole output I tried to look for the logs and thus looked in the folder:
Or where do I find the log files I need (aka the bootfile logfiles)
Anyway, I would recommend you to scan computer using a good antivirus (such as Kaspersky IS, Norton Security etc, and not that free ones), even a trial version will do the work.
Even though I saw logfiles there including aswBoot.txt under reports I did not find any CURRENT logfile.
After that it I updated the software (today an update came out) and it wanted to do a reboot to make a bootscan which I accepted.
During this I saw the usual outputs (nothing that indicated a virus).
The only current ones being: AvastSvc.log, AvastUI.log and GrimeFighter.log (but nothing shows even the found virus during the quick search.....I only see it when I look into the virus container in the avast menu).
As a note here: As the infected file was an old .dll from a bought program from 3 years back and no further infection was found I'm guessing that it was a wrong alarm from avast but one can't be cautious enough sadly.
Here are pathes of Avast log files and how to clear logs.
To recover after Win32/Ramnit malware follow these steps (provided by Microsoft).
During a quick search avast found and removed a virus on my PC (Win32:Ramnit-DO).
Also check autoruns using Autoruns, and check extensions of your browser (in browser settings), because Ramnit steals bank user names and passwords and it can use extensions to achieve it.
