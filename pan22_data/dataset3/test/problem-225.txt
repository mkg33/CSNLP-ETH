As an example, nothing prevents me from setting up DNS entries for any IP address and try to connect to the address using that DNS entry.
ifconfig | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}' | xargs -L1 host
so clearly there is some other way these names are configured and how do I get all the hostnames?
You can't get this information at all, at least in a reliable and complete way.
Additionally, there can be multiple forward (A) records for a a single IP address as well as CNAME records all of which are hostnames for the system.
But I want to get a list of hostnames using single command, much like the way I got list of IP address.
I have a Linux box and I know I can get the list of IP addresses assigned to that box using following command /sbin/ifconfig -a but how to I get the list of hostnames / DNS for that Linux box using single command?
I have checked my /etc/hosts and it doesn't have abc.fb.us, xyz.fb.us etc.
Now, my Weblogic application server has defined listen address as, lets say abc.fb.us and xyz.fb.us etc.
You could try dumping your DNS config and searching for all records that have the same IP addrress, then search to see if any CNAME records refer to the A record names.
The system doesn't need to be aware of what DNS names for what domain are pointing to it.
This isn't simple and certainly isn't a single command.
Now, all those have different IP addresses, so I have 4 different IP addresses for my Linux box (please correct me if I am wrong here ??).
Now when I ping each hostname (should I call abc.fb.us as hostname or DNS or alias ??)
then I get some IP address which is listed when I do ifconfig.
If PTR records are defined, you can get these like Brennen described, but everything else is unreliable.
For most protocols, you will be completely unaware that this has happened (HTTP is a major exception, as it will transfer the hostname in the HOST header).
There is no single command that will give you the information you want.
I know I can do nslookup 172.22.33.11 and I will get abc.fb.us, assuming that's the IP address of abc.fb.us.
Why I asking this is because using /sbin/ifconfig -a I see that there are ~6 ethernets connected to it and in those 4 are active.
