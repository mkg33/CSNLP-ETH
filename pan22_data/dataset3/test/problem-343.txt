(This coincided with my roommate moving in, adding additional wireless devices.)
The situation can be fixed by turning router A off and on, and sometimes resolves itself after a certain amount of time.
I'm a bit ignorant of networking, so I don't have a clue what the problem could be, and even if I did I wouldn't know how to debug since the problem happens rarely and at random.
The internet cable connects to router A, which in turn connects to the switch to provide wired internet to the house.
When I initially set this up, it worked great, you could walk around the house with a laptop and it'd seamlessly switch channels as needed to get the best wireless connection.
If you navigate to its IP address in a browser (from a wired connection), it returns an HTTP error 500.
Router B is plugged in to some port in the house and is in bridge mode, to extend the wireless coverage.
I'd greatly appreciate if anyone had a suggestion!
My home network consists of two Linksys wireless routers, let's call them A and B, and a switch, which provides ethernet connectivity to wired ports throughout the house.
Every so often (on the order of days), router A will stop working, but only partially, in the following way.
However, the internet still works if you connect through a wired port or wirelessly through router B.
