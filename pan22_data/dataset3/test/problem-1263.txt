To work around this problem, you can either use a Windows Domain, which is most likely overkill, or you can only use well-known groups for your permissions.
Well-known groups have the same SID on every Windows OS, so even if you install a new Windows, the SIDs used in the ACEs do exist and work.
Windows (NTFS) file permissions are stored in Access Control Lists (ACL) which are made up of Access Control Entries (ACE).
Some well known-groups are everyone, users or administrators
When displaying permissions to a file, the OS takes the SID and looks up the name for it.
This should explain why you can not access the files, the users with permissions simple do not exist in your current installation.
Because you set permissions on files with a different OS, the SIDs used do not exist on the current OS and the system can't resolve the names (so it displays the SIDs).
If the users group does not work for you, you could use the Replicator group because as far as I know, it doesn't have any side-effects to its members.
Every user/group has a unique internal Id, called the SID, these SIDs are stored in the ACEs.
To see more well known groups on your OS, open a PowerShell and run:
Not all these groups are good candidates to be used for NTFS permissions, because they give their members additional (unwanted) permissions/rights or their membership is only applied when running as an elevated process (Administrators, Power Users).
When you install a new OS and attach an previously existing drive you may see ACEs for users with a name such as S-1-5-21-12345678-....
