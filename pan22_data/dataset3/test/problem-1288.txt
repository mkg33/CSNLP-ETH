Based on that, you could then decide to run with open case, without case, of with a fan.
For the Pi 3, with it's 70-80 Â°C idle temperature, I would use reasonable big heatsinks and a case, that allows airflow over the heatsinks (maybe a hole over it with some wiregrid), and if used 24/7, for example as mail- or fileserver, I would actively cool it with a tiny fan, just enough to move the air away from the heatsink.
Is there any risk of overheating if I close the case ?
With my old B+, the temperature is lowered by maybe 4 degrees - from 53 to 49 degrees.
Your Pi won't overheat (normal conditions), though if temperature gets too high the performance goes down.
If you are concerned about overheating, it depends how you want to use it, if you plan to stress resources, maybe is better consider acquire some heatskin.
I noticed that the case can be opened or closed, but when reading the instructions that come with I am not entirely sure of wether or not I should keep it opened when the Raspberry Pi is turned on ?
Only 8 of them are used without case (they are somehow built in box) and 2 of them are used in combination with a fan (used for capturing and editing videos in real-time) .
I still use raspberrypi with closed case without any issue.
This depends on how you're planning to use your PI's.
I suggest you monitor temperature notifications if they are connected to a screen, or, you write a sript to log the temperature.
All others are used in closed case (primarily use to display webpages and/or videos in kiosk mode, or as server).
Do note that external conditions play a role as well (so temperature might be OK in winter using closed case, but might no longer be OK during summer).
I do recommend to use a case (can be open) since this offers good protection to your PI (e.g.
You can do whatever you want, for example, you can close the cover on top, or maybe you have to keep it open to connect other things like serial or video/ camera and so on.
I have bought the Raspberry Pi official starter kit, with it comes the official Raspberry Pi case.
