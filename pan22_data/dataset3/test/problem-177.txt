So getting to the next step, which is the question here, requires these two steps:
You could lose the data along with the laptop, or someone could tamper with your kernel, bootloader, or hardware to install a keylogger while it's out of your sight, but that doesn't sound like your current threat model, and encrypted mounts should serve your purposes just fine.
The other answers that propose standard SSH hardening are ignoring the fact that those steps have already been taken.
Anyone that says that an encrypted SSD device is not 100% secure provided its done BEFORE any data is placed on it is a complete and total idiot and you should not take technical advice from them ever again.
Of course, using port knocking implies using iptables too.
Cloud storage should be used, you should also have your own local and remote copies you do yourself, depending on how much storage your actually dealing with.
Therefore, port knocking on top of the existing SSH hardening (and denyhosts and other things) is an effective and simple step to take security to the next level.
But, as stated in the question, this is a solution for one person.
This is the particular port knocking implementation I like:
Unless you store the files encrypted on the server, anything you do will be less secure, then a remote cloud solution.
You can then use rsync, conduit, or unison when you get home to synchronize your files, or just copy your updated files back over to your main system.
Alternatively, I think highly of portable encrypted drives with a PIN-pad, such as the Apricorn Aegis Padlock drives.
I'm going to propose port knocking as the answer for how to get to the next level of security on top of the standard SSH hardening that is already being done in this case.
If you prefer a free alternative, you could use encfs, ecryptfs, or similar to create encrypted mounts to hold your sensitive data.
If you use a 3G/4G connection you will want to use a VPN before you upload any content over yet another secure connection.
So using a cloud service really is a solution, provided all your information is encrypted before upload, your only concern would really be retainability in the long term.
The wide use of Port Knocker utilities is a matter of controversy among security experts, but this question is a text-book case of when Port Knocking can be used with great effectiveness.
Now the internet traffic might be secure, but it could in theory, perform a Man in the Middle attack on you.
I don't consider this option quite as secure as the PIN-pad, but it is still a pretty solid choice.
This question is about going beyond SSH hardening.
Amazon and Dropbox spends millions to secure their servers, you being a single user, will likely not install every kernal update that is released.
The use of a long secure random password, encrypted data and encrypt storage media, makes your data 100% secure.
There really isn't a "one size fits all" answer to your question.
You are not doing your clients any favors by not encrypting those files, and ANY storage media, which contains those files.
You do understand that using your phone's 3G/4G connection is not secure right?
Basically, unless you really feel like you need the services provided by a remote system, I'd recommend just bringing your files in as secure a container as you feel you require.
I would use a third-party VPN service, that will allow you to whitelist one specfic ip address, this would allow you to always have the exact same ip address.
Port knocking has some limitations (e.g., it is a shared secret).
It sounds like you should come up with a routine that will sync all your storage devices together.
They're very portable, reasonably secure against most threat models, and the biggest risks are forgetting your PIN or losing the drives while traveling--but in both cases, you still have the original files safely at home.
Futhermore...If you really are dealing with 300GB of data a 3G/4G connection really won't cut it.
The phone company has the ability ( no doubt ) to view all your internet traffic.
Furthermore any files which contain PII and/or confidential client information should be encrypted.
Besides it sounds like you should focus on your clients, doing what you do, then worry about the security of a home linux server that is not as secure as Amazon and Dropbox.
There are clients for many popular systems, including Android.
If your laptops storage device is encrypted, and you encrypt the files, then all anyone would ever have is a laptop with random bytes on it.
