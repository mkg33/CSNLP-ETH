It probably had a lot to do with not being very strong with linux and not having much time to learn it, so unless you are - I'd stick with easier stuff.
I do not know, or have every compared any commercial DVR applications (other than Windows Media Center).
I'm looking for the best out there (under $200) that provides TiVo like quality (season passes, responsive FF/RW, etc).
GBVPR, I have never used this, but been hearing more and more about it recently.
Windows Media Center is probably my favourite, it is well polished and is generally very good.
We've been using Media Center at home for a couple of years, and I really don't have any issues with it.
I've been unable to find very little credible or up to date information on DVR platforms for Windows.
We used Myth for a couple of years prior to that, and had constant issues.
We'd figured getting good Hauppage cards would make the difference, but we never had any luck.
I would have to say Windows Media Center, MythTV on Windows or GBPVR.
MythTV, Very complicated to configure on anything other than the prebuilt Linux editions such as Mythbuntu, but works very well.
