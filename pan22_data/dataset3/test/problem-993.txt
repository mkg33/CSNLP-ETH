I've been very happy with it - even with five SATA drives, it's hard to tell it's running.
Unless you really want to build it yourself, not sure that you save much from NewEgg.
Best of all you're likely to get one to two years of the Dell warranty left.
In the UK Poweredge 2950s with a Perc5/i can be had for Â£500-700 if you're patient.
I just bought a new machine from ecollegepc and had it shipped to Denver for $740 to my door in less than a week.
I'm an Apple fanboi, all about the silent machines, and if I say it's quiet, it's really quiet.
Not sure about more memory, but at the point where you are spending $1500, I think a system builder that will warranty things is not a bad plan.
Adding 3 more drives would be about $600, and I'd be below your $1400 without going through the hassle.
Depending on budget, you can have two RAID 0/1 volumes [4 drives] (one for OS and one for VM's) or just one RAID 0/1 volume [2 drives] with everything on it.
This is actually exactly what I did, though I spent a bit more to get 6 1TB disks and 16GB of RAM.
3) You don't need 5 WD Caviars for a dev/test solution.
1) Get a quiet power supply (newegg.com PSU's usually have comments about their noise levels)
That leaves you some money over to get some SATA disks (Perc5/i controllers work very well with SATA disks), though you'll probably have to live with 4GB RAM for a bit.

Go with WD Velociraptors (very quiet and fast drives).
Best part is it shows up already built, no muss no fuss.
About the silent part - I did a writeup recently on how to build a silent PC using the Antec Mini P180 case.
I have an HP ML115 sitting in my basement right now.
