For details, and for the reason why you should change it to time.nist.gov, see this Q&A:
Fresh installs have it pick up time from a variety of sources that can be many hops from the Master clock.
You are going to want to make sure your Pi is getting the time from the Master Clock instead of from the pools that are set up by default.
Rather than make the system's clock jump forward 3 minutes, chrony will make the clock appear to tick faster than 1 seconds every actual second, and so the system's time will gradually "drift" back to the correct time.
They also are set by default to pools, with the same result.
The best part about using this URL is that it is smart and finds the quickest time server to give you the best results.
How do I set Raspbian to use the primary time server time.nist.gov?
also, for changing your time zone, the recommended way is running sudo raspi-config, then using 4 Internationalisation Options and I2 Change Timezone to do the trick instead of manually editing config files.
The procedure to fix them is included int he same article referenced above.
If you have no internet connection, you may want to set the time manually:
Thought a thread on NTP could benefit from this tip.
This avoids nasty discontinuities in applications, log files, and the like.
ping to google looks just fine, but what results you get from ntptime ?
All my configs, timezone, internet connection were ok, the daemon was also running but the time was wrong.
Only vaguely related, but since the Raspberry Pi doesn't have an RTC it is handy to install chrony which adjusts the clock's rate based on how much it lags or leads the NTP server.
And an example showing my Pi's frequency being corrected by 16.671 pulses per minute:
Rather than retypee the whole procedure, I'll refer you to a Q&A on this Stack Exchange that shows how easy of a change it is:
