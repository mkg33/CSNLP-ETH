I have to abandon a program I love for the poster's problem (and mine)--Servers Alive--since the current version has the "Session 0 Problem" and the developer doesn't know when the next version will be out.
IPSentry is another small, inexpensive but effective tool.
They charge based on the number of things being monitored (ping, free disk, cpu load etc).
It comes with a load of predefined WMI queries and of course you can define your own (they supply templates you can modify).
If a vendor can't assure me that they've fixed the Session 0 Problem and made it fully compatible with Windows 2008 (R2), we're not going to put forth the money.
(virtual)  It works great, and we haven't had much problems with it.
One thing to be aware of, is that three years after Vista and two years after Server 2008 came out, many system admin programs, including network monitors, don't work properly under the new security environment introduced by both OS's.
It is relatively cheap for a small number of servers.
Plenty of charting and reporting available to impress management.
That makes it especially hard to find a good program.
My shop is a non-profit org for whom $1200, let alone the $10,000 for Orion, is very high for what it needs to do (essentially page me when something goes down.)
This is known as the "Session 0 Problem" and it afflicts Windows programs that run as a service (many, many admin programs!)
It's completely web-based and no agents are required.
