You might try re-installing your video drivers to make sure you have the latest version and you have a clean install.
And as far as color format per @Ian, chances are it's already the same by default anyway...
However, if you have any modern video card with the proper drivers installed, it should handle the extra load easily.
Yes, it could potentially make your machine run a little slower due to the extra work put on the video card.
You can have 10 monitors if you wanted and your computer wouldn't care, but it would be your video cards that will choke if they're underpowered or running older software because they ultimately draw the image on the screens.
I use dual LCD monitors on several desktop machines.
Without knowing any further specification of your machine, it is hard to say.
If the drivers are up-to-date then it may be time for a new video card.
Like everyone else has said it REALLY depends on your video card, otherwise it won't slow down your PC.
If you are using on board video often it using system memory.
You didn't mention if you are using a discreet video card or on board video.
I've not seen any evidence of slowness related to the monitors.
Either upgrade your video card or if it's newer, say Radeon 9800+ or equivalent, update your drivers to the latest possible version.
Going to a bigger screen (Higher resolution) means more system ram is needed.
Drivers working properly (or not) can make all the difference in the world.
If it does then you may want to check the drivers as Troggy suggested before re-connecting the second monitor.
