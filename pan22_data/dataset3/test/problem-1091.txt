You should just be able to go into services, stop, then disable the service from startup.
If you're not using SharePoint on this server, you should uninstall/disable it.
It's true that places tell you not to uninstall/disable it, but the usual reason given is that it will hamper your SBS upgrades.
It stopped high disk usage and appears to be working.
But if you have some downtime where you can try it and see if it breaks anything, it might be worth experimenting.
Disabling the search indexer won't hurt anything if they're not using it.
In larger installs, it's quite common to have a server in the farm dedicated just to search indexing.
After that go back to the manage service applications and stop the search service.
If you are using SharePoint, you should read some of the Microsoft documentation for best practices and hardware requirements.
I suspect you're not going to upgrade SBS on that particular server.
Bearing in mind that I'm running SBS08, not SBS2011...
Have you tried disabling the sharepoint search service?
Search Services has 4-digit IOPS requirements, if I remember correctly, which is nothing to sneeze at.
The SharePoint search service has extremely high IOPS requirements.
So, what I would do, during scheduled maintenance, is:
Log into SharePoint central administration, go to application management, manage service applications, click on the search service.
Based on previous comments, my solution was to change service execution time from minutes to three threshold hours at night.
You should be able to set the crawl schedule and crawl rules.
The search indexer will fill up your database server and hard drive with the index  (it stores the index on the hard drive as well) if you're not planning for it or have it configured properly.
Of course, it's not that tightly integrated into SBS08.
