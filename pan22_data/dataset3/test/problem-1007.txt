After using these commands on B, if I use GET http://192.168.1.2/resources(HTTP, not HTTPS), it works, meaning that I can successfully access the resources on the remote server.
I want machine B to forward things at the TCP level(I don't want to deal with SSL certificates)
I don't know if I should actually call B a proxy in this case, but please note that I am not considering using any HTTP proxy(Apache, Nginx).
My question is that how do I use iptables on machine B to achieve this?
However, it is not working with the HTTPS GET https://192.168.1.2/resources
Machine B should blindly pass through the packets, including the SSL packets.
Suppose I have two local machines A and B(Ubuntu), and there is also a remote server C. Originally, through RESTful API, I can call GET https://domain_of_C/resources directly from machine A to get some resources on remote server C
Now the requirement is that I need to first call machine B at 192.168.1.2(B's IP address) by:GET https://192.168.1.2/resources, and then B should help A forwarding everything to the remote server C, as well as getting the response back from C to A.
