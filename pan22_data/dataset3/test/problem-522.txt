When you install the AD role on a server, all "local" users become domain users.
Only then can you attempt to use AD accounts for your application.
I'm a developer, not a server admin, so please bear with me!
Is there a way I can tell the difference between domain users and local users now?
Ok, you should first read about Active Directory before doing anything more.
AD is a directory service: it contains users, computers and all sorts of references that are used inside a "security domain", usually a company or department.
I've been tasked with checking the installation of some software on a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine in the cloud, within two scenarios:
When a DC is promoted, all accounts except the DSRM account become domain accounts.
In your case, it doesn't makes any sense to install AD on your server: AD only makes sense if you want to centralize account management between several machines.
That's one of the reason you typically do NOT install anything on the same machine as AD.
When I look in Active Directory Users and Computers, I see all my original local users and groups.
Be warned, though, that AD isn't just a network service: you need to install all the infrastructure that comes with it (mostly, that's DNS but it also means you'll need a static IP address).
Now, if you want to perform your test properly, you will need to remove AD from your server (or, preferably, reinstall it completely), install a separate 2008R2 server on which you will install AD and then join your application server to that domain.
Again, I urge you to start reading about AD: it will not be time lost for anyone who has to work with Windows networks.
At the very least, have a look at the Wikipedia article about Active Directory and try reading on of the (numerous) AD beginner's guide available on the net.
I've just installed the Active Directory Domain Services role on the server, so now I have a domain of one computer.
