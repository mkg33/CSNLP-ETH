This is a very awful situation to be in, because I can't download anything, and it could take up to 30 minutes of constant refreshing until a "change in the network connection" doesn't interrupt anything.
I am nearly certain this is not a problem with my router or network settings because my parents own the exact same model and have had none of these connection problems, as well as on any other device.

I've tried almost every solution that I've found online and even HP technical support has been trying to pin the blame on my network.
If you have/know someone who has a USB wireless adapter, you could try using that to see if it suffers the same problem.
Try to update the chipset and wireless card to latest release from the manufacturer website (like Intel).
If not under warranty, I would use a usb WiFi adapter.
