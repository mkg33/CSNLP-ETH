So in your previous setup I suspect your fully qualified domain name was something more then just the bare hostname.
For dynamically assigned addresses (DHCP) you have to add a "."
Alternatively you can add a domain name here as well.
However, having just installed Tomato onto my Asus N66U, trailing dots are always required.
to make it actually do a dns lookup (mostly a problem with local domains/hostnames for intranet sites or LAN resourses) here is the solution:
For statically assigned addresses you have to add a "."
So your routers hostname would be router.local., and your DNS resolvers would have a search patch of local.
That when your clients perform a lookup for router, the DNS client will automatically append the .local.
If you found this thread due to a similar problem without using ddwrt, but using dnsmasq on linux and using windows hosts that query it, requiring you to add a "."
Does anyone know how to configure dnsmasq to do so?
to the "Append these DNS suffixes" under "Advanced TCP/IP Settings".
Modifying my HOSTS file is not acceptable, and I've shut off NetBIOS over TCP/IP completely (I'm slowly transitioning to a Linux-only network), so that is not an option for numerous reasons.
With a fully qualified name defined, you could then the DNS search path setting for your network via your DHCP server.
I had DDWRT on a Linksys router of mine many, many years ago, and it resolved local hostnames via dnsmasq without the trailing dot.
For example, "ping router" doesn't work, but "ping router."
Similar to the static settings, but in your DHCP server settings.
I realize that a trailing dot after a hostname is technically "correct", but it's a pain in the butt to type and is unintuitive for non-technical users.
Assuming my router's hostname is "router", I'd like dnsmasq to allow me to type "ping router", "http://router/", etc and have it work as expected.
If you are using DNSMasq as both your DHCP and DNS server making this happen should be trivial.
Hope this helps, there is not much info out there on this problem.
