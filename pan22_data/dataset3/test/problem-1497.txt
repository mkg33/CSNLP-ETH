Power requirements are mostly driven by the CPU and GPU.
Your i5-2500K CPU has a maximum TDP (thermal design power) of 95 W, and your nVidia GTX660 has a TDP of 140 W. Given your particular hardware it's not surprising that you observe 200 W as the maximum load.
Such a computer would generally be equipped with a power supply in the 800-1000 W range.
300 W, some people would go out and buy a 600 W power supply for it anyway.
A computer with a 150 W CPU and 2Ã—250W graphics cards will need at least 650 W, not including the disk drives, USB devices, fans, water cooling pumps, LED lights (...) also drawing power from the power supply.
First off, a lot of people buy into sales BS that a bigger power supply is better, and, of-course, promises you can expand it more.
The reasons they perceive this might be a good idea include:
If your question is "Why do people buy large power supplies?"
A 300 W or 450 W power supply would be quite adequate.
Their power requirements could actually be that high
I think a lot of people also think that a power supply will just draw what it needs, and don't realise the overhead (again, this is a subjective opinion, and won't hold true of anyone who has even bothered to learn what "80+" means.
There is also some truth that buying a bigger power supply (can) mean the components are specced to handle greater current and thus will last longer, similarly they are able to better handle transient changes in input power (ie have a bigger power buffer for sudden draws).
However, other people's computers can have much higher power requirements.
Even if the computer's power requirements are only (ex.)
Another part of the puzzle is that people who haven't built a lot of systems generally don't know how much power a system requires, and its easier to buy a bigger supply then work it out - and still be wrong.
Of-course, very often a smaller, high quality power supply will actually do much better then an overly large power supply.
Your computer has fairly modest power requirements.
They are purposely buying a bigger power supply than they need
