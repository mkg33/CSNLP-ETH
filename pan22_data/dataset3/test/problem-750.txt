As others have said, you are probably running your command on an empty directory.
I prefer to preface my globs with ./ to prevent any filenames beginning with a - from being treated as options.
You can safely ignore this error, or you can specify you want all types of files and folders:
Aside from reducing the amount of thinking you need to give to this task, it also has the advantage of being smart enough to not match .
However, your error indicates to me that you're trying to work on an empty directory, or at least one that only contains dotfiles.
Another way of doing this (that will simply fail silently on an empty directory) is to use find's -exec action:
This is because I am not restricting find by file type so it will also attempt to move the current directory (.)
If you have bash 4+ (check with bash --version), you can simply use the dotglob shell option to ensure that globs include files starting with .
By default, if a glob doesn't match any filenames, bash sends it literally to the command -- and since there is no file named * in the directory, mv is sending that error.
