If so, do you have some websites that you open regularly?
Does the Paste option become available or does it remain grayed?
I first discovered this on a web-survey site, but they also exist on other pages in an attempt to prevent users from copying content; however they also block copy/paste from working on the whole system until the applet is killed!
What you can try is to view the clipboard to see what happens when you try to copy something.
ya i no this an old thread: but just want to offer my meaningful advice, try using IOBIT system care 6 i was having same problem with my toshiba satellite 32-bit win7 ultimate still found a forum that gave me this treat and it work.
This made things worse and I could not get numerals to work even from numeric pad.
I used MS Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) this scanned about 4million files and took about 6hours and all of these found absolutely nothing.
Could not deselect the touch pad by double touching it.
I couldn't for the life of me figure out why cut-paste wasn't working in Win Explorer.
Close the page/tab you are trying to copy & paste  to and open another fresh one .I had this problem when I occidentally moved the actual page on top of the page I was trying to copy and paste some info; to so closed it opened a new one and it worked .
CTRL+C deleted selected text, CTRL+X bringing up save options menu, LH Shift key not working, RH Shift works but sometimes adds additional characters.
That is, does it happen every time you boot and occur from startup to shutdown or does work sometimes?
(Yes, it’s not very effective copy-protection and incredibly intrusive and sucks CPU cycles, but… um, that’s it.)
Perhaps the cut-paste problem is application specific.
This occurred after downloading the later version of Synaptics driver.
Also get a weird beep noise when using CTRl+C sometimes.
Try copying some text, copying graphics (press PrintScreen to capture the screen), and try copying some files/folders.
Also sometimes had to use CAPS lock to log in: this was getting seriously worrying
I ask because there exist programs (especially Flash applets) that copy an empty string to the clipboard in a loop in order to disable copying or pasting.
Who would believe such strange symptoms could result from a hardware fault.
I had these problems suddenly occur for apparently no reason on my HP 6560b Notebook.
Downloaded  NEW version of Synaptics Mouse-keyboard driver software: v17.0.19 (previously was v 17.0.18.25)
Windows 7 does not have the clipboard viewer (which was limited anyway), so get ClipSpy, then try copying various things to see if they end up in ClipSpy.
Removed Windows updates that occurred on 06-09-17:
Apart from keyboard orange light ion top LH corner of the Touchpad.
And yes i do look after my laptop very well and nothing was spilled on the keyboard and it had only 2years of light use.
So last resort I changed the keyboard from a 6570 laptop (very similar HP Notebook) and Bingo it worked OK.
By running these tests, we can narrow down what the problem is.
If it works sometimes, then when it doesn’t, do you happen to have a browser open?
I will try reverting to my original Synaptics driver but I'm not to fussed with these issues.
