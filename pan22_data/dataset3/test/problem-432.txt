Is it possible to have what I have in mind in place i.e.
I have a website and I tried to configure my domain to work my email on Outlook so that I can have my email addresses with my own domain.
One other option is you may be able to have gmail act as a pop/imap client and connect to the outlook server to retrieve the messages.
You must pick the one you want to be primary and that's where the mail will go.
You could however have the primary mailserver forward the message to the secondary server.
Then I used the forwarding option in cPanel to my gmail and this worked.
In DNS, you can have one server act as a backup for the other, but it would only actually deliver to one or the other.
when someone sends me an email on email@mydomain.com I want it to go both to my 'Outlook' email and to my 'Gmail' email.
When I tried to use them the two together and what I had in mind didn't work.
Outlook required that I set my MX settings as follows:
Likewise I changed the priority for Scenario 1 to Priority:0 (as in scenario 2).
receiving emails in both scenario 1 and 2 simultaneously?
