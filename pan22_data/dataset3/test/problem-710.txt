When a layer has a layer below it that supports method 3 but the layer above it only supports method 2, it can stop passing data to lower layers temporarily, causing method 2 to apply to higher layers.
I am trying to get a better understanding of Ethernet flow control.
Often higher layers don't support method 3, but instead support method 2.
If they get full, you return "busy" errors to the higher layers and they handle that however is appropriate.
How does a host actually throttle back traffic if it received a pause frame from a switch?
While the sending engine is stopped, your local queues will fill up with data from higher layers.
At the Ethernet layer, method 3 is supported through pause frames.
Or, to put it more concretely, when you receive a pause frame you stop your sending engine and set a timer to restart the sending engine in the appropriate time.
I have recently seen a Debian forum that mentioned pause frames should be discarded by the MAC layer and if not the driver should discard them.
If the above statement is true, what does passed to the host really mean?
