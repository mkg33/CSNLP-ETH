and when i ran BF3 without configuring it graphix it lagged like﻿ hell but not a single lag when i assigned high performance.
I updated the drivers to the most recent Catalyst directly from AMD (HP simply does NOT provide graphic drivers for win 8), and the card seems to work fine, although it now reports as a Radeon HD 6700M series.
I tried disabling the intel card under device manager, but that only makes windows reporting a "microsoft basic display driver" under Direct X diag, instead of reporting the dedicated AMD card, which otherwise, the device manager reports working just ok (and with no driver issues).
The problem is that some games and windows itself seem to sometimes only "see" the integrated card (intel HD graphics 3000) instead of the dedicated GPU, for example, the direct X diagnostic tool, shows only the intel.
Anyone has had this same probem under windows 8 with amd cards for laptops?
The same when i see the properties of my display (in "advanced" under "display resolution" options.)
So, there is nothing like you need to configure it in bios or upgrading driver....in my laptop it already had the option of configuring switchable graphix i didn't downloaded any drivers from anywhere.......some people say that when they assign games to high performance then also the game didnt used the graphix...first way- try running it on integrated graphix then﻿ on dedicated one...second way- when your laptop plays game on dedicated graphix the laptop will produce more heat and you will be able to listen your laptops fan sound as the dedicated graphix will produce more heat and fan will switch on cooling....
I already changed an option in my BIOS and changed the "dynamic" setting, to "fixed", and that is supposed to make precisely what I want, that is, to make windows only see the dedicated card all the time, instead of switching cards depending in the application.
So, is there a way of making windows IGNORE the integrated card and just to care about the dedicated one?
In fact, that option worked just fine under win 7, but now in win 8.
The PC came with windows 7 but I recently upgraded to win 8.
When i check device manager, i DO see both cards, also when I use GPU-Z, but why some applications seem to only see the intel one instead of the dedicated one?
I have an HP dv6 laptop with an an AMD Radeon 7690m XT dedicated Graphics card.
I also had the same problem of switching graphics...then i discovered that when i right click on my desktop it showed configure switchable graphix options then i came to know that dedicated graphics card has to be assigned to specific games to run them on dedicated graphix...i also had a problem that games were not widescreen but i solved it by seeing a video on youtube!
That is OK since I read the Catalyst drivers just do that because the 7690m is just a custom version of a 6770 made by HP.
