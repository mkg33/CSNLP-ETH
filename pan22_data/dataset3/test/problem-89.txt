Put all your video files on this master in a folder.
(last time I checked it involved rendering your video out to an imagine sequence, which would then presumably need to be recombined into a video for your use)
Some examples of applicaitons that can do this are:
When it's done it renames it to done_yourfilenamehere.
every so often, and, if something is in the shared folder, renames it to work_yourfilenamehere and runs your transform.
You can't simply connect a bunch of windows computers together and magically make a cluster,  and install a standard bunch of Windows applications on it.
Microsoft does have clustering software that I know nothing about.
In other words, can the problem be split into chunks that are basically independent?
That basic idea is to split up the movie into chunks and get a different PC working on each chunk:
Basically all the clients should be kept as busy as possible, with each client taking what ever time they needed to transform each file.
The master computer runs a script which looks in each of the shared folders.
The clients run some windows scripting language (perl would work) which wakes up
If they have nothing in them then put one file to be transformed.
Given that you describe the problem as "a large number of video files to transform", yes, this would work on a cluster.
Your also going to need special software that can run on a cluster to do your work.
Adobe After effects has a sort of clustering mode they call "network render" but it isn't an ideal solution.
Can I have someone sit at each computer and do part of the problem, and will that speed things up?
A cluster of computers works well when you can say...
Without knowing the nature of the video "transformation", what software you are using, or the level of scripting/programming at your disposal, it will be impossible to comment further.
The answer to your question depends largely on the software you are using to "transform" these video files, and what that entails.
Using Hadoop you can run Batch job like yours using multiple machines.
If they have a file named done_yourfilenamehere then move it to the done folder.
These are however complicated bits of software, creating a usable high performance cluster is a complicated and potentially expensive job and should not be undertaken lightly.
Make a shared folder per client and have each client mount that shared folder.
To combine the processing power of multiple machines your going to want to run some sort of clustering software, often called a compute or computing cluster.
