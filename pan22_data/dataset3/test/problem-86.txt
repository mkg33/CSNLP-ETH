If you don't have IIS 7 and the provider, you can use WMI.
The attached script works for most of your requirements, except CPU usage.
./Get-WebServerAppPoolStats.ps1 'Server1', 'Server2', 'Server3' -IntegratedAuthentication
Yes powershell can do this with the new powershell provider for IIS it's easy.
Here are some of the examples from the run time data walkthru's provided:
Save the below script as get-webserverapppoolstats.ps1 (or whatever you want).
Get-Content servers.txt | ./Get-WebServerAppPoolStats.ps1 -IntegratedAuthentication
I imagine there must be some sort of solution that shows the information without needing to click around like process explorer.
This works, but I would like a quicker - almost dashboard like display of the information.
but this just gets me the workerproces id and the app pool name.
The get-process cmdlet doesn't help you figuring out which Application Pool a particular worker process is serving.
I want an application or script that displays the following:
Worker process, App pool name, memory usage, and optionally cpu usage.
