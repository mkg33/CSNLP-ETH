The title above is what I just typed, at normal speed and without remembering or using any code, on my SIMPLE and STANDARD "US" hardware keyboard, in Windows with the software Keyboard Layout set to "US International".
In ~1995-2010 I installed on many PCs (family or work) a little, powerful yet easy and inexpensive utility that let me very easily program the keyboard to complete it my way, making that keyboard complete and reliable while much faster, easier and productive than the various solutions above.
Œ and œ can be typed with AltGR + K on the US International Keyboard.
• For the “accent aigu,” type the apostrophe key plus the letter: é, í,ó, É, etc.
• For the “æ” or “œ,” push control, shift, and the number 7 key (hold them all down), let go, and type the letter a or o, etc.
However those special chars, no matter how rare, still need to be double-clicked one by one in the Character Panel, which is far from the no-remembering typing at normal speed.
You can use the US International keyboard as the starting point to create your own custom keyboard that does include it.
The lengthening (2 chars instead of 1) is NOT a drawback in French, which is a "verbose" language: when the phrase we are thinking of speaking is "short", i.e.
Unfortunately most Windows utilities, for keyboard or else, were designed for 32bit Windows and couldn't work in 64bit; and most developers, somewhat abandoned by Microsoft (who failed to fill its explicit or implicit promises), stopped developing thus did NOT write the 64bit versions.
The most approaching, KbdEdit, while more powerful, made apparently a different choice of the point where to intercept the bit flow.

"œ" and "Œ" under Nos 156 and 140, but all others are there too).
But they can also in Notepad++, which is free, powerful, and easy; just go "Edit > Character Panel"; finding the characters you need is tedious the first times but it becomes soon easier as you remember where they are in the list, and that list does hold all the ones you may need (e.g.

Use the info here: Create your own keyboard layout BTW, that ctrl + shift + & thing didn't work for me.
KbdEdit relativeley often suddenly sends quite unexpected keys so you have to kill it in a hurry or it could do some maneuvers unexpected hence dangerous.
As a result KbdEdit remains unable to catch some of the key strikes (all the "Alt" used in MS Office, and a few others), and doesn't reach the same level of simplicity and reliablity; e.g.
• For the “cédille,” push control and comma (hold them both down), let go, and type c key: ç, Ç
• For the “circonflexe,” push control, shift and the number 6 key (hold them all down), let go, and type your letter: î, Î, etc.
I personally stopped it definitely after months of using it a lot.
• For the “tréma,” push control, shift, and the colon key (hold them all down), let go,and type your letter: ï, ö, Ö, etc.
It's crazy that Microsoft overlooked that diacritic.
to drop accents on upper case letters; the (very few) of current French (or DE or SP) who efficiently write proper French are actually using US keyboards.
• For the “accent grave,” type the ` key and then the letter: à, è, È, etc.
If you have nevertheless a way to get a license number (and a 32bit system), take the good old 2.52 version, as the newer 3.02 is not as good (probably written after the author lost interest).
That utility was 3-D Keyboard 2.52, made by a man very kind, helpful and efficient, who had worked on most keyboards in many central Europe countries and languages, where the problem is particularly complicate, and who was able nevertheless to very intelligently sort it all into a very simple clear easy yet quite precise, complete and reliable way.
The few characters (including the dreaded "œ" and "Œ") that can't be typed in a bare Windows using my « À CURAÇAO et à SÃO PAULO... » previous post, can using a Character Map in a couple paid applications like MS Office.
Details are clearly explained for all OSes in US International Keyboard layout, most of them work in Windows.
(If you need a real apostrophe, type the apostrophe key and the space bar.)
TIA to anyone who would come with a better solution.
As "RedGrittyBrick" accurately pointed, this lets me write just as fast and easily all the most used characters in French, German, Spanish, including all the upper case accentuated ones or others like french guillemets, EXCEPTED the 2 (FR-only AFAIK) "oe" and "OE".
"only" twice the length in Latin or 1.5 than in English, we at once instinctively feel bad and soon find ways of making it longer - yes, and I am very well placed to make you quite sure that this is the very truth!
The lack of "œ" and "Œ" isn't actually a problem since they get more and more replaced everywhere with "oe" and "OE", with no consequence at all on pronunciation or clarity.
This is the only way to efficiently write proper French or German or Spanish; try to write my title above, at normal speed, with an "AZERTY" so-called "French" keyboard (please don't laugh) or on a "QWERTZ" so-called "German" keyboard (please don't cry) ;) ; these european so-called "keyboards" are actually jokes and if they are almost the only used it is because most people give up writing properly thus accept e.g.
You can still download it for now from Fingertip Software -> FTS Downloads or Cyrillic Downloads, but you won't be able to use it without a license, which is no more for sale.
Under newer configurations, that are mostly 64bit, I found very few applications, of which none as friendly, intelligent or efficient as 3-D Keyboard.
He most probably made a good choice of the place where the bit flow traveling from the mechanical keys to the document being typed is intercepted so to make the key edits fast and reliable.
So have I done intensively since 1977 while developing large sci-eng programs (no IT kbds other than US existed then) up to now 2016 (never could accept the downgrade FR or DE "keyboards" actually are).
