BUT, if I use 127.0.0.1 The dsn will cause no exception, and more, I can access to database, but some queries crash, telling me (could not be the exact error because I've translated it from my native language):
Finally I went to the ColdFusion Administration panel and I've created a new dsn using Microsoft SQL Driver, setted the dsn name, the name of database and then the server name to MYSERVERNAME\SQLEXPRESS.
I'm installing a virtual machine with Windows 2003 Web Edition with ColdFusion 9 and a SQL SERVER 2005 Express.
I used (at least for the moment) the sa credentials.
If you need more informations about the system I'll post them, just let me know.
Using MYSERVERNAME\SQLEXPRESS causes a java exception that tells me that the instance is invalid or not running:
Surfing the net, I've found a tutorial that tells me to download the Microsoft sqljdbc driver and put it in the WEB-INF directory of cold fusion and then:
I've imported and attached the databases from two files and I can use it correctly from SSMS.
I've tested the connection at the end of process and the test was successful.
Following the instructions, I've created a System DSN connecting to the server MYSERVERNAME\SQLEXPRESS, combined access Windows Authentication\SQL Authentication and so on.
Then I've enabled TCP connection on lanip+localhost and also the port to 1433.
The answer was not in the configuration of ColdFusion, but in the website itself, that has 2 Application.cfm files.
