To get 'all you RAM' visible, you'll need to find a motherboard with a chipset that supports your 64-bit CPU, and allows more than 4GB of RAM.
It could be that the BIOS update that you have found might fix the problem, but I wouldn't count on it I'm afraid.
Something with an Intel G965 chipset would probably be your best bet.
When the system has less than 4GB installed the chipset dynamically maps the I/O instead, so that it can ensure the most amount of installed RAM is available at any time.
Since the chipset has to keep track of where the I/O is mapped dynamically, this is slightly slower.
I've seen a number of items about this on the internet where hardware is emulating the 32-bit limit, here, a Dell 530 laptop has the same problem, here, a 945 chipset system with Win7 64, and basically all over the internet.
It could simply be that while the processor and operating system may support more than 4GB of ram the manufacturer of the motherboard did not see it worth the time/effort/cost to connect up enough of the address lines between the processor and memory controller to enable use of more than 4GB of memory.
I've seen cases where motherboard isn't working well with particular type of memory chips.
This is basically the same problem as with a 32-bit OS, but limited in hardware rather than software.
It's your motherboard that's limiting the available RAM (more precisely it's the Intel 945G chipset).

The <4GB of RAM problem isn't just operating system related.
It's different when you have a dedicated memory video card installed.
This was a decision made by the Intel design team to ensure top overall 'performance' in both fully populated and partially populated configurations.
To do this, they need to make all the installed RAM visible to the OS so that it can access any potentially available RAM addresses, regardless of where the I/O is mapped at that point in time.
Perhaps the Intel DQ965GF, we used a ton of these and it was a good board.
It's not an easy one to fix, or even one that makes a lot of sense, but it basically boils down to old hardware not being made to physically support what you are asking it to do...
This makes these RAM addresses invisible to the OS, as it's never going to be available.
Also I've seen similar problems in cases where motherboard uses different models of memory chips or different manufacturers.
It's slightly outdated these days, but probably still available (as probably are other makes and models with the G965 chipset).
Since the chipset can only access 4GB of RAM at most, and you have 4GB installed, the chipset statically maps the I/O devices instead of dynamically mapping them (as it's faster to have it mapped statically).
What I'm about to put here is based on personal discussions with Intel technicians about this issue:
It is more likely to affect slightly older hardware where 4GB would be considered "more than plenty"...

You might have a shared memory video card in your system that takes out the amount (like a built-in video card) of your global memory installed.
This gives the same net effect as running a 32 bit operating system but on a 64-bit system, the processor, unable to physically USE any address above 4GB for other hardware or memory devices or even request the memory controller to map up to another address will be forced to kill some of the available memory in favor of things like the graphics card.
This is a long shot, but it could be incompatibility between RAM and motherboard.
