when you see the graph for connection usage creep towards the max_connections level, you'll have to make some decisions (Do I have enough RAM for more connections?
If the max_connections setting is not explicitly set, then it is set to the default value, which I think is 511.
MySQL doesn't handle connections for web apps any different than for any other client.
The main difference lies in the fact that in a web application connections usually only live as long as the server needs to process a particular page (unless you use connection pools).
Bonus points if you can also elaborate on how mysql handles conecttions for web apps...
Often the default values are a good starting point.
It is a debian machine running apache, php and mysql.
These graphs are highly configurable, just right-click on one of them and explore.
What is the best way to determine the best value for this settings?
When using mod_php on Apache, and assuming you're using persistent connections (use mysql_pconnect if you use plain old MySQL API), then you should have max_connectionst in MySQL set to as many concurrent requests as you expect for your application, with some to spare for administration and such - so that if you expect to have 500 concurrent requests on the web application, then I'd set max_connection to something like 550 or 600.
This provides a list of all active connections (under "Server Connections") and also graphs showing (by default) connection usage, traffic and numbers of queries (under "Health", first tab).
In consequence web applications use a lot of very short lived connections (whereas desktop apps use few long-lived connections).
Obviously other factors play a role here, too, such as whether the hardware can be upgraded, and overall server performance and optimization.
The way to determine is to collect metrics with Munin or Cacti and based on historical data give yourself a bit of a cushion (25-50% whatever the historical max is).
You can then monitor the number of connections that are actually alive by using the MySQLAdministrator.
