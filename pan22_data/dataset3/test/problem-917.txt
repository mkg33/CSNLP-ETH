You only did a "Format Quick" which only re-writes the partition tables.
In theory someone could recover information from that.
This will not damage the SSD, it's just a bunch of writes, but you should not do it on the same SSD every day for an entire year.
If you are really paranoid: Physically destroy the drive.
For an SSD that means previous content is destroyed beyond recovery.
In your data is really valuable do a 3-pass DoD Short style wipe.
Nobody has yet been able to reliably demonstrate that ability as far as I know.)
Since that time harddrive technology has come a long way.
My question is, can a 35 zero-write wipe harm an SSD?
A DoD short (3 passes) wipe with a tool like DBAN will exercise every sector of the SSD sufficiently that also the reserved space will be completely overwritten at least once.
I will continue researching on how to wipe my data completely (I know that formatting just recreates the partition table, and doesn't remove the actual files), but I'm curious whether the 35 zero-write will harm an SSD in any way.
There's rumors that just a single format will do it, but I've tested this and my drive-recovery software was able to find the files after the SSD was formatted.
Even then it was highly dubious if data was recoverable after more than 2 overwrites.
If you format the whole device and then you fill it with random data until there is no space left.
Conclusion: A single pass wipe is good enough for 99.999% of all cases.
I recently sold my 128GB Crucial M4 SSD (I have a much larger capacity OCZ SSD, which is faster), and need to wipe the drive.
(It's not like a harddisk where residual magnetic charge can remain on the platter, providing a faint "ghost" of the original value.)
Density and complexity has gone up several orders of magnitude.
There is no way someone could ever get to whatever data was before that.
To my knowledge nobody as ever been able to prove that any significant amount of data could be recovered after 3 writes.
No, I'm not going to destroy the actual SSD, since that'll be a waste of money, and the fact that I've already sold it for a fairly handsome price.
Actually, the best way of removing previous HDD/SDD (or whatever) data is getting the storage full.
I know that the 'toughest' wipe that can be done is a 35 zero-write military-grade 'nuke', which essentially wipes the data on the drive 35 times over.
(Depending on the size of the reserved area and the exact algorithm used by the drive.)
A regular normal format would have over-writen the entire filesystem.
Even then the wear-leveling mechanism will probably leave about 5 to 10% of the data intact in the "reserved space".
On a classic harddrive they may get a few bytes here and there.
You didn't really wipe anything, except the partition table.
I wouldn't normally bother with this secure-erase, but the drive contained classified high-security software files of my own creation, and I really do not want anybody else to gain access to the information.
The 35 times overwrite "standard" was created in the 70's based on harddrive technology that was current at the time.
IMHO: The NSA or some other spy-agency might have the means, but knowing what I do about harddrive and SSD technology I really don't think they stand a chance after 3 overwrites, regardless whether is a SSD of classic harddrive.
