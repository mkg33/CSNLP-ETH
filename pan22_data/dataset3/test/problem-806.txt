What does the name work communicate to someone who is sitting down with your application for the first time?
Finally, What if you have two grids on the same page?
I can't really make a recommendation how without understanding better how you plan to use this (I'm really confused what work.buildHTMLTable(url) could possibly do).
Second, if you're only exposing a single method in that module just return that method directly, no need for an object.
As for where key navigation should go, it really is all about naming.
First, unless the work module is about force times distance in a physics simulator, it is a terribly over-generic name!
seems like you're trying to apply a lot of stuff globally?
Perhaps your modules can accept the grid you want to modify as a parameter?
Next, won't your scrolling handlers depend on a specific structure being present already?
Name modules after what they do and be as specific as possible but not more so.
So if you view the arrow key navigation to be a part of the grid scrolling then yes, it should be in the module that sets that up, otherwise it should not be.
