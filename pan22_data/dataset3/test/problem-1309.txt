You do not need to check for leap years for every date.
Consider showing the month names rather than the numbers.
For February, this means that you have to get the year before the day (I'd recommend first, before month as well).
That would also allow you to just check the beginning of the month in the first if.
Then you don't have to declare two variables in main for every actual value you want to collect.
You only need to check February when it is the 29th.
Rather than manually writing out the days for each, consider creating a constant
The latter two solutions probably won't meet your teacher's criteria.
It's a simple method that the compiler will probably inline.
Then the values will always be correct because you can only select valid values.
I don't remove any of your if statements, so I'll claim to meet them.
For really advanced, show a twelve month calendar and let people pick the exact day of the exact month.
Rather than doing it with generic text boxes, consider using dropdown menus.
Now you only check for leap years if someone enters what would be a leap day.
