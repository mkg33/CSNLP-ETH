I may have also messed up the Windows Store by messing around with the Windows Registry Keys (so they point to the D: drive) and by trying to move over the C:\Windows\WinStore folder from the previous installation of Windows.
Seeing that I had very little options, I decided to reinstall Windows 8.1 again and now everything works as it should.
I think the problem was having C:\Program Files linked to D:\Program Files and C:\Program Files (x86) linked to D:\Program Files (x86).
However, if I open task manager and restart Windows Explorer, then the tiles are showing.
I would move the Program Files folders back to C:\ but even by booting from the Windows 8.1 DVD, it says Access is denied.
I should note that I moved Program Files to my second SSD (as the one installed with Windows on it is only 120GB) and the Program Files on C:\ are linked (with a directory junction) to the Program Files folders on D:.
I tried installing Netflix and it would come up and say it was installed.
I wish there was a solution that didn't involve reinstall Windows, but I wasn't wasting anymore time trying to figure it out (although the problem was probably because of me and irreversible).
One of the problem's is that when I boot into Windows and open the start menu nothing will show (I've included a screenshot below).
I clicked the notification to open Netflix but it just closes right away and then it's uninstalled right away.
I'm at a dead end and I really don't feel like re-installing Windows 8.1 again.
I just reinstalled Windows 8.1 Pro (x64) on to my computer and I'm having lots of problem in regards to the Metro Tiles (aka the start menu).
The second problem is nothing will install from the Windows Store.
I've tried everything I could find but nothing seem to fix this.
Also, if I boot into safe mode then the tiles are showing (I should note I did try disabling everything under the Startup tab in Task Manager and all non-Microsoft services in msconfig).
