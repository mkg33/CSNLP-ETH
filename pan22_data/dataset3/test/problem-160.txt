Ampersand symbols unless in-between "/" and "/" and before "?"
Generally when I code ASP.NET, I almost never fob with the IIS unless it is a core config module or plugin.
Keep in mind high-level character restriction that can cause buffer overflows.
You can type the letter a past U+1000 but you only really need it at U+0097 or its multiple for a layered request.
Writing a small class which handles your gateway requests and parses your request string is an easier way of dealing with special symbols than toying with IIS in registry.
symbols are logical operators for URI and URLs, down to the RFCs that defined them.
Problem was fixed once I changed the Application Pool mode into Classic.
You would have to work pretty hard to use something like:
Make sure that high-bit characters and specific repeat characters do not allow overflow exceptions.
Almost all languages with web API support translation of url encoded characters naturally.
Happened to me, after doing all the modifications to the Windows Registry I was stuck as you were.
url_encoded values and raw ascii representation works pretty well, for example an RHO which acts as an ASP.NET Gateway Filter.
