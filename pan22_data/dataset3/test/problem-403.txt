Use that to shrink the system partition, then boot from the Win8 installer media, create a new partition in the unallocated space and install as usual.
Use a better partitioning program (that will take care of moving the data for you) such as GParted, or if you want to do it within Windows itself download something like EaseUS Partition Master Home Edition.
I assume the drive could not be shrunk beyond where these files were located on the drive.
I now have Windows 7 on C and Windows 8 on D. Dual boot works just fine.
If that does not help you to recover more space for shrinking, there is one method that will definitely help: use PartedMagic.
Easiest way to get started with PartedMagic is to create bootable USB stick using Unetbootin, which has an option to automatically download PartedMagic and make your USB stick bootable with it.
The Win8 bootloader will take over and allow you to dual boot.
You should try to defragment your drive using Defraggler boot time option.
What I did was shrink the C drive as much as allowed, create a new D drive using the default amount of space, temporarily change the location of the pagefile to the D drive.
FYI, I use EasyBCD by NeoSmart to manage my dual boot options.
Alternatively, you can install UBCD, which also has PartedMagic option among other very useful options.
Then, boot from PartedMagic USB stick and use GParted to resize your C: partition down to desired size.
Finally I restored the pagefile location to my C drive and reinabled hibernation.
What I needed to do was temporarily move or disable my hiberfil.sys and pagefile.sys files.
I encountered this exact situation, as in not being able to free up enough hard drive space for the Windows 8 partition.
After rebooting I was able to further shrink my C drive and make my D drive larger for the Windows 8 install.
temporarily disable hibernation (this deletes hiberfil.sys), then reboot the computer.
