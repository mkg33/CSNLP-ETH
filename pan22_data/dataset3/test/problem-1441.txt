Unfortunately some programs are "clever" enough to spot the difference between a loop device and a cdrom.
The short answer tho, is that for anything that actually tries to send commands to the drive, mount doesn't cut it; whether it be at the command-line or the UI.
Look for the CONVERT in the header (between New Image and Resize Image)
Try converting your .dmg to a .iso or something else.
In general .dmg files are using the hfs file system where as CDs are using the iso9660 or UDF file systems.
If you aren't willing to pay for Toast I imagine that something like Michelle Six's answer will work.
The mounting methodology is probably not your problem.
You could try to mount the .iso to the mount point of your cd-drive with mount -o loop -t iso9660 /PATH/XXX.iso /PATH/TO/CD-MOUNTPOINT Just open a terminal and hack the command in.
it will depend on what you want to do, but if you need to convert the format to CD/DVD.
But i don't know where your cd's usally get mounted.
There's a third-party workaround for this at http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/33355/virtual-cd-rw - it's not free, and I haven't tried it, but it does have a 2 week trial.
I needed it to get VM Fusion to read a ISO file...
A work around for this is to convert your .dmg into a .cdr  here's how
Then do: sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 /PAT/XXX.iso /PATH/TO/CD-MOUNTPOINT If it is a DVD the type might no be iso9660 in this case mount should throw an error with the right type.H
Most likely the problem is that something is looking at the file system.
