FIRST PROBLEM is that first Apache2 ignore VirtualHost second.example.com at all... because in local DNS second.example.com is routed to real second.example.com
If you need to have second.example.com in the Host: header, because the second sever only responds correctly with that virtual host name (and that name is also in its TLS certificate), add 192.168.0.2 second.example.com in the /etc/hosts of your first server.
ProxyPass rule to new DNS record https://second-on-second.example.com
Then, if both of the web servers are inside your NAT, second.example.com isn't probably resolving to your internal IP address (lets say second A 192.168.0.2), which may cause a second problem.
I'm port forwarding port 443 to my first local server (where is first.example.com running on 443), but second.example.com runs on sencond web server.
Could me anybody help how do working proxying of web
Same error will ocurrect, when I change ProxyPass to IP of second server.
I need to proxing of HTTPS pages, that hidden behind router.
If you don't need to have TLS inside your internal network, use plain HTTP between the servers:
And I need set proxy on first server to proxing me pages from second server.
SECOND PROBLEM when I change DNS to second.example.com routed to first server.
On the first server, have the following reverse proxy configuration:
than my browser did not show content of HTTPS comunication, because od SNI error... because now certificate didn't coresponding domain.
The VirtualHost should BE first.example.com, doing a reverse proxy to second.example.com:
