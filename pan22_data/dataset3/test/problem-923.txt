Also, individual servers can be given different IP addresses for different reasons.
This can also help if a cable gets cut or unplugged.
This is useful if they need more bandwidth (sometimes incorrectly referred to as speed) than they can get from one internet connection, because they can send some data through different internet connections.
If one goes down, the others take the job of the failed server.
There are a number of sites that provide free secondary DNS hosting, such as:
So currently, I only have one IP assigned to my cPanel server.
I am not quite following your English here, but what I think you are asking is how you should best go about having 2 name servers when you only have 1 IP address and 1 server.
The fact that the VPS (and sites) are on the same IP address anyway really defeats the purpose of having a backup DNS.
The most common reason for a server to have multiple external IP addresses is in case the internet connection goes down.
It's absolutely pointless to have a second nameserver kick in to point users to a dead or unreachable server.
This is usually done when a company doesn't have or doesn't want to use enough external IP addresses to give each server an IP.
Also, servers sharing an IP address (through network address translation or clustering) can sometimes see what name was used to connect, so requests to name1 at IP1 can go to serverA, and requests to name2 also at IP2 can go to serverB.
That way if a router goes down somewhere or for some other reason a subnet becomes unreachable your server still has a way to perform DNS resolution.
The idea is that the two IP addresses for the nameservers are in completely different subnets.
Well, the best thing I can recommend is that you run your primary DNS server om your cPanel server and assign that to ns1.yorudomain.com, and then use a third party to act as a secondary name server and assign them as ns2.yourdomain.com (or ns0 and ns1 whatever numbering scheme you like).
Different IP addresses can map to different services the server offers, or to provide load balancing on their network to make sure one part of the network isn't too stressed.
By this way, I have two IP addresses for their respective nameservers provided which is like the common case, but I don't have the ability to edit the DNS records in cPanel UI and CNAME records must be defined manually each time new domain registered.
Or your network provider may be able to act as a secondary DNS for you.
When NS1 is offline or unreachable, the sites will be down too.
If a domain pointed to this DNS, I can manage the records from Rackspace client area and A record can be set to my cPanel server IP address to serve the hosted web site.
Because of limited IP v4 availability, I cannot buy an IP except for HTTPS and load balancing.
cPanel user with the domain pointed to this server directly are able to manage the DNS records in the cPanel UI, it will autogenerate CNAME for cpanel., webmail., ftp.
If the Internet Service Provider the server is connected to goes down or gets unusably slow, the server can switch over to a different connection.
(1) I am not really understood how two IP addresses (can be more than two) is useful and making sure network up time 99% because both IPs pointed to the same server (I think both may have same physical network path or am I wrong?)
I am trying to use the case 2 which is common, but not sure what is the strong reasons why common two IP addresses for two nameservers in one server?
I use the same IP for both nameservers without any problem.
(2) Now I have I am using Rackspace Cloud Server and I maintain a cPanel.
What I know the two IP addresses used like if one unreachable, the other will use as a secondary choice and user still can access the same server.
subdomain access, but remember since I only have one IP address, my 1st and 2nd nameserver defined in the cPanel WHM pointed to the same IP:
Multiple servers can share a single IP address through clustering.
Case 2: However Rackspace has DNS server virtually located just outside from the cloud.
Changes to your primary DNS in cPanel will be passed out to your secondary DNS servers through dns-axfr zone transfers, so you will have full control from within cPanel.
