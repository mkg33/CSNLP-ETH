for most users it is better to get informed about potentiall problems BEFORE they write stuff to their disk and thus this is the default behavior.
I love the 12 second boot on my SSD, I hate it when it becomes a 2 min boot because of fsck..
I guess you would have to wait also at shutdown, and may be you would be eager to go home far more than  you are eager to start working at boot time -:)
Would you like to check it now, or wait until later?"
I like your idea.. You should request that as a feature on something like http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/.
Let others vote it up, and see if it can get implemented.. (or if there are technical reasons why not)..
An even better solution would be to use a file system (possibly on another OS) that doesn't need fsck at all, like ZFS.
so, you would rather work on a faulty system and possibly lose the work of a day than getting informed BEFORE you start to work?
Of course, this being Linux I shut down my desktop box only for kernel installs, so it's not a huge issue.
(Same for halt and the other shutdown-like commands.)
However, nothing prevents you to add a rc task that will check your file systems at shutdown time if their counters is close to the limit.
If I were a programmer I'd submit a patch for shutdown that displays a dialog: "The filesystem on /dev/sdd4 will need to be checked after 2 more reboots.
I like CarlF's idea about a dialog warning you, so you can run it early.
It is configurable how many boots (or time) have to elapse until the next check.
nevertheless, you can run the filesystem checks on your system whenever you want.
This is a dubious design and even worse, by murphy law, the fsck will usually happen the day when you are most in a hurry.
