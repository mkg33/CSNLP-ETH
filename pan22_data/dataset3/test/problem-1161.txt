If you create user accounts using other means ("NET USER ... /add", for example) then no userPrincipalName attribute will be assigned to the account.
Or you could use a "Get-adorganizationalUnit" with a -Filter switch and pipe that to a 'Set-ADOrganizationalUnit -Add @{upnsuffixes="@UPNSuffix.com"'
It searches for a specific suffix (the default in most cases) and switches it to another.
That said, I've written a script that runs in task scheduler every few hours at more than one client.
This does not affect however, the default UPN assigned to a user created within that OU.
The script is on my blog but I'll post it here as well :)
You can set the allowed UPN Suffixes, by going into ADSIEDIT.MSC, plug down to the OU Structure, right click the OU (in the default configuration), and edit the OU Attributes.
Set-ADOrganizationalUnit "OU=XXX,DC=Domain,DC=com" -Add @{upnsuffixes="@UPNSuffix.com".
There is no documented mechanism that I am aware of to change the default UPN suffix that gets chosen by Active Directory Users and Computers.
The default UPN suffix is really just a default in AD Users and Computers, not a default of the directory service itself.
AD Users and Computers just happens to be hard-wired to do this.
This can't be done as far as I know (Evan's answer is still true 4 years later).
In this case, users created with an ad.example.com UPN suffix will be updated with example.com suffix.
I believe that the tool is hard-wired to take the first portion of the "canonicalName" attribute defined on the "crossRef" object for the domain specified in "CN=Partitions,CN=Configuration, ..." in your forest.
I found this after looking for quite a while, so I hope this helps anyone.
Create multiple template users for the different UPNS.
Actually, you can run in the Active Directory Module for Powershell:
I'll include a fixed version with a minor improvement at the end of this post (it shows you the names of individual OUs where additional UPN suffixes might be defined).
I'd love to be corrected by somebody more "in the know" than me, but I'm not seeing any way to get AD Users and Computers to act differently.
To create a new user, right click the template user and copy .. fill out the selected fields, and the new user will be created with the proper UPN.
Should you run into the Microsoft KB article with a script in it that shows you how to programmatically obtain the default UPN suffix (http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q269441), beware that the script has a couple of syntax errors in it (lines 17 and 32 are malformed and srrNamingContext on line 32 should be strNamingContext).
Right click the OU, create a new user to use as a template, assign the correct UPN Suffix, and then right click the user once created and disable account.
