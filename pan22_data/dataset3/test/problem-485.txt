That option uses the default video driver/settings.
If your "boot screen" (really the bios UI), then your laptop's LCD screen is good (the monitor).
If the problem is the windows driver, try hitting f8 a few times as soon as you see the "boot screen".
There is probably an icon that looks like a tv screen beneath this key.
Either someone has toggled the optional video out (the option to display video exclusively on an external monitor or tv) or some windows video driver is misconfigured (assuming you are using windows).
As far as switching LCD's between two different laptop makers - its very unlikely they are plug compatible.
Is it possible to simply replace the bad monitor with the working 1.
I've opened both laptops before and I can see they're connected at 2 places (1 location near the power button, and 1 location on the back with 2 wires, 1 black and 1 white wires).
Also the plan to just switch the top is probably not hardware feasible.
If lucky, you'll get a windows boot menu with the option "safe boot".
Most laptops have a some special keyboard key combination to toggle between : laptop display, external video or both.
So is it possible to disconnect these wires from 1 laptop and connect it to the other?
