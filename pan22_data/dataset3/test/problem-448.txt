This is what was used for both server.xml for 8080 and 8081.
When changing server ports it's recommended to use port binding set, which will change all ports.
However when ssl is enabled for 8081 and I visit https:// URL:8484 I get that the web page is unavailable.
However when we tried the same thing for 8081 it did not, note that we removed https for the 8080 server first before enabling it for 8081.
I think problem is that if you run the servers on same machine, you only change 8080 port to 8081, but JBoss server opens more than this one port.
We need to have HTTPS enabled for the 8081 server, firstly we tried enabling https on the 8080 port instance by generating the keystore and editing the server.xml and it successfully worked.
My assumption is that second server fails to open some other ports and start incorrectly.
We have a server with two JBoss instances where one runs on 8080, the other on 8081.
But you won't have 8081 port but 8180 and all ports will be raised by 100.
The only difference was that the port was changed from 8080 to 8081 when trying to enable https for 8081 port instance.
What am I doing wrong and what needs to be changed?
NOTE : When I meant enabled for 8080 I meant when you visit https:// URL:8484 you will actually be visiting the 8080 port instance.
