For example, this NewerTech Universal Drive Adapter from Other World Computing clearly states it “Supports drives up to 6.0TB (6000GB) and beyond.” Get something like that, hook up the drive, mount it, copy the data and there you go!
So if you want to invest some more money in self-recovery efforts, you should get another USB to SATA bridging device that can explicitly support drives larger than 2TB.
I cannot speak for the actual condition of the drive itself since spinning up without making noise is not really the main indication of there not being a hardware failure.
I don’t think it damaged your 3TB drive in any way, but it sure as hell won’t know how to mount it.
Checking the specs on that product page for that Vantec CB-ISATAU2 shows exactly what I suspected; key spec highlighted in bold by me for emphasis:
I have seen tons of drives “spin up” and “sound” perfectly “fine” that are 100% completely dead and uncoverable.
So that cable will never be usable for anything higher than 2TB in capacity like that Seagate drive you have.
What this boils down two is modern SATA controllers divide up into two distinct flavors; those which can only support drives 2TB in capacity or lower and those who can support drives that have a capacity of 2TB or higher.
Your problem is you have a 3TB SATA drive and that Vantec CB-ISATAU2 adapter can only support drives up to 2TB in size.
