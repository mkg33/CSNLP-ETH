This is all working great, but I have the following problem.
Editing the dev-servers webapplication to listen to app-dev is no option, since it is supposed to be an exact copy (not my decision...)
I am searching for an option, to set the /etc/hosts entry only inside the vhost configuration file for app-dev.proxy.domain, so that every other vhost config will just use DNS for app.intern.domain.
This is no problem, but unfortunately the app-dev server runs an exact copy of the app servers webapplication, and this webapplication only responses to it's hostname (app.intern.domain)
Ugly work-around is to use (rather: abuse) the /etc/hosts to point app.internal.domain to localhost and then configure Apache to listen to two additional ports, one for each your app and app-dev.
I can do the second thing, by adding "10.0.1.2 app.internal.domain" in /etc/hosts, but that also means that app.proxy.domain will land on the dev-server.
I have set up an apache http reverse proxy, to proxy requests from *.proxy.domain to *.intern.domain.
The apache is the only way to reach my internal webapplications from an external network.
Possibly you could use mod_headers in conjunction with mod_proxy.
hopefully you guys can help me with a proxy problem I have.
