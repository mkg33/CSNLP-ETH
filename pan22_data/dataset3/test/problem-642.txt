For instance, the PC USB port might not be delivering the necessary current to power correctly the HDD, thus triggering errors.
This disk contains a lot of family photos and recording so, in advance, i thank You all for your assistance..
I have a sata hdd which is recognized in BIOS and startup, but throws an error for corrupted data when accessed from My Computer, but when I connect the disk to a device that has no RAM memory ( like older TV sets with usb or dreamboxes, cable recivers) I can access data on it ( pictures and videos )..is there any way to extract and recover data without formatting this disk.
You can either use the included Linux file manager, the command line or some of the more advanced tools like TestDisk or ddrescue to transfer or recover your data.
You should verify if the external caddy (if any), the cables (SATA or USB), and the USB port on the PC are functioning properly.
Then, I suggest you try a Live CD like PartedMagic.
The best way to handle this would to be verify if you have a good connection between the HDD and the PC.
