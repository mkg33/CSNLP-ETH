Not sure about portabilty because a list of network interfaces may be related to the kernel implementation and linux is not related at all to *bsd/mac... however if ifconfig is not good for you you can try netstat -i
Does anybody have a portable way to get this information so it can be used on the majority of unices (linux, *bsd, mac).
If you want to also include interfaces which are currently down (inactive), simply add the -a flag as follows:
It is used mostly by the puppet config management program to grab metadata from installed machines, but it can be run in a standalone fashion for similar purposes.
Its output does include information about network interfaces found on the machine, and its formatting will be consistent across platforms.
I would like to get the list of all active network interfaces (e.g.
The following will return a list of active interfaces on all the common Linux distros:
I assume I'll have to parse the output of ifconfig, but the formatting is different across the various OS's.
As far as I know, there is no common method which can be used on any POSIX system to retrieve a list of network interfaces, so you'll have to localize your command for the OS currently in use.
