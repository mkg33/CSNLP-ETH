this is not the answer to your question, but have you tried yakuake?
Took me a bit to figure this out, I thought the hotkeys were broken broken, and I REALLY use WIN-S to open a shell, WIN-C for calculator, and many more.
Goto "System Settings" from the main panel launcher (For a default install of KDE it will be in the favorites tab, but you can also do a search for this using the main panels launcher's search bar by typing in the words "system settings" without quotes.
In this section you should see an icon labeled "Shortcuts and Gestures" (this icon should be the 6th icon from the left towards the right).
Or to do this in the current version of KDE 4.8.4,
its almost the same as the answer given by Nikhil Chelliah, its just that some things have been renamed.
Now, when you create/edit the shortcut keys in the KMenu, they will be active and work immediately (as we both expect!!)
In the system settings panel you will see 5 titled rows or sections that group various tasks together.
Select the 'Custom Shortcuts' on the left column, then make sure the 'KMenuEdit' entry is CHECKED.
From here you can finish following the steps given by, Nikhil Chelliah, except that your activate check box might not be labeled, but it should be fairly obvious at this point what the gist of things are.
For some reason, the kmenuedit shortcuts were shipped 'disabled' in the recent KDE releases.
Look in the 1st section at the top tittled "Common Appearance and Behavior".
Alternatively you can also press ALT+F2 and type in "system settings" without quotes to get to the system settings panel.
Go to System-Settings, then Shortcuts-And-Gestures.
