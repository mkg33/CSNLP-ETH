Now that updates have started, wonder if they'll ever reverse that policy :-(
Not to mention, isn't Chrome considered a Beta product??
(Or rather, yes I know, the pages aren't build to exacting standards - regardless, the problem exists)
You don't get any NTDLM domain credential pass through for intranet sites, which is very easy to manage in IE and doable in FF.
I've personally run across quite a few compatibility problems with it on certain websites.
Things easily handled by me, that I feel would confuse the average user.
You're also going to be missing out on integrated authentication (unless Chrome supports it, I must be honest and say I've not tested that), meaning you've just doubled your user/password management overhead and have started leading your users down the path of yellow sticky notes.
You then have to consider this situation with non-technical users.
thus they prevent it from running at work via windows policy controls.
If so, how are the users going to know when it hasn't rendered a page correctly?
bugfix response for chrome has been slower than other browsers,
Only a handful of our (100 strong) IT team has it installed.
However, we still have to use IE or FF for certain intranet apps, as Chrome doesn't handle/render those apps correctly.
Aside from lack of management via GPOs (which is an essay in itself), your use of MS intranet technologies will mean that any browser that doesn't have ActiveX support, or even that has ActiveX but not to the same degree as IE, is effectively useless.
I would personally say Chrome is several years away from being enterprise ready - certainly for our enterprise.
Chrome doesn't play nice with certain sharepoint web parts.
