I'm not an expert on time series, but I have a general advice: may I suggest you to try other packages (and various parameters) to see, if there are any differences in results.
Also, unless you have to use Python, I'd recommend to take a look at the R's extensive ecosystem for time series analysis: see http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/timeseries.html and http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html.
Gas usage has a daily cycle but there are also secondary weekly and annual cycles that the ARIMA may not be able to capture.
If you can obtain temperature data for the same period check if there is a correlation between the temperature and gas usage.
There is a very noticeable difference between the weekday and Saturday data.
As @Aleksandr Blekh said R does have good packages for ARIMA models
Try creating a subset of the data for each day of the week or splitting the data into weekday and weekend and applying the model.
I'm trying to use ARMA/ARIMA with the statsmodel Python package, in order to predict the gas consumption.
In particular, you may want to check the standard stats package (including functions arima() and arima0), as well as some other packages: FitARMA (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FitARMA), forecast (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast) and education-focused fArma (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fArma), to mention just a few.
