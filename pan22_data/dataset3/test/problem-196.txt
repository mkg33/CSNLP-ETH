I would say if you are really concerned about it try and find a copy of the license and see what it says.
In my opinion the general purpose/intent behind software licenses revolves around actual usage, since these computers are shutdown and inoperable I would speculate that you are ok. Are you using this software on other computers with updated licenses?
Some EULAs do state explicitly that when you are no longer licensed you must destroy all copies of the software.
While I personally agree that an inoperable machine with unllicensed software installed should be OK, if a license explicitly states removal of the software after license expiry, then that may be the best option in terms of liability.
I would say that if you are done with the software then there is no wrong doing.
That said, I a not a lawyer and as stated above the best solution would be to consult the EULA for the software and/or contact the vendor concerned
It depends on what's written in the software license agreement (or EULA).
The best thing you can do here is to ask the vendor of the product.
usually limit their functionality when the license expires anyways implying that you are now operating in a license free mode.
I guess there is no general answer for your question.
Also, generally speaking, software with time limited licenses (such as virus protection et al.)
