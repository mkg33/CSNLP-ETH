http://spoon.net/browsers/ - this site allows you to download and run multiple browsers AND versions of browsers without needing to actually install them.
This will also be useful if you want to look at the site in multiple different versions of the same browser (IE6, IE7, IE8 etc), without having to go through installing each version, checking the site then moving on to the next version.
They have a free version of their service that might fit your needs.
Litmus is made by the folks that make doctype, which is another member of the Stack Overflow League of Justice.
They each get virtualized into their own little sandbox automatically.
Another alternative is to use some addons, such as those in Firefox, under Windows, that will actually launch an IE session, from inside of Firefox, which means that for the two biggest browsers, you can test them under a single program, Firefox.
As well, Opera also has some settings where you can "fake" the actual browser name reported to the web server.
Another one would be Expression Web with SuperPreview which is much nicer integrated into web authoring tools.
I've used this site QUITE regularly for testing our sites we design.
