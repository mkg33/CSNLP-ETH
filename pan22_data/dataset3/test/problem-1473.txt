You can use Gui4Cli as a language in the Notepad++.
Then, when I'm done with that task, I put a '#' in front of it to make a comment (which color-codes the line as green and you can customize the color).
This will leave the text as it is in the normal text format, but you will be able to use // and /* */ to comment the finished tasks and mark them as green.
I know this is like a year+ later, but there is a feature in Notepad++ to "Hide Lines" just highlight and right click.
I searched for what you need (and I need too) but with no luck.
Not as good as a strike-through but it gets the job done.
Then at the bottom of the menu, there is a Hide Lines feature which Hides a specified line and then can be clicked to be reopened.
Notepad++ has LED markers for each line, basically a blue light that you can turn off and on (click on the grey bar to the left of your text and immediately to the right of the line number)
As a work-around until that happens, what I'm doing is setting the language of my to-do list (a .txt file) to the "Properties" language.
Also, On the left side next to the line number you can click on the line number and it will put a blue circle which can act as a checkbox.
If you don't have option to strikethrough your style, you can set style to use some strikethroug font.
I couldn't find a plugin and I think creating one would be the best way to go.
I'm also seeking a solution for this problem (using Strikethrough for a to-do list).
