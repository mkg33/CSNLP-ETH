Make sure your documentation process is up to scratch and automate as much of it as possible.
They are your number one source of information and will know the problems and bottlenecks better than anyone else.
Get feedback from the sysadmins (and possibly even developers) as to how processes could be improved.
Jumping in after reading ITIL and telling the sys admins "the new law" might get you some unhappy sys admins.
Number one thing to quiz your team about on is backup and recovery - make sure that's covered.
Automate, automate and automate (and document all the automations).
As Tom Kyte says in relation to Database Administation, backup and recovery is the one thing you cannot afford to get wrong.
This 3 aspects should make you team productive, your team members replaceble.
As a sysadmin, I'd recommend you to focus your team on:
Consider writing a server dashboard that allows them to quickly check how all the servers are running and what versions of software are installed on various boxes.
Don't expect to read an ITIL book and know everything but it is a good place to start.
Consider starting with ITIL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library
People always forget to add notes to wikis about deployments and upgrades.
Review that first, document it, especially any risks and the level of service you can commit to and plug any gaps between reality and business expectation.
What I would suggest is sitting them down and discussing with them how best to improve the documentation, and how to cover time tracking/etc.
