Back in XP, people didn't have to worry about this stuff, so they could use API calls and low-level hackery without fear.
Log on as admin (or user if he has admin rights), browse to the folder, open properties and under security explicitly add the user by name and give them full control.
Now Vista and 7 exist, they can't, but the stuff is already inside the program, and too central to remove.
MAKE SURE THERE IS ANOTHER ADMIN ACCOUNT ON THE SYSTEM then take them out of the admins group.
Log off and on, test, revert if it it does not work
The "Vista compatible" version is probably one that was told to need admin rights before it was run - before, it would probably fail if you didn't run it as administrator.
Most likely because it's been coded a little rubbish.
Have a feeling it is simply a folder permissions problem, and it needs the user to have full access to the program's installed folder location eg program files\quarkXpress 8.1\ (or whatever it is these days, long time since I used it).
IIRC this problem existed on XP too, you had to have admin rights then (but so many people did that they often did not realise the problem).
