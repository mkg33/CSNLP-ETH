You may want to double check your upsmon.conf as well and ensure the MONITOR line is correct... should read something like
I THINK locahost is by default but just in case probably better to just add it.
Your upsd.conf should also have the IPs and ports it is supposed to listen to.
I thought it was a cabling issue but it was actually a configuration issue.
If it isn’t properly configured then upshid will keep doing that if it can’t speak to the UPS properly.
Not sure if that helps but I was racking my brain on that one too.
Turns out by reducing the poll interval rate my problem is fixed.
First, make sure there's not 2 instance of the driver running and fighting each other.
I had the exact same problem, and after a couple hours of digging I figured out a way to make it work.
Then, stop the nut server and driver and edit the ups.conf file:
I use netserver because I use the orangepi to send the UPS info to multiple servers in my rack.
I don’t think it is necessary for a one UPS configuration but you may want to try adding the bus that the UPS is on.
Just some things I did to manage to get two UPSes to work on mine and looking at what you’re doing.
One last thing to check would probably be the nut.conf and decide how you want nut to run.
From what I understand it runs as a nut user and there is a udev rule that should be there for it to be able to access the UPS via USB.
