It sounds to me like you've got startup / shutdown scripts that might be running and referencing resources on servers outside your office.
Get a box with two NICs, bridge them, and use Wireshark to sniff on the bridge with the PC connected to one NIC and the LAN to the other.
I'll keep you all posted, thanks for your feedback thus far guys.
I'm going to also recommend sniffing the traffic on a PC during startup or whatever other times are slow.
If that's the case, it may be inadvertantly querying a remote DC across the WAN.
Run RSoP and see what's applying to one of your machines for startup / shutdown scripts.
My boss has agreed to let me rebuild a machine and prevent it from installing, to test.
Upon further investigation, I found that it apparently does a lot more than push software.
Look for software assignments, too, and see if they're referring to off-site servers.
I think it's safe to say that this is causing our performance problems.
Odds are good the permissions will be such that you can go out and read the scripts and see waht they're doing.
I've also seen admins who don't understand DFS and try to do software installations across a WAN.
You'll get to see what your PC is trying to talk to during those "slow times".
It is a complete IDS and antivirus solution (in addition to Symantec Antivirus for some reason), with about 6 related processes running on each machine.
After reading the comments from  Dayton Brown and sysadmin1138, I had a poke around the startup scripts, and I noticed the installation for an app we use to push software packages to remote machines.
