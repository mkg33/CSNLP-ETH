For me the solution was to have my Tool running as "Administrator" Account.
I guess it must have something to do with the Website-User that might have not enough rights to access the lync client.
My Site should make an automatic call via the Lync client if someone does a certain action on the website.
On my notebook calling the tool over the Website works while debugging in VS2012.
This function LyncClient.GetClient(); is built in.
I simply create a file if the call should start and delete it when it should stop.
The Tool checks every view seconds if that File exists and only does the Lync call if it exists.
For that reason a batch file gets called and that bat file calls my programm with parameters.
I have a tricky question and hope that someone could help me out (really important for me).
MS has some compability problems with all the Lync SDKs with the different Lync Client / Lync Server Versions and Visual Studio Versions.
I know that's not the best way, but it works for my deadline.
The problem occurs when my mvc website calls the program especially this function LyncClient.GetClient(); I get an exception "The host process is not running".
I know that the process is running because I can close it via task manager and it gets called via my program when I run it again.
This sounds like a coding question for stackoverflow but everything works fine on my pc and even on the server when my program gets called manually.
