There are several posts on this site already explaining why.
I have tried using a splitter, and then two splitters.....only one PC gets internet at a time.
Most models start with 4 ports, which will give you a spare on for the future (e.g.
I would recommended purchasing a network switch (not a hub!
If this "one" ethernet port is your WAN or the one coming out of your modem, and it doesn't have a built in router, or your modem only provides one WAN address, then it would make more sense to get a router instead of a switch.
if you ever want to add a printer, or connect a laptop, ...)
If this is your scenario, I think it would be safer to get a router rather than buying a switch, just to find out you need a router.
I have two PCs which need to share one ethernet port.
A router can hand out dhcp address's to your two client computers and provide security.
Hubs are designed for this explicitely (to "share" an ethernet port).
Here is a useful link explaining the differences between a Hub and a Switch
if both need to be on at the same time or if you do not want to continuously plug in and remove cables: Get a switch with at least 3 ports.
Usually it is much less hassle to just buy a cheap switch.
Where the --- are Ethernet cables and the #'s aqre network cards.
Note that to use the network from PC2 you will need to have PC1 powered up and properly configured.
