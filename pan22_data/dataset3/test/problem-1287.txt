As a student I can't give proper advice as to what is done in the industry, however, when working on a group project the programmers were "in charge" and told the artists exactly what they needed.
give them the code and let them play with my app until they think output is good enough.
as a coder I just ask them what assets are the going to create, and then create a sample asset of those properties.
In addition to the guidelines provided at the beginning of the project they were also expected to follow the requirements provided by the programmers.
There was a lot of going back and forth when an artist didn't understand that the color R:254, G:0 B:254 was COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the required R:255 G:0 B:255, was therefore unusable, and they had to start over.
This may involve the coders writing exporter plugins for artists.
But there is no standard way of distributing art since there is no standard way of consuming or using art.
The standards should be, "whatever the code department needs, within reason".
It's just down to what the technology pipeline requires.
