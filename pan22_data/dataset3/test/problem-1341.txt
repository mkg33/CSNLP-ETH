3)There has been an issue w/ some PERC card batteries (the raid controller) in the 2950s that we have had lately.
As it was mentioned above install Dell OpenManage - its an administrative application that runs in Windows and allows you to look @ the hardware health/firmware levels.
Go to the logs in OpenMange and look @ the battery.
This will wreck your DB performance and is due to a bad PERC card battery.
When this happens, in our case 1x a day, you raid controller goes to write through vs write back.
If you install Dell OpenManage you can also see this.
Without more information I'd say you're likely just seeing the limitations of your hardware.
You may see it doing its quarterly discharge more often.
Alternatively you can just enter PE 2950 and it will show you all the available firmware/software.
EDIT:  Also if your workload is heavy write then a battery backed up cache on the RAID controller and setting it's mode to Write-Back may improve the situation considerably.
But in reality the number and type of drives are always going to dictate the number of IOPS that your storage system is capable of.
RAID0 is the only option for improving performance if you only have 2 drives.
Tuning your workloads etc can buy you a bit but you're normally talking a few percentage points at that point.
Enter either the ST (service tag) of the server, which should be posted on the front bezel area or the back.
However I wouldn't recommend it as there's no redundancy there and is more prone to data loss than a single drive.
2)Download the firmware updates that are out there, check the most current level vs what you have installed (view in OpenManage).
It doesn't really improve the performance over a single drive, maybe very slightly for reads.
Select the OS you are running in the drop-down and you will get the correct list.
If you have at least 4 drives you can try using RAID10 if your controller supports it.
