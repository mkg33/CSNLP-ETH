I've tested GPU virtualization under Supermicro compute node with 2 NVIDIA Tesla C2050.
I should notice that GPU virtualization feature in GUI is not free under the free version of Xen Server.
I could connect two GPUs to two different CentOS virtual machines.
VMWare Workstation has it as an experimental feature.
VMWare Workstation is a good choice, but not free.
ESXi has a web interface which can be used for console access to VMs, and will work fine over the 'net.
Under the hood of Xen Server, you can create new virtual machines and forward host's PCI slot to any vm.
If you can only run VMs on top of an existing Windows/Linux installation as you'll be using it for other tasks, then it depends on your choice of OS.
But you can always use command line to forward PCI slot.
As for the rest of it - Are you able to dedicate a piece of hardware to be a VM host, or does this need to run on top of your existing operating system?
We were successful in our lab ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gtmwnx-k2qg
If you're dedicating some hardware, then Citrix XenServer or VMWare ESXi are excellent, comparable choices, and both are free.
