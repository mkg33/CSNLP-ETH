The plant does not need to be in the center of the picture but the picture should contain something important i.e.
any decent modern camera now a days is more than enough to capture these fine details.
Another method would be to artificially blow up your dataset using image augmentation.
The approach you have mentioned of taking N images every X days is ok if you have the workforce to complete this task.
AUgmenting a useless image will create more useless images.
a feature that can be helpful to classify that plant.
The location of the plant inside the image is important.
Any decent camera will be more than enough for the task as long as the classification does not need features like the patterns on leaf or edges or anything like that.
Yes, in deep learning (image classification) more is merrier and there are several ways to do this.
There are several libraries available to do this task and you can increase the size of your dataset by many times.
This augmentation will including rotating the plants, cropping, blurring, zooming, and much more.
If the picture does not have anything important in it, then there is nothing that the model would gain from them.
