We're talking about less than 0.1s difference here... (120ms - 30ms = 90ms = 0.09s)
In addition, if your clients are Windows-based, you might never see the improvement; Windows' DNS Resolver caches successful DNS lookups for hours (unless you reduce the cache duration in the registry).
When visiting websites I see the results are filling up the server's DNS cache.
Assuming that the CPU is not overtaxed/under-rated, you might consider adding memory or adjusting the swap configuration (possibly reducing its size, if possible).
But when using the benchmark tool namebench I see that my server's mean responds time is almost 4 times slower in comparison with my default ISP DNS server.
You might consider the sizing of your server - CPU, memory, swap configuration, etc.
I have set up a local DNS server on a Windows Server 2008 machine.
Assessing the concurrently running applications/system features may also be another consideration, where unneeded/non-essential applications/features are disabled.
Is there a way I could speed up or optimize the DNS server?
To put things in perspective: Do you need < 50ms performance?
It's a case of diminishing returns here: The efforts to optimize Windows' DNS Server in order to realize a 0.1s difference just doesn't seem worth it.
