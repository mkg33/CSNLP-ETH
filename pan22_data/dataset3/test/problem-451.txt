One last thing I can offer, is to use Ansible with inventory.
I don't know if you prefer that the commands will run in parallel or serial.
I'm trying to build a command list, and then execute commands on each server.
I'm unable to generate the command list in a way that can be eval'd correctly on each server.
How can I execute scripts from arguments on multiple servers?
If you want, I wrote a shell script which wraps the parallel-ssh command and allows the user to supply a servers list and commands and the script will issue the commands on all the servers in parallel.
If you want the commands to be run in parallel, you can use the parallel-ssh tool which can be installed in both CentOS/Ubuntu flavor OS's.
I would do this with Puppet Bolt.. it allows advocacy commands to be run remotely with ease.
Just download Puppet Bolt (FREE) and use that to issue the command on a provided list of hosts.
If you prefer running in serial then you can do something like:
Essentially I'd like to log into each server in the $server_array and execute either all of the commands in $script_arr or just the selected command.
Just install bolt and make sure you have ssh keys set up on all hosts
