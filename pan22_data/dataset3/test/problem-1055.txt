Note: .format() is used to put values into the string, like in this example, whatever string inputted_word is assigned to will replace {0:}.
For readability and sense, use True and False instead.
actually isn't the index to the last letter — it's off by one.
Counting loops are nearly always better done using of range(), xrange(), enumerate(), or something from itertools.
Don't do unnecessary things in code: it makes it a lot more complicated.
Der_Lett (a cryptic abbreviation for "dernière lettre"?)
Here is a more compact way to write it, using a generator expression:
It is best you put your raw_input statement outside the function to allow it to be reusable and can be accessed in other pieces of code.
Your function takes its input from the keyboard (or stdin), which makes it not reusable.
By using [::-1], you can flip a string, which is needed to check whether a string is a palindrome or not.
I don't understand though why adding 1 to the len is required.
Now if that is the entire program, then use print instead of return as you need to assign the returned value to a variable and print it out, which is cumbersome.
Now if the input will always be used for that one function, then you can keep the statement within the function.
Please, use a proper separation of tasks: do not ask for input in the method that should only check whether the input string is a palindrome.
There is no need to check whether the string's length is even or odd nor convert strings to lists as strings can be indexed and checked as if they were lists.
You should never return None or 0000 in this case.
PEP 8 naming conventions apply to your variable names, même en français.
None practically is nothing and 0000 seems like False to me.
There is no need to handle odd and even lengths as separate cases.
If you want to accept keyboard input, it should be done outside the function.
If not already, use the PEP 8 convention for your code.
200_success' generator expression seems to me the must succinct and practical.
Also, allow the user to type in the same line, so \n is not needed.
Even more unusual is the fact that you return None if it's a palindrome, and return 0000 if it's not.
A palindrome-checking function should accept a string parameter and return a result.
