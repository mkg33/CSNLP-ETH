We have a Tomcat instance that connects to multiple service providers as a sort of "gateway."
All in all, the solution is overshadowing the problem and I wanted to reach out to you guys and see if you know of a better solution, or anything else that might help.
The problem is that we need to monitor the file for more than just a given string, we need to use several regular expressions to filter through all the meaningless stuff so that we aren't waking up at 3am because a user forgot his password.
This Tomcat instance will generate errors if it cannot connect to a given provider.
Just to give you an idea of how complicated this "script" is, here are the MINIMUM files/folder that must exist for it to work:
I really do not look forward to being the sole maintainer for this fracking band-aid.
Well, in the end we went with an overcomplicated Python script to do the job until something more viable comes along.
I already tried creating a python script that would sit between Zabbix and Tomcat, but with log files (that are rotated daily) that are in excess of 200MB, it's too CPU intensive (100% for 15+ seconds).
I tried adding a "sleep(0.000005)" to slow it down a bit, but now it takes to long (> 1min) and still uses 25% CPU...
