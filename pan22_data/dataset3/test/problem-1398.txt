And I don't think the Private Tab addon was mentioned yet.
This would not only give you discrete sessions, but the possibility of entirely different setups for different purposes.
That gets you two sessions (albeit in two different windows, rather than tabs) out of the box.
You could run two (or more) entirely independent and physically differentiated instances using Firefox Portable.
If you have more than one user account set up on your machine you could do a Run As on Firefox to open a second (third, etc) window up as a brand new Windows user, this would get you totally independent windows with independent sessions, but again in different windows.
EDIT: This obviously only helps if the application in question is GMail though!
Then you get a new browser session, which will not use the same session as the one logged into gmail.
For Firefox use the private Browsing as others have suggested.
I've never used it, but the GMail Manager addon for Firefox may help you to do this.
Just extract the program to two (or more) locations, edit \Other\Source\FirefoxPortable.ini to read AllowMultipleInstances=**True**, and you have two functionally independent Firefox browsers.
It seems to create the same effect as separate private browsing windows, but in neighboring tabs.
The Multifox Firefox plugin may work for you: br.mozdev.org/multifox
Easiest way to do that in Internet Explorer is to do the following:
People often use it to maintain a clean browser "image" that can be reset.
Sandboxie would probably work along the same lines as ThinApp or Browser Sandbox.
Internet Explorer 8's "Private Browsing mode" gives you a totally independent session with no shared cookies or other login details.
You can't do the same thing in Firefox as Firefox 3.5's "Private Browsing" mode is more of a toggle, it closes and saves your main session first.
