I don't want to keep this Internal server as a production server since it's not as good a setup as we have in AWS on several aspects.
There are third party services, but they introduce a single point of failure and sincerely I have a much easier time trusting my AWS setup than those.
We have a backup policy in place where we have at least 3 places with all the data from our main server one of those is exactly the same webserver running our Webapp inside our company network.
Is there anyway to configure a dns to only use an A record when all other A records are unresponsive?
So we Have a server on AWS for our website and we use another provider for our e-mails.
I've been looking for a solution that allowed for this internal server to become a turnkey solution in case something went wrong with our AWS setup
As for right now we have this server setup on another domain and I would need to manually add the A record in case of failure, which in that case would cause some downtime.
I can't just setup another A record and turn off the backup webserver since it will try to make some clients connect and that will fail.
