I am not worried about doing damage to the hard drive or the computer, just me!
It shattered into many small pieces all of which were very sharp.
If you drop or bend them, they can shatter to to quite small, painful shards.
I recently opened a deceased Seagate laptop drive.
I have a couple of dozen pairs in a desk drawer :-)
I would really enjoy taking the drive apart and looking at it.
I took it to work to show my coworkers and flexed one thinking it was maybe aluminium or magnesium.
( I have had trouble with this brand in the past but that is another story) The platters in it were indeed glass but looked and felt like metal.
This drive was manufactured in 2011 so yours may be different.
If you were to pinch some flesh between them you could end up with a minor but painful hematoma or laceration.
I don't think this applies to laptop hard drives, but the platters in some older desktop drives used to be made of glass.
I have an old laptop at my disposal that has a malfunctioning HDD in it.
However, I would like to ensure that I am not going to end up with lead poisoning or any thing like that.
If you let them stick together it will require significant force and a wedge of some kind to separate them.
Lead in solder, and other metals are present, of course, but not in forms that would be hazardous.
When separated by a small distance (3-4mm) they can exert several kilograms of force, which increases quadratically as they get closer together.
Some of the funnest parts inside a hard drive are the small but quite powerful magnets that work with the voice coil to move/position the read/write heads.
The only "danger" I've ever encountered is the voice-coil permanent magnets.
So, my question is, are there any health hazards associated with the contents of an internal HDD (that was placed in a computer manufactured in 2004)?
As others have stated, there isn't likely to be anything immediately hazardous inside a hard drive of that vintage.
I've taken a number of them apart and never seen or heard of anything in any form that could be easily ingested or absorbed that would be toxic.
