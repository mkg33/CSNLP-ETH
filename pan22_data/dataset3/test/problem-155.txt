In fact I haven't found information on this subject at all.
Fry's is offering a service to uninstall the software HP, Lenovo, Dell, ect.. put on there to bring the cost of the computer down for you.
Even the Wikipedia page for Windows 8 doesn't seem to mention advertising software.
I bought a Windows 8 laptop from Fry's and saw that there were signs posted throughout the store warning people buying a Windows 8 laptop to ask an associate to help remove the advertising software in order to make the computer faster.
Windows itself does not come with advertising software, what it will have is the maker of the PC will include software to "subsidize" the cost of the PC to make it cheaper that is either time limited trial or contains advertisements built in.
To my surprise I haven't been able to find any tutorials on this subject.
The associate I asked said that it would cost 30$ to have them remove it, so I decided I would do it myself instead, figuring there has to be a tutorial on youtube for how to do that.
There is no tutorial how to do it because all you are doing is just going in to Add/Remove programs and uninstalling any unnecessary or trial software you see.
