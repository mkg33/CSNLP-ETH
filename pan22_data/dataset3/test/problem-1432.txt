Putting trust in my practice, this time I didn't first carefully determined the jack socket's exact whereabouts, but rather, I boldly plugged my headphones where I thought I remembered the jack socket to be.
And I was astonished to my laptop shut down immediately, just like the power was cut off.
I was trying to plug my headphones' audio jack plug to the laptop's audio jack socket while my laptop was operating.
If the computer starts up and works normally, there was likely no permanent damage.
Now I understand that a USB socket is a no place for a jack plug, but nevertheless I'm curious.
However, due to less-than-perfect lighting, I was forced to feel around.
Best case scenario is, there is no permanent damage.
How possible that tampering with a USB  port can destabilize the whole system?
Shoving a metal cylinder into a jack with multiple conductors, including the main 5VDC and Gnd lines for your computer, is likely to short-out the 5VDC line and cause the computer to malfunction or shut down, yes.
On its rightmost side there is an audio jack socket and right next to it a USB socket.
Worst-case scenario is, you may have damaged the 5V regulator and/or other parts.
