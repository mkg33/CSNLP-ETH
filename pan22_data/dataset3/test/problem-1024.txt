The Windows Live Essentials beta includes a Live Sync feature that combines Live Mesh and Remote Desktop capabilites.
Set up an OpenVPN tunnel outwards from the PC you want to access to a machine somewhere (like a VPS) that you do have access to.
There is a video on Channel 9 with more information on Windows Live Sync and how it differs from Live Mesh.
I'm looking to remote into my windows 7 machine (looking to connect to terminal services, not just at a command prompt) from outside my LAN but I currently do not have access to my routers admin page to configure any sort of port forwarding or rules.
From the same folks who give you the (free) LogMein, check out LogMeIn Hamachi.
GoToMyPC works much in the same way, and is really easy to install at both ends (remote host and the client) as everything works over port 80, which is more-often-than-not the default port available.
Edit: I'm looking for a free solution to do this, if possible.
Machine-behind-router ---OpenVPN--> VPS-or-something <---- Some-client-you're-at
I'd then set ssh from the machine I'm at to the open/3rd machine and forward a port (like 3000) to the behind-the-router machine's VPN IP, and connect RDP to localhost:3000.
Slick little "hosted" (brokered may be a better term) VPN solution that makes it very easy for you to get to your PCs regardless of the firewalls in between them.
I've been using it for years for just what you're after.
