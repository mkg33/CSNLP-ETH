So, I have my VPN tunnel up between my DataCenter and my VPC.
route add -net 10.116.0.0/16 gw 10.115.0.1 (depends on your configuration.)
It means all of the traffic to 10.116.0.0/16 will go through 10.115.0.1.
Make sure you have appropriate rules in your DC firewall to allow all traffic from 10.16.x.x subnet to enter into your network.
Evidently, when the RETURN messages were coming into the PAN, they were having the AWS subnet address stripped off of them, replaced with the LOCAL subnet address, and then black-holed because the rules didn't allow ICMP to traverse the security boundary then come back in the same interface.
The next-hop usually means you need to add the destination IP address, netmask and gateway into your routing table.
Traffic passes normally; SQL, RDP, AD, DNS, etc and PING from AWS side to DC side pass, but PING from DC side to AWS FAIL.
There was a check box on the PAN config that said "append local IP range to ICMP requests".
There is a default gateway in your routing table, all of the traffic will go through the default gateway, if you need some traffic to use other gateway, you need to use "next-hop".
what bloody line of the config document that AWS provides gives me the "next-hop" interface IP that I configure my PAN with so i can ping across the tunnel?
