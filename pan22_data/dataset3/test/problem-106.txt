"SSS s  s " - This makes a T shape when displayed with 3 characters per row.
When displayed in the 3x3 grid the 'S' would be across the top with the next two rows containing a space, a 's' and then another space so the handle goes down the middle.
The values used in the strings are up for you to decide but here is just a quick example, again using minecraft recipes as a basis.
If you wanted to get more tricky you could represent the layouts as bitmasks and then just scan for patterns that way but you would potentially lose the 'What type of material' is there and be reduced to just pattern recognition.
For example, 1 2 4 and 5 == 40, but so does 2 4 5 and 5 8.
This seems to be ok with what you were doing however so I figured I would include it.
A number on its own and then the 1 position would also be mathematically the same.
You can use something like what minecraft does and just do a string comparison for patterns that must have matches or character counting for the ones that are shapeless (there is just a boolean that marks a pattern as shapeless or not).
The product will Not work for this as there are too many collisions (different shapes with the same product).
The S represents stone the 's' represents a stick (this association is also set up within the recipe when it is made).
