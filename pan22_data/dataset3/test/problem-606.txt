You need to compile the packages and its dependencies (which you cannot find already installed on the machine) from source and put them in directories like $HOME/bin, $HOME/lib and set up your .bashrc $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly to pick up the correct binaries and libraries on startup.
It was also using solaris I believe but it doesn't matter.
So the only other alternative is to mirror the whole repo on your server using the pkgrepo create and pkgrecv, set up an instance of pkg.depotd locally on your system and add that as a publisher.
The only other alternative is your option 1, of trying to compile packages from source.
Unlike rpm, deb or other common linux packaging formats the Solaris system uses the .p5i format which does not contain all the installation files of the package itself.
I've done this a couple of years back on my department's CSE student login machine.
But even if you do all that, you say that you do not have root privileges on the server and hence you would not be able to install anything using the the Solaris package manager pkg since it would try to install to locations such as /usr/bin, /bin, /sbin, /etc, /lib, /usr/lib.
