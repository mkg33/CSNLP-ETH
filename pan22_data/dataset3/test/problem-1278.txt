To put it differently: policies reflect the flow of data (and it's protection) in the way you have planned and foreseen it.
Firewalls are a lot about planning and foreseeing.
That's why there are implicit DENY policies for each interface pair in FortiOS, as an example.
The loss of RPF is IMHO only a side effect of the 'any' interface.
There is hardly ever a good or mandatory reason not to specify the interfaces in a policy.
In not using this information you prevent the firewall from attaining it's full potential.
When you use any, the rule applies to all interfaces, ie.
FGs apply RPF - in order to accept a source address on an interface there must be an appropriate route out of that interface.
Firewalls are built to prevent deviations from that plan.
Which one is 'shadowing' others, and are explicit policies hit at all, if not, why?
it doesn't matter where the packet enters or is bound to exit the firewall for the policy to be applied.
Try to determine the flow of traffic through, say, 80 firewall policies most of which use the 'any' interface.
This route is used all the time if you use an 'any' interface, even for traffic of unknown origin.
A better way may be to set a route with a high metric that won't ever get used.
So, essentially you're not required to use interfaces in the policies at all times.
There is always a price you pay for convenience: loss of control and time while maintaining and debugging.
Usually, if the protected networks are connected to the internet you need a default route.
RPF can be disabled by turning on asymmetric routing (config system setting, set asymmetric enable), disabling stateful inspection on the way.
You do have the information about which network exists (or is routed to) behind each interface.
