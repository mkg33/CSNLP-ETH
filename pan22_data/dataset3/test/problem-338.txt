It was in a big white "toothpaste-like" container.
I think I did a good job of applying it as the computer hasn't had any problems, in fact it seems to be running better than before.
Unless you do some serious overclocking thermal paste does not matter that much, provided it is present and applied correctly.
I've read many articles that I should have 99% Alcohol... not to use petroleum based cleaners... naphtha ehh... anyway, I ended up buying arctic 5 and it turns out my friend had some thermal paste.
If the paste was of "not so good" quality it may dry out faster and then you can replace it.
I've taken my laptop apart and separated the cooling mechanism and cleaned off the cpu.
No reason to change only because of the brand name, do it if you're having issues.
I did this because I had separated the fan/cooling from the cpu when taking it apart in the past thus the thermal paste/bond was no longer "good".
Now that the arctic 5 has arrived, I'm wondering what's the point of taking this laptop apart again to re-clean the cpu and use the artic 5 thermal paste.
Changing the paste in a laptop is a bit risky, because mobile processors usually do not have covers, so it is easy to damage the die.
