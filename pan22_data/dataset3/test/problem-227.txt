Good hardware controllers with good linux support :
I ran the file server for a very similar company/situation.
This was all setup about 5 years ago and if I were setting it up today I would use OpenSolaris and ZFS.
ZFS has some other very nice features that make it a better choice but there are other questions on serverfault that go into that.
RAID is used for drive redundancy, LVM can be used to break up your RAID device into logical volumes, it is used for easy resizing, and for taking snapshots.
It will provide lots of SATA connectors for your drives, redondancy via RAID-5 or preferably RAID-6, and may provide better performance too.
My experience shows that unless you use dual quad-core systems, properly configured hardware RAID will beat software RAID hands down.
Software RAID performance is often better than hardware RAID in benchmarks, however file serving and software RAID are both CPU intensive and compete for your processors while working.
RAID vs LVM isn't really a good comparison they perform separate roles, and are frequently used together.
You can still separate each project into its own file system but without having to micromanage the sizes of the individual volumes.
When the project was done I could archive the job to tape and blow away the logical volume.
You end up having to micromanage the sizes of the logical volumes trying to balance the amount of space allocated to a logical volume so that you had enough space to do your job but not over allocate it and end up wasting space.
In my opinion ZFS simply is the best free solution available today.
I managed the physical and logical volumes with LVM and ran the XFS file system.
So over allocation of space to a logical volume can add up to a lot of unusable space.
Wait a few days, download the by then released 2009.6 version and give it a go on a test machine.
I eventually setup some scripts that monitored the trends in the available space on the logical volumes and would auto grow them.
As a bonus: smb is integrated with ZFS in OpenSolaris and it handles Raid very well.
To connect a lot of drives in the same chassis, a hardware RAID controller is the best tool.
And the file server was serving a sizable rendering farm which could really pound on it.
Our rendering farm was capable of generating many TB's of data a day and if you didn't pay close attention to this you would run out of space in a hurry.
The main reason is ZFS pooled storage approach means less volume management.
What I would do is create a logical volume for each project and then expand it as the project grew.
Basically a 3 person graphics department with 30TB of storage and the shoestring budget of a small company.
This was a very clean way to utilize our storage but there are two drawbacks to this approach.
Even with that in place with 80 or so Logical Volumes there was a lot of unused space tied up in all the logical volumes.
ZFS is really reliable and it sure does make your storage management hell of a lot easier.
In my setup I ran a 3U server running Linux with external hardware RAID6 arrays attached to it.
This would return that space back to the volume group where it would get reallocated to the next project(s).
And about your comment ZFS being new: not very new anymore!
I've already hinted at the 2nd problem....LVM doesn't really do thin provisioning and XFS only allows you to grow a file system.
