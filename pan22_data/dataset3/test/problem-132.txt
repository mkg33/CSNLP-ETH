However I think you'll find a lot more cases (as mentioned above) of people using Lua, Python or other languages in games.
You could probably use the GNU Interpreter for Java or some other such system.
MMORPG Darkfall Online uses Java as a scripting engine.
However, these days it's probably better to consider a language like Python, Lua or Javascript for your embedding needs.
However if you are looking for a JVM langauge for scripting, I'd probably recommend either Clojure or Groovy over Java itself - both are dynamic langauges that are better suited for the interactive development style that you usually want with scripting langauges.
Amusingly, googling for "java interpreters in C++" seems to yield as many (if not more) hits for C++ interpreters written in Java instead of the other way around :)
Lua in particular is very well suited for the task of embedded scripting.
Additionally, you might check the jog interpreter project, which touts itself as, "...a lightweight but reasonably full-featured and fast Java compiler and interpreter."
Of course, the code in that article is probably a tad out of date, so you can also check out these articles as well:
Fortunately the article also appears to be available online.
They're a lot more lightweight and, in the case of Lua in particular, designed with embedding and scripting in mind.
Way back in 1999, an article was published in Game Developer on the subject, entitled "Dirty Java: Using the JNI Within Games."
