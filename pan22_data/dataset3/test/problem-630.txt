The users tell me they don't like reading them on the screen.
Every time someone creates an electronic alternative to paper I see the end users printing it out anyway.
All the printers were attached to this, as well as a Fax-Modem for incoming faxes (which were saved to a File-Share as TIFF instead of printed directly).
In other words, just accept that paper is part of the process and recycle as much of it as possible.
When I was tasked with the responsibilty of reducing paper usage while running IT at an SMB employing about 130 people I used the following novel technique:
At the end of the session, just save the whiteboard to a bitmap or an SVG and start again.
Far more successful than trying to aim for what I firmly believe to be an unattainable goal, is paper recycling.
In the end, we really never needed the print-logging functionalities of the print-server (which was ostensibly it's original purpose).
So to make your office more paper-less you need to provide a better way:
If you have a good projector it's brilliant, and you can actually use it has a huge touchscreen during presentations (it really impresses people).
Staff very quickly got into the habit of relying on email, pdf, doc, xls and reading stuff on their monitors!
because it has online syncronization I can reach all of my "paper" notes from all of my machines as well as any other device with web access.
Bear-in-mind that the reduction in paper records put an increased responsibility of file storage, retrieval and uptime.
I then made sure there were always "issues" with this server (was quite easy to do by 'accidentally' pulling out cables etc.
I also repeatedly refused requests from one department to buy a photocopier, instead giving them a desktop scanner, and telling them to print stuff only if they really needed a hard-copy!!
Because electric documents are very easy to work on, gradually people will not bother printing stuff out because it has no advantage to them.
This is not really answering the question as asked, but a long term observation.
No more common brainstorming on paper, and no double handling typing up whiteboard notes.
A projector projects onto the whiteboard and when you write on it with the special pens (there's four different colours) it actually draws it on the PC and projects it onto the whiteboard as if it really was writing on it.
I equipped the company print-room with a Linux/Samba based Fax/Print Server.
Every single one of those faxes is then printed out before being read.
We ended up investing more into NAS storage for file-shares, redundant backup servers, ERP systems, and offsite 3rd-party reliable email storage capable of large attachments and unlimited inbox size.
Our network fax system dispatches received faxes as emails to the appropriate person.
Over quite a few years (nearly as long as the dream of a paperless office) I've observed that the harder a company tries to create that mythical thing we call the paperless office the more likely that their use of paper increases.
Best way to make people do stuff is making the alternative (your choice) less hassle than what they are doing now.
For my note taking I use Evernote - I've scanned businesscards and bills as well as keep all my notes.
