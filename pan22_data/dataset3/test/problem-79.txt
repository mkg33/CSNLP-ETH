Even if someone were to steal your drives and mount them in another machine, they would have to bypass the encryption software.
When it comes to security, the assumption is if someone has physical access to your computer, then they have full access to the data.
There are plenty of tools built into various Linux OS's as well as 3rd party disk encryption tools.

It offers protection from drive failure, not from data theft.
can also be combined with dropbox (what I do), so you have a backup, and can share encryped files among hosts.
I think you should try Encrypted partitions/file-systems,
for this I use encfs it works in mac, linux and possibly also windows (if anyone cares), you can make a drive that can only be seen with a passphrase, the good thing is that if you need to see it yourself with a live CD you can, provided you remember the passphrase.
RAID does add a layer of complexity, but it is not a security measure in any way.
