I'm looking for a way to, based on the level of frustration, tell the music generation mechanism "this set of parameters is effective", or not.
The music parameters would then adjust automatically and iteratively, as we continue to make judgements of the subject's level of frustration.
I'm using a dynamic Bayesian network to reasonably accurately determine the level of frustration of the subject.
convexity: in theory will this find the local optima, but also more practical concerns around the size/dimensionality of the space and easy of specifying neighboring points and the accuracy/precision of the frustration measurement).
We are working on a system for providing musical feedback to change the 'mood' of a subject.
At the same time, we measure the physiology of the subject.
This will be more or less effective depending on the complexity of the space (e.g.
One basic approach would be a hill-climbing algorithm to search for local optima.
There are a number of parameters of the music that we can manipulate.
I'm not really sure what to even search for to try and find a duplicate/answer!
This also answers a slightly different question: the acceptance criteria "this set of parameters is effective" seems linked to some threshold of "frustration" that you would define as opposed to simply a process to "minimize the frustration function with respect to these parameters", although one can view the latter as the way to make the iterative adjustments to search for the former.
Please let me know if I can provide any clarification!
