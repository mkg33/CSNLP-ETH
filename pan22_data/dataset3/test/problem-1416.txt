When doing ssh @WAN_IP it will not work from within the LAN.
You start a service and can access it from anywhere without making any other change.
in DMZ all ports are exposed to the internet (The password will be the same as the one you use to login to the web interface).
You can try visiting this website: http://portscan.me  it will perform a portscan on the IP address you're coming from, so given that you come from the same IP address as your server, then you should be able to see whether or not port 22 is open to the world.
It can be that your router does not support you connecting from your internal network to your external IP address, unfortunately some routers cannot route that.
For telnetting do "telnet ROUTER_IP" username by default is usually admin and password is password.
Secondly, if you want to host a website/ssh/ftp server on a dynamic Ip it is possible.
a. you can use your router in bridge mode and have your linux box make the PPOE connection so that the public IP is directly assigned to the Linux box.
(Easier than the first0Telnet into the modem/router and you will have access to a host of other option which are not listed in the web interface.
Otherwise Dyndns provides an option of creating a subdomain for the number of domains listed.
It is a routing issue and I do not want to get into the details of that.
