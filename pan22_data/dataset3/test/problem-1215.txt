I was a tech support rep for Gateway 2000 back when that name still seemed futuristic.
They had a two week training course for tech support reps back then, which was pretty comprehensive.
I think it comes from older hardware that didn't handle rapid power cycling well.
also some early switching power supplies could be damaged by inrush current if they had not completely discharged.
I remember the instructor saying that among the reasons above, another reason to let a computer sit for 30 seconds had something to do with viruses that could push themselves in to VRAM and then be activated after a quick reboot where a full power off and 5 second wait would make sure the VRAM was clear.
I am not sure about current hardware but older generations of DRAM relied on capacitors that took up to 5 to 10 seconds to completely discharge.
That's the only time I've believed there might be something in waiting.
Because all of you are impatient and don't follow instructions.
Depending on the power supply again up to 15 seconds was needed.
When I have phoned support for a broadband connection I've been asked to reboot my router and wait 10 or 30 seconds (I forget how many) to make sure that the modem(s) I was connecting to in the telephone exchange had properly disconnected my router.
I had two old commadore 64 computers that died because I reset them by flicking the power off then on again too quickly.
I mean Microsoft doesn't wait any length of time when I hit the Restart option...
