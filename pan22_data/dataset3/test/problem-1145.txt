According to this post, the Ideapad 110 has the following network controllers:
In conclusion, Crunchbang 11 is incompatible with your laptop because it is too old.
So I have absolutely no Internet accessibility at the current moment at all.
The wireless card is a Realtek but again the network manager shows nothing to connect to and the wired connection is grayed out unallowing me to even click it.
The computer doesn't even show the wlan0 option under ifconfig I have no Internet to install outside packages that come beyond what the OS comes with.
The Current Debian Stable (Jessie, version 8, released in 2014) comes with Linux 3.16, whereas the next Stable (Stretch, version 9) will probably use Linux 4.9 or later.
However, even the latest Debian stable does not support r8169.
I have tried editing all those files directly still nothing.
Now, this Debian wiki article states that Debian 7/Wheezy, the parent distribution of Crunchbang 11, does not support rtl8821ae, but Debian 8/Jessie does.
You should move on to something much more up-to-date.
It was based on Debian 7, which was released in 2012.
When I tried it in 2012/2013, it came with Linux 3.2 by default.
My problem is that I have tried every modprobe command, if config up, rfkill, iwconfig up, and neither the wireless or wired connections are being picked up by the OS.
I have been working on this problem all day and have not found a solution to get the wireless or at least wired connection to work.
I have a really big issue, I went and bought a Lenovo ideapad 110 today and the first thing I did was replace the windows OS with Crunchbang 11.
