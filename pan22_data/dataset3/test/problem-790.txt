Thus, I would like to know how to check whether or not a given port is open, and additionally, how to open a port that may be closed.
You have to forward ports on your router in order for people from outside your network to access certain applications/services on certain ports.
Basically it tells the router that whenever someone wants to view the web server at your ip address for instance (or that ElasticSearch applications), it knows to forward that request to the appropriate computer behind your router.
I assume this is because the port is closed (but I'm not sure).
I can connect to it via localhost, but I cannot connect to it remotely when I specify the IP address.
I just set up ElasticSearch on my server, but I cannot seem to connect to it remotely (default is port 9200).
Sounds like you're behind a router, you probably need to forward the ports.
If this is the case, check out this site for a pretty easy walkthrough of how to setup port forwarding.
