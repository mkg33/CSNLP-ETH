and lets printNextNumber parse the individual test cases.
Imagine if you had to add arbitrary large integers, so large that they don't fit in int, neither a long, for example 12345678901234567890 and 99999999999999999999999999.
you have to keep in mind what impact the changes may have on the other.
These functions share objects and state (scanner),
I don't expect any parsing to happen there, only printing.
The parsing of the input would have been better all in main.
How would you do it without a computer, only pen and paper?
it would be a lot easier if you could focus your attention on function, without worrying about another.
Especially when I look at a function named printNextNumber,
A solution is possible without reversing digits, and supporting arbitrarily large numbers.
main parses the number of test cases and loops over them,
Is the goal really to reverse numbers so you could add them and then reverse the result?
It's confusing when a clear responsibility is split among multiple functions,
Which function's responsibility is it to parse the input?
therefore while working on any of these functions,
In the posted code this is shared by main and printNextNumber.
In a program, if the numbers are given reversed as string, and you have to return them in reverse and as string, then it's actually quite convenient for performing the addition digit by digit, appending the added digits to a StringBuilder.
