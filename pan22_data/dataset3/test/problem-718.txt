The machine you have (and what you use locally) is a switch, one of whose legs is connected to a router, a machine that connects two IP networks (one of them "outside").
I am reading the wikipedia article of mac addresses and it states that the least significant bit of the most significant byte of the mac address of a NIC indicates the following:
Other alternatives are (rarely used) multicast addresses and (somewhat common) the broadcast address.
That means when a frame is sent from the NIC over the ethernet line it is intended to be sent to one receiving NIC.
A hub essentially folds the long cable into cables to and fro the machines, nothing really changes.
I have two computers each has a mac address where the least significant bit of the most significant byte is 0.
So what kind of collision domain is this article talking about?
In the original Ethernet, all NICs were connected to a single cable, and thus all could interfere with each other (causing collisions between their frames, thus "collission domain").
A router avoids collision domain because each NIC has its own dedicated ethernet line.
A switch is essentially a multi-leg bridge, with one leg going to each machine.
Later bridges were introduced, which split one cable into two pieces, and only forward frames from one to the other when the bridge knows the recipient is on the other branch.
NICs can be configured to read frames addressed to several addresses (either multicast or unicast), and always read frames addressed to the broadcast address.
Now I have both my computers wired to a Belkin router.
Those "unicast" addresses are actually the normal Ethernet addresses.
