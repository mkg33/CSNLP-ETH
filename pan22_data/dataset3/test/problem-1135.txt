After doing a discovery and a login to the 2nd iSCSI target server (without logging out of the iSCSI target server), doing an ls -l /dev/disk/by-id shows something like this:
I Googled this problem and searched for relevant tags here but I didn't see any answers.
When you mount the iSCSI targets from both iSCSI servers, the symlinks under /dev/disk/by-id will be unique for every iSCSI target.
In the file 1.conf, the configuration information is stored in an HTML format.
Don't use backticks when you edit your 1.tgt file.
Is it possible to have all the iSCSI targets, from both iSCSI target servers, have separate symlinks and be listed under /dev/disk/by-id?
For example, doing an ls -l /dev/disk/by-id after logging in to the first iSCSI target server might show the following:
1) I checked that all the iSCSI targets are mounted on the Ubuntu initiator by issuing an fdisk -l command.
For each iSCSI target, you need to specify a "scsi_id" value for each iSCSI target
I am using Ubuntu's open-iscsi to mount the iSCSI targets from both iSCSI targets servers to my Initiator.
A workaround would be for me to write a script that ccreates individual, unique symlinks for all the iSCSI targets but I'd first like to see if I am misconfiguring something.
2) But the symlinks point to targets from the 2nd server now.
For iSCSI targets that are on an Ubuntu, you have to edit the target's configuration file at: /etc/tgt/conf.d/1.conf
It looks like the symlinks to the targets from the 1st server were overwritten by symlinks to the 2nd server.
When I do the iscsiadm discovery and the iscsiadm -m node -l command to the first iSCSI target server, the targets are mounted and there are symlinks under /dev/disk/by-id.
NOTE: I used backticks ("`") in front of the < or > characters because this website's editor was not displaying them correctly.
The problem is that the symlinks in /dev/disk/by-id are "overwritten".
The iSCSI Initiator is an Ubuntu host (Ubuntu 14.04).
