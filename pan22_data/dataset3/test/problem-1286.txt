so raid 5 is better for smaller files and 5+0 or what is called raid 50 is better for larger files like movies, As far as the file system goes a ext4 or NTFS, Both support very large file systems and i believe ext4 is a 128bit system,  will due fine depending on the OS you are using.
Of the two you've listed (ext3 and XFS) I'd be tempted to go with XFS, both have broadly similar capabilities and you don't sound like you'll be pushing them particularly hard but given ext3 can only really grow to 32TB maximum and you already want 20TB on day one I'd say go with XFS simply because it'll allow for larger and smoother growth if you ever go past this 32TB limit.
Deleting a large multi-gigabyte file under ext3 is an exercise in patience as it goes scurrying around to free up the blocks.
That can take up to a few minutes for larger files.
If you are using raid 5 you may want to use raid 5 +0 for big files, this uses blocks instead of bits.
The primary reason to use ext4 over ext3 for a file system of that size would be that file deletion in ext4 for large files (of more then a few hundred megabytes) is made significantly faster due to the use of extents in ext4.
Deleting the same multi-gigabyte file in ext4 typically only takes a few seconds.
