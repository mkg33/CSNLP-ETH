But before doing that I figured it couldn't hurt to just run the installer again so I did ... and now the damn thing starts without error.
With so much variance in environments, errors & other sufferers' suggestions, etc., I have no idea what caused all this.
However, if it's possible to access it without blowing out any of the schemas that the new mysql install created, I would like to give it a shot.
After yet another day of googling error after error ad nauseum, and seeing - once again - that mysql installs are endless hell for so many users with infinitely varying conditions - platform, version & install method among them - I decided to throw in the towel on fixing this (I have a project to work on, and have already lost two days on mysql) and instead uninstall 5.6 and then see if the prev version would run.
If anyone's still listening, I do have a follow-up question: since none of my data is critical (it's all just test dev stuff) I didn't dump it or otherwise prepare it for resurrection in the new version.
