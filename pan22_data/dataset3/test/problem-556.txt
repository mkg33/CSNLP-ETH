How can I make Sublime/VS-Code to only create/save files in .txt format?
Everynote, OneNote, Keynote NF, etc., do not have all-black-themes same as Sublime/VS-Code have.
How to implement it in VS-Code (at least give me some idea or a starting point and I will try to study/learn it).
Or at least tell me any real note-taking app with same all-dark-theme, I really couldn't find one.
In SublimeText (and any other code editor) you can choose what programming language your file belongs to.
I really like typing in either Sublime Text and/or VS-Code because of the all-dark-theme those two have.
Sublime Text or VS Code as Note Taking or Diary or Organizer App, or any Blacked-Theme App.
You can do manually in bottom right corner in status line.
Code editors work with plaintext files by default, and there are no other options for text files.
I personally use OneNote with a dark picture as background on my default template.enter image description here
Also, I would want to disable the automatic tagging, etc (those programming stuffs) that pop-ups everytime I type a word that have meaning on programming.
Also, I have heard about this markdown/markup in VS-Code so I could make some formatting on texts (bold, bigger, smaller, bullet lists, colored, etc.)
It is also done automatically when you open file with .txt extension editor assume it's plaintext.
I spent times searching for extensions to support it as a note-taking app, but really can't find a good one.
There are bold, italic and underline, but they depends from color theme and language you use.
To save file as .txt you simply add .txt to the end of file name when you save it.
The same way goes with .md extension - editor assume it's Markdown and so on.
What extensions or plugins do I need to search to make Sublime and VS-Code to be like a note-taking app, and how?
If you choose plain text then there will be no highlighting at all.
