She couldn't release details of their system, so it was like 20 questions, but the clear impression I was given is that something like this was in place.
You take the agents who answer calls for these institutions.
My girlfriend's sister is a manager in a telecenter for a large bank and the large-scale release of data is their biggest nightmare.
These questions being answered correctly, the system allows the agent to see the record of that person and that person only.
An INSERT wouldn't be a problem either (new account - no risk).
There is one simple enough scenario where I could see permissions being REVOKEd/DENYed for SELECT and GRANTing INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE makes sense.
You allow the customer to key in their details (account number).
Then, the agent is allowed to UPDATE or DELETE that account (change of address, cancellation of account).
I discussed this with her (me from a database perspective and her from a banking one).
This way, an agent can only see one person's account details at a time and cannot SELECT large quantities of data for potential download/malicious release for criminal/blackmail/"hacking" purposes.
Suppose one works for an institution wheire confidentiality is crucial and any large scale publication and/or loss of user data would be disastrous.
Then, the first thing the agent sees are the security questions (mother's maiden name, first pet's name, &c.).
