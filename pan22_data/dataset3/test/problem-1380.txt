Windows 7 is a consumer/business grade operation system, and while it can be used for hosing websites it is aimed more at hobby or development work than true corporate web hosting.
If you want a cheaper option then you may want to look at virtual or shared hosting options.
This is not to say that a W7 web server could only be used by 10 users as HTTP is stateless and an average request only takes a fraction of a second so you can over contend the server and depending on the web app (AJAX obviously screws it up a bit) you could have perhaps even 100+ users happily using the server and not hitting the 10 concurrent user limit.
We have to replace our server (2003-based), and  we was thinking that it's time to switch to Windows 2008 r2.
If you're just testing some things, it would probably work.
It depends on the expected load, what other interfaces you need IIS to have to other boxes/APIs and how your users expect it to perform, both normally and under heavy load.
If this is low priority then sure, give W7 a go, you can always wipe and install W2K8 if needed.

It will still cost $300-$400, but would be more reliable as a web server than Windows 7.
It looks like IIS in Win7 and Win2008r2 it's almost the same.
The web version does not include any other server features (Domain, file Server, etc...) but it does have full IIS capabilities with only a few limitations.
Windows 7 wasn't designed to be used this way and Microsoft wants you to pay more for the server version to use it in a server role, even if Windows 7 were technically able to handle the load (which is probably is, just artificially crippled).
On top of that I'd worry about support; if you needed tech support or a consultant to come in for some reason, they're probably going to tell you that you need Windows Server in order to be compliant.
But... just because you can doesn't mean you should.
I think there were concurrent connection limits when running XP as a server that were rather low; fine for a home website or a developer's testing site, but if you're using it for business it wouldn't last a day.
You can use any of the non server versions of Windows as servers (web/file/database...) - the main problem being Microsoft's 10 concurrent connection limit.
Otherwise, I think MS imposes limits either in the registry or with licensing that prevents you from using it as a full-blown corporate or business web server.
If all you need is a web server then Windows Web Server 2008 R2 would be the right version to purchase.
If it were this easy for organizations to save a ton of money, it would be done all the time.
In the short run using Win7 for your server would be great for testing or developing.
For production environments, you're asking for long term trouble (plus some software is keyed to check versions of the OS, and won't install in non-server platforms).
