I've only ever used it for Apache but the site says "If you can 'tail' it, you can visualise it."
Google netflow collectors and get a bunch of vendors to demo some kit for you.
The usual suspects of cacti, munin, mrtg aren't what you're after here.
Above would connect to your web server and run logstalgia locally at your workstation, so no additional load or installed components at your server are needed.
On an Ubuntu system, you can just execute the following commands to get it up and running:
I suggest you check out Munin out munin which is fairly easy to setup, and provides daily, weekly, monthly and yearly graphs for your network and lots of other stuff on your system.
The already mentioned Zabbix, Cacti, Munin and ntop are excellent for general network traffic graphing.
You're after something that can act as a netflow collector for your various network devices that can pump out netflow and sflow streams.
It has a different visualisation style (not pong, so it looks slightly less like a game) and it has a cute "funnel" effect that looks like a visual backlog when your server is busy.
It is really powerful and nice network graphing tool that has a web interface.
Presumably, if you wanted a pure network visualisation, ignoring what protocols were being used, you could write a quick script to loop over "parsing" netstat -s output, sleeping for a second and redirecting the output to a log file and then use gltail on that.
It should be installed near the gateway to see all traffic to be graphed.
For real time stats graphite is a good bet these days, but probably not a good fit for your needs.
As you say price is not too much of an issue, but dev time is, a netflow appliance from someone like Netscout or Infovista might do the trick.
Ntop can also plugin to cacti, but is still ugly and so is cacti.
But if your management is not very technical and you have some web servers around, logstalgia provides you lot of eye candy.
Great for ops people, not great for wowing management.
Just tell them you are debugging your web server load issues or whatever.
