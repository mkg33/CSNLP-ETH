I'm less sensitive to red light than the average person, so reds are darker for me than for others: really dark red is easily confused with black, and I can pick up the green much better than the reds in fully saturated computer yellow, so it's easily confused with fully saturated computer green, as are dark blues with dark purples.
- Though I can still pick up large differences in brightness.)
I've experienced a few games whose "colorblind mode" was obviously an afterthought.
(I've seen games which turn everything black & white in "colorblind mode".)
There's a wide range of colorblindness types, and certain types are less about not being able to distinguish between different colors and more about not having the same sensitivity to particular wavelengths, so the perceived brightness for a colorblind person will be different than for a non-colorblind person.
To add to the other answers, you can use a colorblindness simulator such as Color Oracle to detect problems with your color scheme.
Whenever I need to pick a set of colours, I use colorbrewer.
When choosing colors, think about differentiating colors by brightness in addition to just hue.
Also, while this may not be applicable to your game, Jon Blow of The Witness made sure that puzzles which depended on discerning different colors were optional.
Even though it is technically for maps, you can it for everything, and they let you choose between different pallets based on your preferences (like colour blindness).
Someone who has difficulty with red/green colorblindness might not be able to tell the difference between maximally bright yellow (red+green) and maximally bright green (or red).
So your "colorblind mode" should add extra distinguishing factors, rather than replacing the color.
shapes) is used to distinguish things is also a good idea.
The problem with this was that the game was time-sensitive and distinguishing between a 2 and a 3 is harder (takes a fraction of a second longer) than distinguishing between colors.
Let's go with primaries: red, green, blue and yellow.
Even if they can't distinguish the hue of the color, they can tell that the colors are different by their brightness.
The following is informed by my experience as someone with slight red/green colorblindness - specifically protanomaly.
The problem with this approach is that all your colors are sitting at maximum brightness.
So levels that were comfortable for normal sighted persons using colors were unplayable to someone relying on the labels.
Instead, in addition to spacing the colors out by hue, you should also space them by brightness.
Either through some colorblindness simulator (but remember the multiple types), or simply by converting everything to greyscale.
Ideally you should be able to have your "colorblind" features on all the time.
The colors I always choose when given a choice in situations like this, are:
But one thing you definitely want to do is to extensively play test you game with things "de-hued".
Color combinations I have problems with are mainly the following:
What colors should I choose so the game will be colorblind-friendly?
But keep in mind that there's a range of severity in colorblindness, and many "colorblind" people can still perceive colors.
For example, don't have bright green and bright yellow, but have a dark green versus a bright yellow, to help out those people who may have red/green colorblindness.
Adding a "colorblind mode" where something else besides color (e.g.
For example, one game just added numeric labels to the colored balls.
A naive approach in choosing colors is to say "Okay, I need four colors.
