Just before the Drop rule, add a rule to LOG all traffic.
You will know that what type of packets are being dropped or denied, then you can create a rule based on those types of packets to be allowed.
You're blocking incoming DNS responses, and apparently lighttpd (or wp) is configured to resolve IP addresses to hostnames.
There is no load on the server, processor usage stays low.
Then check your syslog logs for those packets which are being dropped.
As the details about the complete setup are not known, then i can suggest you to to following.
You're missing a rule to accept traffic based on existing traffic (the rule that makes iptables stateful).
Here is my config, what could be the cause of this ?
So I implemented some a different set of iptables rules and now if i enable them, then lighttpd simply takes forever to load php enabled pages(like wp).
You should be able to fix this with something like
since the UDP packets for DNS responses originate from port 53.
Those two questions should help you find the issue, you're blocking something too much...
