Please answer in layman terms, as I'm still grasping concepts here.
So a subscriber's public facing ip address can change during the length of their subscription.
The nat on home based router works with a default rule of all incoming packets with a source address of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx and a destination address of yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy(your public ip) will be translated to a destination ip that initiated the request on the local LAN.
If the public ip address was to change, would this confuse the  Network Address Translation (NAT) and cause some sort of disruption?
Therefore will this stop your web server from responding to new requests that come in from the new public IP...no.
But the external DNS servers that say yourdomain.com is at public ip yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy will need to be updated to the new IP before new requests come in since the requesting devices wont know what IP to go to unless it is updated in DNS.
Now what if you remove DHCP on a particular computer, which you plan to use as a web server, so that the machine has a static, unchanging IP address.
So I found out that the cable company use the DHCP to assign the public ip address dynamically.
What this will may disrupt is sessions where the remote device is strict with session.
