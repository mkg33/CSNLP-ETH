But after rebooting, Virtual PC's section on Virtualization and MS' HAVtest say I don't have VT-x... so strange.
It has support for Intel and AMD hardware assisted virtualization.
Once in DOS-mode you get the cmos as a file using SYMCMOS.EXE, change the correct register to [0001] and flash the cmos with the modified file.
Many motherboards come with this disabled by default.
This usually happens if there is an application running that is making use of the VT when virtualBox is run.
I appreciate this is not specific to MS Virtual PC but it may be a clue...
Look in both the Chipset section as well as the CPU section for virtualization options.
I enabled it my Vaio, it was usb-boot-disk based hack.
The error message you're getting from Virtualbox indicates that it cannot get exclusive access to VT and will fail to start.
At the very least you can see if it's an issue with Virtual PC or not.
In some BIOSs you need to enable VT in more than one place.
You may want to install another VM product just to test and make sure that it works.
