Lets say you take a full backup Sunday at 00:05, and all other days a differential backup at the same time.
If you agree, why not employ a backup plan in which you take:
Every sunday, when the full backup is complete, you can simply discard all backups from the previous week.
If someone accidentally drops all table at thursday around noon, you would only need to restore: The full backup from sunday, the differential backup from thursday (at 00:05), and 11 hours of log backups.
If your database fails, for whatever reason, you wouldn't restore from a backup taken a year ago.
You would restore the database to the most recent backup available.
The most common reason for backing up a database is disaster recovery.
First of all, ask yourself what the purpose of having an indefinite backlog of all transactions ever submitted to the database would be.
Is it really important that you can restore the database as it was 7 months and 8 days ago?
This of course, only applies in a scenario in which the purpose for backup is disaster recovery
