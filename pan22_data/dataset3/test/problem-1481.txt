Instead, it uses Local Shared Objects, aka flash cookies.
Deleting cookies does not clear out this information.
The question is not about the website guessing your current location, it's about the website remembering locations that you have looked up in the past, even after deleting the site's cookies from your browser.
The site saves "locations you care about" and every time you visit the site these are listed along a banner near the top of the screen.
These answers don't seem to understand what is actually happening.
You can lookup some of the results of using GeoIP online yourself, using, for example, this website: https://geoiptool.com/
weather.com can then go to one of those databases, lookup your IP and get the region.
GeoIP uses a big database that maps IP address ranges to a certain region.
The first time a website wants to figure that out, it can't assume that you have any cookies stored in your browser, so it can't rely on that anyways.
For example, I have looked up weather in a disparate of handful locations over the past several months, including cities in North America and Europe.
You can use this link to review your flash settings.
If you want to avoid that from happening, I recommend using a VPN service.
However, this is a lot less accurate than GPS, depending on the quality of the database.
Essentially, the IP address that you get assigned often depends on where you are connecting to the internet.
All of these locations continue to be displayed when I visit the site, including my home town--listed both by name and then again by zip code.
I have Waterfox configured to delete cookies every time the browser is closed.
This is a way to hide you actual IP address and use the one of someone else, typically in a different region then yours.
I find it unsettling that Weather.com seems to know my location even after their cookies have been deleted.
So, now that the question is better understood, the answer to the question is that weather.com does not use regular cookies to store this information.
When I have looked up my weather in my home town I have used the site's search bar at times to search simply by name and the exact zip code of interest.
Your location can be determined through a number of ways, not only GPS.
