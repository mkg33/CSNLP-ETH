My question is; How should I alter my bounce height depending on the material(s)?
If the COEFF is 1, the ball will have a "perfect" bounce, i.e.
Thanks in advance and please let me know if you would like to know anything else.
I have created a bouncing ball simulator using XNA and I am happy with my use of gravity, acceleration, change of direction and friction/spin.
Put a fractional value between 0 and 1 in COEFF to get a realistic bounce.
I have found some information about Young's Modulus of Elasticity but I would be grateful if someone could advise as to how I use this (or another) value as a ratio in my "bounce" calculation.
This will mean that I could have bounces as varied as:
Ultimately, I will also want differing types of bounce surfaces as well.
So you could have two coefficients and calculate COEFF as follows:
The bounce is implemented by inverting the Y component of velocity, when the ball collides with the ground.
However, I am now at a stage where I would like to define my ball as being made of a different material, subsequently meaning that the "bounce height" will be different depending on the elasticity of the material.
