A3: To use CloneZilla and similars, the best is to first use (may need some install on LiveCD and that can be long proccess) VeraCrypt to mount the drive, then do the Clone so clone tool will see it as non-encrypted... remember (for security) to store the image on a 'secure' place, aka another encrypted partition on external media mounted, or whatever tou consider 'secure'... to restore it... do the oposite... mount VeraCrypt and restore there, then (if needed) use VeraCrypt rescu to restore boot, etc.
A2: Encryption/Decription on a 'mounted' is done on the fly and only blocks that are read/write are decripted/encripted... so if CPU is fast enough (and not overload by other processes) and HDD is slow enough, it will have no impact on speed... but if HDD let's say can Write at 1.3GiB/s (fastest PCIe solid state memory cards, upto 1TiB) and CPU can only encrypt/decrypt at 100MiB/s, there will be a very great impact on speed.
A1: Time to do 'encrypt'/'decrypt' of a full container (partition) in place (aka, not loosing data) can take a really long, long time... if partition is empty, better do it the other way (not in place) and tell it not to do on full, after when mounted, use a tool to fill free space as a backgorund task (create a dummy file, fill it till partition is full, then delete it).
A3*: Another option is to clone the encrypted partition without mounting it, but that way it is needed more than the full size, since free space will not be known without mounting... i recomend mounting prior cloning/restoring.
