These are the highest values you can set, some things are hashed out, activating those causes you to error out and be unable to login to your console, modify the commented out options at your own risk, but you shouldnt need to (default is unlimited on most)
There is one more file which overrides your configuration /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf.
Using explicit usernames would resolve the issue in this case.
So ideally you configure your setting in this file.
Here * config will override whatever you set in previous config file.
Info on this is terrible on the internet, heres a limits.conf file i made for debian linux, showing all possible options and their maximum "safe" limits, tweak accordingly.
I hope this is usefull to someone, as i could not find this info anywhere, theres 4 hours of research on this file.
When you checked the limits, were you using the root user to do so?
There is one more possibility that the configuration for "noproc" is not working  while configuring in /etc/security/limits.conf.
