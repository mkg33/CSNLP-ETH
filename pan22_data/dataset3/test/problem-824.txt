That being said, I'm going to guess that you're wanting to restrict analyzing to a week because it's taking forever for analog to parse your logs.
I just started using analog and reportmagic myself..
Maybe this will help a little more, since most of the links to, "Here's how Bob did his config, and here's how Jerry did his here, which is nice and all, etc."
Be advised, once you parse a set of logfiles, (say a few days worth, or a week's worth) it may take a while, however re-running analog to examine any following logfiles is extremely quick.
Which should give you a little help in setting up exactly what logfiles you wish to parse.
To summarize; create a scheduled task for analog to run once a day and it while the initial run will take some time, each successive run will be much faster than the first.
Some pseudocode that might help you get started and moving in the right direction would be:
I'd hazard an educated guess that your answer lays within the "FROM" and "TO" .cfg entries.
There probably isn't a need to delete the directory, but I'm cribbing from another script that I use, mmmkay?
(This is a totally random guess, and colored by my opinion, because I sorta/kinda saw the same thing when initially setting it up :)
In the hopes that it can help you out a little more, here's my analog.cfg file:
Again, hope this helps as well and good luck, mate!
In addition there's this corresponding entry, that details the "TO" and "FROM" dates:
As one more alternative, you could always skip those above and simply write a batch script that will move/archive or delete the previous week of logfiles -out_ of the default "\LogFiles\W3SVC1" location to say, something like "D:\IIS-Logfiles-Archive", and then run the analog analyzer for the day.
Sorry, that last little bit in there is if you've got reportmagic installed and running as well.
