I stopped the service and the 32 bit client installation proceeded.
The installer was failing stating it couldn't "access the temporary location."
I am an admin on the box and that is not the problem.
Specifically I'm wondering about whether each client needs to be in its own BASE directory (say C:\oracle and C:\oracle32) or if they should be within the same base direct but have their own client folders.
How to install 32 and 64 bit versions of Oracle Client
So I need to have both the 32bit and 64bit clients for Oracle 11g coexist on the same machine.
The problem was simply that the OracleRemExecServiceV2 service was running on the machine.
I've searched for a long time on various Oracle forums and Oracle specific resources and tried various techniques for getting the ORACLE_HOME and such set so the two clients will play nicely side by side, but really nothing has worked.
Is there a legitimate best practice way to do this?
I have installed both together before, but there are many issues where applications that need to use the 32bit client seem to reference the 64bit client and vice versa.
I installed the 64 bit client with no problems a couple days ago and just got around to installing the Desktop application.
In my scenario, I need both clients because I have ESRI's ArcMap application (32 bit) and also their Server product (64 bit) on the same machine.
I've used this persons guide to installing both versions for .NET developers for a few years now, works like a charm.
