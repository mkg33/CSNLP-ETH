I tried spreading the pagefilesys over two other hard drives and no page on my ssd and it opened up 25 gigs of space on the ssd.
Windows determines how much space you need from your hard disk.
And I think it's better to share C drive for virtual memory (if there is enough space)
Depending on your usage, you may see a performance increase, but only if you found yourself paging a lot before.
I have os on c:/ and two other hdd f:/& s:/ all are 1tb 7200rpm sataIII disks.
all seems well letting windows determine the size on the other two.
When creating virtual RAM using page file, you will get a recommended space there.
I have set the page file to custom using the recommended mbs and noticed on my two other hdds that they were blank and was wondering if it would be necessary to set up page files on those hdds.
Creating unnecessary page files will only waste your disk space :)
However, by spreading your pagefile across multiple drives you will gain a performance increase.
But don't add too much space on your hard disk as page file.
If you need any further help you can go here - Change Virtual Size Memory.
This is due to the fact that Windows will use the pagefile on the disk that is least active.
