Commands that are supposed to generate the same result generate different results for me.
FYI:  I use Tunnelbear VPN as a Chrome extension, so it works on anything that runs Chrome or Chromium.
I keep getting pretty generic failure messages, following multiple walkthroughs.
I am heading back to basics, and realize that I may be having problems with something as simple as my IP addresses.
When I want to know my public-facing IP, whether or not I have my VPN on or off, I use this URL:
I am getting these commands from this page: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-and-configure-an-openvpn-server-on-debian-9-in-5-minutes/ where it seems host... and dig... commands should give the same thing as ip addr....
www.whatismyip.com gives something different again; and dig TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com, also gives something different - a string of numbers in a totally different form this time.
ifconfig, and ip addr show eth0 give what I expect (my internal IP address).
However:  host myip.opendns.com resolver1.opendns.com, gives something different.
Why these commands are all giving me something different?
I have seen others point me to ifconfig and whatismyip.
(i know my internal IP is right as i ssh through it)
Switching the VPN on or off shows completely different addresses.
