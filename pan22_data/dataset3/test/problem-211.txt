I want to install a Nagios server which does the usual collecting of information about the machines and services on the network.
There are several more-modern options available now, like DNX and MNTOS, which are detailed in the new distributed monitoring docs.
My idea is to have a second Nagios server, which is located outside of the office network (maybe in a DMZ), and that the main server sends his results of the checks to the outside server.
This one should run in the local network, with unlimited access to the other machines.
Is this possible with Nagios, or is another nice solution?
I refer you to the classic docs because these new tools might not work for you if you absolutely cannot have inbound traffic (for job submission).
For the times when i'm not in the office, i would like to look at the Nagios state, with the web interface.
(Unfortunately, the old "redundant and failover monitoring" docs appear to be gone, replaced instead with solutions for Nagios XI.)
What you're asking about is basically the classic distributed or failover monitoring setup.
This can be mitigated with config management tools.
The problem is that all of the hosts and services also have to be defined on the receiving end (as passive checks).
But i don't want to allow connections from the outside to the local network.
The idea is to have one Nagios instance forward all of its check results to another server.
Is there a way to forward the state of a Nagios server to a second Nagios server?
You used to do this with an ocsp_command (and/or ochp_command) that would forward all check results to another server.
This way there would be only an outgoing connection from the local network.
(These docs are from 2.x, but the idea is the same.)
