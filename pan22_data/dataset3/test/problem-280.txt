The only time the VPN between the routers goes down is when one of the remote site's IP addresses changes.
The enforce antivirus and gateway antivirus works very good and is much less of a pain than most other corporate antivirus software.
They also support PPTP VPNs so you don't have to install anything special on client PCs that need to remote in (SonicWall requires you have the SonicWall VPN client).
I then from this desktop login to the router since the internal IP is still the same, and reset the VPN.
(there are desktops there)  So when the router's IP address changes at the remote site, the internet still works.
I have 3 sites that connect back to a primary site all using RV042's.
That being said the SonicWall units are also very good, especially if you need an anti-virus solution.
This is because the ISP for those sites does not offer static IP's for a decent price.
Maybe it's just that model of router that is the issue.
I can't remember the last time I had to power cycle them (6 months plus atleast).
Also with using logmein I can remotely work on anyone's computer as long as its connected to the internet, even if the its not connected to the servers correctly or if the user is at home.
The SG310 has more memory than the SG300 so it can run the newer 4.0 software.
This means Logmein can still connect and I can still login to a deskop at the remote site, remotely.
They are a bit cheaper than the SonicWall units and they do IPSEC site to site very well.
There are several option with different capabilities.
Part two of this is I have Logmein installed on all the computers on the remote sites.
