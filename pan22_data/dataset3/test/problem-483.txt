works with both 32-bit and 16-bit cards but is limited to Windows and will work in my situation.
Note that technically this is relative trivial since express card basically is a single PCI-e lane and a single USB connection.
That might be a challenge on modern OS's (PCMCIA is based on old ISA.
However you will need to find the right drivers for your PCMCIA card.
Other cards may not support both 16/32bit cards (make sure to check before purchasing) or specific operating systems.
I have a National Instruments card which is an older interface - PCMCIA Type II PC Card.
Naturally, my laptop I would like to use this with does not have a PC Card slot (only USB and Express Card 54).
If you do not need to move around much you can combine an express card to PCI-e adapter and combine that with a common PCI express to PCMCIA adapter.
In addition to the other answers, if anyone else finds this site, you can find Expresscard to PCMCIA adapters as well.
The nice thing about this is that it is a very flexible solution, allowing you yo use common PCI-e cards (including PCI-e to PCMCIA, or even PCI-e graphics cards).
If you only need the PCMCIA card at one location you could use this and just unplug the card.
I have been able to find literally hundreds of adapters to take a PC Card slot and use it for everything but nothing going the other way.
