If you think you have an argument, try writing it down fully, first in whatever language / notation you wish.
It takes reading/presenting a lot of papers until you are familiar with the proper style.
Beware of any instances where you tell yourself things like "It is clear that..." or "The following just has to be true."
One purpose of writing down a solution to a problem in the first place is that it needs to be utterly convincing to your readers.
For example, I find that I am not completely sure of my proofs until I try writing them down, and sometimes in the process of writing, I discover problems that I wouldn't have imagined.
One advantage of getting comfortable with writing in proper style is that after a while, you'll be writing proofs "properly" from the first attempt and won't have to do the rewriting step.
If you find that your work cannot withstand such questions, then you still have some more to figure out.
If I leave writing until last minute, I often find myself in danger.
On the other hand, if you can address every issue, then you can go back and rewrite your work up formally, using the proper notation and language so that your peers will be willing to read your work.
Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts here either.
