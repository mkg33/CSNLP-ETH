I've checked the port number sshd is configured to use, checked my firewall rules and verified that I can ssh localhost (which I can just fine).
I've just set up an SSH server (OpenSSH) on a Windows 7 machine using cygwin and I'm trying to connect to it using PuTTY on a Windows Vista machine but I keep getting Connection timed out.
SSHD is probably not in the list that comes up, so use the "Browse..." button to find the binary and click "Open" and then "Add".
I left mine with Private checked and public unchecked.
Control Panel -> Windows Firewall -> Allow a program or feature through Windows Firewall
Make sure you are win 7 Antivirus is not blocking port 22.
This line (using my subnet) as the first rule fixed the issue for me.
Click the "Change settings" button then the "Allow another program..." button.
If it's 127.0.0.1  (or any other 127.0.0.x number), then it's ONLY listening on the LOCALHOST, and you can only log in from the SAME machine.
Does your sshd_config specify ListenAddress as 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1?
I have absolutely no idea how to troubleshoot this problem.
If it's 0.0.0.0 or just commented out, then you can connect from outside the machine, ie, from another computer.
I've checked the network activity on the Win 7 machine with Wireshark and found that I am receiving TCP SYN on port 22 on the Win 7 machine, but the ssh server doesn't seem to reply.
Also, go to your windows service panel and search for CYGWINsshd and enable it.
Somewhere in there you can decide which "Network location types..." you want to use.
After messing around with windows firewall to no effect I eventually found I had to allow connections to my own subnet in Cygwin itself via the /etc/hosts.allow file.
