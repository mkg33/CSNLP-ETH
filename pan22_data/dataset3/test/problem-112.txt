I have done it in my home using a program called Connectify Dispatch.
It does not double my download speeds but increased it from 200kbps to just over 350kbps.
I then use the Connectify Dispatch program to join those connections into one.
Other terms for Link Aggregation include: NIC Teaming, Etherchannel, Port Channel, or trunking.
Link Aggregation is the term that you're looking for, but in most home setups this is not possible.
I have heard of people getting up to 100mbps using this method.
There are ways of connecting multiple connections.
To my best knowledge, you can do it by using a software such as Speedify
Assuming you have such hardware, you need a NIC that supports it as well.
You need a switch that supports 802.3ad, and those are usually semi-expensive enterprise-class pieces of equipment.
If you live in, for instance, a large apartment complex where there might be a dozen unsecured connections that you can see....you can combine them ALL using Connectify Dispatch.
edit: To answer your last question, if you're on a standard home router and that is your only piece of networking equipment then there probably isn't much to gain from having 2 links.

I have one connection plugged directly into my computer via cat 5 ethernet, and the other connection I pick up using an $15 Steren or Cisco usb wifi adapter.
