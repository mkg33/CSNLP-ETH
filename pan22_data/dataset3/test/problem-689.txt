If you have a Blackberry or other mobile device, there are clients that will keep RTM and your tasks list in sync.
I love the idea of one person handling interruptions while the other person has a "fortress of solitude" to concentrate on important, but not urgent matters.
If something interrupts me (and it does frequently) or if a task needs more time I just drag and my tasks around on the calendar accordingly.
Unfortunately, I'm a one man show most of the time and I have no door on my office, so I get lots and lots of drop-bys.
Although I have currently fallen off the wagon, it is the only time I have ever had an inbox with ZERO items (and kept it that way for months at a time).
Good use of comprehensive documentation (wiki) on system configuration, network, etc that is always up to date (so I never have to research anything)
I leave the reminders set to remind me 0 minutes before due so I know when to switch tasks.
I work from the ticketing system for fix-them-now type tickets, but for larger issues, those that will take multiple periods of work I schedule them into my outlook calendar.
It's fairly simple to use and implements some of the Getting Things Done principles, but doesn't force you into it.
STRONGLY recommended (and... making a note to go re-read the book myself :).
So if you're having that hallway convo and a todo comes up, you can type it into your phone.
If you're on a Mac, OmniFocus is pretty awesome for managing a bunch of projects and tasks associated with the tasks.
I have had MUCH better luck (and strongly recommend) Take Back Your Life by Sally McGhee, which basically takes the principles of David Allen's Getting Things Done and applies them specifically to Outlook (where I spend the majority of my day).
It has 3 levels of priority, can be tied with other people, allows you to use tabs to group items, and allows the use of tags.
While I have tried the Total Workday Control method mentioned elsewhere, I was never able to make it work well with my workflow.
Then it shows up in your inbox the next time you hit the website (I tend to have it up on my screen).
Personally I use a combination of ticketing system (Request Tracker) and my Outlook calendar.
I just drag the tab or address bar over and drop it into the calendar.
