Use 2 2g links dictated by the switch or use 4 paths and let the plugin do it's job ?
I am assuming that you are connecting your storage via iSCSI.

I have a new ex4200 switch stack, my 3 esxi hyper-visors connect to the SAN via vlan 200 which is EST.
I would always use as many LACP trunk members as practical, not only for resilience but for potential performance benefits too, so I'd let the plugin do its job.
Here is the EqualLogic configuration guide with more information on this topic [Section 4.5]:
This is expected behavior however what is better ?
When I have the 4 cables per server dedicated plugged in to the switch the hyper-visor see's 4 paths like it should.
If so, definitely let the MPIO do its thing, instead of aggregation.
When I lag 2 ports and 2 ports together I only get two paths.
You can (and should) use LAGs or LACP trunks between the switches though.
I have loaded the Equallogic multipathing plugins.
Critically, far too often people forget that their single switch is a SPOF, and they do nothing about it.
I am personally a firm believer in cross-stack aggregation, which eliminates the switch as a SPOF.
However, if you decide to use NFS, you have to keep in mind that with one datastore there will only be one TCP session and loss of that session means a loss of your datastore, so you are going to need something to give you added layer of redundancy.
With your SAN, let MPIO do its job and do not use LAGs with the server or SAN connections.
Datastore diversity is important with NFS, as this way you can distribute and reduce impact of failure.
