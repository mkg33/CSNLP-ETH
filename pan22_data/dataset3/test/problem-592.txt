To scroll back, press ^A (Ctrl-A, or whatever your screen control sequence is if you remapped it) and then Esc.
I like being able to scroll back, and I don't want to use the screen functionality to look at the past buffer; the scroll wheel on my mouse doesn't have hooks into screen and I don't expect it ever would.
Screen always draws the full text area, and has its own backbuffer that you must control with screen.
When I use screen inside a putty session, I can't seem to use the scrollback buffer of putty to look at whatever just scrolled off the screen.
PgUp/PgDn will let you scroll up and down inside of screen.
This is similar to using programs, like vi or joe, that take up the entire text area and provide their own buffer: scrolling up in your terminal emulator just gives garbage, but scrolling up inside those programs gives your intended result.
You might also check out the Screen FAQ which allows a sort of hybrid behavior:
The same problem exists in 'less' when not using screen.
The reason for this is the way that screen handles the scrollback buffer.
Instead, I just see what was happening in the putty session just prior to my running screen.
Screen does a dynamic update of your whole text area, rather than pushing new lines at the bottom of the screen which in turn pushes the top line into the scroll-back area.
It redraws the whole screen when a new line shows up, which prevents more data going into scroll-back.
