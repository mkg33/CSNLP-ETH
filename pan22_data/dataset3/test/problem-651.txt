Traceroute depends on the common router practice of sending an ICMP Time Exceeded message, documented in RFC 792, back to the sender when this occurs.
Traceroute'' is a network debugging utility that attempts to trace the path a packet takes through the network.
It measures the time from the initial SYN to the SYN/ACK.

no... your machine sends out 3 UDP packets with a TTL (Time-to-Live) of 1.
When those packets reach the next hop router, it will decrease the TTL to 0 and thus reject the packet.
At every router the value is being decremented by 1 and if TTL reaches 0 the packet has been expired and is discarded.
Since tcpping requires tcptraceroute, I'll start with tcptraceroute.
This is sometimes referred to as a half-open connection scan.
Also in ICMP ping you can specify the packet size, can this be achieved in TCP ping?
Traceroute transmits packet with small time to live(TTL) values.
It will send an ICMP Time-to-Live Exceeded (Type 11), TTL equal 0 during transit (Code 0) back to your machine - with a source address of itself, therefore you now know the address of the first router in the path.
Does it take in account just the time it takes to establis the TCP handshake?
So, tcptraceroute does not measure the time it takes to complete the three-way handshake because that never happens.
Since tcptraceroute sends a standard SYN packet, it should be a small packet, perhaps 64 bytes.
I am not aware of any standard specification or reference implementation for "TCP Ping" or "TCP Traceroute", so you probably need to pick a particular pair of tools that implement these tests and then use a packet sniffer to see what those particular tools do.
As to your packet size question, the above description also has the answer.
Further: It is worth noting that tcptraceroute never completely establishes a TCP connection with the destination host.
The author of tcptraceroute states that unlike a traditional traceroute, "By sending out TCP SYN packets instead of UDP or ICMP ECHO packets, tcptraceroute is able to bypass the most common firewall filters."
