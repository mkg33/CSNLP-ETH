Configure the servers with appropriate server aliases.
Configure the authenticating proxy to listen for these names and proxy them to the appropriate sever.
If you want to use a regex, then you likely want /(serv.)(.
I have several web servers in the LAN, addressable as http://serv1.lan/, http://serv2.lan/, etc.
If these are different sites use an external naming scheme like serv1.example.com, serv1.example.com, etc.
What are the regular expression rules needed to effect this conversion?
The proxy should be perfectly capable of routing the address based on the received host address.
To be addressed from outside the LAN, requests need to be passed through an authentication reverse proxy, such that https://proxy.com/serv1/ be translated into http://serv1.lan/ etc.
The authentication server is IIS, but the proxy could also implemented in IsapiRewrite (which has a syntax similar to Apache).
For microservices, you likely don't want to change the path, so you would route to http:/$1.lan/$1$2 assuming the servername and context path are the same.
