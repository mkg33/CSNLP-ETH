If you want to distinguish between walking or jumping, you need to perform a couple of more checks, but nothing hard.
I solved this problem without using any additional variables, just collision checking function.
As commented in code, this code may work both for jumping on top of or walking onto a musical block.
That said, we can write our code to check for the needed values.
Assuming that in the real world when someone jumps you hear a sound only in the very moment contact with the ground occurs, I managed to get the following code which checks for collision in the current position and in the previous one.
As well, prev_coll does the same, but assuming the player position in the previous game step.
I also had this problem once, though i could not solve it completely.
So, we can have four different cases (CC: curr_coll, PC: prev_coll):
If we want to just play a sound only when landing on a musical key, we can write:
You can use both a switch statement, or a chain of ifs, depending on your purpose.

If this is set to true, then your sound will loop.
Variables curr_coll is a boolean value that tells us if there's a collision with a block underneath the player at the current position.
The function audio_play_sound as a third parameter, 'loop'.
