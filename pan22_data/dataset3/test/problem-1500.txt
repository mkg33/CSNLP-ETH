Generally only when you start looking at raid 10 or 01 that is becomes an issue.

Monitoring for failures is easy enough in this situation.
"The T3500 uses an integrated SATA 3.0Gb/s host controller (part of the Intel chipset) and supports host based RAID 0, 1, 5, 10, an optional PCI-e SAS 6/ir controller supports SAS drives with host based RAID 0 or 1."
Speed isn't a reason to specify RAID1 - any gains in one area are likely to be offset by losses in another area making the overall improvement hard to measure.
Some of their older cards were using tricks to get to a raid 10 level meaning losing a drive didn't always work as it should.
If you need reliability, that would be a reason to go with RAID1.
Beefy and fast, a good choice if you are processing lots of video or other very large files.
Dells newer servers all have decent enough raid setups in Hardware.
The onboard is effective, but less than ideal, I've had trouble with that configuration often.
The best choice from the factory is to get the 710, which uses it own processor and operates completely independent from the system processor.
The T3500 does use HW raid on setup which is fine in a workstation.
