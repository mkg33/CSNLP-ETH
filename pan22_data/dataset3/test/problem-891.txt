It's really hard to explain without pictures, so please visit my website (Resolution Magic 2D)
Define an area of the screen that must always be visible regardless of aspect ratio/resolution, and use a simple rectangle transform to 'stencil out' this region.
Issues I have in mind is when there are key things that have to be in certain places and cannot fall off the screen.
One is to provide different game objects for each aspect.
Using black bars on top or bottom is unacceptable these days.
I really would love to know what successful games have used to handle different aspect ratios on iOS and Android without making a zillion different sized assets.
My extension attempts to alleviate a lot of that pain.
There are generally two method that most people use to switch aspects.
I created a AssetStore extension that allows for easier aspect switching called AspectSwitcher.
I am strictly speaking mobile, not desktop, specifically with Unity and I don't care about the UI, I only care about the gameplay canvas.
And as long as there is sufficient 'extra' content (e.g.
I created the Unity Asset 'Resolution Magic 2D' to solve this very problem (ad: you can get it from the Unity Asset Store, or see more details at grogansoft.com).
The other is to create custom code that modifies the properties of a single game object based on the current aspect.
Using a simple algorithm I then zoom the camera until the region blocked out by the rectangle is as large as possible while still being 100% visible to the camera.
I don't personally make 3D games, so I don't know if this would work in 3D (or if it is even necessary).
My asset also includes some logic for placing UI, but that is mostly obsolete due to Unity's new UI system.
None of the tutorials talk about aspect ratio and dealing with mobile devices and there are a zillion ways to do it, all seem to have gotcha's and flaws.
Then your main game area is always taking up as much screen as possible.
I've gotten a lot of answers to this question, but they are all generic and generally not very useful.
If you use this technique (or my asset), just make sure you design your game to have 'optional' space all around to accommodate screens that are wider or taller than your ideal (to avoid black bars).
It provides a system for allowing you to easily specify different properties for different aspects.
My asset provides this out of the box with minimal setup, and it works really well on all platforms.
your background) outside of the rectangle area you defined before, players whose screen is not the same aspect ratio as your 'ideal' rectangle will see the extra content where black bars would otherwise go.
