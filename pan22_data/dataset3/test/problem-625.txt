If you didn't create a recovery point and are desperate, I reinstalled and identified the following juctions that need recreated (replacing ?
The problem is that the \xj option on the robocopy EXCLUDES JUNCTION POINTS, creating the issue (missing junction points) later clarified by Simon.
Unfortunately, if you leave this option out, the process chokes on the junction points.
I believe, therefore, that the new junctions should be pointed at their "usual" locations (standard drive letters) despite the fact that the instructions above show different drive letters (on the Repair Command Prompt).
Naturally, additional links may have been created by other programs, but this should fix the major items broken by the inadequate instructions.
All the other, unofficial ways, such as messing around with junctions and copying or moving files around, gave me "The User Profile Service failed the logon.
I did not actually restore a system this way so I cannot guarantee that this is exhaustive, but I believe it to be so.
The problem seems to be with the different drive letter mappings in repair mode compared normal mode.
Note the substitution of the /D option for the /J option:
As you can verify for yourself, the junctions continue to point at "C:" even after the drive letter has changed (during Windows Repair Command Prompt).
What I did and worked for me is to run DISKPART (good reference here: http://ss64.com/nt/diskpart.html) remap the partition/devices and then make the junction with the drive letters which windows will normally use.
Using sysprep is the easiest way to create user profiles in a different location.
This is a serious catch 22 with the proposed approach.
