Please back up your hard disk and have it replaced!'
Self-Test Status Value: 0 (completed without error)
In this case, it seems the drive is a likely cause to your issue.
It's possible the drive has failed at some point in use, but the issue could have either not been included in the extended test, or is of an intermittent nature that didn't show during the test.
The following SMART attributes indicate a potential imminent failure:
On starting up, the machine made consistent noise as if it tried to access the hard drive, and soon the console showed 'Please back up your hard disk and have it replaced!'
So could someone please explain to me why SMART extended self-test passed without error but SMART status check indicated failure imminent?
These attributes are mostly marked discreetly all the while the drive is in use.
Either way, it's very often the case that if SMART has displayed a failure, the drive is on it's way out and it will usually be a sign of problems to come.
Then I carried out a SMART status check, but this time I am getting 'Hard disk failure is imminent.
The likelihood here is that your drive has passed an extended test, which tests the disk surface and electrical and mechanical performance of the drive, however it could have failed for any of the above issues which may not be a part of the test.
If you can get the machine booting, using a utility that can show the SMART attribute statuses would give you more information and hopefully narrow down the cause.
So I went in bios and did a SMART extended self-test.
