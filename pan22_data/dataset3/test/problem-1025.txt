Editing many separate smaller maps by hand and dealing with markup or configuration files for specifying how one map links to another is tedious.
It would be great to be able to edit their properties on the fly (i.e health, defense, current items, etc).
Often overlooked issues from the user's standpoint:
I've seen this happen with a lot of the tools i write for myself or even in other bigger tools(like tiled) where it is very hard to replace a tile set with a new version of it, or even change the size of the map.
I'd love to be able to simply make a huge map but section it off with markup and export it as submaps for implementation/efficiency/etc.
My big wish list feature is the ability to easily make a large map "stitched" together from 'rooms'.
Multiple Map Sets: This could server for having the world on one map set, the dungeons on another, and the houses/caves/etc.
Something I would put as very high in a level editor "goal" would be to avoid ANY situation where starting the map from scratch is easier than correcting a mistake in the current map.
Basically a map editor designed specifically for a metroidvania style game.
Character/Boss/Enemy Positioning and Properties We are probably going to want to set where the player and enemies are in the editor.
