I'm having some difficulties logging in to my Windows 2008 server (a DC) running Cygwin sshd.
After way too much time spent stumbling around, I've finally discovered the cause of my problem.
Open Allow logon locally and add the Users group (or, you may want to create a 'SSH users' group and add that instead).
I can log in fine with an account that is a member of the Domain Admins group, but when I try with a regular user account, ssh says "Permission denied."
When sshd tried to switch context from the sshd service's account to a non-privileged user, the operation failed because the user didn't have the logon locally permission.
However, after removing it from the Admins group, it is again unable to login.
In fact, if I add an account to the Admins group, it can login.
After editing the policy, run gpupdate in a command prompt to refresh the changes and you're good to go.
This can be found in Group Policy Management > (your domain) > Group Policy Objects.
Go to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment.
To fix, I had to edit the Default Domain Controller Policy to give the Users group the Allow logon locally right.
In short, I was getting "Permission denied" for my non-administrator users because on a DC, the Users group does not have the "Allow logon locally" user right.
