There are a number of other reasons, but it isn't something you should do.
That's before we get into the power efficiency loss, or damaging downstream units from lack of active power factor correction.
The second UPS will usually either also go on battery at the same time, or interpret the bad power as a spike and try to ground it.
Simpler overall answer regarding UPS or surge protectors or plain old power strips : Don't plug them into each other.
I have been researching this today because I was considering this.
Quality of the voltage will drop,  and the back and forth Ac to dc to Ac to dc to Ac to dc will be inefficient.
The first has to do with how the UPS outputs power.
That means the 2nd UPS will send power down it's ground to the first UPS.
When a UPS goes on battery, it doesn't output the same kind of power as what passes through.
There's a risk from fire, data loss, and equipment damage from someone in the future overloading either device, the outlet, or the breaker.
UPS into a UPS might work, but it can also cause damage to both UPSs or even a fire.
I am a chemical engineer by education, but I have been doing electrical engineering work in my role at an industrial plant and did the research today and stumbled across this thread so thought I would contribute.
