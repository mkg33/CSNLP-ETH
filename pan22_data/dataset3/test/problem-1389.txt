You could also use the Data Compare one to sync data between databases.
The SQL Server Management Studio has the ability generate scripts.
Disclaimer: I only used it on SQL 2005...don't know if it works with SQL 2008.
Red Gate Sql Data Compare - for data comparison and replication
The problem is that it breaks on identity columns.
I can't find a link to this bug at the moment but Microsoft basically declared it as a "feature".
I haven't fully reviewed this tool, but take a look at it.
Red Gate Sql Compare - for structure comparison and replication
It looks like you'll have to do a touch up and recompile for SQL Server 2008, though.
Is there an easy solution to this that actually works?
It's free when I downloaded it (it still is, i believe)
Scriptio worked well with SQL Server 2005 and is from SQL Server MVP Bill Graziano.
These two Red Gate tools are very good for comparing differences between databases and scripting the structural, or data, differences.
We've used them extensively to setup development databases and copy the changes back and so on.
They sell a SQL bundle which includes both products I think.
If you're looking for 3rd party tools, Red Gate's SQL Compare is great (full disclosure - I'm a Friend of Red Gate).
Have you tried Microsoft's Database Publishing Wizard?
