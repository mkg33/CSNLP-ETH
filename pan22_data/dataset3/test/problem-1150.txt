Not becasue of performance but because all viretualization is fully integrated and maintained as part of windows updates.
Cramming 4 such instances into what is less than 2gb physical memory per Computer (as a VM is a computer) is asking for trouble.
1VCpu - bad, too low (I dont allocate less than 2 virtual CPU's these days) and seriously, 512Mb RAM for something as ressource hungry as Visual Studio.
No need to install anything unless you run outdated windows versions.
That is totally not related to the virtualization technology.
You simply need to put (a) an SSD into the thing (or an array of faster discs) and (b) put enough RAM into the server to run the workloads you want to run.
What about you run VIsual Studio on a physical computer with 512mb RAM.
A 500gb HD is not good to run visual studio - unless if is a Velociraptor - because it will be slow.
It does not makgically make crappy hardware faster.
Let me be clear - 4gb PER VM is too low to run Visual Studio properly (with debugging etc.).
Running multiple computers on one such hard disc is like saying "hey, my Fiat Panda is too slow when i load up 2 tons of stuff into the trunk".
