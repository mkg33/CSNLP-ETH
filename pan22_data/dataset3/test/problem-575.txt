target     prot opt source               destination
If pmon is running, it will take some time to for the db engine to register.
I needed to change oracle default dbms_xdb httpport to 9080, so with that I can use tomcat @8080 port.
As the user which runs the process, generally oracle, you can excecute practically the same lines:
========================================================begin
This will tell you if proccess monitor is running:
If everything seems to be up, telnet to your IP on port 1521:
If no results from that command, start it up (again, check your environment):
target     prot opt source               destination
I have a Suse11.2 machine with the following services:
========================================================end
That is your answer: ports 1521 and 9080 are only listening on the IP address 127.0.0.1  (localhost).
target     prot opt source               destination
You need to change the config of those services to listen on all IP addresses of the server.
If database is up, and you have any other problem (SQLNet), you can always use internal.
Since I'm developing this app I've made a lot of tests using localhost:8080 and access the DB through localhost:1521 and worked fine.
but it keeps blocking others ports besides 9080, and icmp...
But when I need to access this ip, it doesnt respond: like 192.168.1.4:8080 and :1521 it shows me in browser and when I tried to connect the oracle that it can't connect with server....
But I cant understand WHY it connects at 9080 port (oracle dbms http)
If you see no results here, startup the listener (make sure you have environment set properly):
Have you tried making sure that those ports are indeed listening?
If you see any suspecting rules wipe it all up (you will have no more firewall rules):
1 stop the firewall at yast2 and prevent it to starts automatically
