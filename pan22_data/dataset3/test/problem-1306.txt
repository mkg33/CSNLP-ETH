These devices will often be referred to as a kvm switch or a display switch.
These are typically devices that are dedicated to docking a single, specific brand/model laptop or tablet (although not the case with some USB "docking stations" and other exceptions).
However, I was looking for a solution that would enable me to be able to use one plug (USB?)
I have a macbook pro 13" and an alienware 15" that I would like to be able to swap external monitors, mouse and keyboard quickly.
At the moment this requires some unplugging and replugging.
Other than a docking station I was looking at something like the Dell P2715Q which has some USB outputs which I think would possibly work but I wanted to check what the preferred method is for this (or is it just a case of 2 docking stations/ unplugging and replugging lots of things in)?
These switches generally have input buttons that allow you to switch between PC1, PC2, ect, while sharing a common display and set of peripherals.
There are industrial grade and home grade versions of these devices, the main difference being the number of devices the hardware can use.
While you're researching this question, I wouldn't get confused with the term "docking station".
Most of these devices come with ports for USB, PS2, ect.
