However, only Vista Enterprise and Ultimate supports dynamic disks.
Once you converted your HDDs to dynamic disks you can create all kinds of RAID volumes.
The biggest downside with an actual RAID is that all the disks involved should be the same size or else it treats all other drives as the same size of the smallest drive.
2 x 20 GB drives and 1 x 100GB drive) will result in a 60 GB possible capacity - 3 x 20GB)
One of the advantages of ZFS (which has support in mostly server OSes, and not r/w on Windows and only read only by default on Mac OS X) is that you can mix and match drives and it shows them as one pool.
I know Windows Home Server will aggregate all of your drives (including external) to look like one drive, I'm not sure if Vista can do it though...
If your HDDs' sizes aren't equal, you can still use JBOD, so you can have them all in the same file system.
I'm not sure if an USB hard drive can be converted to a dynamic disk, but this seems to be the only way to this.
Slightly related, I've seen someone RAID together iPod Shuffles, and it has some screenshots of how he did it on the Mac:
The process would be the same if you had many USB drives connected to your Mac.
