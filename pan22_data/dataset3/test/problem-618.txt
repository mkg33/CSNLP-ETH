Breaking down the command in this way might help debug & track down permission/connection issues....
...But typically people don't have sshd running on windows, and it isn't always that simple to set up.
Or, vice-versa; login to agenadin@uc3-dev and run:
Also, the only reason I am doing that is because I am not sure how to download that file from the ssh command prompt directly.
ssh serverB "cat /path/to/remote/file" > /path/to/local/file
Is there a way to just download that file from the shell of Putty's ssh client?
I'm not sure where putty (the windows ssh client) comes into play...
If scp is not possible and the transfer should be between 2 *nix hosts, you can always cat the file over ssh.
If you have that, then you can login to the remote linux host, and, using your windows hostname or ip address (and, it helps to avoid windows path issues and just copy to your windows $HOME),
PuTTY has an SCP client & an SFTP client, both on the download page.
As for the issue, can slabrams-desktop resolve uc3-dev and vice-versa?
Edit: just to clarify: copying to windows & running the scp/sftp commands on windows (e.g., using putty's psftp or pscp) is trivial, as it only remotely logs into the linux server & copies the file locally.
Does it work if you login directly to one of the servers, so that you aren't remotely copying between two remote servers?
Copying to a windows pc from the remote linux server (executing the copy from teh remote linux box -- assuming you're using putty on windows to ssh into a remote unix/linux box) won't work unless you have an sshd server running on windows (e.g., cygwin sshd).
this way you order serverB to cat the remote file while grabbing the output of this and putting it in the local file.
I am trying to SCP a file I downloaded using this command:
...first login to agenadinik@slabrams-desktop, and then run:
It looks like you're copying between two linux (ubuntu) servers.
