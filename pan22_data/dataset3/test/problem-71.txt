Though it's not a true Full Duplex solution because this device still needs a mechanism to detect collisions and then back off a random amount of time, else it becomes useless if you install more than one in an area.
I'm not a wireless spectrum expert, but one thing to remember in this idea is that full duplex is not just the ability to simultaneously send and receive, but also to do so without a danger of collisions.
I just looked at an installation of this equipment (http://www.ubnt.com/airfiber).
One thing to note, though, is that IEEE 802.11 doesn't support pure TX or pure RX on a single interface, so you wouldn't be able to use easily-obtainable Wi-Fi equipment.
Maybe CSMA/CD would solve that issue, just wanted to point it out as a consideration in full-duplex.
This is what MIMO does, multiple frequencies on multiple antennas operating simultaneously to increase throughput.
Suppose now we have stations with both antennas in, say, the 5GHz band, but on different channels, would full-duplex communication be possible?
In wireless, even if you used a separate non-overlapping channel (it wouldn't even have to be 2.4/5) you still have the possibility for collisions on 1 of those channels (the one the hosts are using to transmit).
You'll need two physical wireless interfaces in order to achieve true full-duplex.
This is basically a 750M Full Duplex wireless solution, since even for ethernet you're really just two independent unidirectional 100M (or whatever) media.
@bigmstone has the answer for wireless full-duplex, sending and receiving simultaneously on the same frequency, it's being researched but nothing is in production yet.
They're running two antennas in the 24GHz range, each with a 750M throughput.
And because of the shared medium (the radio spectrum) it can never be "Full Duplex" due to the necessity of detecting collisions.
If you're using two different channels then that would be two half-duplex connections, not a full-duplex connection.
This, unfortunately, would also be a PtP solution, as you would still need to avoid collisions in PmP (as others here have also pointed out).
Now wireless uses CSMA/CA (instead of CSMA/CD in a Ethernet network), which is suppose to *A*void collisions not just *D*etect them.
"Dual-band" stations are now common, with one antenna in the 2.4 GHz band, and the other in the 5GHz band.
In a wired environment, if you install a hub you have to fall back to half-duplex because of the possibility of a collision.
