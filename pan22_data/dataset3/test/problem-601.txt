You can select the disk to examine with select disk disknum where disknum is a number identifying a particular disk.
So you could issue the command select disk 0 to select the first disk drive.
Then issue the command select disk 1 followed by detail disk.
On a Windows system, you can obtain details for disk drives using diskpart.
Assuming you have two drives on the system, the numbers would be 0 and 1, since the numbering starts with 0.
You can run the utility by opening a command prompt window and typing diskpart; you will need to provide credentials for an account with administrator access on the system to run the utility.
As Pablo Gomez said, C is probably a partition on the old drive, which you can hopefully identify from the drive model numbers, but you can verify that.
If you have additional drives, increase the number used in the select command.
Then type detail disk to see the details for the disk, including the drive model number, which will be on the first line of output from the detail disk command and a list of all the partitions on the drive with the drive letters Windows has assigned and the labels for the partitions.
