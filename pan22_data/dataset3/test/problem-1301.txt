I haven't actually tried it myself (I don't have a kindle) but I used a similar method to establish ssh abilities to my iphone.

I'm not sure whether the Kindle can be accessed directly -- but you can Download a User Guide and check for yourself.
Is the emailing process just a backup measure of some kind?
I did some research and found that I can use a program called Calibre.
However, I noticed that Calibre emails the content to my kindle email address.
