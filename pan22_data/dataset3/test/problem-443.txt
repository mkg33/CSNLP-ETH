This problem is strongly reminiscent of "Optimal stopping" of stochastic processes.
You need to clarify how "$x$ in some feasible region" is described analytically.
References even to this specialized literature are extensive, due to its applications in decision theory and finance.
Check also the Decision Tree for Optimization Software (google it, it's one of the first results at University of Arizona; I can't post more than one hyperlink.)
These are frequently solved by dynamic programming.
So if your "feasible region" for $x$ has the form $\ell \leq x \leq u$ you are in the realm of bound-constrained optimization.
Check the Wiki and the Optimization Software Guide.
If there are conditions of the form $Ax=b$, you are in linearly-constrained optimization.
You will find quite a bit of information at http://www.neos-guide.org/NEOS.
There are many different methods out there for all categories.
You can narrow down further what precise area you are in based on the structure of your objective function $\sum G(x,n)$ (e.g., is it a sum of linear terms, quadratic terms, squares of linear terms, convex, concave, neither, etc.)
The constraint $n \geq 1$ is usually called a "bound constraint".
