If a website has a dedicated (not shared) IP, then (for example) http://123.456.789.012 will bring up the website.
What happens is that the hosting company rents a single IP address that points to a physical server, then hosts thousands of websites on that IP address using the "virtual host" feature
This is known as virtual hosting (not to be confused with the more recent concept of virtual machines).
I say "usually" because it's almost always done this way, but there are in fact methods where you can setup the http server to answer if only the IP address is used.
Initially virtual hosting was done by allocating multiple IP addresses to the server, the sever could then send different content based on the IP address used, but this was seen as wasteful.
There's a lot of answers here with technical detail, but I think the simplest high-level explanation is that even if a web server is properly listening for http traffic on it's IP address, the server must usually also be configured to answer for a particular domain name, and that name must be in the request sent by the client (i.e the web browser)
People want to allocate multiple hostnames to the same web server and serve different content for each hostname.
The server can then serve up different content based on the value of the header.
But as others have said, it's usually not a good idea.
This header specifies the hostname the client asked for.
The key term to search for is "name based virtual hosting".
Therefore the "host" header was introduced, initially as an extension but then later made a mandatory part of the http 1.1 specification in 1997.
A dedicated IP address is expensive, while creating a new website on a server is basically free.
We need to understand the differences between Virtual IPs and Dedicated IPs.
