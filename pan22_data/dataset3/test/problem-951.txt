For example, I have a simple equation =SUM(C4:C16).
Usually changing the "Workbook Calculation" option (Excel 2010) solves the problem, but if it didn't, probably the workbook itself is set to manual calculation.
I think I've noticed this happening for me when I threw in a value once that was "$xyz" as opposed to "xyz" (I mean xyz to be some integer, of course).
I don't know what happened I've never seen this fail before.
Try changing the format type of the calculated cell from "Text" to "General" and then re-enter the formula.
After that, click on the cell and paste your formula into the formula bar and hit enter.
I suggest you copy your formula into Notepad, then type any number into the cell.
Can you check and make sure the data in there is all still numerical?
If I change any of the cells in C4-C16, the answer doesn't get updated...
To change this, open the workbook, select the "Formula" tab (Alt+M), then click "Calculation Options" and the select "Automatic".
That fixed the problem when I was seeing these symptoms.
For some reason all of a sudden when I update cells in Excel, my equations are not being updated.
I think this can happen when you end up with different data types in the fields in the given range.
