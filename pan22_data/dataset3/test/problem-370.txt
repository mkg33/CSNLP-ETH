It will keep track of the source address+port from behind NAT and destination address+port from the WAN of a connection to know where to send packets back.
From a logical perspective, however, this can be considered a form of temporary port-forwarding.
This is called connection tracking or stateful connection tracking.
When a response arrives, the router forwards it back to the origin of its associated request.
This is a fundamental part of what NAT is and how it works--no port forwarding necessary.
Similarly, this is also the reason why, as you mentioned, public-to-local requests require port-forwarding.
When a network request passes through a layer of NAT, the router performing the translation keeps track of where the request came from (w/o passing through additional NAT layers).
When a router receives something without an associated request, it doesn't know which local device to forward things on to.

Because of NAT, we know that a computer in public network cannot access a computer inside a local area network (LAN) without setting port forwarding in the router.
I guess the server on the internet only know to send files to the public IP address of my ISP's router, and how does the file actually get to my computer, with potentially several layers of NAT in between?
From a technical standpoint, there's no port forwarding involved.
Is there a temporary port-forwarding automatically being set in the router?
So, how does a computer inside a LAN actually download files from the internet?
I am not a computer network expert, so if I get any concept wrong, please point out.
