OEM should just be installed one one computer to die together with the hardware.
I've always used OEM system builder editions and have moved them to different hardware many times.
Some suppliers will only supply an OEM copy with some kind of hardware such as a drive, but YMMV.
There is no difference between the versions, except in the terms of use, i.e.
There's what the license states, and then there's reality.
Getting the full version means that you can move your copy of Windows to a new machine and re-activate it without worrying, the worst you'll have to do is phone Microsoft and tell them that the old copy of Windows is gone.
I would assume that so long as you keep the media for Windows Vista then the upgrade version should be the same.
It is legal for you to buy an OEM copy of Windows, but they are effectively "one-shot" installs, they live and die on the hardware they are installed on, I'm not sure if that means you can reactivate if HDD fails and you replace it even though your system is effectively the same...
A Dell OEM would be a lot more restrictive than a "System Builder Pack" from newegg or amazon.
With XP I've always had to call it in, but with Vista I've had no issues.
It's free and easy to use and I cannot imagine anything appart from directx to use windows for...
