I appeared to be pasting no extra characters - for an 8 character password, 8 circles appeared.
I used a third-party app (Ditto, in this case) to do a "Plain text paste".
When logging in to a Windows 2003 server, after the login failed, I'd see 13 circles.
I am not getting any spaces or extra charactors when copying (verified by using a hex editor).
When I copy/paste the password from notepad to RDP login, the login fails.
Clearly the password I thought I was sending was not being sent.
I have a simple work-around for this and it is to use the shortcuts of Ctrl+C (Copy) Ctrl+V (paste) instead of the right-click menu.
However, if I intentionally typed an incorrect 8 character password, I'd see 8 circles.
I've also had this happen when logging into sharepoint.
After I have successfully logged in, I can logout and then paste the password from notepad and it will work.
There is a hotfix (not included in a Windows Update) for this issue: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2547752 (Windows 7/2008R2 with or without SP1)
I don't know how long before it will stop working again, but I've run into this many times.
I was using Windows 7 on my workstation, and the issue was occuring with both Windows 2008 and Windows 2003 servers.
The password is exactly as I type it (not replacing 1 for I or anything like that).
I'm not sure if this is the case for you, but trying a "plain text paste" may help.
There is a strange problem i'm seeing when using remote desktop.
I have passwords stored in notepad (yes, I realize i have passwords stored in notepad).
