Is there a way of downloading 8.1 and installing it locally, or am I doomed to download for all eternity (well, til the 60 are done, anyway?
I have looked at installing Windows 8.1 from an ISO but as these are OEM keys I think this will cause other issues - also the fact they do not have a network port means I would have to install from USB which would likely be even slower than downloading from the Store.
The only thing they will have access to is our guest wireless and the internet, authenticated through a Smoothwall proxy.
I can configure Windows Updates to run through our proxy server which, although it seems to work, is very slow.
WSUS Offline does seem to work a little bit better - it takes a good 30 minutes to build a list of updates.
The place I work have recently bought 60 Lenovo Windows 8 Tablets as a trial for a BYOD setup.
I am currently installing 8.1 from the Store but at 2.1GB this is not a quick download and having to do it 60 times will cause me issues.
As they are on a completely separate VLAN they do not (and will not) have access to our WSUS server so I cannot hook them into that to get them updated.
It has been requested that they are fully updated and upgraded to Windows 8.1 before deployment.
