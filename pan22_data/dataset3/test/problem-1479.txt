I've not used it, but the config (below) would seem to suggest that you could enable it, and use your host's IP with a particular port with any of a number of VNC clients to gain control of your virtual machine.
Open installed Mac OS go to Menu click on Apple icon -> System Prefenreces -> Network -> Ethernet and see your ip address
The simplest easy way no use of virtual machine settings just follow the steps provided in the link.
All of your VM's will have similar MAC addresses, so you can narrow it down that way if you have a large network.
Another option for Linux is arp-scan (it's not usually installed by default, but has very few dependencies).
To find any unknown host on your network (whether it's a VM or not) you can use Angry IP scanner.
The command arp-scan -l will give you a table of IP addresses and associated MAC addresses.
Maybe it is too late for answer, but I had same problem.
Simply install VMware vSphere Client and after logon you can right click on VM and open in console where mouse and keyboard works.
