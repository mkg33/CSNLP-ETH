Please disable password auth: open the config file /etc/ssh/ssh_config and add the line PasswordAuthentication no.
When you log in with a password you transmit your password to the server.
It is also a known fact that trojans are put into (some) warez before they are distributed.
A keylogger would for example email the login details to a hacker which then easily could access the server.
With a Man-In-The-Middle attack this is very easy to accomplish inside a local network.
A key is orders of magnitude longer, and is not displayed at any point so it avoids these three issues.
With public key authentication, they cannot obtain your private key as only your public key every goes to the server.
This means that some individuals could modify the sshd server to retrieve the password.
What I consider the biggest risk, given you have taken care of the basics with a strong password, is that a lot of computers have keyloggers installed without the user realizing it.
Use arpspoof and iptables to put your patched server between the client and the authentic sshd server.
I recently was warned by Norton about downloading Zombee Mod installer (not the jar, the installer) for adding flight to the Minecraft jar.
I don't know if this is correct or not, but it was pretty specific with filenames.
There are even people creating entire sites of useful utilities that contains trojans, so it can happen to the best of us.
This means that the operator of the server can modify the SSHD to get access to your password.
You can just patch the sshd server by installing this patch (https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-mitm).
I looked at the details and Norton listed a lot of utilities on this site that was marked as containing a trojan.
The reason you use key based auth is that the key is so far above current or near future brute forcing that you need to be either coming from your own PC, or have the key on a USB stick or similar.
With this mechanism the password will be transmitted to the sshd server (like @ramon has already said).
