As you will see the result was that chkdsk actually deleted the files for me.
Just create a Empty folder and then use robocopy to mirror that new empty folder over the top of the one with the bad file.
It's easier than booting Linux, even using a live CD.
Sorry kinda late, not sure how to remove the one file however you can all the files in the directory.
I fixed a FLAC file like this by using Winamp's basic open command, using that program explorer window.
If you have Cygwin installed it should be able to take care of the file.
This basically mirrors an empty list over the top of whatever was there.
When I went to the folder, I had the rename option, unlike Explorer.
So, if you want to keep the files, I don't know what to do, but this will get rid of the files for sure.
A barebones Cygwin setup only takes a few minutes, and I always keep it around anyway because there are so many good tools.
I would imagine that mv would do it to in case you wanted to keep the file.
I had that problem just now and using rm from Cygwin in a bash shell was able to delete the file just fine when no Windows app, including Explorer and including trying to use the UNC filespec with CMD.exe helped.
drag and drop to a new folder, navigate in command prompt to that folder and type
