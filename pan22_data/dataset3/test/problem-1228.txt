Now two weeks later nothing I can do will allow my laptop to see the device.
There are two bluetooth services running (seemingly correctly) but can't see anything.
I followed various pages on the Microsoft Knowledge base and nothing worked.
Found I needed a middle button (why don't laptops have middle buttons?).
Got it, put in the batteries switched it on, my laptop saw it, downloaded the Intellipoint drivers, I played a bit of Magicka and then exited out and turned the mouse off as I awaited my brothers return from Warsaw.
I am currently sat in my hotel room annoyed that I can't get this working.
So I set it to Local Service, entered my normal user password and now it works again.
Managed to get it working after comparing the services to the Dell Latitude I use at work.
I then tried to see if I could see any other devices - I set my HTC Desire to discoverable but my laptop couldn't see that either.
I bought an Envy 17 laptop running Windows 7 Professional x64.
The batteries are fine - the battery tester needle flies over to 'max'.
My machine was set to Local System Account but the Dell was running with Local Service user account.
