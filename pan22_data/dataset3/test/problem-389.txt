You can do this using simple but great Percona online Tool.
Does it mean even I am using in such a small size, the server still use 128M RAM?
First of all generate an optimal my.cnf (config file) for you server.
The buffer pool is used by MySQL for caching InnoDB data and indexes in memory.
Until the bufferpool is fully utilized, the RAM will be available to other applications.
This means that the MySQL will not start if it cannot grab ahold of 128M of RAM, but your server will not initially use that 128M of memory.
If your InnoDB tables are that small 128MB is more than enough and effectively all InnoDB tables will be treated as in-memory tables.
The 128Mb is a limit of how large the buffer can be and it is only filled when needed.
Many patterns says that you must or may give innodb buffer pool 70-80% of your server's total memory.
Optimizing InnoDB buffer pool is common practice in MySQL Optimization stage.
MySQL allocates the memory for the bufferpool at startup, but only actually occupies the memory as needed.
