This reminds me that I can temporary change my auth credential in Chrome by using Incognito mode (private browsing).
If you are on Mac OS X and you are wondering how to remove a basic-authentication credential from a website, you won't find the password in Safari preferences.
Is there any way to clear the stored credentials for that specific website only?
However, now that I have changed my password, Safari no longer displays the page, keeps trying to load it with the old password, and eventually displays an authentication error page.
      Choose 'Remove All' in order to delete all of the saved passwords.
You can save it as bookmark calling it "reset intranet credentials".
      Click on a password listing and push the 'Remove' button in order to delete the password from Safari's memory.
      Go to the 'AutoFill' section in the Safari Preferences window.
Search for the name you want to get rid of (it will be something like "your.internetserver.com (john.doe)", select it, right click, and then delete it.

Open it up (it's in Utilities) and then go to the Passwords Category (the categories are on the left, at the bottom - you don't need to be doing anything with your keychains here).
This assuming your actual user and password aren't actually "foo" and "bar".
I can of course reset Safari entirely, but I'd like to avoid that if possible.
You should be able to make Safari prompt for credentials again by explicitly specifying wrong credentials:
This will bring up a window displaying all of the passwords and usernames that you have authorized Safari to save.
On subsequent visits, Safari logs me in automatically.
      Click on the 'Edit' button to the right of where it says 'User Names and Passwords.'
To access the corporate intranet website, Safari asks me the first time to enter my credentials, using a default HTTP(?)
