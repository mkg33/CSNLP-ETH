Ignore the guy who's telling you to just get a new drive, a few bad sectors does not always indicate a failing drive, they are more often than not caused by unexpected power loss and there is nothing mechanically wrong with the drive.
Some newer drives have a block size of 4096 rather than 512.
Spinrite does 2 things nothing else that I'm aware of does (which is why I own a copy).
It can recover data from a bad sector (rather than erasing it like all the other tools) and it can 'refresh and verify' the disk surface meaning it reads and writes each sector twice to catch sectors that are near to failure.
I tried running Seagate Seatools on the drive but both the short test and long test fail even before they start even chkdsk /f/r doesn't seem to work as the system locks up at stage four.
Also it;s worth bearing in mind even brand new drives come with bad (already reallocated) sectors and always have.
If you don't care about the data you can use the "seatools for DOS" boot disk to scan for bad sectors or, as it's the drive (not the software) that detects and relocates bad sectors any process that can reads all the sectors on your disk without crashing when it finds a bad one should trigger the swap out.
If you have can boot your ubuntu live CD simply pop open a terminal and use dd e.g.
Modern drives have a huge gross error rate by design (the market preferring capacity to reliability) and are correcting a surprising number of errors every second even on new drives.
It will scan all sectors, try to recover the data if possible and mark defective sectors so they're not reused.
Back in the day you had to program these into your operating system by hand when you installed the drive from a list the manufacturer provided with the drive.
The odd 'bad' sector is neither here nor there when you consider the size of modern drives and $50 is a useful amount of money.
Is there a disk bad sector mark utility that just marks these sectors so that the disk doesn't seek them later.
SpinRite from GRC is well known as a disk recovery tool.
People who reckon a single bad sector indicates you drive is near deaths door know nothing.
I already have Windows XP, During installing Ubuntu(dual boot) the disk drive just stuck up at one place and doesn't seem to move ahead..
