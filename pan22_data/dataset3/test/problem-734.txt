When I connect with VPN I am however unable to browse any websites on my own computer, which can be very inconvenient when I am basically waiting an hour for somebody else to finish his job to do a 5 minute job.
If you want to prevent your workmates to bug you (by moving the mouse or tapping keyboard to check up on the screen) you can also use "Disable Remote Input" which will prevent that.
It would be nice if I could still continue browsing.
So for your workmates happening to walk past your PC will only see black screen.
After connecting to to your VPN server your forwarding table probably looks like this
Everybody in the working area however, can see me using my computer remotely and this is not a good situation either, especially during work hours.
Of course, you can add additional PCs from the office network if you have to reach them from your home pc.
It will show a black screen on the actual PC, but your connection will be normal.
An appropriate forwarding table setup would allow you to continue browsing the web.
Sometimes I work from home and I use either of these 2 methods:
When using TeamViewer, they have an option to "Show Black Screen" which does exactly that.
I would like a solution that allows me to continue browsing normally and still control my remote workstation, without other people seeing every move I make on the workstation.
With Teamviewer I can manage the other computer, without suffering the restrictions of using the VPN.
