A server room is a work site that can experience accidents like any other.
This includes cellphones and other communication devices as needed.
Otherwise, earplugs if you're expecting an extended stay.
I don't often hear of fatal accidents in server rooms.
A desk, so you can go in there and work when the "outside" world gets to be too much.
Non-rechargeable types have a habit of always being flat just when you need them most.
I have spent several hours in very cold, air-conditioned server rooms.
Take a picture of cables after doing work, so you can check the picture before walking back to the data center.
Most data centers are under the OSHA requirement for ear protection, but demand earplugs anyway - take a sound reading in the worst spot and remind that the OSHA regs were meant for 8 hours, and you could spend far longer.
If you expect to spend extended periods in a server room, get earphones that act as earplugs.
Hardware and tools that you expect to need, of course - this goes for any job.
One headache from 18 hours in a server room makes them worth the money.
Oh yeah, and a beer fridge won't go astray either.
A camera is important for data center work, but you need to take a picture of a machine that's clear enough to read serial numbers, hostname stickers, model numbers, etc in one shot.
I've seen (or been within earshot of) plenty of incidents where no one was injured and a machine was destroyed, just due to luck.
Take a picture of cables before doing work, of unexpected or surprising fault lights.
I've seen more than one server room in which cellphones didn't work.
But I have witnessed several incidents that could have been fatal if there were no one else around.
Keep your water in a proper container, both for real safety and to create the impression that you are behaving carefully (either to set a good example, or in case you are caught, depending on your position).
A cellphone camera usually can't take a picture of a serial number sticker - to get it in focus, you need to move so far back you don't have enough resolution to read it.
Also a fold-up bed/cot, for those times when things get so bad you're too tired to drive home afterwards.
If it's an internal server room, I'd put above anything else a bin.
I disagree that a cell phone camera is good enough - useless in my experience.
Layered clothing, you may stand in a hot or cold area of high or low airflow.
Personally, I've found one of the most valuable items to be a rechargeable torch (flashlight), mounted just inside the door.
