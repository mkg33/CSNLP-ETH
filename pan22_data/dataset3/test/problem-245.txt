I wrote a little program to parse hg log's command-line output, which happens to look like:
Is there any other program that generates "key: value" data like this?
However, if it is your format, I would go to a more CSV-like format.
With two commands, tr and sed, you can transform it to a more record-like format:
Now I want to go crazy and try running it against some other (real) data.
If you have a more volatile format, xml might be better - not per se, but because there are so many tools out there.
You don't need to repeat the headline in every row, and with tabs instead of ';' or ',' (if you don't need tabs as content), you get a format which is very good to parse by hand, to compare rows, to grep rows with grep, and to produce graphs with LibreOffice or to put the data into a database.
In Chapter 5 of ESRs writing "The Art of Unix Programming, maybe you find some inspiration for your work.
Actually, my program is generic enough to parse any "key: value" pairs, as long as each new record is separated by a blank line.
