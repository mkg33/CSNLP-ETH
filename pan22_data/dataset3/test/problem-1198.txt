Thanks in advance and thank you for reading through all this!
Installation without previous update is possible (though yum will complain about Public keys) and results in the following error:
Becaause puppet and foreman uses ruby1.8 and amazon linux by default uses 2.0
http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.5/index.html#3.3.1RPMPackages
I assume this happens due to conflicting ruby version, so:
Unfortunately I'm running into difficulties with the installation.
After that foreman-installer -i finished successfully.
I used yum downloader on a centos box, and installed
It turns out that I needed to install an additional repository as described in the installation guide for the foreman:
You will need to find either a different way to install Foreman, or preferably a different Linux distribution (Amazon Linux has many issues which make it generally unsuitable for just about anything).
I assume your should do something similar in your AWS instance.
and tried installing the repository (after removing the old one)
I was able to install foreman on Amazon Linux, using the foreman-installer which also installs the foreman-proxy.
Next, the scl-utils package (version 20120229) that is in epel for doesn't have this file /usr/bin/scl_source.
I had similar problems while trying to set up passenger and eventually surrendered.
Packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its clones are not compatible with Amazon Linux.
The suggestions seem useless (--skip-broken installs all dependencies but foreman/puppet).
I am currently in the process of setting up a puppet service for our ec2 instances and decided to give foreman a try (node certificate management and automatic passenger setup seems nice).
