I don't have hard numbers, but the evaporation rate of mineral oil is, to my understanding, VERY low (as opposed to say, gasoline, which has a pretty high evaporation rate, even under normal temperatures, or even water).
The spirits are not an ‚Äùoil" and  will evaporate quickly.
(If memory serves, the original Cray computers were cooled in this way.)
Heating it up by the amount put off by a PC doesn't change that very much, so the amount of evaporation stays very small, and you don't end up with a problem.
Flammability wise, it is virtually inert unless you plan on super-heating it and since it's an oil, it is very slow to evaporation.
The same way that you can use oil to lubricate an engine without killing the driver:
If you are really paranoid, but want to get into immersion cooling, then you should find yourself a source of de-ionized water.
Mineral Spirits are the more "industrial" version of mineral oil.
However, even mineral spirits are safe to handle in controlled amounts and the fumes and no worse than a can of cooking spray.
That's water that's filtered so heavily that there's nothing conductive in it, and thus it's safe to immerse electronics in it.
Look outside of PC hardware and you'll see it has a wide range of uses, including as a laxative.
They are widely used in furniture dry cleaning services.
