Trying different port numbers will be completely trivial and you'll waste the day away by trying.
The reason a web server can have multiple websites on a single IP is because it's using virtual hosts.
All websites share the same IP, and the web server does the routing.
The name to IP address mapping is in DNS and the name to webhost mapping is in the nginx config.
So, from the information you gave here, I would say that it is not possible to connect to a particular website using a particular IP.
If that doesn't cover your question then I'm not sure what you are asking.
You could connect to the different websites by putting the name of the site along with the server's IP address in your /etc/hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts) so that you pass the right Host: header and nginx can route you to the right webroot.
For instance, a website for an Apache website might be xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/~foldername whereas for IIS it might be http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/aliasname.
listens on one IP addresses, and depending on the domain name (the HOST header of the HTTP request), will return a different page.
Your web server configuration should have all this information.
You need to figure out what your web server is, and then you're ability to figure out the addresses becomes MUCH easier.
