That can save you from potential spousal-veto regarding an ugly wire snaking across the house.
Yes, but only if that second wireless router can be configured as a "repeater".
Add in some remote TV viewing from my MythTV and it just wasn't holding up.
Give both the wireless router and the access point the same SSID and encryption/key and your wireless devices will be able to move between to two seamlessly.
A better way to acheive greater wireless coverage would be to run cable, and have an access point instead of a repeater.
Upgraded antennas can extend the range enough to pick up those dead spots.
Basically the router has to be able to connect to the existing LAN.
Bear in mind, similar to DD-WRT, there are only specific routers that this will work on.
The speeds I was getting on the WLAN were pretty crappy when I was running through the repeater, and with broadband speeds now creeping up to the levels where it can saturate a 802.11g network that's a significant thing now.
Another option to look into if a hardwire isn't in the cards would be to see if your AP has replaceable antenna.
I've used a dedicated hardware repeater before and ultimately replaced it with a hardwire run.
While some wireless routers (and access points) can also function as a repeater, you need to take into account for every repeater you add to the "chain" you effectivly halve the speed/bandwidth.
It improved reception in the places we needed it and speeds were noticeably better.
A hack-ish way around this would be to use a wireless bridge to connect to the LAN port of the second unit to provide the link, but at that point, you might as well have bought a real repeater
I bit the bullet and surface-mounted a Cat-5 cable to a spot in the middle of the house and put my access-point there instead.
If you do have one of these routers though it works like a charm.
I'm not quite sure, but I think the Apple AirPort Extreme can act as a repeater, though it is a quite expensive router..
