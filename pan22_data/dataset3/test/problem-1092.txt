To confuse things for me even more, executing find ./ -exec rm -rf {} \; within the directory itself via the Terminal works (slowly).
I have an interest in deleting old files once a day at 3 AM using a script scheduled via launchd.
I think the "Too Many Arguments" makes sense - it sounds like there's a cap on number of arguments, and I have ~33,000 files in the one workstation I'm proving this concept on.
Since the production workstations haven't had this script running, they have a lot of images, on the order of several hundred gigabytes.
I've performed the delete using the Terminal so I'm not worried about the process in the future (it won't produce anywhere near 33k pictures in a day), but what I want to know is why find works in the Terminal with 33k arguments, but not within a shell script.
This means that when find is executed via the shell script, it stops and says "Too Many Arguments."
I have verified this to work on a development workstation with only about ~250 mb of images (30 images).
I have a work station that stores images temporarily before compressed versions are uploaded to a server for safe keeping.
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why (trying xargs, seeing if changing + to ; affected anything... etc) the only thing I didn't try was actually going into the directory via the shell script to avoid using find altogether.
