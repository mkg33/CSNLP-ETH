The simple solution is to get two internet connections, one for the appliance and the other for the server.
For quality control I want to set up a test appliance at my location that will talk to my server through the internet.
What will happen is if you force your appliance to contact it 'over the internet', the default gateway on the appliance will send the packets to the router.
It is absolutely crucial that this goes through the internet to make sure the test environment is as close to the production environment as possible.
And then be ignored by your router because it's not aware of it.
I have a server appliance that is distributed to my clients (I'll refer to this as the 'appliance').
That said, pushing the traffic to the router and have the router re-direct it back into your network is probably a pretty good test for everything except for latency and reliability.
Strictly speaking, if you want to impose a less direct route, you can do so by adding a more specific, less direct route to your hosts.
Your computer already goes through the internet to talk to a computer on the same network.
Is there a way to do this with one internet connection?
If you could get the router to forget about its WAN address (let's say you have two IP's and the router is not aware of the other one), it will get to the first hop of your ISP and immediately come straight back.
But that's inefficient and adds a point of failure.
So it's not really a very good test at all actually because those are the two most important things, apart from port forwarding the right access.
This is actually the IP Address on my WAN port, so I'll just send it back into the LAN segment after matching any port forwarding rules".
Packets are routed according to routing tables, if they can be routed directly, they are.
Otherwise, you may look at forwarding ports in your firewall to match the service you're looking to provide to "the other end"..
