I was confused, took it back, and sure enough, it was slower than molasses in winter.
It's the same as with any other antivirus: Having two on the same system is not recommended.
Rather than uninstall my AVG, I disabled it, just in case I wasn't happy with Microsoft's.
Like with other Anti Virus programs, you may get a combination that works and can be installed together, but just because you can does not mean you should.
I did my research before I installed Microsofts's Essentials and they recommend you uninstall any other Anti Virus programs prior to installing theirs.
Haven't seen a need to re-enable AVG, even to see if they play nice with each other, On the other hand, how does one really know if your Anti Virus program is really working?
I would never have two security programs that do the same job - AV, Firewall etc.... You are just going to be asking for trouble.
You don't have to, but it is highly recommended to do so - your system might otherwise slow to a crawl.
I just had a client who was complaining that their computer would not even work anymore after they got it back from me.
Turned out that they installed AVG on the machine as a preventative measure, which conflicted with MSE.
