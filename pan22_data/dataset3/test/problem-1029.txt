One option is to try the Live HTTP Headers Firefox addon.
one user apparently developed something that runs well in IE.
The FlashGot and DownloadHelper Firefox extensions may be useful.
I personally use firebug for this purpose - there you can monitor network activity which flags all the files the system downloads and how long it takes, as soon as I see the video file, I grab the absolute URL and snag it with wget.
Open the plugin, load the page and start the video playing.
Somewhere there will be the request for the video file, usually with the extension .flv

It can help to save the headers to a text file, then open it in a text editor (so you can use it's text-search)
I left you with that original link just in case you run into some troubleshooting issues.
"How To Save Flash Video From Firefox Cache Folder" explains this well:
Another option is to let the video fully load, then prod around Firefox's cache directory for the file.
