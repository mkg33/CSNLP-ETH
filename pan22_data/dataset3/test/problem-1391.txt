You should really consider pfsense which is a embedded distribution that does FW/Router and captive portal.
I do some wifi hotspot installations, and a new client recently asked me if it would be possible to force users to his website when they first open their browsers.
SO- has anyone ever set up captive portal this way?
I'm comfortable flashing the firmware and setting it up.
Is it reliable and easy to support, remotely and securely?
If I can make it work for this client I'm thinking about offering it as an option to future clients.
All you need (as far as I can tell) is a Linksys WRT54G.
If I set my customers up this way will I eventually end up with Linksys Bricks all over the place?
So, after much more Googling the cheapest solution I can find is DD-WRT and Wifidog.
See http://www.nufw.org/ for another versatile open-source solution that might help here.
It's a free wifi hotspot, so my client doesn't need authentication, just wants users to hit his site first.
Some of our client have already made their own captive portal router.
i provide open-wrt routers with WIFIDOG open for captive portal.
After some Googling I figured out that this is "captive portal".
