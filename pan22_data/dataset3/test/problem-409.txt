Fusion has a great advantage in that the VMs run in the background and the Fusion application merely connects to running VMs.
I would recommend Fusion (if you want to spend the money) or Virtual Box (which I haven't used but have only heard good things about).
Also I find the interface of Parallels more intuitive.
I can't compare performance with parallels or fusion since I haven't tried them, but virtualbox is good enough for me to completely forget that I'm in a virtual machine when I run it.
Even if cost is no issue I like Virtualbox because it's cross-platform.
You can run your VM's on almost any other machine/OS, not just macs.
And while my work Mac Mini is much faster than my old MacBook, Parallels feels much more fluent and responsive to me.
I can have my personal environment up and running within minutes on almost any computer.
(Boot Camp can be combined with Fusion or Parallels but unless you need a native Windows, I wouldn't recommend using it or that option.)
I also found Fusion to be better at resource management than Parallels.
I have a development VM that I bring with me on a usb drive together with installation files for virtualbox.
Even though I seem to be the only one: I prefer Parallels.
This means you can have VMs run in the background while you log in and out and if the Fusion application crashes (for some reason), the VMs are still running.
It also means that you can "disconnect" from a running VM rather than shut it down, which can be very useful.
All three can do the mixing desktops thing (called Coherence Mode in Parallels and Unity View in Fusion).
