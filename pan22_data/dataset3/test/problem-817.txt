Folders will now always be kept at the top, regardless of sort direction.
will sort directories first (g) then in most-recent-first (-d) order.
The @tryingToBeClever's answer worked for me, but with two additional steps:
I always have the problem with folders appearing before my files.
Next, click the "Dated Modified" column header, with the arrow pointing down.
Files>Change Folder and Search Options>Folder Options>View
Finally, Hold shift and click the "Name" column header.
When you arrange by date modified, folders are always at the bottom in descending order.
You can then apply it to the defaults for all File Explorer views by going to:
It seems when you arrange by date, folders are displayed at the top regardless of the direction of arrangement.
Same with the folders, the most recent will be at the top of the folders.
Try arranging the files by Date instead of Date Modified.
The view will now show all folders at the top, and the most recently modified files will be at the top of their group.
I had to add steps 3 and 4, otherwise the attribute A of the files was always going first before that of the folders, i.e., D.
