If your computer is on a network, and you have access to the router (on home networks, it is often part of the modem), then try find the port forwarding section of your router's settings and set your torrent client's port to forward to your computer.
Other solutions include the use of a paid VPN or worse, a public proxy.
First off, you should test if your ISP is actually throttling your torrent trafic.
If you are being throttled, you might be able to bypass it by enforcing encryption in your torrent software, as this will make it more difficult to detect whether your traffic is actually bittorrent traffic.

I run in the 30000-60000 range, and I've nver had issues.
You may not need to enable encryption if your ISP uses naive analysis, like mine does.
Randomize the port on every launch, if your router supports uPNP, than it's not a pain at all.
My ISP occasionally throttles a port (on the rate of every 6 months), and then I just switch to another random port.
Most ISPs engaging in this behavior now use deep packet inspection which allows them to identify and throttle torrent traffic regardless of the port used.
