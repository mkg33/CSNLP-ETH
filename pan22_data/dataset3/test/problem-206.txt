the GPU stores 8 bytes for each 4x4 tile in your texture.
So yes, it is true for the most part that a .png will take more space in video memory than on disk.
Textures can be stored compressed or uncompressed in both video memory and system memory.
For DXT3/DXT5 compressed textures, the GPU stores 16 bytes for each 4x4 tile in your texture.
There are some caveats with both uncompressed and compressed textures:
The uncompressed data (at 8-bits per RGB channel) would ordinarily be 4x4x3 = 48 bytes, so that's a compression ratio of 6:1.
Mip-mapping will increase the need for video memory to.
Most GPUs can only read a very specific compression format.
For uncompressed textures, the general rule of thumb is that it will take the same amount of space in video memory as it does in uncompressed form in system memory.
AFAIK it's the images width * height * BPP, independent if it's a PNG, JPG or BMP.
A large png on disk may only take up a couple megabytes but I imagine that on the gpu the same png is stored in an uncompressed format which takes up much more space.
I don't know how DDS or other compressable formats are layed out.
My knowledge in this topic may be a little outdated.
