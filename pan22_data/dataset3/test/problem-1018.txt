But given the caching capabilities of Reporting Services and extensive built-in capabilities for scale out (see Planning for Scale-Out Deployment), one has to wonder whether such a replication topology is truly needed.
There's no need at all for RS to use a DE on the same machine.
Wouldn't it be a lot better to have multiple servers running Reporting Services, all of them querying a single Database Engine server?
However, I would take a long deep look into the MS SQL deployment and architecture documentation to see if there's anything that says "build it this way, taking care that you do X and don't do Y" or "It won't work at all because of Frob."
About NLBing Reporting Services: yes, you can, but it has some caveats.
As long as you're only doing queries to the NLB name.
One solution is to stage the distribution, have one of the subscribers (or more) act as a publisher/distributor too.
Make sure you do not have the publisher act as its own distributor, with many ('unlimited') scaling the subscribers load on the distributor becomes quite significant.
See http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc281307.aspx.
This way more subscribers can be added as subscribers to this second-hand publication without adding further load on the original distributor.
