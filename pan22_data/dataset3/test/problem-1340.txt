The very first thing you should ALWAYS do when trying to recover data off a drive is to make a block-level copy into another location.
You don't want to run that disk any more than you have to and risk either damaging the data or having the disk physically fail.
If you have the skills and a spare drive of the same or larger capacity you could make a sector-for-sector image of the "failed" disk to a spare disk and then use recovery tools on the spare disk.
I used a restoration program over the unallocated partition but it got nothing.
Don't perform recovery against the original disk, though.
I connected it directly to my computer and it was read as "unallocated" ...
I "created" a simple volume from the disk manager and "quick" formatted the hard disk to be able to see a drive for other recovery programs to work on.
That said, there are commercial firms who specialize in data recovery.
Make a block level copy of the disk with clonezilla.
I have a 1 Terra My Book Western Digital external hard disk ... Its USB socket got broken so I kept connecting and disconnecting it several times to make it work ... sometimes it worked and other times it told me "This disk should be formatted", anyways ...
I used "recuva" program and "restoration" program and I got nothing ...
If you formatted it, your best bet would be either a data recovery company, or hope you had that data backed up elsewhere because it is most likely gone for good.
By doing a quick format you may have overwritten critical parts of the filesystem.
I really need your help as It contains VERY valuable data to me (Pictures specifically).
That disk is what you'll be sending to a data recovery firm when you find you can't recover any data yourself.
For photographs the PhotoRec tools work very well.
