I've repeatedly heard comments along the lines of "Don't try to make your dream game initially, just make ANYTHING."
The reason I think you should keep it small to begin with is so you do not become unmotivated.
(see http://interactionartist.com/index.php?page=allgad)  Imagine having 219 ideas and prototypes in less than a years time.
One of the five seems like it could actually be a fun game, so I might spend more time to actually make it into something.
We don't have experience, we don't have massive art teams, and we don't have the a large diverse team of people.
Yesterday, I happened to have found a link to a guy who made one mini-game or interactive program each day for 219 days!
They have horrible graphics, are buggy, and often not incredibly fun to play, but the cool thing is that I have an idea now of the possible success of five new game mechanics, and I've lost less than 5 hours.
Don't put yourself on a time-table, this will hinder your project.
It's OK not to have the coolest new idea for a game, a lot of ideas are used and reused.
Sure, to have a commercially successful game you need polish and high production value, but "you can put makeup on a pig, but it doesn't change the fact that it's a pig" lol.
You need to start of with a project that certainly interests you but you should be keeping it small.
"), increase your portfolio, and increase your skill as a designer.
Games evolve as they are created, I think you should challenge yourself with a simplistic project and allow yourself to build it into something more over time.
Sure, a lot of them will be junk (many of his are less than stellar), but incredibly, many of them will quite possibly be fun and interesting ideas.
Do what you can to create your game without any of the cool animations or fancy graphics.
Creating something within a super-constrained time frame forces you to focus on the core mechanic of the game, the idea that makes it special.
I've done it five times now, and the crazy thing is that I have five new game ideas done.
Unity3d now has a store you can download lots of amazing free or cheap prototyping scripts/models/animations ($15 gets you a great prototype graphics set, and I've had a lot of fun with a free explosions kit).
Creating sprites or models is time consuming, adding animations just increases the time exponentially.
Firstly, I think you are being to hard on yourself.
I had recently been having some of the same issues you mentioned, but I decided to try using my hour lunch break at work to create a simple game each day.
Admittedly, an hour is obviously not long, but if you are sufficiently experienced in some type of game tool (Flash for me, or Unity), it should be possible to make something during this time period.
I've been doing a lot of reading and listening to pod casts recently, and a lot of successful developers stress making a bunch of games as one of the best paths towards success as a game developer/designer.
Pick a simple game you enojoy from the 80s/90s and give it some interface love, turn it into something shiny again.
You need to be creative with what you have, not with what you don't have.
Doing so will increase your confidence ("Wow, I have X ideas functional in only Y hours?
Blizzard hasn't made an original game in years, but they still make the best games.
How much better to spend a tiny amount of time on each concept, then you can focus on polishing the ideas that seem to actually have merit.
