May be you could write something like warning mechanism that will warn when integer type is used.
I would consider #pragma message("your warning message here").
Currently if T = int the algorithm is going to produce somewhat incorrect results.
Also, runtime_error is a good fit, but it has child called invalid_argument, which perfectly matches the case.
I think that using std::stringstream is an overkill here.
It must be at least of length window_length" is pretty good by itself, since most IDEs will probably stop execution, so that programmers could have a look.
Throwing just "The length of the range is too short.
It is possible to give window_length type std::iterator_traits<ForwardIterator>::difference_type.
Well, the result of ss.str() is obvious :) It is possible to write constexpr there, or throw the string right into the constructor.
Even if they had a catch for this, they would need to parse a string to be actually able to do something.
It might get portability problems but the code will still compile since unrecognized #pragmas are ignored.
