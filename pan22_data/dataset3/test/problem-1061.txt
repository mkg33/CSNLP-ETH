At this point I'm all out of ideas, and feel like I've exhausted all internet resources, so any ideas, anyone?
The keyboard has a Swedish layout and the air mouse has a US layout, and I would prefer not having to change the global layout in X every time I switch.
I have searched extensively and found several similar discussions, all involving setxkbmap -device <device> -layout <layout> as a solution, but no matter how I try that command always changes the layout of both devices.
I did try reattaching my devices to the master keyboard instead, with xinput reattach 11 3, but that just gives me this error message:
I'm thinking this might have something to do with the fact that, for some reason, both devices are listed as 'pointer' in xinput -list.
Maybe setting the layout of a pointer device is not allowed and thus my attempts to do so default to setting the master layout instead?
I have a Linux machine on which I frequently switch between a standard, wireless Logitech keyboard with built-in trackpad, and an "air mouse" with built-in mini keyboard.
Here, device 9 is the Logitech keyboard, and device 11 is the keyboard part of the air mouse.
