those are the two underlying shifts in environment that will cause problems for you if you try to do this migration piece-meal.
one of the key things Apple is trying to do with Snow Leopard is to surreptitiously get the whole world to migrate to true 64-bit computing, and to abandon PPC as well and fat binaries and all that jazz.
While there might be some way to bootstrap in a fix, I think I'm just going to dump my old MacPorts installation and reinstall from MacPorts-*-SnowLeopard.dmg
you need to completely reinstall macports 1.8 when you migrate from 10.5 to 10.6.  macports does not support migration.
It relies on various other components which need to be compiled in 32 bit or universal mode, but by default aren't.
it'll be on the Snow Leopard DVD, but it won't install unless you explicitly install it from the optional folder.
before you uninstall (or just move /opt/local), make sure to save the output of "port installed | grep active" to a text file so you can reference what you had installed.
If you do the upgrade there should be no reason to recompile, unless of course you want something to run as 64 bit.
after you've uninstalled, you also need to install the new xcode version.
In my case, most stuff that was already installed under MacPorts still worked after installing 10.6.
Here's what I did to get wine-devel (this is the 'bleeding-edge' alternative to the wine port) running on Snow Leopard:
the tool(s) won't tell you that, but will give various esoteric messages that will frustrate you because it ALMOST works if you do various forms of manual upgrades.
these problems were similar when historically migrating from tiger to leopard.
The only significant differences I've seen so far is strartup, shutdown, wakeup and sleep.
In a way Leopard is also 64 bits in that it supports 64 apps, even though the OS itself is only 32 bits.
Eveything else, be it 32 or 64 bit, runs just fine.
then do a clean new install of macports in the usual way, and install the packages from your list that you know you'll be using again.
IMHO, Snow Leopard is the first OS X release where most end users won't experience all that much new good stuff and if you are happy with your installation, there is no reason to upgrade.
