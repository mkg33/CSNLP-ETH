Additionally- We have VMhosts which will reside on a different network as they are physically in a nother location.
We did not configure the MTU on a port basis but globally with "system mtu jumbo" command.
This is a Gigabit switch so to my understanding the Gigabit port will accept the frames on ingress- but will drop the frame on egress if the port is not configured to forward jumbo frames.
In the switch config- we specified a global jumbo MTU of 9000.
I'm assuming these gigabit ports utilize this command and be able to send/receive jumbo frames?
We have 2 new catalyst 3750 switches to support our VM hosts and SAN arrays.
I am hoping one of you can help clear up some of my confusion on this matter.
Is it worth it to have jumbo frames configured if a host is set with an MTU of 1500 and the SAN 9000?
The SAN arrays utilize jumbo frames with an MTU of 9000.
The frames will be fragmented if needed at layer 3- is it worth configuring the hosts for jumbo frames considering the fragmentation?
