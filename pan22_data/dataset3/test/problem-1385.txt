So essentially, the problem was fixed by forcing Windows to rebuild the driver data structures for the USB devices.
When I got my iPhone 7, it had ios 10.1, and File Explorer on Windows 10 could not show the phone as an external drive.
Now, looking at File Explorer, the iPhone is mounted as an drive under This PC
After a couple hours on the phone with Apple Support Level 2, and then almost five hours in an Apple Store being helped by a succession of seven people, we finally just stumbled into a solution, and it is so easy, I'm actually unhappy we wasted all that time on this idiotic and unnecessary problem.
Whether this is a security change on iOS 10 or whether it's a bug, it seems to only work after the device is unlocked prior to plugging it in.
The mouse was still not working, but I managed to log in using only the keyboard.
Since iOS 10, I've noticed that a lot of Windows Computers do not see the MTP portion of the iPhone when it is plugged in UNLESS the device is unlocked before it is plugged into the computer.
At the end of this process, the mouse was working again.
Also you will most likely need to update to iTunes 12.5.1 if you are attempting to sync photos via iTunes as well.
What eventually worked was going into device manager and deleting every USB hub starting at the top until my (USB) mouse stopped working.
If you already are; try uninstalling iTunes, then reinstalling via Apple Software Update.
As the desktop came up, I saw messages about (USB) drivers being reloaded.
This has worked for both my iPhone and iPad, and now on two machines.
What fixed it (on two different make and model pcs):
And after that, when I plugged the iPhone in, it came up in "My Computer" and in Device Manager.
I don't know whether you actually have to unplug the phone after disabling, but that's the step we took, so it won't hurt to leave that step in.
Make sure you’re using the most up to date version of iTunes – 12.5.1.21 as far as I know.
