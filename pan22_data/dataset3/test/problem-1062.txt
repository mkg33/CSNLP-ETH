This is a pretty common security descriptor for services.
If so, ProcMon would be highly useful for figuring out specifically where the access needs to be granted.
I verified that Bob could not stop / start the Tomcat service (using "NET STOP tomcat5").
I would think that using Group Policy to modify the security descriptor would work fine.
I'd recommend creating a group to delegte this right to, putting a user in that group, getting the group's SID (using WHOAMI or any other tool) and modifying the security descriptor this way.
3) I created a limited user called "bob" on my box, opened a "RUNAS" command-prompt as him, and got his SID from "WHOAMI /ALL" (a command that's on Windows Server 2003 but not on XP... don't know about Vista and Windows 7 off the top of my head).
I have seen cases where some services don't like the default permission that a group policy-based modification puts on a service (look at this posting about the Windows Search service if you want to see what I'm talking about: http://peeved.org/blog/2007/12/07), but that has been uncommon in my experience.
1) Downloaded the Tomcat 5.5.27 Windows Service installer and installed it.
I'm not sure what you've tried to do before, but here's what I just did and had success:
5) I flipped back to my "Bob" command prompt and verified that I could now stop and start the service using NET STOP and NET START.

I received the same error you report in your post.
This SDDL string gives Bob's SID (S-1-5-21-1409082233-484763869-854245398-1009) rights to stop, start, and pause the service (RP, WP, and DT, respectively).
2) Dumped the TomCat5 service security descriptor using "sc sdshow tomcat5", which showed me:
You need to find out what makes these Tomcat services so special that the normal methods for controlling them in Windows don't work.
The SYSTEM and built-in Administrators have "full control", "Power Users" can stop, start, and pause the service, and "Authenticated Users" can query properties of the service (I'm glossing over a bit here).
4) From my regular administrator command-prompt, ran the following:
