If there's some software that won't handle it, I haven't seen it...
Changing from C to A can only break things and doens't do anything working better.
Despite the fact that A and B were taken and C became the default hard drive assignment, most applications assume that C is the default OS location, A and B are floppies, and D is CDROM or DVD drives.
When I built my last home machine using Vista, I tried to use A: & B: for the CD-ROM drives.
Most application wouldn't have problem to run even if C: is not the system drive but you may have custom scripts running on your server with hard path to some file (exemple if you have a software to analyze apache log file) and if you reinstall your server you probably don't want to have to check every config files or script to change path.
I've used other drive letters like D: for my Windows partition (and then A-C for data partitions) since Windows 2000 without a single problem so this is just tradition.
I forget all of the problems with that I encountered, but Vista was clearly not amused.
I believe that it probably has more to do with legacy then it does moving forward.
I've seen applications break if the default OS is not located on C.
There are pros and cons both ways, with neither being a clear winner.
Something like this needs a reason for change and so far nobody has come up with anything that would warrant such change.
As for dropping the use of drive letters altogether, the same argument applies.
You just want to copy them from old installation to new one then run and it works.
