At work, my company has lately gone crazy and has started blocking all the sites (Almost all, facebook, gtalk, picasa, hotmail, gmail etc etc).
1) Have set up Squid proxy server at home and is running on port 3128 (default port).
I found that I had to use the argument "-oUsePrivilegedPort\ yes" to get this to work.
I tried to establish tunnel using the following command, but it doesn't seem to be working.
You probably need to change the proxy server to "localhost" (127.0.0.1).
In firefox, I changed proxy address to Office_Linux_machine and port to 2011, but its not working.
But, I have observed that they allow any outbound SSH and I have a Linux machine @home to which I am able to SSH without any problem.
Before you go any further you really should check with management before attempting to circumvent company network security policies -- if they discover that you're breaking their rules (without authorization), which were probably put in place for security reasons, you could lose your job.
It's been years since I set it up, so I don't remember why that was required.
I even I tried to telnet to office_linux_machine on port 2011, and hoped it to land me on Squid server @home, but connection is failing here too...
2) Have a linux machine at office from which I can SSH to my home.
Also, you MUST have something listening on the remote port in order for the traffic to be passed.
HOME_IP_ADDRESS => Ip adrress of Linux machine @home
So, now I am thinking of using SSH tunneling to divert my traffic via my Linux machine at home to get access to places from which I am now barred from.
Not having something listening there is why it was refusing connections.
3) Set the linux_machine_at_office as proxy in my browser.
