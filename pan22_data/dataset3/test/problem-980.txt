I tried importing the pem file containing it, chrome says all okay, but nothing appears in chrome's cert manager.
However, I'm only using my server privately and I don't really want to re-setup my certs for that.
Chrome does not offer an option to import certificates (you can't even view them easily in the current version) so you need to fire up Internet Explorer and import it from there.
By the way: I faced the same issue as you did with StartCom certs.

As already mentioned by Seth Chrome uses the Windows cert store.
Is there any way to force Google Chrome to trust my cert?
Also tried .der and .p7b with password, and chrome doesn't even ask for the password.... Am I assuming correctly that chrome simply refuses to trust/import certs issues by distrusted CAs and that I cannot circumvent that in any way?
It only took me a few minutes to swap to Let's Encrypt certificates with Certbot (https://certbot.eff.org/)
My server cert has been signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", and that is a CA that is now generally distrusted.
