The above steps are just to help you narrow down the possible issue.
If there's still no clue, do a full manual check of /var/log/dmesg for other errors.
To make this permanent, add the above line inside .xprofile in your home directory (create it if it doesn't exist already).
As a workaround to load it manually, type this in a terminal:
On Ubuntu 14.04 (and perhaps others), the module-x11-bell module tries to play a bell.ogg sample, which is not loaded in PulseAudio's sample cache.
BTW, pcspkr is blacklisted by default again in Karmic.
For me, it was solved by opening "alsamixer" on the console and unmuting the "Beep" slider.
First, you need to be sure the right module is loaded.
With these kind of problems, it can be difficult to guess the answer right off the bat.
This command will tell you whether the sample is loaded or not:
A quick grep of the other logs in /var/log/* with today's timestamp might also turn up something.
If not, the sound control center won't do nothing AFAIK (and even if the module is loaded, I don't know if the bugs mentioned in this thread are solved in Jaunty).
