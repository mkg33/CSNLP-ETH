When you're done, the Ubuntu installer should recognize the Windows partitions.

See the FixParts documentation for further details.
The easiest way to do this is with my FixParts program, which comes as part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu.
I tried universal usb installer but it is still the same.
Windows is already installed in MBR, even though I have a UEFI machine.
Launch fixparts on the disk and answer in the affirmative when it asks if you want to erase the leftover GPT data.
If you have further problems, post back with details.
This library is used by the Ubuntu installer, which shows MBR disks with leftover GPT data as being completely unpartitioned.
I have confirmed that Windows is installed as MBR.
I wanted to install Ubuntu 12.04 side by side with Windows 8.1 in my SSD.
I was able to create a bootable usb disk using Rufus 1.4.9 that installs Windows in legacy mode (i.e.
