Extending the partition is tricky and dangereous, be sure to have a back-up to be sure.
I would have to say that 16GB is rather small for a modern Windows based operating system.
It will be very hard as you need to move the start of the second partition which isn't supported so you will have to remove the partition and create it again.
The user folder and the permissions outside of it have been invented so people don't place items outside of it and mess around with the system itself.
There are several tools that claim to be able to resize partitions without losing data.
Which suggests that that is what is required before you start installing your own programs.
You can move the common files to the D: drive with NTFS Junction points,
With some names you should be able to get more information.
A suggested size would be one partition of 600 GB as partitioning would only be useful if you want to move files you barely use away to the slower end of the disk, like big ISO files...
From the Microsoft Windows 7 Requirements page, the minimum recommended specifications are the following:
you could also decrease the page file a bit as that won't hurt either and give up hibernation if the difference between a normal boot is not that high.
You shouldn't be thinking of separating in the terms of your system folders, but in terms of everything contained in your user folder.
Windows 7 has a pretty cool partition resizing ability, but I'm not sure how easy it it going to be to enlarge your system partition...
I would give windows 50-100GB to give myself space to install whatever programs I might consider useful, and also keeping in mind that temporary internet files and other rubbish will get stored on that partition..
I haven't used any myself, so you'll need to do some more research on the ones listed.
If your using one disk you shouldn't be using partitions in the way you are doing now, it decreases the performance if it needs to switch between the two partitions a lot.
The 16 GB should be fine for above suggestions, but then I would rather take 20 GB just to be sure.
WinSxS might decrease by uninstalling software and removing the 'ehome' things if you don't use the Windows Media Center.
Partition Tool is one, this page has a list of others.
You may end up having to use a GParted live cd or one of ChrisF's suggestions.
50 GB as suggested by Cheesebaron is too much (if you keep my first alinea in mind) as Windows will never grow to that size.
Partition magic and Acroonis Disk Suite will do you justice also ($$).
Get a live linux such as ubuntu and resize the partition with the included Gparted(free}.
Just ignore everything that's outside of your user folder as you end up running out of space like now and into performance issues.
