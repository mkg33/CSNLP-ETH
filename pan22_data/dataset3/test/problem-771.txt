The easiest and most technically simple way to do this is through eSATA.
They would never know how many licensed/unlicensed Windows would be running and this would impact directly on them $$$$$ profits...
If it would be possible, Microsoft would have a big problem with software licensing.
Actually there is a important problem that would be created for Microsoft if Windows 7 boots up from an external device(DVD, Hard Disk or Flash USB).
The reason is that the connectivity is identical to installing the HDD internally.
If any of the core components changes, like motherboard, or processor, you need to re-activate.
This has become less of an issue with newer versions of Windows, but it is still there.
If you are doing it frequently you will probably have to eventually start calling Microsoft and they may prevent you from re-activating eventually due to a history you could potentially build up.
If you're doing this just once then re-activating should be easy.
If you have the time you may want to attempt installing it with the drive installed internally, then move the drive to an external enclosure - I'm not sure if the check is only in the installer or if it is also baked into the bootloader.
it is impossible for Windows to detect that it is using an eSATA connection as opposed to an internal SATA connection.
Ever since Windows XP was released they do hardware checksums, as in they compare all the hardware and generate an internal serial.
I tried it a while ago, and yes, Microsoft explicitly disallows this.
The problem is if you move it to another computer it will probably require re-activation.
Since we can create a DVD-R or USB Flash drive that boots up Windows 7 but never have I heard about booting up from external hard drive, is it true that we cannot install Windows 7 on external hard drive or boot up Windows 7 from it?
