I now upgraded my computer to Windows 7 and would have to buy another license from X1.
Not sure if anything will output into another pst file though.
I am looking for software that will let me do this quickly.
I have Microsoft Outlook 2007 installed, but that will not work because it will only search through 1 PST file per search.
If I recall correctly, a "Search All Mail Items" button can be added to the toolbar at the top.
Again, sorry for the ambiguity, but I hope this helps!
We use Doc Discovery http://www.docdiscovery.net for running keyword searches on multiple PST files and the results are reviewable in its Outlook-style viewer.
I hate to be so vague, but I don't have my work computer in front of me at the moment.
Preferably Windows-based, but if Linux-based software did the trick, I could persuade my boss to let me take my laptop.
We've tried X1, but thus far we've not been able to get it to return the read receipts that match the search term.
I think this button will allow you to search all active PSTs (in other words, PSTs which are currently opened in Outlook, not merely archived PSTs).
I have many PST files that I am trying to find all instances of a search term in for a court subpoena and then pull those out, preferably into another PST.
Does anyone know of any software that would help us?
I used X1 for a while - it used to work very well.
It doesn't need Outlook installed and as it is designed for lawyers the interface is very user-friendly ;-).
I decided to use Google Desktop - if you open your .pst files on Outlook (Go to File/Open/Outlook data file) and let your computer idle for a while, Google Desktop will index your emails on your .pst files.
At least on Vista, X1 sometimes would consume a lot of CPU resources.
I still prefer X1's interface, but Google Desktop is very gentle on the CPU.
EMC offers a product called Email Xaminer - it's made for scanning multiple PSTs and works very well.
