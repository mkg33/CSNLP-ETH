None of the devices that I know of will stop you from entering whatever you want in an ACL, even if it's wrong.
Traditional ACLs are stateless so they do not remember any connection states.
Whichever it's EXPECTING is what decided which you use.
With ZBF the zones are stateful so return traffic initiated from Data to QA are allowed, while blocking traffic initiated from QA  to Data.
You could literally type a mask of 222.222.222.0 and it would accept it.
Here is Cisco's design guide on Zone based firewalling:
As a side note, on your Guest and QA ACLs, you're using wildcard masks for your first 2 ACEs but a subnet mask for your third (172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0).
172.16.0.0 (as is defined in RFC 1918) is a /12 network, so your mask should either be 255.240.0.0 (subnet mask) or 0.15.255.255 (wildcard mask).

If you are using a newer Cisco router I would check out zone-based firewalling to solve your Data to QA problem.
