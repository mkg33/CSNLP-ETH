And if you think it is over another number comes along.
1760 may not be a magic number for anglo saxons (Yards per mile)
So if you want to discuss, go for the relative approach.
1 may not be magic in the context of multiplication (neutral element)
10000000 may not be magic for south inhabitant of south asia (crore)
Discussion over... for all numbers... Of course this is only a (one) definition.
Any number that remains unnamed remains a magic number.
Even if you practically ignore it the statement stays the same.
But this definition has inherent properties that will make it possible to evaluate it exactly.
And the result to consider a number to be non-magic, will depend on when and where you start the discussion.
It's not related common usage as common usage is relative.
The problem with it is "when" or "where" to draw a line... when does a number changes its state to non-magic...
The relative approach will lead to a discussion that will evolve a local aggreement.
I go the second way with following definition: Every unnamed number is magic.
Unfortunally this discussion has to be lead for each number separately.
2,71828... may not be magic for mathematicians (Euler)
The absolute approach is simple an clear: Every number that is not named is a magic number.
Or you go and find a definition that can be used in boolean expressions that will evaluate to true or false.
