So reversing that what you can do is, if you somehow make sure that src port 53 is taken it will select another port.
When the routers NAT they will first check if the "correct" source address is available if so they will map that to that nat translation.
Or create a static dummy static nat which creates a static entry in the translation table forcing your service to use another port.
Probably wont work in your case cause the router is doing the requests?
If it is not available it will select a number as src port from a pool 1-512 (or 1024) for the service under port 512 (or 1024).
Going by this, and this is mainly an idea i had for a case i had with similar issue (NTP src port coming as port 1, because ntp port was taken and request denied from the ntp server as it was a non ntp port number and their firewall stopped it.)
Again it's an idea havenÂ´t really tested it but it might work.
So have another service take over the translation forcing your real one to be mapped differently.
Didn't at the time really find any good way to control which services got which source port without "hacking" a bit :).
Which ever is the first available and place that in the translation.
