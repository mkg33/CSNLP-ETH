Running sudo chmod 666 /usr/local/share/doc/pkg-config does not change the file permissions from -rw-r--r--.
Why am I not able to add write permissions to this file?
I also got this: Warning: Some directories in /usr/local/share/locale aren't writable.
Similarly I came across a similar question on this site where the issue was fixed by doing sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local; but this didn't work either in my case.
After installing Homebrew I ran brew install pkg-config, got a "brew link error", and ran brew link --overwrite pkg-config.
My ultimate goal is to compile the source code for a program (not available through Homebrew) which depends on pkg-config.
Once I got gettext and libffi installed, I tried to do ./configure glib and got an error related to gettext.
Then I tried to install pkg-config and ran into the problem described above.
After installation I got messages advising I remove some files, and did so.
I originally thought it would be no big deal to compile pkg-config on my own, but when I tried doing so I found myself in a maze of dependencies: pkg-config requires (and is required by) glib, which requires gettext and libffi.
When I tried to compile gettext I was able to run make and make install but got several errors and "...not found" messages in the process.
This gave me a different error: Error: Could not symlink share/doc/pkg-config/pkg-config-guide.html /usr/local/share/doc/pkg-config is not writable.
