The article is pretty old, but perhaps this answer can help also others: Windows 2008 server R2 64 bit, RAID Level 5 with 3 x 3 TB Seagate ST3000DM001 (AMD 5050e, Gigabyte Motherboard GA-MA78GM-US2H, onboard graphic card & gigabit-ethernet).
I might also have something to do with you are using a software raid and not a proper hardware raid controller.
Changing the drivers speeded up my system four times - unbelievable.
That said, I would consider ~4 days a bit slow, but doubt that 2003R2 would be any faster on the same hardware.
Concurrently reading 4 drives should yield 480MB/sec, then parity needs to be calculated (concurrent with read because the write is going to the 5th drive) and the parity is written (again, concurrent with read).
It has to read 6 TB worth of data from the other disks, do checksumming etc.
No other system that I have used exclusively syncs a new volume without the option for "quick build" with no sync.
That's the problem with using large disks with a RAID: Reconstructing takes ages.
But then again nobody ever claimed that built-in windows raid solutions were fast or optimized.
Please keep in mind that your calculations are assuming that the system can only read from one drive at a time.
I believe that the system is doing this as a very low-priority process in order to not overwhelm the rest of the system, but 1/20th seems to be unnecessarily conservative.
Modern processors should be able to easily XOR 480MB/sec of data (heck I can MD5 100MB/sec of data) - meaning that a 5x2TB RAID5 should take no longer than 4.3 Hours if operating at full speed.
Did you install the right motherboard sata-driver or did you use an pci(e)-card connecting your harddisks ?
Considering that single-drive reads operate at 120MB/sec that is 1/20th of the maximum read speed.
In case of a software RAID, it has to do this while normal operation continues.
The original windows drivers are pretty slow and produced a blue screen.
In reality my rebuild is looking to take about 96 hours - or operating a 5.5MB/sec total speed per drive.
Resynching-time before driver change: 40 hours, afterwards only 10 hours.
Reading and writing on the RAID while reconstructing is happening is not a problem except that both normal IO and reconstructing will be a lot slower than usual.
This is also completely ignoring the fact that a brand new raid does not need to synch.
Actual read performance per drive should be on the order of 120MB/sec.
It should be trivial to throttle the speed of the rebuild based on the overall usage of the system instead of at a low rate fixed speed.
I did not get windows 2008 r2-drivers, I used vista-64-bit drivers from my motherboard manufacturer.
