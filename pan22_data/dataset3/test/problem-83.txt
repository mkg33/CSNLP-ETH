The names on the list in IIS don't matter much, but I would make them unique so they are easy to differentiate.
Then, there would be a second entry in IIS which would hold the bindings for the SSL version.
Usually in these cases I will create an HTTP version with the bindings on port 80 and the appropriate IP/hostname combinations, then set the host to use HTTP redirection to the secure URL with a 301 status code.
Following ruslany's suggestion on the URL Rewrite Tips page here, I'm trying to use URL Rewrite to redirect http:// requests for my site to https://.
Also remember to give each site its own "home" folder where the web.config file will be stored.
So my assumption is that, using ISS (not SharePoint), I will create a new site (http only) with the same name and host header as my existing site, and add the URL Rewrite rule to the http site.
If they share a home folder the settings will not come out right (in IIS 7 anyway, IIS 6 does not have this issue).
(I need to use a second site because I don't want to uncheck the "Require SSL encryption" checkbox on my existing site.)
I'm an IIS newbie so my question is: how do I do this?
Should I create a site with the same name and host header, only it will be bound to http?
I don't want to screw anything up with my existing site (which is a SharePoint site, currently used by external users).
That site currently has http and https bound to it.
And then I guess I should remove the http binding from my existing site?
I've written and tested the rule using a test site I set up, and so now the final piece is to create a second site (http) to redirect to my https site.
