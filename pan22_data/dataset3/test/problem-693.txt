To test if your LCD panel is bad, simply put like a YouTube video on, turn the monitor on, and shine a bright light onto the panel, if you can see the video then your LCD panel is fine, then the problem is likely just with your invertor board and probably just a bad cap or two, or one of the transformers on the invertor.
This issue could theoretically be caused by an incompatible refresh rate coming out of the netbook, and the monitor doesnt know how to handle it, and is spazzing out.
If not, it's unlikely to be worth the cost of a repair.
Don't know why nobodies recommended that, but aside from things like the actual LCD, or tcon board being bad you can usually fix a monitor for no more than a few dollars if it's just one or two bad components.
If there is no image while shining the light then that will point to one of three things being broken; the panel it's self, the icon board, or the actual computer board.
You need to take it apart, check all the caps on the power and inverter boards for bulging/leaking & replace them, also check the transformers on the inverter board to pinpoint that noise and replace that part.
