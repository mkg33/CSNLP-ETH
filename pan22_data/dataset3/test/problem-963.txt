Eventually their cache expires and their attempts to connect to www point at the new server.
I use CloudFlare's free plan on all of my sites, and since all requests actually go through them, changing my sites' IP address really just changes an entry in their proxy.
End users see the same IP addresses in DNS so the change is basically instant.
You could have all of your requests come in through a proxy.
The result is that clients who get the updated DNS entry work as expected while those who get a cached entry get a temporary redirect to www2 (which is new and always pointed to the new server).
The key is that it cannot be a redirect to www (otherwise you're back at square one).
After enough time has passed you could then 301 redirect www2 to www, but I think in most cases you'd be fine just deleting it.
I have handled this in the past by creating a www2.whatever.com sub domain, which the new server will listen on in addition to www.
After changing DNS to point www at the new server you change the old server to 302 redirect www to www2.
