Crucial have an automated tool which runs on your Mac and will identify the right RAM for it.
It's no loss to them if some of their users decide to do the manual upgrade; if they were real asses about it, they'd put some clause in the warranty to discourage such behavior.

I did this with my MB301 Model and upgraded the RAM and HDD for the same price as buying just the RAM.
We do this at work regularly since we have around 75 Mac's and 40 MacBook's, old and new running around.
Buy from them direct and it's WAY cheaper... you also get to keep whatever Apple shipped you to begin with and use it in another machine, sell it on eBay or whatever you like...
Apple probably gets plenty of people who will upgrade just on the common suggestion that more is better.
I know Apple have a reputation for expensive ram but do Apple really think that people won't just upgrade themselves the day they buy the laptop to save money?
It's not really the case that Apple ram is expensive here, it's come down in price a lot recently.
The manual actually has the instructions on how to do this.
$1000 US for an additional 4GB of memory to bring the total to 8GB ... What the ?
I was pricing up a new Macbook unibody 17" and whilst following my general rule of giving a laptop as much ram as it can physically take, I fell off my chair when I saw the price.
You can use the Kingston website to get the exact model of RAM for the MacBook and by the memory from any reputable supplier and install it yourself.
Most people are deathly afraid to open their case and look at the pieces, much less replace them.
