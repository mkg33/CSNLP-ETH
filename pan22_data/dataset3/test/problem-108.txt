Hotspare has itÂ´s own dangers, as it leads to an automatic rebuild.
Are there any downsides (drive life/wear, etc) to keeping the extra hard drive set up as a hot spare or is it better to leave it packaged on a shelf somewhere if I don't require the immediate recovery time of a hotspare?
In other words, should I leave a spare disk on the shelf or set it up as a hot spare?
Unless you're at capacity in your enclosure, use it as a hot spare.
It's not a webserver or anything that needs to serve stuff up 24/7.
With the size of arrays in the TBs, and the amount of stale data, there is a numerical chance the array finds another defect during automatic rebuild.
Just one of the advantages: It will make your job easier when it is required.
If the server has a little bit of downtime, it isn't the end of the world.
To reduce the chance of breakdown because of a drive failure in the time before the rebuild, you need an array that can handle 2 drive failures: Raid 6 or Raid 10.
This is aggravated by the long duration of rebuilds.
In case of a drive failure, you want to verify the backup, and the failover mechanisms before you initiate the rebuild.
Therefore, it is better not to have automatic rebuild.
If you have the choice why would you not go for a hot spare?
You can't test a cold spare for functionality; for all you know, that drive on the shelf doesn't work.
It also means that you get back to full redundancy in the array without you having to go in; useful for holiday weekends etc.
Thats a long time to wait before you can do the Right Thing (TM).
