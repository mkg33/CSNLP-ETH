I don't know why, since I inherited the laptop from another person.
Q1: Why did Windows swap the boot drives around like that?
PS2: I'm almost certain the "11.35 GB, Healthy (Recovery Partition)" will be Win10 Home (what it originally was)
The "limited version of Windows" doesn't sound like a boot problem, since Windows has booted.
Run Diskpart, and swap the bootable partitions over?
The SSD has Win10 pro, which was upgraded from Win10 Home.
Q2: Why will neither drive boot using Legacy BIOS?
Q5: I cannot make a recovery partition from this PC.
Q4: Am I right in thinking that I need to make a recovery partition on a DVD, CD, or USB, and boot from that.
I notice the Drive C: and D: have been swapped; but Disk 0 and 1 remain as they were.
In UEFI BIOS mode it boots from the HDD but gives a limited version of Windows, with no start menu.
The HDD is still Disk 1, but now labelled C:  The SSD is Disk 0 and labelled D:
Basic windows utilities can be run from the command prompt.
I have Windows Explorer, Device Manager, and Computer Manager all running.
Over the weekend the PC stopped booting from the SSD.
I suspect your Windows installation is broken somehow.
I ran a disk check on the SSD but found no errors.
Can I make a recovery partition from another (Win10 Home) PC instead?
