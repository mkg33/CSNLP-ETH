(Disclaimer: I'm well aware that these are idealistic recommendations that are frequently ignored by most large companies.
Given the security policies that should be in place for your AD infra, it's unlikely that this central authority will be your AD servers without adequate planning and replication.
Just limit it to what is actually necessary (very little is, like joe said in the comments) and use forwarders for the rest to ensure that automatic creation of reverse records doesn't get out of hand.
Those companies also have to deal with different PTR records being returned depending on which DNS servers are being used, with very few of those PTR records ever being properly cleaned up after IPs are reclaimed.
Reverse DNS for private IP space that is company unique should live on DNS servers that are likewise reachable by all internally facing production DNS servers, to maximize unique ownership.
In short, it's a madhouse and it always will be unless you plan to make it otherwise.)
This isn't to say your AD servers should have no reverse authority.
