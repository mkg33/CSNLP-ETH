In your agreement there is no such point that something is guaranteed.
Unless your ISP is very good (but in that case you wouldn't be having these problems).
This will test the connection between you and your ISP in the first instance.
I think your case is lost, although it may depend on who is your ISP.
Anything outside of their network is largely outside of their control
As I understand it, in the general case, if a router is busy, then your pings will be treated as low priority traffic.
You could have a look at the tools from Measurement Lab.
No matter how much technical information you gather, you'll likely find it impossible to get in touch with the appropriate audience for your report.
Your ISP may only guarantee the connectivity to them.
If you have a choice of ISPs in your area, change supplier.
So, you could be getting slightly misleading results from this anyway
The least thing you can do is to phone them and tell them exactly what you said in here.
If it's working (lousy but it is) they probably won't give a broken nickel.
If you don't, direct your complaint to the appropriate regulatory authorities.
You could also potentially run a few Speed Tests to see if the results are as you'd expect
If so, I'd upload\download files from systems they manage.
And ask them politely to run similar tests on their side.
Recruit other peeved customers of the ISP to your cause.
