I cannot for the life of me figure out what the problem is.
I've gone into the outlook settings, and set it there, I've changed the default applications setting to outlook, I've reinstalled office, repaired office, changed the defaults to something else and back, etc etc.
Whenever the user tries to open an email file, specifically when it has been put on a shared drive, it gives this error:
Took me forever to find any reference to this solution, and it worked immediately when I turned it off.
I found a thread about “Microsoft Outlook 2013 not recognized as the default mail client when opening emails on shared drives” and you can refer to it:

The issue here was that the user had "Preview Pane" on in Windows Explorer.
The issue is, it is set as the default mail client, everywhere.
Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client".
"Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request.
Explorer tries to open the msg file in preview pane but can't.
