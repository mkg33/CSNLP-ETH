If it is not enabled, the UAC icon remains in the corner of the iTunes logo, and nothing happens upon double click.
Hopefully people can see this and save some time, unlike me.
Interestingly, closing that process doesn't disable Bluetooth on the machine, and it also does not get rid of the system tray icon.
Disabling UAC or providing admin credentials is obviously not an option.
Closing the process and trying to open iTunes allowed it to open, also disabled in startup and tested with a reboot and multiple user accounts.
I tried with my regular domain account, same thing happens.
I have reinstalled older versions, newest version, followed all uninstall guides for correct order, checked permissions on the application and on the Music folder, made sure the computer was verified, checked event log.
When he tries, one of two things happen: If "Run as Administrator" is enabled in compatibility settings, then it will prompt for credentials, which he does not have.
I tried a specific program UAC disabling method using Compatibility Administrator, but that only works if the program actually tries to start.
Checking task manager, whenever iTunes is double clicked, iTunes.exe takes a spot in task manager, but nothing happens still unless ran with administrator credentials.
Somebody else said that this occurred for them after the Windows 10 Creators Update.
