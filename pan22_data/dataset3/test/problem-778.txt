Next, go to Foobar preferences and change the output device to DS: USB DAC.
This should allow you to use the knob on your laptop to adjust the volume of everything BUT the device to which Foobar is outputting audio.
First, in the Windows control panel, change the default output device to the laptop's internal sound card (or to a device other than the USB DAC).
My laptop has a volume knob by the side and it's associated to the playback device currently used.
Here's how you can use the knob to control master volume without affecting the volume/gain setting of the USB DAC:
I am assuming that the hardware knob on your laptop is a digital control (rotary encoder) and not an analog control (potentiometer).
Please note that the knob on your laptop will not change the position of the volume slider in Foobar.
Since I use a DAC that requires such level to be at 100%, I cannot use the knob to control the volume and have to rely on foobar volume control.
How can I associate the knob to foobar volume instead?
If that is the case, it will likely act a master volume control for the default playback device and any applications using the default audio device.
