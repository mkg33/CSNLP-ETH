As an example, to remove the folder C:\testdelete on the next system restart, run in an elevated prompt:
One option to attempt a removal or rename of a file or directory is to use the Pending File Rename Operating (PFRO) functionality of Windows.
If there are issues removing the directory or any of the operations carried out, they will be logged to C:\windows\pfro.log
If the proceeding line has a path then it will be renamed.
Note: The entries in the value are processed in pairs such that a blank line following an item will instruct the SMSS.exe process to delete the previous item.
The above command will create or append to, the REG_MULTI_SZ PendingFileRenameOperations registry value under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager as shown below:
One option is movefile.exe from Sysinternals/Microsoft.
To do so, you can manually create or update the REG_MULTI_SZ PendingFileRenameOperations registry value under the registry key HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager to be read by the Windows Session Manager (SMSS.exe) at start-up.
The easiest way is to use a tool to create or append to the value if it already exists.
