One thing to think about, although I am not sure if it affects it or not, is does the account you log into your terminal server session, have access to the local disks on the client machine?
When I connect from my work machines which runs XP to my home machine that runs Vista 64, my local folder opens and immediately closes.
I've seen some odd behavior occur when there are file system errors, even if they don't otherwise make themselves obvious.
I don't know if you have a similar quirk, but I thought I throw it out there.
To use it in a CMD session or script, launch it inside FAR manager or something similar.
The only really reliable way to copy files over RDP that I have relied on, almost every time is using the \tsclient\c (or whatever drive you want) method.
Just to check, you do mean in Terminal Services Configuration, in the RDP-Tcp connection properties, on the "Client Settings" tab the "Drive mapping" tick box is unticked?
It's a long shot but... Run a disk check on your laptop.
It does not work in a CMD window, but it works in an explorer window.
It should only take a few minutes to run and certainly won't do any harm.
and a window with the local machines files will open.
You say "local resouces linking are allowed for TS sessions".
I am sure a year or two ago that was an issue for us.
Also this can bork when the machines are on different networks?
