Watching video can take quite a bit of processing power, so this could be the cause.
If you are running this system with a 300W power supply, it is time for an upgrade.
Like literally taking a vacuum and compressed air can and cleaning out the dust.
This may sound silly, but try cleaning your computer.
If there are still problems after replacing the power supply and anything that fails hardware diagnostics, then update your drivers and codecs.
Beyond that, you either missed something in the diagnostics or it's time to retire the system.
With that out of the way, also run some full hardware diagnostics.
It may cause overheating or clogging some fans which may draw extra power from the power supply and overheat your processor.
trun off your system unplug ram and start the system it will give beep then turn it off plug the ram again and then start the system
If, after all of that, you still have issues, time for a clean install.
this seems to be a system heating problem check your system's fan speed also tried the following
Check for the CPU (more likely) or graphics card overheating.
