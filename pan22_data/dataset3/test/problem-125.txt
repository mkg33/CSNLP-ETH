Often if not always, it is written on the battery if you can or cannot recharge it.
Of course you can always simply replace the battery with a new one.
You can now lift off the back cover, and the tip of a single battery will be revealed.
You battery charger needs to be compatible with the type of battery.
Some chargers have a switch on them, so you can select the type of battery you wish to charge.
In this youtube video it is shown how you can reach the battery.
You should be able to pull the battery out, and place a charged battery back.
When you press it in deeply (don't go crazy with it), the back cover will pop up.
Do not try to recharge a battery that is not chargeable, in the worst (not too likely) case the battery can light on fire or explode.
Please be advised not all batteries can be recharged.
If a battery is chargeable, also be advised that not all batteries can be charged in the same manner.
The video shows that on the bottom back side of the Logitech M215 there is a 'release' button.
