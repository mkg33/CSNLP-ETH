We (as in, my company) are developing an application that will utilize the Ricoh Theta S camera and its API.
I have installed Kali Linux as it comes with various useful tools, primarily Wireshark, out of the box.
I have the wpk2 password used to connect to the hotspot.
I can't directly intercept this, again, as the camera needs a 1:1 connection (i.e., can be connected to only one host at a time).
The camera is connected via its hotspot to a phone, and it supports only that one connection.
It communicates via HTTP on the IP address 192.168.1.1, port 80.
As in, this is literally my first time encountering something like this.
I already tried using airmon-ng start wlan0 and then capturing on wlan0mon in monitor mode.
Is it possible to monitor this traffic as a 3rd party and save the JSON payloads attached to it?
However, the settings we try to apply seem to be buggy and they're not exactly working as expected, so we'd like to use one laptop to sniff the communication between the camera and the phone application, and dump the JSON payloads associated with the packets.
I tried following this article, as well, but I'm still getting misc.
While I was able to find and filter traffic on the SSID of the camera's hotspot, I couldn't locate any JSON in that communication.
