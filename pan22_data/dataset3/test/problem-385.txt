64 bit XP will give you more usable memory to play with, and Win7 is just more stable in general.
Also not sure if this is related to one of the apps installed but his Start bar flickers (does not completely disappear) intermittently from time to time.
You mentioned that the Spreadsheet was a large one...
I have heard that this is recommended and may be the reason why a minidmp file was not generated when he encountered a blue screen.
FYI - It stopped crashing ever since i moved a large spreadsheet he has open to his local HDD instead of over the network.
The taskbar icons which are hidden appear and then get hidden again as if it was having "fits".
Seeing as you're having graphical effects (the start bar and icons flickering and so forth) you may wish to try swapping out the primary video card if possible to see if that is faulty.
This spreadsheet "refreshes" constantly as it is pulling live data to update cells and I suspect it was auto-saving so frequently that it caused crashes if saving over the network.
I removed Adobe and installed FoxIt as I figured it was a resource issue but I do not think so as he does have sufficient resources when the problem is happening.
Some things to try might be : Running Repair on office, uninstalling and reinstalling Office entirely, updating drivers for the network card, replacing network cable, move his PC to a different network switch or port on the switch.
Sometimes he can't bring task manager up until he kills certain apps.
Some background - the PC has a Xeon processor and 4Gb of RAM and running XP SP3
As for the crashing with the large spreadsheet open on the network but not crashing while stored locally, this suggests may be something to do with the network connect.
He has 2xHDD and pagefile is hosted on the secondary HDD (D:) and min/max values are set to 4096.
Running the Office repair as you suggest will leave customizations
I have recommended creating a new profile for him but due to the amount of customisations he has and the amount of time and effort it will take to get him up and running again, he prefers to bear with the problem than to go down that path.
This user has 6 monitors so he has an NVIDIA Quadro NVS440 hosting 4xmonitors and an NVIDIA Quadro NVS290 hosting 2xmonitors.
This may not make a whole lot of sense so pls bear with me...
Does it by chance have a lot of VB Code or Macro programming in it?
The drivers seem to work but he only has 2.5Gb out of 4Gb available RAM as I believe the video card chomped up a portion of this.
BTW, what version of Office are we talking about here?
Definitely sounds like a resource issue but I am not confident that is the root cause.
In my experience Excel is notoriously unstable once VBA applications get beyond a certain size, althought that would only cause the Excel crashes, and not the other effects you're seeing.
There is a video card driver from NVIDIA which is compatible with both NVS440 and NVS290 and he is on the latest version of that driver.
He is a heavy Bloomberg, Outlook, Word, and Excel user and runs two Citrix applications.
Can you monitor RAM and CPU use to see if there any anomalies?
Outlook and Excel frequently crashes - I am going to perform an Outlook and Excel repair and also check/remove unnecessary addins - will he lose any customizations if I repaired and chose "Restore my shortcuts while repairing" and do not select "Discard my customized settings and restore default settings".
Do you think different models would cause problems?
(Note: Make of video cards are different - one is from leadtek and the other from Nvidia)
I am about to perform a routine check on one of my user's PC.
I am planning to perform sfc /scannow and office repair but would like to know if anyone has any other suggestions.
At times, his right click completely fails to respond.
I guess we are at a stage where we just want to "stabilize" things so he won't encounter issues that frequently.
His left click works fine but he can't right click on anything in any Window and even on the desktop.
Sometimes, he needs to start to close certain applications such as Adobe and the right click will start functioning again.
I have performed reg scans, malware scans etc but problems do not go away.
However, at least once a week, his PC acts up and I can't think of any other tools or techniques to rectify his problems.
Also try updating the video card drivers just in case that's it.
As a last suggestion, being the most destructive one, assuming the Xeon processor is 64 bit capable, you may wish to upgrade to 64 bit XP, or even better Windows 7 64bit.
