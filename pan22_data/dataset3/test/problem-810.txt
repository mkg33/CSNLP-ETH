If you were after some more information on .local and why it may or may not be an issue for you to use it.
(Or, if you want to protect yourself, by always using FQDNs for the important stuff -- although the final dot in DNS names is sadly neglected.)
There don't actually seem to be any reserved zones for internal use
As a real-life example, an app I'm working on might be addressed in full as some-app.beta.internal.mycompany.com, but as internal.mycompany.com is in the DNS search path for workstations as returned by the DHCP server, I can access it as some-app.beta.
We use .local all the time with both macs and pcs.
We have one for our internal network, mainly used for development sites, but it works well.
A nice compromise solution is to use an internal subdomain in conjunction with a DNS search path.
IMO, either of the latter options are better ideas.
There's still a possibility of collision if these names are chosen poorly, but in that event a collision can be resolved using an FQDN.
I wouldn't use .local unless you understand how zeroconf works, as it will become a bigger deal when you start to see IPv6 move into the mainstream.
