Linux includes the file program for just this purpose; at the command line, run
If you're asking how to tell whether the file is binary or text without opening it in a text editor, that's certainly possible, at least for most files.
Although even in that case, I think file might be able to identify it correctly... the point is, sometimes it's hard/impossible to tell at all, so you can never be 100% sure that you've identified the contents type correctly.
There's no way to verify what kind of contents a file has without some program opening it and actually reading the contents.
I guess the bigger question would be, why are you trying to distinguish binary files from text files?
If a file is UTF-8 encoded text that includes a lot of high-numbered Unicode characters, for example, it'd probably look like a binary file and you'd get gibberish if you open it in a text editor that isn't Unicode-aware.
Of course, there will always be some corner cases where even file can't tell.
The file program will print out an informed guess at the type of the file, based on its contents, and it's usually pretty good at guessing.
(where of course you replace name_of_file with the actual name of the file you're testing).
