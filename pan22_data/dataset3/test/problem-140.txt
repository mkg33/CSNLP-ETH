Still I recommend you try and look for an alternative to ChrisF's solution: a bulk disk duplicator.
If you want to do it yourself, you caould always build yourself a robot.
So if your computer can't keep up with the data streams, you'll end up with burning 5 disks at much lower speeds with a overall slower burning time...
I will admit they are a little expensive ($1300 USD), but a automated duplicators like this one is the way to go.
The inkjet printer is not the highest quality, but it does OK.
Do note that if you write at high speeds, you're hard drive has to be able to keep it supplied with data.
I would have thought that the main pain in doing the duplication would be the inserting / removing the disks from the drive; even the free software on my Windows machine has a wee box asking how many copies of a disk I want to burn and although it will only write to a single drive, I can open more than one copy of the program.
drop in a stack of blank CD or DVDs, select the data set or image, enter the quantity and go.
If you are going to stick a bunch of cd writers into your own PC then you are probably going to need some extra PATA/SATA ports in which to plug them, add in controller cards are available if you have free PCI slots, and may be a beefier power supply.
If the optical drives (and your motherboard) work with S-ATA you can probably attach quite a few more, but then you need an up-to-date computer to do so.
How many simultaneous drives you can write to reliably will probably only be found out by trial and error.
If the drives are not writing in sync, then each one will have to be fed data at a reasonable rate.
In any case, you will soon get very fed up with juggling the CDs in all those drives.
