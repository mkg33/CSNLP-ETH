Connected and likely available only on your current host (though possibly not).
Neither of which is connected the second of which is possibly similar to the second wireless network or may in fact be a second device/connection.
Two wired networks "Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection" and "Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection 2".
Two networks related to IPv6 functionality "Tunner adapter 6TO4 Adapter" and "Tunnel adapter Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-Interface".
And six networks I believe are also related to IPv6 functionality.
The headings above each section explain what they are (to certain extent).
Services use IP addresses they do not create them.
Two wireless networks "Wireless LAN Adapter Wireless Network Connection" and "Wireless LAN Adapter Wireless Network Connection 2".
Only one of which appears to actually be connected (the one marked "2" may be an artifact of a wireless card change or a Windows quirk or something of the sort).
Your FTP service was available on that 192.168.56.1 IP address for some reason (configuration or auto-detection or something else) but stopping the service will not release that device's IP address configuration.
One virtual network device (created by VirtualBox) "Ethernet adapter VirtualBox Host-Only Network".
One bluetooth network "Ethernet adapter Bluetooth Network Connection".
