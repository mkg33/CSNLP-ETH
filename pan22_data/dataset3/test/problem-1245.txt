A old method was to mount the VHDX via diskpart, but I do not suggest it now.
If you want to recover some of the disk space on the host that is being consumed by the VHDX you can compact the VHDX.
The tool usually fill the HDD partition table where files was before and no longer exist to fill it with zero.
In HyperV: Inside the VM in the tool menu for the HHD click Optimise.
As in the past, pre-2012, we had to run sdelete -z to zero out empty space from inside the VM which was filling to 100% to .VHDX, and after we compacted the VHDX when the VM was close.
After that close the VM, in the Hypervisor itself or another Windows VM right click the VHDX, click Mount and click Optimize.
The optimize we run after hard delete those 'zero'ed' reference from inside the VHDX.
Deleting data inside of the VM doesn't cause the size of the VHDX to decrease.
Additionally, you could shrink the Windows volume inside the VM and then shrink the VHDX.
To compact you could do it with the Hypervisor's menu.
In ESX: Virtual Machine > Virtual Machine Settings->Hardware->Utilities > Compact
Once the VHDX grows it will remain that size, or grow larger as the amount of data inside the VM increases.
To add to joeqwerty's answer, as he's right as the virtual hard disk size will not decrease automaticly when you delete some files from inside the partition.
