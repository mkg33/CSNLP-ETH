This happened to me twice on Windows Server 2012, and it was due to one of the following reasons:
https:// server_fqdn:443/ReportsServer/ --> SQL Reporting Server
  TCP    0.0.0.0:443            0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       4
http://* :2869/ --> Simple Service Discovery Protocol service (SSDPSRV)
https://* :5358/ --> Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WS-Discovery)
https:// server_fqdn:443/Reports/ --> SQL Reporting Server
http:// +:80/ReportServer/ --> SQL Reporting Server
In my case it was DataManager from F5 Networks which uses Tomcat 6 internally to serve its web pages.
First off, I will answer this question directly and anyone reading this can ignore any answers talking about 3rd-party, non-Microsoft applications using the System Process.
I had the same trouble while trying to install a VMware update.
There will be a list of URLs (with the port numbers) which can lead you to which application is running and holding which ports:
You can then find the corresponding service on the system and stop it and see that wanted port is released by confirming with another netstat -aon | find ":443" command.
Get the process number of the port that you are looking for (443 in this case):
http://* :5357/ --> Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WS-Discovery)
Running tasklist to find out what is running in the process proves unhelpful:
Using netstat -ao | find ":443", I found out that port 443 is being used by PID 4, which was the System process.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\HTTP\Parameters\UrlAclInfo
...from a non-mapped drive of Windows to avoid "Access Denied":
Or TCP Monitor: http://www.itsamples.com/tcp-monitor.html
This might not be a solution for everyone, but it may help some.
Output should look like the following for the System process:
  TCP    [::]:443               [::]:0                 LISTENING       4
