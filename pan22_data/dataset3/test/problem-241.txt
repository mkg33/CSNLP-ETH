Both Chrome 52.0.2743.116 m and Firefox 48.0.2 behave the same way.
I'm new to nginx, but I can't imagine why the first uri in a try_files should behave any differently from going directly to that uri in the case where the file exists.
The problem is that when I do that, the page gets displayed immediately as just the text content of the div, without the images specified by the <style> in the <head> section.
Using Chrome developer tools Network tab, I can see requests for the image urls going out, and getting 200 status codes.
So before I shut down the backend server, I create a symbolic link in the nginx server's root directory to a static html file that looks like this:
If I point my browser directly at /site-down.html, the page displays correctly right away.
Using nginx 1.8.1 on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance.
I want to serve a static page from nginx in case I want to take the Apache server instance down.
Using as a reverse proxy to support https for Apache running on a different instance.
But if I click on those requests, there is no preview available, and the body length is too short.
But if I let it sit there for a while, eventually the correct output with the images appears.
