Here is instructions for older versions of adobe products (before CS6).
The only program that I seem to really have an issue with is PS.
Follow the instructions above by user568458 (make sure you can view the file extensions).
To help illustrate how this is done, here is the photoshop files.
Your going to want to replace one of the existing assemblyIdentity lines.
Copy that line into the manifest downloaded from above.
There is an option (Windows only) to scale the UI in PS:
For photoshop CS4 it's Microsoft.VC80.CRT.manifest.
I'm on a Mac, so I can't say for sure what it does, but it might help you.
I did a lot of searching on this subject, when I first got this monitor hooked up and I'm pretty sure that it's a PS bug.
If you try to open the program you will get a dll error.
I have a 4k monitor as well and this has been driving me insane!
You can compare them to the ones above to see how they were modified.
As one commenter stated, I've seen lots of complaints, but no solutions.
Look in the folder where you placed the manifest you will see a different .manifest file.
