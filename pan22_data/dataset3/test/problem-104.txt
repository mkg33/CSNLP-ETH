I have posted this issue on stackoverflow, but unfortunately nobody couldn't find solution, maybe someone here know this.
I'm grateful for previous answers, unfortunately, still problem exist.
If someone have different idea, what may cause this strange effect, I would be really grateful for help - thank you.
But I discovered strange and ugly effect, while moving my player (while camera is chasing player exactly, means while camera is changing its position)
Its more or less, how does it look in the game, where:
Images of my sprites looks just different, they are like blurred or there is effect like those images would be moving (not changing their possition, just jittery effect, really hard to explain and call this effect properly) Hopefully this image may explain it a bit:
I'm developing Side Scroll 2D Game, using AND ENGINE
It's really noticable on the Xoom due to the large screen size."
I don't know if it's the screen or the graphics processor, but it doesn't occur on my wife's Samsung Captivate.
I'm using their SVG extension (I'm using vector graphic)
"the blurring that you notice is actually a hardware problem.
a) "FIRST" image is showing square, while player is moving (CAMERA isn't) image looks as it should
b) "SECOND" the same image, but with this strange effect "which looks like image moving/blurring during camera moving [chasing player])
Friend of mine told me that it might be hardware problem:
But seems there is way to prevent it, since I have tested many similar games, where camera is chasing player, and I could not notice such effect.
Some phones "smooth" the content on the screen to give a nicer feel to applications.
