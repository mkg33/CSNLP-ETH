Extension of Alex Robilotto's Answer for clipboard object not formatted as "text".
 Note: pasting as value is not an option for non-text, web-based clipboard object.
2) While pasting it from MS word paste it using Paste Special option and select 'Values only" option in the dialog box
Be careful, though, b/c if you paste numbers into the cells that you've pre-formatted, they will also be converted to text, and you'll have to use value() or such to get them back (with Excel 2013 you get a preview of where the data will go just be hovering over the Paste button, so I usually do that and then convert the columns where date-like strings will land first).
This keeps you from having to count columns and rows, etc.
This is a bit of a kluge, but if the data can be pasted normally (without using Paste Special) it usually works:
Now, go ahead and paste, but paste using the 'match the destination formatting' option.
Since the numbers won't automatically convert, I used text to columns on the column, selecting "delimited" but unchecking all the delimiters.
This has the same effect as going into each cell and hitting enter to get Excel to recognize it again.
1) Select the cells and go to Format --> cells --> number and select Text for the selection
If you have data you actually want to be numbers, dates, etc, it's much easier to reformat them correctly from this end than it is to do from the other.
This is definately a kluge and it's the only thing I've figured out to do.
Before pasting, select column that will hold the non-date value.
