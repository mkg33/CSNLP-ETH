Is that something bad will be happen if I still in this way?
After you are sure your services are up and running on the newer version, then you could proceed with the upgrade.
Unless there are special circumstances that we don't or can't know about, there is no issue with running two different versions of the same distro, two different distros, or two different operating systems on two different machines.
As this is new LTS, you still may run into troubles and need to take the necessary precautions - check your system, make a test run, etc.
Since mid 2011 until now i'm use this different version of ubuntu.
It caused by for desktop I have installed by own self but for server is by another person.
Generally, it is not a good idea to have servers on non-LTS versions, as those have shorter lifecycle and tend to be more ... unstable, if you will.
As long as it talks to the server when and if needed, all should be good.
However, there is nothing wrong for a desktop to be any version or OS.
Well, it makes sense for the server to be Ubuntu 10.04 as this is LTS (Long-Term Support) version.
I found that my server is ubuntu 10.04 and my desktop is ubuntu 10.10.
It is generally not a good idea to just upgrade the server to 12.04.
