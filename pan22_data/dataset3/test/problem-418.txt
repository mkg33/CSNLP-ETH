If I access from Windows 7, then after entering password to login I can see the list of share folders on Linux box.
I have installed Samba on this linux box and want to share files with my laptops which run Windows Vista home and Windows 7 home.
Try enable guest OK. Also are you accessing via IP or via a name?
I resolved my problem connecting my Windows 7 box to my Ubuntu samba (11.10).
This is only half a solution, I can't be sure what the problem is without further troubleshooting.
Tail /var/log/samba/log.windows7-pc I got the following message:
  I have been struggling with the setup for almost a month but couldn't get it right.
Once it was disabled, I could see the shares and map the drive.
I have a linux box running Linux server ubuntu 10.10.
Just for a test try to disable IPv6: as described here.
I tried a lot of things, but when it came down to what actually solved it (all other items reversed) it was the "Microsoft Network client: Digitally sign communications (always)" setting that was causing my problem.
I Had the "Windows cannot access" error (0x80070035 - the network path was not found" when trying to access the server (or share).
Also, due to the funny permissions that can sometimes apply to /root, you should try another directory ie /home/someusers/sharemedia/.
If I try to access share folder from Windows Vista, I get message
But if I click on a share folder, I get the same error message as above.
