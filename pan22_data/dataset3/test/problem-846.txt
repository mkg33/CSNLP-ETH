Switching zones would be quite a task since there would be new IP's and other schemas to re-do, so we are looking for alternatives.
So there are legacy CentOS 6.x VPS templates on a very good host which are "stuck" with a 100mb /boot partition.
We are using CloudLinux on that server, so perhaps the kernels are a bit bigger than normal.
This is a multi-tenant production VPS (KVM) running LAMP.
Kernel-debug* packages seem to be larger than the standard kernel.
With kernel-debug* you means both kernel-debug as well kernel-debuginfo as there is a difference between these two package
Either way we are forced to trim down active kernels to 1, which bothers me, but that is all that can fit into /boot.
Unfortunately since it was spawned ~4 years ago, one of our servers falls into this category.
We don't do much server side CLI on it, it's mostly ecom+webapps.
Are the debug kernels useful on production if there is an older version of a standard kernel [potentially] available for boot?
These packages are only for debugging purpose and they could cause performance degradation..So yes they are safe to remove and only need to install during debugging.
Now coming back to your question Is it safe to remove those?
The problem is that there is a lack of space available to install new versions of the kernel.
Short of changing zones to get a new package/template with more space, there is no way to increase the size of /boot.
It has kernelcare if that could provide some sort of workaround.
