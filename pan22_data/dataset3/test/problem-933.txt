pitfalls, problems or anything that would be handy to know before i start?
Basically our v9 ASA database is no longer supported by Sybase, due to the costs involved upgrading it to a supported version we have opted to move the entire system over to MS SQL 2005 Std Edition.
the ASA DB is presently 7.5GB as well btw, out of interest in a perfect world where the db converts first time totally automatically, can anyone take a guess at some rough timeframes to convert a DB of this size?
any help would really be appreciated on this subject.
can anyone post feedback regardind any experiences they have had doing this or tools they have used to accomplish this sort of transfer?
im hoping for some advice and hopefully information regarding the conversion of an ASA Anywhere v9 Database to MS SQL 2005 Standard Edition.
im not really sure what to expect or what to plan for regading this as its the first real time we have ever opted to migrate a DB to another system, i have already done some reading and am aware of problems that may exist converting stored procedures, views etc
