You may see some query info, may not depending on a few things.
It's sort of like when two cars are at a point where they each need to cross a road to enter a parking lot across the street from them at the exact same spot.
Reading the deadlock graph takes a bit more skill.
Sentry even has their own deadlock graph, I trust the others do also but not sure.
SQL Server just blows one of the cars up for you instead of moving one of the cars a bit or driving around the other.
But if you can recreate the situation you can capture some of the query info from an extended event session or a third party tool that watches queries coming in - tools like Sentry One, Idera DM or Solar Winds DPA should all show you queries as they happen - and most have a free trial period.
The deadlock graph information and the rest of the info in the deadlock report will show you which object each session have locked and what type of lock - and also what lock the other wants.
If you have the Deadlock Graph - you have quite a lot of information.
