The way I do 1+2 is simply put one of the router as AP (simply by disabling DHCP on that router and plug a cable between the LAN ports of the two routers; and then set the same SSID and password)
Pro: users could pick their own SSID to switch between ISP.
So I have 2 piece of Cisco RV180W router hardware.
Ask your favorite search engine for [dhcp multiple gateways].
I have only little knowledge in VLAN so any newbie-friendly, overly-detailed explanation are more than welcome.
This page would trigger a script that makes the respective changes to the DHCP configuration file.
You can assign different gateways via DHCP configuration.
The office is moderately big and one single Wifi router is not sufficient to cover them all.
Con: They have to switch SSID in order to print or use NAS, because the two thing are associated with one of the router only.
Although not strictly required, but I would like to keep the amount of additional hardware/server at minimal - best if it can be done just with that two router or maybe the NAS (since it came with also VPN server and DHCP server that I could enable)
We also have 2 WAN connections so that we don't have a single ISP point of failure.
We also have some shared network resources like a Wifi printer, and a NAS.
Current situation is that each router broadcasts their own SSID, so it's like two entirely separate network.
Is there any pro tips on how I could achieve 3 as well?
this is my first question here so please bear with me if I haven't made it super clear
You could offer an internal web page which the users can use for selecting the gateway.
