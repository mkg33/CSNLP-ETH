to the top of my Makefile fixed this particular problem for me.
I used GnuWin until I realised last release was posted back in 26 Nov in 2006 .
Futher to Norbet P.'s answer, I found that adding:
Once I commented the ifneq and end it started working.
Unfortunately, the available GNU for Windows is hopelessly outdated.
So make sure that there is no (other) MSYS distribution in your PATH.
Might be a different reason, but this problem is apparently caused when the PATH variable contains parentheses (, ), as it does on Win Vista/7.
Thats a bit lame, and caused such problems as seen above.
I noticed in my compile logs that "SHELL=sh" was being passed to make, even though I am on windows platform.
The reason seems to be that Git ships with a version of MSYS and that seems to conflict with MinGW (maybe it doesn't conflict when it's the right version of MSYS and/or MinGW but that's just guessing).
Not sure why the platform was not interpreted correctly.
MinGw is acronym for "Minimalist GNU for Windows" and is up to date and includes make and other tools
I had that issue when I added Git's bin directory to the PATH environment variable.
Setting SHELL=C:/Windows/System32/cmd.exe does solve some problems but running such old code on new operatingsystems feels unsafe
My problem was fixed by forcing make use the correct shell: insert the following line at the beginning of your makefile.
