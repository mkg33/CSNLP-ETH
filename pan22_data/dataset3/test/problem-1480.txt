Is there a way to put the Equation Object inside an Excel cell?
A1 * (A11 + B11), use =A$1 * (A3 + B3) in cell C3.
However, if you literally want something calculated, type for example =A1 * (A3 + B3) in cell C3.
Now that I've written that, I think my interpretation of your question probably was off the mark, but I'll most anyway just in case.
If you want the reference that is now A9 to stay fixed on A1 (i.e.
I always use "Equation Object" in Microsoft Word, and I know that one can also insert such an object in Excel.
If you then sort, say using values in column D, and if for example what was row 3 winds up in row 11, then your equation in C11 will become =A9 * (A11 + B11).
I'm not sure if I'm reading between the lines correctly, as I'm uncertain what you mean by "losing the information" -- if you want an equation object to remain associated with other data upon which you are sorting, then this isn't what you are looking for, and @teylyn has probably answered your question
However, the inserted Equation Object just "floats" on excel, it's not "inside" any cell.
