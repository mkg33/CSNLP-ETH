The smaller the size of the OS the more OS's you can have.
The RAM requirements will vary depending on the particular OS, but the number of systems won't be affected.
There is no limit... using boot loaders and similar technologies, you can simplyfy the process - When I was a younger geek, I used to think it was cool having everything from Windows 3.1 to XP and a few flavors of Linux on the same machine....
You can even find out how to install 145 operating systems if you want.
Using a VM will make this whole process a lot easier.
If you want multiple operating systems, I highly advise you stick with one and explore technologies such as virtualisation which will allow you to run multiple Operating systems from within one without all the headaches.
You can have as many operating systems as your hard drive can handle.
Is any extra RAM is need for each extra operating system?
...As I grew older, I realised it was just a waste of time and a maintenance nightmare.
No extra RAM needed, just enough hard drive space (or hard drives) to hold them all.
How many operating systems are allowed in a single computer.
I would imagine that as long as you have the hard drive space for it, you can partition and install as many operating systems as you like.
