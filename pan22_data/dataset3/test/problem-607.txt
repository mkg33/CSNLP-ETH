Are you testing this by seeing what your throughput is between two machines on the same network?
Fortunately, if you watch techbargains.com or slickdeals.net (or any other deal site of your choice), you can sometimes find a cheap USB wireless N adapter for $20 or less.
Kind of odd that your friend noticed this on his system but you haven't noticed anything unusual, no?
The first thing I always check with a wireless AP, especially the 2.4GHz models, is channel contention.
You want to choose the center of the quietest section of the spectrum, remembering that 802.11b/g/n channels overlap.
Having an unbiased speed-test is important in such cases, such as using speedtest.net.
As soon as an 802.11b device hops onto a wireless G or N network, the data rate will drop to wireless B speeds of 11 Mbps, with an actual throughput of maybe somewhere around 5 Mbps.
Slowness in a wireless network might be caused by interference, maybe by your neighbor's router.
I take it that the direct ethernet connection isn't slow, or you would have noticed it already.
I'm afraid you might have to get a newer network adapter for your laptop.
Grab something like netstumbler and take a look at what other APs are active in your area.
Most consumer routers cannot handle multiple data rates simultaneously, and they drop to the lowest common denominator.
If you other APs with strong signals are on or near your channel, that will really slow things down.
I mean, there are people talking about channel contention, etc...but what if it was just the site your friend was visiting?
Try and change the router's channel to number 11, which is also the strongest, and check for an improvement.
Or, if you don't have any money, just disable your laptop's wireless adapter when you have company, and plug directly into the router with an Ethernet cable.
The transfer speeds should jump back to 802.11n if everyone else connected has wireless N adapters, or 802.11g (54Mbps) if everyone connected has at least wireless G.
