I would use a script on the sending side which accessed the Pi over SSH to run its VLC script.
On the sending side you set your desktop as the capture source for VLC, then set an IP address for that source to be streamed to.
On the receiving side, you just open the network stream matching the configuration set on the sending side.
Adjust your audio and video transcoding options to meet the requirements of your streaming capacity (higher quality/high bandwidth, low quality/lower bandwidth).
There are some options outlined here which should help: http://dtucker.co.uk/hack/ssh-for-python-in-search-of-api-perfection.html .
Ideally you would create a couple of scripts for both the sending and receiving sides which would run VLC and set up the necessary session parameters at each end.
In the case that you're trying to restream a video call I'd consider using VLC on both the machine receiving the call and the receiving Pi.
The instructions at the link show how it can be configured to stream the entire desktop of one machine to another: https://software.grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleid=14625
