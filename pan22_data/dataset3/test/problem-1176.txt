Sniff your home network for youtube http requests.
The extension will just save the video you watching (say, as video/x-flv) as a ready standalone file in your preferred directory.
And most important thing is that it eliminates much efforts to analise traffic that you should be doing otherwise.
It does not require to install any heavy soft such as traffic monitors (WireShark and similar), and proxies.
let say you would like to download video what has address https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqpEJh03fI - you go to http://savefrom.net paste address of video into search bar, press download - and service will bring some direct download links on the right side of page with different video formats and quality (FLV, MP4, 3GP) then select one fits you most and download video file on your PC.
For example use this service - http://savefrom.net
As I understand you would like to download video file from Youtube, this is not very difficult and there are plenty different services over Internet to do this.
If you can handle YouTube "captures" manually, then there is a probably most naive but simple way of doing this by means of FireFox extension MediaStealer.
sudo apt-get install -y youtube-dl && sudo youtube-dl -U && sudo youtube-dl -U
It won't be as immediate or save bandwidth, but you won't have to reassemble raw packets into a video.
Setup one computer with Linux, maybe a Raspberry Pi to use less continuous power.
Download the videos with youtube-dl and save them to a drive that your TV can access.
