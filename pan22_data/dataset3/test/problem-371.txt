In order to have Windows PCs see the FAT32 partition, the whole partition table must be of DOS/Win type (Master Boot Record), so you have an HD with a DOS partition table with a Mac HFS partition inside.
If, as you say, you are not concerned about letting VirtualBox (or a real PC) mount this drive, there is absolutely no reason to use other filesystems.
Using a "GUID" (modern Macs) partition table is good for Mac partitions, but your FAT32 partition will not be seen by any PC, making it quite useless.
This is ok but has some limitations like booting (can't use it to boot the Mac).
Keep a 4GB thumb drive with FAT32 to move files around.
VirtualBox files are plain Mac OS files, and HFS+ is the "normal"/"native" OsX filesystem, works well, is journaled (=less jamming/crashes) and has no strict filesize limits.
The reason you might consider FAT32 (keeping all files under 4GB) is if you want to be able to boot the same VM images also on a Windows computer (and on the Mac too).
Also, using FAT32 and HFS on the same disk is not that ideal solution as it seems.
