A good first pass if you don't have a better idea is "damage done to others".
So a power that only does 10 points of damage is worth 10 "balance points".
For instance, let's say that the average robot does 10 damage per second and has a total of 100 hit points.
You can create similar conversions for abilities such as movement (which increases damage given and reduces damage taken) and stealth (that can reduce damage taken) and make up some initial factors.
So each robot can last an average of 10 seconds under direct fire.
Now, you need to compare armor to damage in usefuless, so see if you can come up with a good metric to convert it.
It's very unlikely that 2 seconds of survivability is ACTUALLY worth 2 seconds worth of average damage, and your testing will show which of your base assumptions are incorrect.
An important thing to remember is that all of these initial conversions WILL be thrown away eventually.
Here's a rough strategy I've used to balance similar systems in the past:
But, this gives you a system for creating initial values and one for evaluating the results that fall outside your expected balance.
You then modify these balance points based on the cost it takes to execute, so for instance an ability that does 10 damage with a 5 second recharge can be worth 1/5 as much as an ability that does 10 damage with a 1 second recharge.
An ability that increases your survivability from 10 to 12 seconds is then worth 2 seconds of damage, or 20 "balance points".
