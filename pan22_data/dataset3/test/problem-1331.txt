You'll need to install the Microsoft Loopback Adapter if so.
If you don't, then it isn't an Oracle database problem, but a networking one.
Do a search for listener.ora and see what that configuration file contains.
When you use 127.0.0.1 or localhost, the PC 'knows' that you are talking about it, and it doesn't have to do any lookups.
I get the same error when logging in from other host in local network.
Do a TELNET 192.168.0.190 1521 and see if you get a connection.
It is quite likely the default listener is running on the loopback (127.0.0.1) interface and not the external interface (192.168.0.190).
In which case, you should describe your network setup in more detail (is this a home setup, a corporate LAN, DHCP/static IP...)
My problem is that I cannot log into database from other host (local network).
However, when I change it to '192.168.0.190' which is my host IP address I get 'The Network Adapter could not establish the connection'.
If it is not a firewall issue then the database listener needs to be configured to run on the proper interface.
When I connect to database using Oracle SQLdeveloper everything is ok as long as I specify 'localhost' in connection configuration.
Tweak it there to listen on the correct interface.
I installed Oracle 11g Enterprise Edition on my Windows 7 Pro.
When you use 192.168.0.190, the PC probably sends that off to a router or proxy or something where it will come back to the PC.
