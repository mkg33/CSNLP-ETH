You can use a scanner like the one at Crucial to get your current specs (link below).

You'll want a clock speed equal or greater than your current.
The maximum amount of memory it supports is 32 GB.
The other processors support a different memory frequency, checking the specifications for your particular configuration, is highly recommended
From this info, you'll see that for a laptop, you likely have two banks, each occupied.
You likely want a pair of modules in the same form factor as your existing, capacity depending on the maximum the motherboard can handle (need more research there, likely 4Gb or 8Gb each).
Physically swapping them will be something for the Dell website, keep all contact surfaces clean and untouched by grubby fingers, and make sure the modules are firmly 'seated' in the bays before replacing the cover.
The Dell Vostro 3670 comes with 8 GB DDR4 but there are other configuration possibilities.
Remember, the bus sets the speed so you need to support at least that speed or exceed it with your selection.
You'll need to swap them both out for replacement.
You have a Core i5-8400, which is a desktop processor, so you want to purchase DDR4 for a desktop.
The other processor configurations are also desktop processors.
Alternatively, the instructions at the link below will show your current specs.
