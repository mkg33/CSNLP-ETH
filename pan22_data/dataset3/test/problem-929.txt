I wrote the following shader which purpose is to force draw a mesh over the rest, regardless z-depth :
Too low value will render transparent objects after your overlayed object.
Try setting it for example to 5000 or so, and see which values work for you.
If you want something overlaying everything the easiest way is to create a second camera with identical settings and position to the first except for:
It works great, however transparent objects still get draw over it.
Setting the queue as Overlay should have solved the problem.
Easiest way to move them together is to make the 2nd camera a child of the 1st.
Your material may have too low Render Queue value.
If you change the camera's FOV or other effects you'll need to add a small script to copy the values over.
This is a method that works with Unity 4 as well (and more likely to work with future versions too).
Sometimes the material overrides the value it gets from the shader.
The left face of the white cube should be white, no tinted in green.
