It seems that configure sendmail to send through Gmail SMTP is easier for you.
cat << EOF | mailx -s "more tests" myemail@myhost.com
If any of your servers are hosted a well known source for spam - which now include many cloud providers and hosters, any alias forwarding to gmail (or any such webmail provider) is likely to fail due to RBL policy.
I'm looking for the simpliest way to be able to send admin emails (backups, notifications) from an ubuntu server to my gmail address.
If you have mail setup, you use mailx to send out email from a script...
echo "just a test" | mailx -s "please ignore this" myemail@myhost.com
Or should I install postfix or something similar ?
Should I just create a gmail account and use imap ?
my-backup-script.sh | mailx -s "results from backups" myemail@myhost.com
(I'm concerned about keeping it lightweight and avoid the need for too much configuration/security tweaks).
What i usually do is setup a "google app for your domain" account, and add the necessary SPF record to the DNS zone so that google MXs will accept mail relayed through my hosts.
