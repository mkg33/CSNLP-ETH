In a bigger company (we have thousands of employees) it has proven to be very unreliable.
If you are a small company ( <50 employees ) it will probably work fine.
The TCO for GApps is easily 80% that of the MS solution.
My users primarily access their email through Outlook on their laptops, so I am not looking at Deskless Worker.
I can tell you 25GB of email, Calendaring, and Online docs.
The requirement for running a ridiculous applet (slow and memory consuming) to run Outlook is a turn off.
There is this blog entry: "Microsoft Online Services: Very Cool (and Cheap!)"
MS is theoretically the best company to host their own software, but what about in practice?
Currently switching to Enterprise Google Apps because we loved Exchange so much.
For a bigger company it is more cost effective (and reliable) to run your own in house Exchange server.
Has anyone used MS Online Services - Exchange Online in production?
In my organization we are less worried about where the email is than that the email is available.
I post this purely as a reader of the blog, not as a user of the services.)
I will say my users needs fit the GApps collection more closely than MS.
