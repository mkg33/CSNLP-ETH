Theoretically, it looks like you've got room on the PCI bus for two Gig-E cards, or a SATA-II card, but not both.
*2xGigE cards are a total of 4gbit of bandwidth (or 500MB/s) if you max both out in both directions at once (not likely unless you are doing VPN/conferencing at those speeds).
It could work fine without any hiccups for many common workloads but if you are pushing maximum bandwidth on 2 gbit NICs and your SATA card you will have a slowdown due to maximum PCI bus speed.
If you put in all three, running them all at full load will bottleneck at the PCI bus.
Conventional PCI buses operate with the following bandwidths:
Your Gig-E cards will probably come closer, but in all cases the real-world speeds will be significantly less than theoretical speeds.
In plain English it really depends on your max usage and load.
I expect such a setup will work fine for many applications.
So it really depends on how much average and maximum bandwidth you pull on your NICs and the SATA card.
I agree with quack quixote but to keep it fast and simple for your case:
Newer SATA drives will pull an average of 170MB/s.
Your total maximum theoretical bandwidth is 533MB/s
According to Wikipedia's PCI article and List of device bandwidths, PCI bus bandwidths can be calculated with the following formula:
Fortunately, you won't come close to hitting theoretical speeds on the SATA interface (unless you're using expensive SSD drives).
