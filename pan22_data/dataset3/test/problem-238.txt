In addition to intelis answer, there are a couple of additional reasons to consider  (under KVM at least)
If you want to use VMs for replicating production environments locally look at docker, its awsome
You only really need visualization if your running multiple applications from one machine and want isolated environments, if you setting up a web app for a family member you'll be fine setting up a standard linux box deploying the site on a non root account and giving access to the family member to that account, without sudo access.
And what about other services, like SSH,FTP.. Can that be installed straight to Ubuntu or do(if I'll use virtualization) create virtual machines for every one of them?
- if you are thinking "Maybe I need a environment where I can afford to make mistakes, and not muck up main main system" you need to look at VMs.
I've heard a lot about virtualization on server, but I have a very basic question:
I am building a web application for a family member and I need to learn Linux Administration, since I will be setting up the server myself.
In this specific usecase, it dosen't make any sense to do virtualisation.
I used to run an ubuntu server VM on windows, before I got a dedicated box, and if you're running a linux system, there's little need to run these seperately.
I've been searching, but I can't figure it out, because most of articles are quite advanced, but I would like to get just a basic idea about that concept.
There's a few situations where you might want to consider virtualisation though
For example, I would probably need to install something like virtualbox and then run lamp on it?
You're best off just running what you need on the server itself the moment you ask "why would I do it?"
SSH/FTP logins will be explicitly linked to them accounts.
I mean, I can already install everything I need directly on Ubuntu 12.04, why is a good idea to create some sort of virtual machine to run another server on it.
