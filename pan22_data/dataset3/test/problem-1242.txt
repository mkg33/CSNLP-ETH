AutoPatcher is another way you could probably install updates without needing to use the Windows Update site directly.
Trying to avoid it is, in my opinion, a HUGE WASTE OF TIME.
Note also, that you will not be able to avoid it at all if you upgrade to Vista or Windows 7.
The odds of a problem are probably up there with the odds of dying in a plane crash - yes it could happen, but statistically, your safer than when you drive to the airport.
To date, helping others in various forums and from my own personal consulting experience, I have not seen one incident that WGA caused a major problem with.
Apple is vengeful big brother with draconian measures to prevent software from working (look at the iPhone) and Microsoft is just plain big brother.
You won't be able to use the WindowsUpdate web site - just the local client, and you'll need to be careful with that as WGA creeps in unexpectedly with other updates (make sure you always do a custom download and install of updates).
Microsoft would not be daft enough to deny anyone security updates (at least until XP is officially fully deprecated) as the extra abundance of hacked Windows machines causing hassle would be extra embarrassment.
If you want to avoid most kinds of big brother stuff, then you need to use linux.
Without WGA installed you will have trouble installing any optional updates from Microsoft though there are presumably "ways and means" if you have the time to search for them and the determination to avoid Windows-Genuine-Spyware.
Caveat: I long since gave up trying to avoid WGA, though I've not stopped resenting the "guilty until proven innocent" attitude it implies.
Fine, don't like it, but wasting the time downloading everything off line and patching manually is a recipe to be hacked or otherwise suffer from malware infestations.
If you can live without optional updates though, you'll be fine.
That doesn't mean it can't or hasn't happened, but to me, it's an irrational fear - if you have properly obtained your copy of Windows, then you have nothing to be concerned about.
