This one symptom is particularly weird, though: the optical drive will not open with the IDE cable attached, but if I unplug it from the mobo it will.
I have tried running it with just one of them, then switched the other in.
Currently I am trying yet another suggestion: turn it on and wait an inordinate amount of time for POST.
I have disconnected every peripheral unnecessary to POST.
I have replaced the CMOS battery with a used one I had lying around, and which worked in the computer it came out of.
Currently seated is a completely different 1 GB stick that I keep around for troubleshooting purposes, and I have tried it in both slots.
These include: mouse/keyboard, PCI modem, the IDE optical drive (power and data), and the SATA HDD (power and data).
The only two things connected are DB15 video and power cable.
I have tested the PSU with a tester to confirm it was good, then tried connecting another PSU just in case--same symptoms.
I can turn the PC on with it attached, won't open; then unplug IDE while it is still on, WILL open; then plug IDE back in with the PC STILL ON, WON'T open.
I have even tried a suggestion I found elsewhere on this site wherein one disconnects power from the PSU and then presses the PC's power button twice, thereby "resetting" the PSU.
The machine reacts to the power button being hit by spinning up the two fans: CPU and PSU.
