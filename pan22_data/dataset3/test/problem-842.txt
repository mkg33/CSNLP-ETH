Then I restart the mysql service, and create slave users in each VMs:
So basically I added the following to [mysqld] section in my.cnf files:
In master master replication, How to have one master write data with odd IDs and the other one with even IDs?
Followed to that I set the Master config in each VM:
my.cnf of the Master-2 is almost identical to Master-2 except server-id which I set to 2.
I believe this could be solve using auto-increment-offset = 2 in one config file, although I'm not sure about the procedure... beside not quite sure what SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER = 1; is and what it does, when Googled my first problem found it here.
I created a database in Master-1 and added a table with some value.
I wanted to setup a MySQL master-master replication on two virtual machine I have on my system, to just play around with replication and get familiar with the concept.
SHOW SLAVE STATUS \G in Master-2 show me the following error:
But When I do the same in Master-2, the changes are not committed to the Master-1.
I edited [mysqld] section of /etc/my.cnf of Master-1 and it looks like:
I would be thankful for a description of the errors and how to overcome them.
I stopped the salve, wrote SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER = 1; in mysql and then start the slave and ask for the status, which I get a new error:
When I commit and check in Master-2 I can see all the data.
