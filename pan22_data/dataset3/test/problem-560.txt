Thermal paste is like glue to make ur processor cold.
If none  of them working,return that laptop to that laptop repairer and ask him to be responsible
When I got the laptop back its speaker was working fine but every game started lagging.
I think this is some hardware related issue , I have tried updating drivers and updating the setup settings (F2 to go in setup when booting) and now I am going to install windows again.
My laptop is Samsung np300e5e (series 3) and has intel graphics and I played a game which worked fine but its speakers were not working so I gave it to a laptop repairer.
I'd initially check up on the power setting and make sure you're running in High Performance.
Okay first check task manager.and see if ram/cpu usage is high.show detail and find any process that make ur laptop lagging
Second,try update ur windows.and install all ur driver with driver pack solution
Perhaps it may be worth giving the repair shop a call to get a detailed overview of the work carried out on the machine?
Whenever I played the game (Inversion) laptop expelled much heat out and laptop fan would start running faster and faster and temperature of air coming out of the laptop was too much but now laptop does't go very hot and the air coming out is also not very hot and fan is also not going fast and the game also lags after being repaired.
can someone please help me or guide me what could be that is causing the issue that every game is lagging.I have read much about thermal paste but I don't know if thats the problem.
