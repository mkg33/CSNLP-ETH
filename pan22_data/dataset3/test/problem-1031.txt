Or if you purchase what is usually called “Dark Fibre” then you are typically paying for dedicated end to end fibre strand(s).
Very quickly, you just got connected to the nearest POP (point-of-presence) with IP over ATM over copper, from which you got allocated a VC (virtual circuit) over a mutualized ATM line.
Short answer: "Back in the day" maybe they did this.
Between 1995 and 2005 inter-POP ATM lines were progressively replaced by IP over MPLS over copper then fiber, and last mile was somewhat replaced by ATM over DSL over copper and now by IP over fiber.
In fact, one of our locations doesn't have any local servers any more.
Then most providers would create a L2 VPN (such as an MPLS pseudowire) between the PoPs across the service providers network between PoPs.
Say I have a remote data center in LA and my office is in San Diego.
It's just some 2 km and you can't see a difference between a local and a remote server.
The two main exceptions are if the two sites are within close proximity of each other (in relative terms, say 20Km) the sites might both hair-pin through the same provider PoP.
When you say I have a site to site dedicated line between the data center and my office, does it mean fibre lines which do not connect to the internet but just between the office and the data center?
Do they dig up the path between the cities just for this request?
We've had the luck to get a few dark fiber pairs spliced off when a larger trunk was laid down along a major road just three years ago.
It wouldn’t actually be a dedicated fibre from end-to-end.
Today this would likely be done by laying a fibre from your office back to a nearby PoP and from the DC to a PoP near the DC.
