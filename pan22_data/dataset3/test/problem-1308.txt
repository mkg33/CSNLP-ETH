The advantage to this is its included with windows so you are not installing anything extra on your computer and if you are a laptop user you can claim it was to protect the laptop while you are on your home network since you don't trust your son's friend's laptop that he comes over with and plays WOW all night on.
And for the recommendations about bringing in another external drive, or laptop, one place I worked did not allow any of that, first time you did it you got a warning put in your file, second time you got fired.
I echo what everyone said about using work pc's for work only.
For example if I'm having a conversation in Skype, can he secretly log in in parallel with me and watch my screen?
RDC will lock your screen if they try to login however there are numerous other ways to see it such as installed transparent screen grabbers or using proxies to intercept traffic.
Best you can do there is use wireshark and see if anything "interesting" is going out.
So that said, there is one loop hole you MIGHT be able to get away with is turn on the windows firewall and block everything by default (disable all exceptions and prompt before allowing) then as stuff requests network access, you can see it and allow or deny it.
That said the admin might have a GPO in place that disables your access to the windows firewall.
Caveat: if he's reaaaally good, and he has nothing better to do, he could have planted a rogue hypervisor in the Bios.
Bring your own external HDD with your OS of choice.
If you're worried about him knowing what you are doing, then you shouldn't be doing it.
Your admin can see what's going on in the virtualized system, but he can't see what you're doing above.
Fire up KVM/Xen/VirtualBox/VMWare/VirtualPC, have it run the OS on the main HDD (this might take some work unfortunately but it's definitely possible).
