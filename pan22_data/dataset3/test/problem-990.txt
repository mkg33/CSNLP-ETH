Is everyone a solid "producer" or are there people whose net worth is likely to just keep going up and others who will remain at a fairly steady net worth?
You might also want to consider what players quitting or becoming inactive does to the amount of circulating currency as well if that is possible.
Inflation is usually defined when well, inflation is >0% and deflation is when inflation is negative.
Everyone may want to sell items for very high prices banking on the one dude with a ton of money strolling through and buying it, not caring that it takes a while to sell.
Or it may be the case that if those "big fish" aren't biting, prices remain the same for a long time because even though the currency supply is bigger, the average Joe doesn't get any of it.
Also, a useful tool to understand the impact of inflation is the doubling time.
For instance, if they don't typically save significant amounts of currency, their income is frequent enough to adjust with the rate of inflation and they interact with the game often then a pretty high inflation rate wouldn't be too bad.
I believe that having a small positive percentage is not inflation, but from the other side, crucial for the economy.
(Ie: increase in the overall cost of most goods/services):
To hazard one practical useful answer: You want a little bit of inflation, otherwise there is no impetus to spend your money and the economy stagnates.
I can however suggest that you think about it as a problem of player perception and expectations.
Are they making daily purchases or are they likely to save up over a long time to make a few big purchases?
For example, in WoW, you wouldn't see a level 1 guy looking for the same weapons as a level 50 guy.
They may be (and usually are) related, but there's a lot of other factors that go into it.
You may have picked up the idea that small positive inflation is good because it is the opinion of some economists that it is indicative of a growing economy.
It also depends on how equitably the increased money is distributed.
Note however, inflation tends to be cancelled out by interest rates or raise in salary.
That depends as much on how long and frequently players interact with the game and what their cash flow looks like as the global inflation rate.
In many countries, the central bank aims to keep the inflation at a steady 2-3% per year through the use of monetary policy.
I dont know what kind of simulation you are aiming for so it is difficult to give a specific answer.
I have experienced playing games with virtual economies that experienced hyperinflation and there are lots of good questions here on Game Design about designing virtual economies but I can't find anything that points to a particular tipping point for inflation percentage.
However, you do not want so much inflation that money earned today evaporates before it can be spent.
On the other hand, if they save a large amount of currency and interact infrequently, they may come back to the game after several cycles of inflation to find they've lost a lot of value - which might make them quit and destabilize the currency more.
You can calculate the percentage of the new money on the system or the money that has been lost from the system by the income and the costs.
In this sense, it will depend strongly on how the money is being generated and sunk.
So as player skill level increases, or population increases, you need to print more money to match it.
Which is the number of inflations that will cause something to double.
In a situation like that, if the level 50 (presumably) is getting a bigger chunk of the increased money supply, then his items will inflate much faster than the items that the level 1 guy is interested in.
Inflation is really the difference between growth of an economy and growth of a money supply.
That depends too much on the nature of the game to give a meaningful answer.
Have you found from your experience or from any research limits that could ring a bell?
However, I was wondering if there are any rough limits of this percentage that could lead to an inflation or deflation for negative percentage.
Zero inflation occurs when your printing of currency matches your economic growth.
With a mixture of both, I would probably go with a figure close to the real world value of 1-2% a year.
In a virtual economy, you can calculate all the income and all the costs (money that sinks) from every user in the game.
For example, if you have every week a result of 1-2%, will not be a serious problem.
It can be approximated as 70/(inflation rate), thus, with a inflation rate of 2%, it will take roughly 35 such inflations to cause something worth 100 to be worth 200.
Let's assume everyone's income increases at roughly the same percentage rate.
If only relatively few characters have a ton of money, prices will likely be very unstable.
I am not confident that there is a good answer to this question without a lot more detail.
If your economy grows and you dont print any more currency, your economy will deflate.
Inflation becomes a problem when player expectation of future currency value shifts cause undesirable behavior.
The exact rate would have to be dependent on how fast you expect people to spend their money.
All you can really track that way is total net worth of all participants.
It is true that by watching the income and sinks of the currency supply you can track overall currency in circulation, but that is not strictly the same as inflation.
Any change in the total amount of currency is inflation.
