When ET is done, it will also tell also you which applications need to be installed.
To copy an OS X installation, files and all, you can just do a backup with Time Machine, reboot from the installation DVD using the "Restore System from Backup" option, and then wait.
I would use vlite to make an unattended install, as you can specify the programs that are installed with it.
If you mean a complete reinstall - also the complete OS, Windows 7 - there is a tool for your needs.
