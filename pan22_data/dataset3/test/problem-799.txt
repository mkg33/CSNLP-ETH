It's good that you're using objects - creating an instance of a class does that.
This is a bit awkward though: you have written your (static) main method in the HelloWorld class, and then you have that main method create an instance of that very same class - I don't like that.
While this is a perfectly valid declaration for main, I'd prefer to have the array declaration behind the type and not behind the argument name for consistency's sake:
I suggest you to use StringBuilder for String concatenation.
Initializing private fields from constructor arguments, and making them final sounds exactly like The Right Thingâ„¢.
I personally find this to take a lot of space and I'd reserve "large" vertical distance to signify sectioning or similar, it's consistent ;)
But I would have implemented the parameterized constructor and the getMessage method in a separate class.
You seem to be using consistent two newlines between last } and the next opening brace.
Java by default imports the java.lang package, you don't have to specify any further things.
For readability property name and corresponding methods name should be relative.
