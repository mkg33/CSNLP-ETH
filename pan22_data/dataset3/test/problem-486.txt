This also makes it very easy to expand to more or different event_code values (assuming you want the min event date, not the min event date per event code).
SQLFiddle is a great place to create schema and sample data.
If you post the full schema, including indexes, and then a few rows of sample data (all cases, including source data that has users with only 223, only 859, neither, and both), and desired results from that sample data, it will be much easier to provide precise assistance.
This won't necessarily speed it up all that much, since the slowness is probably not altogether the fault of your particular query, but rather your indexes (or lack thereof).
Incidentally, you have a repeated ON ON in the last line of the original query.
Now, you mention tuning, which to many will imply that the current query is slow.
No it wouldn't (that is, it's not logically equivalent.
If you need other columns from the user_table, or you need to include rows from user_table even if they don't have any corresponding rows in event_table, then outer join after aggregating, but without all that repetition you currently have with derived tables:
