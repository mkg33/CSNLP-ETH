Assemble a list row with key-value pairs that denote 'events' relevant to your problem:
Does the model need to be understandable by someone (your supervisor or Prime Minister)?
You didn't show us the distributions of the input features grouped by type.
In this case I suggest to use DecisionTrees (easy to interpret).
You wish to find out whether company X with attributes A,B,C will participate in a tender with its own attributes, so the training data is used to model the tender behaviour of a certain company by statistically analysing its history.
Try using simple models such as kNN, Bayesian flavours or Logistic Regression.
Check out this overview to see which classifiers support probability scores.
As a baseline you could try kNN and then Gradient Boosted Classifier.
When you have this data set, you can divide it into training data (80%?
Historical might only include 'positive' values: events that did happen.
The most important aspect of your problem is the set of attributes (features) you choose to collect.
Next, I would suggest to use some of the sklearn models.
The first step you need to produce the input data.
An idea might be to artificially add some events that do exist but in which the company did not participate, so as to include 'negative' values as well.
It's mean you need to assign class (Whether the company participated or not) to your data.
This is the most human part of data modelling / machine learning, because this is where you decide what you want to teach the machine.
Honestly, the selection of models and algorithms is secondary.
How you want to teach it (what algorithm or model you'll use) is also important, but not as important as the content.
I suggest use python pandas library and then you need to label your data.
You need labelled data if you wish to attempt supervised learning.
This gives you a good overview of how well chosen your attributes are.
Try to mimic the actual distribution when adding negative data.
In your case, I would investigate models that output probabilities.
Historically speaking, how likely are companies to participate?
