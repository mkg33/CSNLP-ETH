I wouldn't bother with going through the complexity of a network install if I were you.
If I were you, I wouldn't touch a computer that is working perfectly well and has all the required drivers.
Once you've re-installed Windows 7, copy them back into any folder you like (I use "My Documents\Drivers") and then when Windows asks for the drivers for a piece of hardware, point it at this folder.
The PC Decrapifier is one product that will remove pre-installed bloatware.
For any bloatware left behind, use Revo Uninstaller Freeware to uninstall completely.
Instead, I would try to clean up the utilities that I don't need.
But be very sure that what you uninstall isn't really required.
By wiping the disk you take the risk, even with the best intentions, of finding yourself later on with a half-usable machine.
For connecting an optical drive if you need to: for a one-off use you might find it more cost effective to buy a cheap PATA/SATA-to-USB adaptor and plug in a desktop drive (if you have a desktop machine you can take one out of temporarily) via that.
I use the following method to install Windows 7 on netbooks all the time, there are various tutorials that go into more depth on the topic too:
You may also find that there is a hidden rescue partition on the hard-drive that you can access via key-press at the appropriate point in the machine's startup process.
If a manufacturer does not provide a physical install/rescue CD then they usually provide an image on the laptop that you can write to disk yourself - unfortunately this is likely to require an optical drive connected as it is unlikely to work over network (the image is not usually a plain ISO file in a visible place from where you can copy to another machine for writing).
But overall that's the simplest / quickest method that I'd choose to use.
Once you've backed up the files to a folder, remember to copy it off your computer.
Bear in mind that you can't use this method if you decide to go from Windows 7 32-bit to Windows 7 64-bit (or vice versa) - however going from one variant of Windows 7 to another will work just fine.
I usually erase the recovery partition and MBR added by the manufacturer; normally more hassle than they're worth I find- it's up to you if and how you maintain that.
Many Acer models are setup this way and I've used it to restore a college's laptop to factory default setup (IIRC the magic to start the factory restore process on Acer machines is pressing F11 in the two seconds after the logo is removed from the screen) and you might find Sony do the same thing (check your product documentation).
Acer provide the rescue partition and a way to make a rescue disk (worth having in case the harddrive dies and you need to do a factory restore onto a new one, or the rescue partition becomes corrupt in some way or otherwise lost) so make sure you check for this first.
Regarding (3), use Double Driver to backup all the drivers installed on your computer.
