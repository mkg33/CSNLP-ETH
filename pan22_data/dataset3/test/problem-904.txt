In the case of generic partitioning, where all the partitions created use the same file system and are used for storage... where you partition just to make organizing things easier... it's all about personal choice.
It is possible to make a hard drive work harder (IE shortening the life slightly or decreasing performance) depending on how you write to and from the partitions on that drive.
It is recommended that a partition is dedicated for the time machine backups because the backup will eventually use all available space.
In the case of a Linux operating system, running with different partitions, and different types of partitions improves performance.
Let's say you were going to use the secondary drive for your time machine backups instead of the external drive.
So if you also want to store other stuff on that drive it would be a good idea to partition it.
Really... it depends on whether or not you feel the need to have that level of organizational compartmentalization.
Creating a partition on the secondary drive just for Time Machine to use isn't going to improve performance or make Time Machine do it's job better.
It can help you organize what you use the drive for better.... depending on how much help you need organizing.
It just means you will tell Time Machine to save the backups to a "drive" rather than just a directory.
This is because the different types of partitions are used for different purposes.
