Once we know that ns.example.com is the name server for example.com won't we get stuck?
I then subsequently register ns.example.com as example.com's name server with my registrar.
Having read this, my understanding is confirmed but I'm still left puzzled...
We can't resolve the address of ns.example.com without first knowing who is responsible for example.com.
Perhaps doing some experimentation with dig using +trace and +norecurse in several steps can clarify what's going on.
Presumably there is a step that I'm missing in the lookup...
It looks like this is possible, as google.com appears to be configured this way (as outlined in the linked article).
Surely there is no way to contact ns.example.com because the A record identifying their IP address is held by that same server...?
If I'm not wrong, although the .com gTLD server does not have records for the IP addresses for google.com, knowing the location of google.com's name server it can query the IP addresses and respond with them.
I'm comfortable with DNS and how it works, but this question lead me down a path I've not considered before.
... yes, but we need to know the IP of one of these nameservers to query them, effectively swapping a www.google.com query out for an interim ns1.google.com query.
Suppose I host a DNS server for my own domain (example.com) at 1.2.3.4, and this DNS server advertises the following (simplified) zone:
