For example, the cyrus-imapd service runs on the backend1.
It doesn't know that backend1 and backend2 are the "same".
I use too drbd to synchronize the /var/lib/imap and the /var/spool/imap between my 2 IMAP backends.
The aggregator replied negatively because the aggregator knows that the userA's mailbox is managed by the backend1.
When userA create folder, cyrus-imapd requests from the aggregator if it can create the folder.
I have one cyrus murder (aggregator) master and a IMAP backend cluster on failover consisting of 2 nodes (backend1 and backend2).
But as their datas are replicated, so the maibox disappears on backend1.
When userA creates folders and subfolders in their INBOX, the backend1 requets the aggregator with the mupdate protocole.
Is there an option, in the imapd.conf or something else that allows my 2 backend's IMAP appear with the same name ?
It replied positively and on the aggregator's mailboxes.db we have the folders plus the backend's name where the folder is stored.
Even if the backend1 stops, the backend2 takes over.
