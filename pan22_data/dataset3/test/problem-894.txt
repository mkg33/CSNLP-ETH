step 6: dhclient br0 to ask for a ip adress for br0
step 1: install bridge-utils, and make sure you got a kernel with CONFIG_BRIDGE on.
step 3: brctl addif br0 eth1 to connect eth1 to the bridge
step 4: ifconfig br0 hw ether 08:00:27:b7:84:28 to set a new mac-adress, if you use the same mac-adress as eth1, you get the same ip as eth1.
So how can i get a 2nd IP adress from the DHCP server?
I know that Virtualbox OS can get a different IP-adress, using the same network card as the host, but i hope to get 2 IP-adress for the real computer.
If i use static IP adresses i can use more then one per network card, for exemple i can set eth0 to use 192.168.0.1 and eth0:1 to use 192.168.1.1.
Some info about my computer that may or may not be relevant:
And if eth1 get a ip-adress over dhcp, can i somehow make a eth1:1, and get a 2nd ip-adress?
step 2: brctl addbr br0 to add a bridge called "br0"
(if CONFIG_BRIDGE is off in kernel, you get a error like: "add bridge failed: Package not installed"  at step 2
step 5: ifconfig br0 up to activate the interface/bridge
