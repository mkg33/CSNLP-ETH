As such, I'm sure you don't update /usr/bin/gcc on a pkgadd.
after installation, I use 'gcc -v' to check, I found it is also gcc 4.2 !
I believe it gets installed as eg++ and egcc in /usr/local/bin/.
The compiler is most likely installed in a different directory.
Here is the link to the manual for packets and ports and all I can tell you is read the manual... regards..
I get confused at first, but know I could give you a little help since I don't have OpenBSD installed, I thought it was a program not an OS, anyway...
Then I would find the directory where the binaries are, and set PATH=/path/to/new/gcc/bin:$PATH in the appropriate shell startup files.
You would need to find the directory where the new gcc binary is installed, then prefix that to your PATH.
The assumption is you may need to use the compiler to recompile the system on an update.
pkg_add -u gcc in order to upgrade... not make a new installation, you could uninstall gcc and try to make a clean installation running pkg_delete gcc, but before you do something, try searching if it's true you have the two versions of gcc running pkg_info it should show you all the packages installed...
I would use the pkg_info tool to query where the package was actually installed into.
as I see and reading the manual...(Have you read it?)...
Even a simple rename wouldn't help, since gcc is not just gcc, but a whole slew of libraries, headers, and other utilities.
It could leave you with a system that can not be updated.
