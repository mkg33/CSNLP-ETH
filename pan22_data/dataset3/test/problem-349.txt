Currently, when we update the software, I manually push a copy of the updated client/config files down to each DC.
Is there some kind of DNS magic I can use to pull from the local server?
Excuse the poor explanation, I worked 61 hours over the weekend and haven't completely rebounded.
The client has an autoupdate feature, but it'll only pull from the application server (which is housed in the datacenter, over the 3 meg link).
It determines what subnet the PC is on, and pulls the software from that DC.
They each run the software and a version change is detected.
I have a script that we run on each PC to update the clients.
For instance, if I tell the clients their update server is ERPUPDATE, can I have their local DNS server return a different IP for ERPUPDATE than the other sites?
After the most recent patch, you can configure the clients to pull from a different server.
As per the config files, the clients look to ERPUPDATE for their updated client.
It takes forever, since the updates are not "patches" but a full version of the client, even for minor upgrades (bad design).
Example:  Client 1 is at site A, client 2 is at site b.
