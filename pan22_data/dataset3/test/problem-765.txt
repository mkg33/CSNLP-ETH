I then have a wireless router hooked up, and a laptop, and an iPod.
My intranet app needs to be accessed by name in some places, so direct IP access won't cut it.
I have an intranet server that is also a DNS server, that has its own IP set up as a Host (A) record with the name 'foo'.
Not totally familiar with iPod touch network settings, but in order for me to get the macs on our network to hit our intranet with just the name, i had to modify the "Search Domains" in the mac's Network Settings.
You'd probably have a similar problem with any macs on your network.
In my experience (and I've done specific research into this) whilst most routers have GUI settings for DNS settings, some don't then propagate those settings via DHCP to clients.
If this works, add domain.whatever to the "Search Domains" field in the network settings on your iPod.
It could be resolving the name->IP via NetBIOS, which the iPod wouldn't support.
The laptop connects and can go to 'foo' in a browser just fine.
the laptop) which specific resolvers are being doled out via DHCP.
You said you had a wireless router, which may be using it's own DNS
Are you sure DNS is actually doing the resolution for your laptop?
I tried manually editing the settings on the iPod so instead of the wireless router acting as a DNS server (it then just forwards DNS requests to the intranet server), it used the intranet server as a DNS server directly.
Besides not having to do that on the laptop, it didn't seem to have any effect.
Oh, and be sure to try Dave's answer to make sure it's querying the right DNS server.
From your browser, try going to foo.domain.whatever (whatever the domain the DNS server is authoritative on).
My guess is that the DNS server isn't actually resolving the IP, or DNS isn't forwarded properly.
The iPod connects and can hit the internet and the intranet server by IP address only--type in 'foo' and it never connects.
Check on a connected laptop "nslookup foo" and see what it comes back with, this should help you diagnose the problem.
