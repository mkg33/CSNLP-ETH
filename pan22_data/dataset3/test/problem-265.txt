Some of his work is very hard to find (and it's mostly in Polish, though a little of it is in German), but there's a book, "The Logical Systems of Lesniewski" by Luschei, that describes it well.
This is a development of (a rather idiosyncratic version of) what is usually called Morse-Kelley set theory, but Morse also pays a great deal of attention to the formulation of definitions.
Probably not what you want but perhaps worth mentioning anyway is A. P. Morse's book "A Theory of Sets".
Another logician who paid close attention to definitions was S. Lesniewski.
(There should be an acute accent on the first s in "Lesniewski" but the best my keyboard and browser can do here is LeÂ´sniewski.)
His goal is to make the formal language close to normal mathematical English, while avoiding ambiguities.
In contrast to most systems, definitions are not conservative in Lesniewski; some definitions play the role of comprehension axioms.
Because of their importance in his framework, Lesniewski gave very careful rules for what constitutes a legitimate (in his sense) definition.
There's a long chapter, early in the book, spelling out what is allowed in definitions.
He developed a system of foundations of mathematics in which definitions played a crucial role.
I don't have the books handy at the moment, but I think Shoenfield's "Mathematical Logic" and Hinman's "Fundamentals of Mathemtical Logic" would contain much if not all of what you're looking for.
