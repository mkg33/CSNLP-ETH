If you can physically swap all the parameters from working Pi's then it is a hardware fault with the pi/pis
But we upgraded the included power adapter, because that too doesn't worked - LOL.
This started better, because the OS had fault before the INIT... GOOGLEING... ok, format card, copy fresh NOOBS... FAIL, card is read-only.
It's hard to believe, from 6 cards, there's 3 defected ones and ALL IS NEW!
I have an university project, with 4 raspberry pi 3 (starter kit).
I've successfully set 1 as an AP, and 2 with client (all 3 has mosquitto installed), they works fine.
But I had a similar problem that an additional device doesn't connect to the network but couldn't verify a hardware problem.
So I went back to the university, I said the problem, then I got another pi.
Including SD card, power supply(plus cable) and the physical location.
So the clients and the router are in different room.
OK, then, again back to university another replacement.
The reason was simply that the pool of ip addresses from the DHCP server was used up and the new device doesn't could get an ip address.
Then I tried inserted an installed OS from one of the working one, but it still can't see.
So I thinked this is a hardver problem, because the other 2 sees 6 wifi networks, also my laptop and mobile sees too, both my wifi (with mostly 4/5) and the pi's (mostly 3/5 or 2/5) and some neighbor's wifi (mostly with 1/5 signal streinght).
But, you have to swap everything to prove the test.
Well, I wasn't able to remove the read-only (this session only read only), however I fount an 32Gb own microSD, format, copy, done.
Can't see the WIFIs... (however, sometimes at least it came up the router's wifi, not like at the previous ones.)
However I tought now, it's an OS problem, so I went down to the satellite wifi, I connected via UTP cable, I updated, I saw it sees next to the satellite the wifi, after update I went back and same, it can't see.
Plus any devices you connecting including monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.
I don't overview when and where the 4th RasPi doesn't work so I can't verify my idea about the error.
