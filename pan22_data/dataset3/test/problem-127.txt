Today I've used wiringPi library and succussfully light up the LCD1602 and show tempreature on it.
If you do, just hook it up to it and see if it runs it.
Maybe a problem with the power supply that comes with the set?
the last 4 ports which not duplicate with the former 6 ports should be all right.
I also had the same problem and it seems to be something with the trimpot that adjusts the contrast.
4,12,13,6--LCD1602's DATA (4 bits mode) is from IO4,MOSI,MISO,IO6
It uses 4 bits mode so that wiringPi's library function lcdInit() should be called like this:
However, after attaching the ribbon cable to the DVK511 and the Pi, the DVK511 has it's lights on, and if I plug the LCD1602 into the correct pins, it's screen lights up a light blue.
However, when I 'make' the LCD1602 test program that comes with the waveshare version of Rasbpian, and then run it via LCD1602_Test, nothing happens on the LCD, and a few LEDs on the DVK511 flash.
I recently got a pi and it came with the a DVK511 board a number of other things, such as a LCD1602 screen.
If the pi is running on battery it has to be grounded.
I have the custom raspbian image on my SD card that my pi is running, and is currently booted off of.
GND 3.3V V0 IO3 GND SCK X X X X IO4 MOSI MISO IO6 3.3V GND
I tested the LEDs to make sure I had the board connected to the raspberry pi correctly, and they worked.
Also, maybe you are not feeding enough power/not any.
In my case, the display shows the text but with a very low contrast, even if the trimpot is at max.
I don't know what library you use, but the problem could be the same
