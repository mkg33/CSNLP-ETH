According to your link, AutoCad 2011 doesn't modify the MBR, but instead modifies the 2K bytes that follow it (which are usually unused, except by GRUB) therefore you need to reinstall Grub rather than restore the MBR.
To backup and restore the part that AutoCad overwrite replace count with 5 (to cover the first 512 and the 2k following it).
Depending on your version of GRUB, there are different choices for which recovery disk you should use; you can see them all here.
Although as Cody pointed out - any piece of software PARTICULARLY A TRIAL VERSION that modifies your hardisk on such a low level should be removed immediately
For this problem it's not actually an issue with the MBR.
If you want to restore your MBR back to its original state and you have win 7 or vista you can do this:
restore using the same command but with flipped of and if
By Far the Easiest and quickest way to backup/restore the MBR is to use a linux live-cd and dd.
In any case, since it is an important question I will address what you actually asked - restoring MBR.
Assuming of course that you did this prior to installing AutoCad.
Make sure that /dev/sda refers to your primary hard drive, there is no need to specify blocksize and count since MBR.bak is 512 bytes already - NOTE THAT THIS WILL OVERWRITE YOUR PARTITION TABLE - avoid doing so by selecting bs=446 count=1 on the restore (last 66 bytes of the MBR is the table + signature)
According to the Super GRUB Disk Wiki, you can fix GRUB from within a Linux install if you use a LiveCD, or from the GRUB command prompt if you can get to stage 1, or by using said Super GRUB Disk to repair the bootloader.
If you have access to stage 1 of the loader, use the following commands:
