At the end of the list will be the fonts that are used in the image but are missing from your system.
If you see any rasterized images you need the font face of, you'd best export just that section as a clear, standalone image and use a service like What the Font to determine the font.
In the Character tool, go to the font selection drop down.
Also make sure you ungrouped all layers before doing this.
If the text has already been rasterized, the easy way would be to crop the area with the typeface you want to identify, save as a .png and upload it to WhatTheFont, where it should be able to tell you what it is, unless it is an obscure or bespoke one.
Developer asked me almost the same think like you needed.
And of course, if it's not a web-safe font, you'll need to find an appropriate way of replacing it, or providing a fallback stack.
This will list all the embeddable fonts used in the PSD file, provided you can embed them.
You have to select each layer to actually see them and it is useful only if you need a quick glance at them
Identifont is another site you can use, where you describe characteristics of the typeface.
Depends on how you want to extract the information.
I came up with editing simple script, to export layer properties (text, font name, font size, font color) which you need when developing, to a single txt file (should work on Windows machine).
It will show what font is being used in the Character window.
Just save this like "ExportTexts.js" and put in Adobe Photoshop > Presets > Scripts.
Hope it helps someone three years after this was asked.
(Shouldn't the typeface be shown when you open the PSD and select the respective text, though?)
Select the Text tool (T icon with serifs) and click on the text area to edit it.
After that, run (or restart) Photoshop and run script (File -> Scripts -> ExportTexts).
I would take a snap of the text you need (preferably zoomed in) and use WhatTheFont to get some guesses.
Exported file should be in a same dir as psd file.
There is an option on the Layers tab that lets you filter all of the layers to show only the fonts.
