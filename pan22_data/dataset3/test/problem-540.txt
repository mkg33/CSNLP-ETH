edit /etc/tor/torrc by adding appropriate HiddenServiceDir and HiddenServicePort directives:
I have been checking error messages using journalctl -xn, and they are not consistent - however the primary errors seem to be:
This should work flawlessly for up-to-date Fedora and CentOS systems.
I have experimented with commenting and removing some of the lines in the default systemd tor.service file, but with no success.
A few of the fixes that have been posted in answer to this question do work, but with variable rates of success.
on Debian Jessie, this worked for me (I store tor hidden service information in /opt/tor)
One fix I have come across which works consistently is to load a few exceptions into SELinux.
However, for what it's worth, I have also seen this issue on a mostly-stock installation of Fedora Server and on Fedora Workstation.
Some potentially helpful output from /etc/tor/torrc:
Currently I am attempting to start tor using systemctl start tor using the default systemd tor.service file shipped with CentOS.
Create a tor-selinux-workaround.cil file with the following content:
I have ensured the following about the entire /var/lib/tor path, but with no success:
Now when I attempt to start the tor service with the hidden service lines in the /etc/tor/torrc file, it fails to start.
Import that file into SELinux with the following command:
(allow tor_t self (capability (dac_override dac_read_search)))
I am attempting to set up a Tor hidden service on CentOS 7 (with systemd), using the tor package from the EPEL repository.
Not sure what might be causing this issue, but I suspect it's something to do with the precise configuration of systemd.
create directory and set ownership and permissions:
Nothing on the system was restarted at this time, though automatic updates are enabled via yum-cron so perhaps something updated.
Previously this was working fine until a few days ago when it stopped working.
