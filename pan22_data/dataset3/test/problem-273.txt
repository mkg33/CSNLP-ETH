For example, if the Meraki system assigns an IP address to the WET54G and Router WAN of 192.168.0.xxx, the router LAN must be set to a different IP range (192.168.1.xxx).
I put together a separate network with all the devices that we needed on our router.
I then configured the WET54G to connect wirelessly to the other network.
It appears the WET54GS has a buit-in hub so it may be possible to use only the WET54G to create a separate network.
If you are going to get a mac address white-listed, I would get both MAC addresses on that list.
The biggest thing you are going to have to watch out for is your IP address that you assign to the router lan DHCP server.
When I setup the system before, I had a IP address for the WET54G (192.168.0.245) manually set in the configuration page and a DHCP address for the router.
When this was done, I plugged the WET54G into the internet port of the router I was using and voila... internet access for my network.
I have done exactly what you are asking for in the past with the WET54G devices (the device without the hub).
