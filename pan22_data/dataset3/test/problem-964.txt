Finally, if your music collections are a mess with files of varying quality, some tagged, some not tagged, some named or tagged incorrectly, then quit downloading junk from LimeWire and copying crap from your friends and buy your own music.
Do a Google search, there are lots to choose from.
Once that's done you can consolidate however you want.
:-P  For real though, at this point you'll need software like MusicBrainz Picard that can take an audio fingerprint of your songs, identify it against a music database, and then tag it correctly.
I use it very successfully for tidying up, and it copes with any file type.
*I've heard of things like EAQUAL, but they still have failings compared to real humans listening.
If you've got the same music in possibly different formats, (like some MP3, some FLAC, some AAC/MP4) then you'll need music library software that can help you organize all that music and find your best quality audio out of what's available.
If you might have done things like tagged some songs and not others, then AllDup will help you out.
If you want something more sophisticated, try WinMerge.
MediaMonkey is one such program -- this isn't an advertisement that it will be any good for you, just an example of what you're looking for.
If you're sure that the duplicate music is going to be identical, then you can use a duplicate file finder to eliminate the duplicates.
It's a duplicate file finder that's smart enough to ignore tags on MP3 files.
What you want is some kind of duplicate file finder :-)
You might have to do some listening to see what sounds best to you though, there's no good standards for measuring audio quality*.
The one I use is this one http://www.afterdawn.com/software/desktop/misc_desktop_tools/fast_duplicate_file_finder.cfm
Then go up to the previous option of getting some kind of library software to get everything organized.
It might ignore tags with other audio types too, I've also heard that the author is pretty responsive, if you need an extra feature or two.
