I have the SRW2008MP version, and the internal fan bearings were going bad.
You can find a cubic meter/hour to cubic feet/hour convertor via google, and divide by 60 to get cubic feet/minute to prove this to yourself.
You can unscrew the front interface port and push that internally, and thru that hole see where the far right top plastic tab is to start your process of removing the front face.
The small Sunon fan is KDE1204PKV1, and you can look up the performance curves for that V1 version to see the max cubic feet/minute, etc.
My approach was different..... mount a nice Noctua 92x92x25mm 3-wire case fan to the top of the switch, externally.
The fan is pushing air inwards (as is the pattern with virtaully all computer fans it pushes towards the center fan hub label) down onto the left end of the internal PCB.
you get VLAN support, but not SNMP for instance) the SLM will do you fine, and it's smaller (and cheaper) than the SRW.
If you have a pile of old heatsinks you could attach them to the hottest chips and that should be enough, especially as IIRC the power supply is external on those small linksys units.
There is a smaller number of case holes on the left metal case side, and more on the right metal case side so the air flow exits both sides, right greater than left.
The Noctua fan will plug right onto that header, perfectly.
The mechanics:  I had a hole saw for 80mm fan size, and just used that, so there is about 3/8" internal metal overhang, but that is fine and good for strength.
Maybe the top metal part can be pressed forward off of the bottom metal part, but I did not think of that and worked hard enough to finally tear off one of the plastic hole back edges (one each right and left end) so that the back could then be removed.
You can remount that programming port before you put things back together.
I sawed from both sides to get the cleanest edges, and filed down the sharp edges some.
It is a 0.8W max fan, and clips into a metal holder at the far left side.
I had drill press drilled my 4 fan mount holes first, plus a center 1/4" guide hole for the hole saw's 1/4" center guide drill.
then you can redeploy the SRW2008 somewhere where the noise isn't a problem :)
Mine is in a small data cabinet in the wall that abuts a master bedroom, and the noise was getting disturbing.
Pull that out and disconnect its standard 3-wire fan plug from the circuit board.
When I looked up the Noctua fan with a Noctua low noise adapter in-line the specs showed greater air flow (by far), and that runs now almost silent, with huge improvement in quality and MTBF.
All very neat, and running virtually silently, with much better airflow than the original.
I ran some 3com gear for many years after disconnecting the internal fan, however it did eventually die with the power caps popping after years of high heat (not actually over the limit, but steady).
I also drilled a 3/8" hole in the top left back black plastic plate, centered 1" in and 1/2" down from that top left corner..... that allows the Noctua LNA's smaller end to be fed thru and hooked to the header.
I centered my hole saw equally front/back over the top left side of the metal case (very near where the original fan was), and the metal is an aluminum alloy so it did cut (carefully) with the hole saw.
The power port is not attached physically to the back face.
The center to center for the 92mm fan holes is 83mm.
All went back together nicely, but be very careful as you finally put the front plastic face back on to not hang up on any of the front metal port thin edges.
For the time and effort you're going to spend pulling it apart and trying to find replacement fans that will a) fit and b) last, you may as well go and buy a Linksys SLM2008 switch instead - if you don't need all of the managed functions (eg.
I used the Noctua rubber fan mounts, and wrapped the Noctua lead around the fan outside for neatness (can zip tie it to the fan's outer corner ribs after drilling 1/8" holes in them).
