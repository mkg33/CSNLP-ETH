We will continue using the previous scenario for convenience but we will add TheNewSlave to the plot.
Fetch the master_log_file and master_log_pos from the file xtrabackup_slave_info, execute the statement for setting up the master and the log file for The NEW Slave:
We will use Percona XtraBackup to clone an already configured slave.
If both IO and SQL threads are running when you check the TheNewSlave, server is replicating TheMaster.
Copy the directory from the TheSlave to TheNewSlave (NOTE: Make sure mysqld is shut down on TheNewSlave before you copy the contents the snapshot into its datadir.
By using the --slave-info Percona XtraBackup creates additional file called xtrabackup_slave_info.
It's pretty easy to create a slave either from the running master or slave.
Make sure you change the server-id variable in /etc/mysql/my.cnf to 3 and disable the replication on start:
rsync -avprP -e ssh /path/to/backupdir/$TIMESTAMP TheNewSlave:/path/to/mysql/datadir
Here Percona explains how to do it with XtraBackup http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.1/howtos/setting_up_replication.html#adding-more-slaves-to-the-master
You can use this procedure with slight variation to add new slaves to a master.
