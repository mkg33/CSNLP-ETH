As mentioned earlier, on the Windows side I'll be running Office and iTunes primarily.
So, based on your needs, it's definitely a Windows VM on a Linux host.
One OS might have better overall performance due to drivers; that would be a better choice for the host, as the guest would benefit indirectly.
Using Windows as the guest is certainly doable, but there might be a hiccup reactivating it on virtualized hardware.
On the Linux side I'll be running OpenSuSE 11.2 and above, and the software I'm developing uses OpenGL and the Qt SDK.
I want some of the software that Windows offers (i.e.
Your best bet is to run Windows in the VM - Office is not resource consuming, and iTunes if you are only using it for music (not videos!)
I will be getting a Windows 7 machine at work soon.
Should I install Linux on a virtual machine with Windows 7 as the host (either via Windows own software or VirtualBox), or should I install a Linux partition and run Windows 7 in a virtual machine, with Linux as the host (assuming I have the Windows 7 disk)?
On the other hand, your development needs means you need straight on access to the OpenGL layer without going through another VM layer, and compiling will definitely be faster if it's done on the host layer.
