You might be able to get something like Karabiner to differentiate, but I've never used it.
Holding combinations of modifiers will show you what is mapped to where.
Alternatively, how can I find a map of the current layout to learn the new combinations?
My question is: how can I remap those key combinations so that they're exactly the same like they were on Windows?
I recently connected my Windows keyboard to my MacBook Pro.
I currently don't know how to produce the @ key with my keyboard, for example, and I have to rely on copy/pasting it from the web.
The keyboard has a Croatian layout and I have picked "Croatian - PC" as the input language in keyboard settings.
But now when I connected my keyboard to MacBook pro, those combinations no longer work.
On my Windows keyboard, I would usually use Alt Gr + some key to produce a specific character.
Everything mostly works fine, except for one problem.
You can manually search for which keys would produce @ by opening the Keyboard Viewer - from the menu bar if it's shown, or enable it in System Prefs > Keyboard > Keyboard.
Mac doesn't differentiate between actually pressing Ctrl+Alt & pressing AltGr.
