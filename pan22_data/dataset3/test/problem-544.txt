The reason the F5 solution exists is to handle this on the Proxy Server side.
I think this will work with ASP.NET applications but will NOT work with PHP applications.
Both the ASP.NET solution listed here, and the PHP solution listed for Drupal seem to be utilizing a value that CloudFlare is forwarding (HTTP_CF_Connecting_IP) and are intended to be used on the destination server.
For those I would think you would need something along the lines of:
I realize it has been a while since you asked this question but I figured this answer might help others even if you've already arrived at an answer/solution.
Otherwise, you'd see the IP address of the proxy server as the requesting IP address.
Yes, this web.config "script" from Cloudflare does affect logging by capturing the IP address of the client (connecting) user that connected to the proxy and delivers it to your destination server via the server variable REMOTE_ADDR.
(though I realize that is Drupal specific it is basically a PHP version of the ASP.NET way you listed)
