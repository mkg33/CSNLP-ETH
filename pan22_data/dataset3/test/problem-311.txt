So it closes off any external attacks; in that way it is better than an account with a weak password.
By default the new accounts you create don't have password, with the exception of the Administrator account.
By default, Windows XP (and later), accounts with no password cannot be used to access the computer from the network.
For that reason it is sometimes recommended to have user accounts with no password at all.
If you set a password, it will (naturally) always ask for it.
However, on my installation (with integrated SP2) it always asks to click on username, regardless of whether it has a pass or not, so that depends, obviously maybe.
However, if you wish to use auto login feature, it can be set.
When you start Windows XP for the first time, it is expected to create a password for that account.
The other consequence, is that your account can be used to connect to the computer over the network.
Unless, it is your home machine, which only you have access on, I would generally suggest putting on a password.
Scheduled Tasks can run just fine on an account without a password.
If you set a password it will not auto login, unless you specifically ask it.
You will need to click on the username and then will be asked for a password.
At least something simple which you can type in a quick one handed stroke (like trew or something like that).
When you're prompted for the password, press Enter.
