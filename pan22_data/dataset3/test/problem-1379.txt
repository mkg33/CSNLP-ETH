Ubuntu 16.04 uses systemd instead of init and hence the concept of runlevels is replaced by the term targets.
After some trial and error, I narrowed down to it because once xpra is installed, as long as I don't log out or reboot, there seems no problem.
Once I reboot, I cannot type my password in the login screen, nor can I show the terminal via shortcuts.
How can I fix this, using xpra or alternative without such problem?
Don't use the version of xpra from the Ubuntu repositories.
So there is indeed a mapping between init-based runlevels and systemd-based targets:
When a GUI is used you are using a runlevel of 5, the multi-user is the runlevel 3 that you can use to avoid the login freezing.
Those are fundamentally broken, see problems with distribution packages.
I tried reinstalling lightdm and ubuntu-desktop but in vain.
Now, to just change the "runlevels" in 16.04, you can use for eg:
If you can get access to the system you can change the runlevel of the system to avoid start with the login of xpra, if you set the runlevel to 3 you are telling to the system to start and shows the terminal login, and from there you can perform any procedure you need, you can try uninstall xpra or you can try testing the xinit and xorg binaries to see if your user can execute it without any problem like the freezing.
