If yes maybe you should try and uninstall it first.
I started an installation of the Xcode 4 developer's preview last night before going to bed.
I did so, but whatever script had displayed the message seemed to have hung because the (uncancellable) message wouldn't disappear, and the installer wouldn't progress.
Also activity monitor can shut down any other installers running that was the way it worked for me...
When I woke up, the installation had popped up a message saying to close Xcode first (doh!).
Is there a previous Xcode installation on your computer?
Simply just check that no Applications are downloading in the App Store because I had iMovie downloading in the background and I didn't notice until later.
This time it wouldn't even start, instead showing one of those candy-stripe activity bars and the message:
After force quitting the Installer app, the message above was still showing, so I restarted my MacBook Pro and then tried the installation again.
After that I just cancelled the iMovie installation and the other installation downloaded within seconds.
There are no other installations in progress, so there must be some artifact left over from the interrupted install that's gumming up the works.
