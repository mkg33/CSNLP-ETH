you could easily add the start RDP call after the loop that wait the host to come back on line .
In the alternative, I strongly suggest you use choline daily as your mind is frying at a relatively young age.
this is a quick way to see what users are connected to a server, this particular syntax would looks specifically for the RDP listen session on that server, once that visible it should be possible to logon, i use the command slightly differently in a script that actually crawls around 60 servers, and identifies where on the network a user is logged in.
But that could be easily added, along with a quick beep on successful response.
OK, I don't know of anything that will call your cell phone, but if you open a command box, and do "ping -t" minus the quotes, it will keep pinging...not just the 4 times.
I have a simple script on each of my servers that emails me when the server has rebooted.
Quick and dirty Powershell script that I use daily:
It could be not so difficult to achieve what you want with this two script.
They are triggered by whatever means is appropriate to the OS.
Look at this function that start an RDP Session and at this piece of script for PowerShell .
#This piece waits for the Server to come back online .
It's a batch file using blat on Windows, perl scripts on Mac and Linux.
It is hard to ignore that in the middle of your screen when you get back.
do{$result = $ping.send("ServerName");write-host "."
The bit I'm more happy with (taken from a currently unremembered source on the internet) is that this won't try and connect when the server comes responds to ping - instead, only when the standard RDP port is accessible.
