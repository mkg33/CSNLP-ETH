My copy of MicroScope is getting a bit old now and I need to get an update, if there is one, because it sometimes doesn't test very recent hardware.
I also keep a spinrite cd with me to deal with low level hard drive issues.
I have a vendor support contract, and a well-stocked on-site spares pile.
It reports continuity and cable sequence with a set of 9 LEDs.
I've found that Linux tends to give better hardware errors and it takes the installed OS out of the picture.
For cable testing, in me previous position I used a superb device from Fluke (expensive!)
I dont have much equipment that i have the knowledge to test with a multimeter.
I know memtest86 has a lot of fans but I no longer use it since discovering that it isn't too reliable.
Our servers could be at any of 500 locations or 6 datacenters, so screwdrivers aren't very useful :)
I'm a management dope now whose only tool is a blackberry, but when I cared about servers, my top tools were:
Nearly any linux livecd or USB distro can be made to test hardware effectively, as there are a multitude of tools for that in the repos for most distributions.
I usually set that up at the end of the day and let it run overnight.
I recently found a cat5 tester invaluable for testing and identifying fault in a vertical run, and really how else would you do that?
Seriously I always keep a Linux live cd such as System Recovery CD.
The going philosophy at my place of business is always have one spare, so nearly always theres an identical part that we are pretty confident works.
If a hard drive is questionable but still works (and it sata or pata) i usually rip it out and either image it or just copy off the necessary data using a USB drive sled.
But it tends to work better on the users than the hardware.
I've had several occasions where memtest86 said the RAM was OK when it wasn't.
Sure, I've got multimeters, oscilloscopes, soldering stations and all manner of weird shit at home, but on the job it's far more efficient and makes far more business sense just to swap parts (whole systems, if I'm not sure what might be the cause of the problem) to get things up and running, then validate the failure and ship the busted stuff back to the vendor.
Then it can typically be tested/fixed/identified as bad using that machines disk tools.
but  I now use a simple CAT/Phone cable tester that I purchased at a local electronics supplier for about $20.
I also have a commercial product called MicroScope, which is a bootable CD with a large range of testing software that can be run in a number of ways, including batch mode for testing multiple devices.
If I have the parts the old parts swapping technique is used.
