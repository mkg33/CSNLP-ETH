The problem I'm trying to solve is when coding in large projects, I need to add/subtract/modify related code in many places and get lost as to where I am.
This is more of a wish, but does anyone know of a text editor / editor plugin that visually shows you where you've been editing last?
The SynWrite editor has "micro-map" feature showing changes for any file opened.
You could define "sets" of marks, to group related points.
You could use Jedit with the plugin "MarkerSets" to mark specific locations in multiple files an then move between them fast using whatever hotkeys you have defined for its functions.
A nice characteristics to not get lost in presence of lots of markers.
The Emacs mark ring is nice within a single file, so I'm looking for something like that except more visual and across an entire project.
I tend to remember what the code looked like, but it's hard to jump back to where I was N edits ago.
When you create a mark depending on the "active set" a different color is used to represent it.
