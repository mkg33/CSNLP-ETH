Also, it doesn't necessarily have to be with Excel.
There may be alternative 3rd party software that can also do links; you may be able to take your PDF without links and use some software like that to add them later.
So I finally thought of using someone other than Adobe to create the pdf for me - but I didn't hold out much hope.
Excel doesn't know anything about PDFs, so its hyperlinks don't necessarily mean anything in PDF format unless your authoring tool can both read the Excel links and translate them into the PDF it authors.
Can anybody suggest how I can publish this to PDF so that the hyperlinks work in the PDF?
Adobe Acrobat is the application that works with the PDF format most natively, and can definitely do this, but it is pricey.
You will need to use software that actually creates a PDF without a printer driver, such as PDF Studio, Bluebeam, Nitro, Adobe, or several other tools.
According to the answer I'll upvote, Excel will export external hyperlinks, not internal.
I've worked out that saving as PDF from Word will do this...i.e.
Publishing from powerpoint would be almost as good, and failing that, any easy solution which allows me to create a PDF containing clickable images that takes one to internal bookmarks might also be a workaround.
It's FREE to convert your excel document and it works!!
You just attach the document you want to turn into a pdf and email it to yourself online.
When I publish or use PDF Factory, the hyperlinks are not preserved (and bookmarks aren't created for that matter either).
I was not able to get external hyperlinks to export as pdf either by printing to pdf or by save as pdf while using Excel 2007.
it takes a 'picture' of your document, and makes it into a PDF.
It sounds like pdfFactory doesn't do this on its own.
I was, however able to get the external links to publish to pdf by going to "save as" and then to "other formats" and then selecting .pdf.
I have an Excel workbook with an index page containing a series of images, that are each hyperlinked to different worksheets.
Perhaps pdfFactory Pro would grant you the feature set necessary to achieve this.
PDF hyperlinks need to be defined/created with the PDF authoring tool.
I would prefer to do this with inbuilt functionality or free tools, though any suggestions welcome.
Adobe are apparently well aware of the bug and will address this in the future.
