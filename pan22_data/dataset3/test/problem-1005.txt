And, because we all know that doesn't always work out, have some kind of recovery plan.
The other day, my boss accidentally rm -rf *ed the wrong directory.
All I can say is follow the mantra previous mentioned: think twice, do once.
Once you retrain your brain to expect rm to be safe, you become very dangerous on any machine without those protections.
I'm strongly against protective aliases like rm="rm -i".
Personally I'm a fan of an Rsync'd directory that saves all important files nightly, but that's because it works for me.
In my current position, mistakes aren't to terribly bad.
We had clients who depended on things, programmers who didn't do a great job of securing/saving their code, and people in other departments messing with things they had no right to touch.
I'd much rather train my fingers to type "rm -i" or just use mv instead of rm, since those aren't likely to get me into trouble in a new environment.
In my previous post as a Jr. Linux Sysadmin, anything going bad was VERY bad.
other people may need backup solutions that are far more frequent.
