There are millions of shoppers on Amazon every day, so how does Amazon track each individual shopper?
After noticing this I went to the CCleaner site, which I used years ago, and the functionality I need is no longer part of their free version.
Now it has this huge warning flag that you will be clearing everything.
Any changes in your computer, in Firefox, will have no effect to your shopping cart.
A few versions ago I stopped using an addon that deleted flash cookies, because Firefox said that was necessary anymore, and also the plugin was incompatible with the new version.
I noticed that my Amazon shopping cart still had items in it after I cleared all my data (except browsing history) and restarted Firefox later.
On the other hand, Amazon's servers store a record of all the activities you performed on their website.
The changes only happen on the client side, your computer.
I changed the clear history back to my prior settings, and what should be the default: "Time range to clear: Everything."
The problem was that when I upgraded Firefox it cleared all my settings (including in about:config - which is a total pain, but another story.)
I have all the boxes checked except for browsing history.
You can remove all the cookies in Firefox to prevent websites from tracking you.
Finally, Amazon maintains its shopping cart, not Firefox, even if Amazon is using cookies to do so.
Also, when I came here to post this, I was already logged in to the stackoverlow system, and I just had to press a button to add superuser.
When you clear Firefox's history, you are simply removing all the URLs that you have visited using Firefox.
In short, items in your shopping cart is tracked and stored by Amazon servers.
The clear history defaults to "last hour" - which is practically invisible the way they have it laid you.
If that is the case, all actions you have performed on Amazon is stored and tracked by their servers.
To prevent tracking, you can use Firefox's Private Browsing and not log in to Amazon.
When you deleted everything, everything was deleted.
Second, History in Firefox is a list of sites you've visited.
The huge warning flag should be shown when you will NOT be clearing everything.
When you first visited Amazon's website, it stores a unique identifier, called a cookie, on Firefox on your machine.
Even if you clear all cookies and cache on Firefox, or even use another computer, as long as you log in to your Amazon account, Amazon will show you your previous shopping activities.
Every time you visit Amazon, Firefox will send the cookie to Amazon, and Amazon can track your previous activities, including adding items to your shopping cart.
The safe way to delete an item is click the Delete button or set quantity to zero.
First, Firefox currently has some issues, due to an expired certificate at Mozilla.
