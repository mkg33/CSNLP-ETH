(I've quit the program for now and my comp is running smooth).
Also, I'm not running any other conflicting security programs.

When I restart the program, reboot, whatever, it goes off and hogs all the resources again after a couple minutes.
I've scanned with MSE, another antivirus and malware with no probs.
This only works if you have a Multi-Core CPU obviously.
Not the ideal solution,  but you can attempt to set the process affinity to a single processor core so it can't take all the resources.
All of a sudden the process "MsMpEng.exe" will randomly go crazy and hog all my system resources so I can't do anything unless I kill it in the task manager.
I've been using MSE for a couple months now, never had a single problem.
If I kill the process it will go away and then come back a couple minutes later and do the same thing.
The following settings can decrease the resources usage without greatly effecting the effectiveness of MSE.
This should leave your other processor core to do the other tasks you need.
