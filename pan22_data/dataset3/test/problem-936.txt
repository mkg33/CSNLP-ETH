Also you can add a layer of protection using DVDisaster error correction codes.
Nowadays, Blu-Rays have become affordable (both the writer and the discs), so we could say that if you take care of using the correct writer and discs (HTL), you can have a cost effective reliable long term storage medium.
What they found is that not all Blu-Ray discs are equal, and the most resilient were of the HTL type.
If you set up a ZFS RAID-Z array, you would have 6TB of available space and one drive could fail completely, before you would be in trouble.
The prices of decent HTL BD-R discs have come down to just above $20 per 50.
For example, it reads the media and tells you how many errors the drive encountered (yes, even with perfectly readable media, all drives will encounter thousands of errors - that is normal and part of the specification for optical media).
I was also wondering if BD writers are reliable now.
Also, the optical writer impacted quite a lot on the resiliency of the Blu-Ray (they tested writing with different optical writers on the same blu-ray brand).
The technology is similar to the technology used in DVD+R M-Disc media, which makes it seem pretty reliable to me.
A study was conducted by the french National Archives in 2012 about the viability and resiliency for long term storage of various Blu-Ray discs brands and BR writers.
The cloud storage is encrypted and archived to 7zip files (protected by a 30+ character password), so no prying eyes can see my data.
That said, I would still use BD-R media as one leg of a more complete backup solution.
I definitely wouldn't use the cloud as my only means of backing up though.
I know that in the CD/DVD world, Verbatim and Taiyo Yuden are the top brands of media, so perhaps that is still true when it comes to BD media.
I agree with Xavierjazz - back up to different types of media, and keep them in different locations.
For BD media, there's a new version of the program called Opti Drive Control, which is payware and which I haven't used.
But this will always be more complicated and time consuming than using a simple hard drive...
My caveat is I wouldn't use any capacity higher than 25GB, single layer, and if you have TB of data, this would take quite some time to burn, and quite a bit of space to store.
Also, after you have burned a CD or DVD, you can use a free program called Nero CD-DVD Speed to test the media and it will give you an idea of what the burn quality is.
I have a few I burned a few years ago, and they are still readable.
There is no perfect way to keep data, all media will degrade over time.
The best way is multiple backups, probably on different media, kept on different sites to guard against fire, flood, etc.
I have a second hard drive in my computer dedicated to backed-up data, plus my roommate's NAS, plus optical, plus cloud storage.
I suppose using the "cloud" would be convenient - it is in a different location, but you don't need to leave your home to access it.
