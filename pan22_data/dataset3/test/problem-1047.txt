It's a little late perhaps, but you could try this: run the app on a Windows server, then install OpenSSH and configure passwordless login for every user.
My guess for the reason that it doesn't run and will not run is because it's actually a 16-bit application.
Kind of like using Terminal Server, but may avoid the problems you anticipated with it.
But if yours is 16-bit then you're going to have to run an emulator.
If done right and with a little luck they might not notice they're running the app somewhere else at all.
The easiest and fastest is b option using XP Mode.
XP Mode, as a virtualization option, integrates the installed application in XP, in Windows 7.
Apparently, Win64 doesn't include the WoW Win16-support subsystem required to run 16-bit apps.
Also, if the users are accustomed to cmd.exe you can try ssh'ing from it instead of Putty or some other terminal emulator/ssh client, but the feasibility of that depends on your app mostly.
Also make sure to disable Data Execution Prevention or add your app as an exclusion to it or it also won't run.
You can definately run 32-bit apps on 64-bit windows.
If it really is 32-bit then make sure the 32-bit libraries are installed and available.
