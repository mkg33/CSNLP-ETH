If you want full control over your server you'll probably at some point need to leave the control panel behind.
The Linode 512 ($20/mo) starts you out with 16gb of drive space.

Also be sure that you plan good your resource usage (HDD, RAM ..etc) which depends to the sites you are hosting.
You couldn't get their Linode 1024 but I expect you'll be fine with the Linode 512.
I would definetly go for a VPS, as it allow much greater flexibility.
The only limiting factor with Linode is disk space.
Unless your websites have a large set of special permissions migration should be pretty trivial.
I've seen a lot of cases where some not well optimized website runs nice on a shared hosting and after migrating to virtual server the performance degrads a lot....
Keep also in mind that a cheap VPS can perform worse than shared under certain workloads, like high IO.
You can get nightly backups, you can scale up or down with a single press of a button.
And...when the question is related to control panels....I would stay away from plesk(you can search the net for them, and see what I mean), preferring cPanel.
Set up a directory structure: /home/jsmith/website.com/htdocs (same with logs, etc)
They have better support, offerings, and pricing than any other Linux VPS provider out there.
Add a virtual host for the website pointing to the above folder
Even if it's kinda time consuming, my advise is to get a trial virtual server (I think that a lot of companies would give you a trial period for testing their services) and make the migragtion, than see how the sites are working (with a real traffic on them).
But you could always just install one if you really need it [/edit]
You don't get a control panel with it, but for basic linux admin Google / ServerFault are your best friends (plenty of how-to style guides on http://www.howtoforge.com/)
Anyhow greater flexibility means also greater responsibility.
You can get a server running for about Â£7 a month, it's 64 bit and it's all yours.
If you don't have any system administration skills (I suppose you don't have dedicated admin too) it would be better for you (and for your customers) to buy virtual server with a control panel.
Keep in mind that you can buy reliable server management from 29$/month, from third parties companies.
