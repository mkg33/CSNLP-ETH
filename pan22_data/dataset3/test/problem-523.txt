I tried running the below commands, but they failed throwing the "directory service error", I just because there was no server added:
- Installed WDS on the test server - it appeared under WDS.msc>Servers fine and I could configure it
I rebooted the server, then uninstalled WDS, rebooted again and reinstalled it, rebooted once more.
Also, after reinstalling WDS, the WDS service won't start at all now.
- Moved the test server to the same OU as the equivalent one
When I tried to add local computer I got the "A directory service error has occurred" error.
It was reported multicasting stopped working on all of them.
are pingable and the computer accounts have necessary privileges set in AD.
- other issues that always co-occured with he main one included: RSOP.msc would not open, gpupdate would fail with the error saying there was no RSOP data for the user, I was prompted for credentials when accessing network shares on other servers from the affected server, I couldn't add any AD groups or users to local groups (e.g.
- Uninstall all server roles (WDS, File Services and IIS)
wdsutil /initialize-server /reminst:[PATH_TO_REMOTEINSTALL_DIRECTORY]
- Configure WDS with multicast: https://keithga.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/multicasting-with-mdt/
- Manually recreate the deployment shares under file services
I made sure the multicast option was selected in the deployment shares' properties, but when I went to Windows Deployment Services in server manager, there were no servers showing there.
- Found an equivalent W2008R2 server where the above issues did not occur
- The issues didn't return after I moved the test server to the OU it was supposed to reside in.
WDS appeared again, but there was still no server under the servers node and I still couldn't add any getting the same error.
Remote Desktop Users), because they could not be found after I clicked "check name".
I have three Windows 2008 R2 servers with MDT and WDS installed.
However, moving the original affected server to the equivalent OU was not enough
I replicated and fixed the fault in test evironment first:
- set up a Windows Server 2008R2 VM (W2012 or 2012R2 were not affected)
The WDS service was running, though, and I was able to restart it, but it didn't help.
I still don't know the root cause of this issue, but it must have been something related to policies/GPO's, as the error implied.
I found a similar thread here https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/265b4b53-63ac-491f-817c-6030daa39b81/cant-start-quotwindows-deployment-servicesquot-service?forum=itprovistadeployment, but the suggested solutions don't work for me, as explained above.
I enabled tracing and when trying to start the WDS service I get a bunch of errors in WDSServer.log, but I believe they might be irrelevant, and all boil down to no server showing under the "Servers" node.
I searched the internet high and low, but couldn't find any information on exactly such an issue, so any help will be greatly appreciated.
It puzzles me that all three servers lost the WDS functionality, can it be something related to AD?
