The problem is  known as Monotone Boolean Duality or Hypergraph Duality and several enumeration problems are  reducible to this problem or equivalent to it (for instance the enumeration of minimal dominating sets is equivalent to this problem).
Currently there is a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that gives an $O(\log^3 k)$-approximation.
The following problem is known to have a quasi-polynomial time algorithm and it does not break any conjecture if in P. Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}:=(V,{\cal E}\subseteq 2^V)$, a transversal of ${\cal H}$ is a subset of $V$ that intersects every set in ${\cal E}$.
Also because there may still be some combinatorics sitting inside the algebra of GroupIso...
Approximating the Directed Steiner tree problem to within a poly-logarithmic factor.
Either says that ${\cal T}$ is the set of (incluion-wise) minimal transversals of ${\cal H}$ or gives a counter-example.

Although Ricky Demer gave lots (though certainly not all) details on this, there is an important point I want to highlight, esp.
If Graph Iso is in time $2^{(\log n)^{O(1)}}$, Group Isomorphism is then a much more immediately relevant obstacle to putting Graph Isomorphism into $\mathsf{P}$.
[1] I won't say "all" of the combinatorics, because the exponent in Babai's algorithm is most likely $> 2$, which would still leave a gap between GI and GroupIso.
Group Isomorphism (when given by multiplication tables) reduces to Graph Isomorphism, so the above was technically always true.
Solving the planted clique problem of distinguishing a uniformly random graph from the union of a random graph and a clique (of size intermediate between $2\log_2 n$ and $\sqrt n$), with success probability bounded away from 1/2.
It differs from your ETH-violating example of finding polylog-sized cliques in arbitrary graphs, because this is an average-case problem not a worst-case one.

More precisely, one can obtain an $O(i^2 k^{1/i})$ approximation in $n^{O(i)}$ time.
But when Graph Iso was way up at $2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})}$ it was so far from Group Iso's $2^{(\log n)^2}$ that there were clearly other obstacles in the way.
The best known algorithm is a quasi-polynomial time algorithm (the first is the one by Fredman and Khachiyan  http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jagm.1996.0062
(Not that there's not hard algebra in GI, but GroupIso is by definition about algebra.)
Related to this problem is the Submodular Orienteering problem and its special cases.
In particular, this would suggest that Babai's algorithm handles much [1] of the combinatorics of GI, and the problem is now down to hard algebra.
given the stated motivation for the question, namely:
