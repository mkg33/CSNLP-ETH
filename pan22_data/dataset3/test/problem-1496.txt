Correct me if this comment is too obvious or not relevant:
What you want is nearest neighbor scaling, but I doubt MS Word has an option for that.
I Need to take a screenshot of the whole Screen or go via IrfanView.
I have experienced that it is always better to prevent Microsoft products from trying to think what might be good for you.
ImageMagick's convert program can do it for example.
Note: if I use the built-in photograph tool in Acrobat Reader, then paste directly to Word, the above does not work.
It is probably the most easiest solution to scale the original images to 300dpi or whatever resolution you use during your PDF export.
If you want to scale it to 4 inch at 300dpi the target width is 1200 pixel.
It looks like Microsoft Word's zoom feature uses bilinear filtering.
then the crisp image I pasted reappears in place of the blurred one.
When I paste a crisp Image of, say, a page of text (I tested .bmp and .png) into a Word 2010 document (.docx) the result is a blurry version of the original.
This should not change the image itself, but only how it is displayed at magnifications other than 100%.
This is due to automatic resizing and Image processing done by Word, seemingly regardless of the relevant settings in "Options".
