I think the answer to your question is to be sure the data spreadsheet itself is correctly formated first.
But if you really want to continue to use excel and/or openoffice you might get around your problem by temporarily change the product numbers to something that definitely doesn't look like a date.
It seems to me that the solution is to be sure that the data fields are set up to interpret the data properly.
The next best thing would be to stop using openoffice and do that bit in java.
OO/Excel will be more likely to treat it as text and at least not mangle it into some bad date format.
Try enclosing the numbers in quotes as you process it through your java program.
For example you could surround the product numbers with some special string (that never occur in the product number naturally) that you then remove before doing the final export to csv.
If you could bring your supervisor to not use Excel, export directly to CSV.
Well the best way would probably (IMHO) to stop using excel and openoffice and do the whole thing in java.
I have selected a column, for example and set it's "type" and then added the data.
