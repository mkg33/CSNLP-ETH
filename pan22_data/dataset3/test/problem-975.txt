If you are looking for a replication cluster, the Galera cluster library enables multi-master clustering with MySQL: http://galeracluster.com/
I've found quite a few guides and am able to get replication working on two servers, (from what I understand, a master and a slave).
I'm looking for some help setting up MySql Replication.

If anyone can point me in the direction of a guide that could help me out, I'd be incredibly appreciative.
Of course, a Galera cluster is not invincible, and clustered databases have their own issues.
For example, Galera's structure won't scale writes very well.
Another solution is to use Oracle's MySQL Cluster itself, though the architecture is a bit more complex as MySQL Cluster partitions data across the database servers instead of simply replicating the data to every server.
See the MySQL Cluster FAQ to determine if MySQL Cluster is suited for your workload.
But I want my replication to work in such a way that there is a cluster that I can add database servers to on the fly.
Galera allows database servers to join and leave the cluster virtually seamlessly, and uses a quorum setup to handle the failure of one or more active database servers.
Severalnines has a good list of tips for running a Galera cluser: http://severalnines.com/blog/9-tips-going-production-galera-cluster-mysql
This also means you may have to restructure your data and/or applications, but  it allows MySQL Cluster to scale writes.
I've been looking around online to find a guide that explains how to set this up, but thus far I've not found anything helpful.
There are fully MySQL-compatible forks that have built-in Galera support as well, such as MariaDB Galera or Percona XtraDB Cluster.
Or if someone more knowledgeable wouldn't mind explaining to me the process that would be great too.
This is the guide I used to get the two server replication working:
