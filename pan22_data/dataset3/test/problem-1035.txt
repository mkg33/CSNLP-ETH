I am pretty sure it's something very little which I just don't see!
When you run from Java, the python interpreter knows that it's not connected to an interactive terminal and shuts down the in/out that you're using.
If I remove the line raw_input('') the input stream in Java will be readable but I just can't communicate with the script anymore.
I have a python script which is run by a Java Program with Runtime exec.
The two programs communicate quite simply with each other if the java Programm sends "go" the python script does something, once its done it returns "done"
And the java program Opens input and output streams from the Process.
Try using the -i flag to python to force interactive mode.
I am quite aware that this might be more of a Java/Python problem but it's on the RasPi and I also don't know if Java or Python is the problem.
Running this in command line works fine, it does just what its supposed to.
To use that flag, I think you'll also have to use ProcessBuilder in Java rather than exec as you've done, but you might be able to make it work with exec too.
If I run this and check for the input stream to be ready, it won't be, it will never be ready so I can't read from it.
