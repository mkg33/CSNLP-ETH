In other words, this is the third network Windows has been connected to.
Disconnecting and reconnecting the Ethernet interface can cause the interface to be renumbered when Windows thinks the network has changed.
This often happens when a laptop moves between networks.
As part of Windows Firewall, different networks on the same interface are automatically recognized and can be associated with different firewall profiles (home/work/public in Windows 7, private/public in Windows 8).
FYI, the name of the interface is actually the top label (Ethernet), the second level is the name of the network (Network 3) and the third label is the type of adapter.
On a home network, using a workgroup rather than AD, it is just the name Network and a numeric id that increases each time that Windows thinks the network has changed.
To rename the current network or to manage previously recognized ones, go to the Network & Sharing Center, and click the icon next to "Network 3".
The interface is named "Ethernet"; you can rename it using F2.
"Network 3" is how Windows calls the network you're connected to.
(Internally, Windows associates configuration to interfaces by their GUID, not name, so you can use any descriptive name you want.)
On a Corporate network, the network will be AD network name (such as Corp.Bigcompany.com).
