If making levels and puzzles bores you, then perhaps you should stick to being a programmer and stop making games.
If I get to a point where I think my game is pretty awesome and I want to start selling it, all I have to do is freeze the open-source portion of the project (yes, sorry guys), pay an artist or two to change all the art & sound, add some new features to make it "better" than the free version, and away I go.
All of the models on Google Sketchup can be used for non-commercial purposes:
Level and puzzle design is the very meat of game design.
Via procedural textures, Generative music and dynamically composing sound, you could not only create a style that's specific to your games, but "program your art".
Clearly this totally depends on the type of games you make, but I'm sure it could make some of the more tedious aspects more enjoyable.
Now... you may be thinking: "But I might want to make money one day!".
Game enthusiasts who aren't necessarily programmers are likely your best bet.
Have your code create a level, and you can fill in the details.
I always come across this blocker when I'm making games, particularly graphics, sound and music, so I'm going to focus this answer on graphics, sound, and music.
When all else fails, there's always the option of finding a partner who is interested in content creation.
There are thousands, if not millions of models that you can use for free from Google's 3D Warehouse.
If you have friends that play the type of game you're making perhaps one of them is interested.
Then Google Sketchup came along and changed the playing field for me (at least on the graphics front).
If you can force yourself to sit down and work on whatever it is, even if just for 5-10 minutes, that will break your barriers and get you moving on your project.
You can always use the procedural content as a starting point too.
There are significantly fewer restrictions on content that you find if your project is open-source (or strictly closed source among you and your friends).
FYI: I try to contact all of the modellers, thank them for their wonderful work, and tell them where I will be using it.
a writer, artist, someone who really loves puzzles, etc).
It is what separates a good game from a crappy game.
If that's not enjoyable to you, then you need a new profession.
It doesn't even have to be people who've worked with game creation, many people with a deep love of games have the potential to create great content depending on their other talents (e.g.
This lets me use free resources like Google Sketchup and open-source music and sound clips.
Perhaps you can attempt to create textures and sound through programming?
Seems like that's the best way to program AND create content.
