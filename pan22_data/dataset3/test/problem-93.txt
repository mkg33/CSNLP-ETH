Using NAT, the host (your PC) becomes the DHCP server and router for a private network which is created for your guest OSes.
Other machines on the network do not need access to the guest.
For some reason the host and the guest were giving me different IPs.
I need to be able to easily SSH into the guest from the host.
It would be nice to use a hostname, but a never-changing IP address would be fine too (currently, the IP changes with each new network I join, and the hostname has never worked).
However, I think the best solution is to suss out why name resolution isn't working for your guest VM :)
It is mentioned but to be explicit, I had to set the port forwarding port for 127.0.0.1 to 5679 and not the default ssh port 22, as that is already in use by the host's own ssh communication.
I had to go to > VirtualBox > File > Host Network Manager > vboxnet0 > Configure Adapter Manually > IPv4 Address
If you don't want to mess around with port forwarding, you can set up a host-only adapter which appears as a host interface and then add an IP address inside that subnet in the guest.
What is the best way to configure my VirtualBox network?
I'm pretty sure you can set a static address using NAT also...

You might be better off configuring your virtual NIC in NAT mode if you are moving around quite a bit.
I have a mac host, and a VirtualBox Linux guest, currently using Bridged mode.
