You can enter the URL for a site at LastPass Heartbleed Checker and it will tell you whether the site was or is still vulnerable, and when its certificate was updated.
This means there's a fair chance the websites you mentioned didn't change certificates because they did not need to.
Mashable.com has a list of well known sites, whether they were affected, and whether you should change your password.
You have to hope they did what they need to do (because it's the right thing, or even because they fear public humiliation) and if they did you can only hope they are open about it.
I'm afraid the key issue here is trust: there's no way objective way to verify which SSL libraries they use and used without inside information.
There's also a Chrome extension called Chromebleed that will warn you if you're visiting a site that's affected by Heartbleed.

Unfortunately, as you already stated, this does not tell you if they were.
Of course, you could always ask these websites if they were affected, I've seen a number of websites issuing public statements about this.
There are a number of tools and sites which can help you check if a website is vulnerable, for example:
So the best advice I can give is a piece of general advice: be careful what you leave behind on the internet and which websites you trust with your personal information.
Not every website uses OpenSSL libraries for HTTPS (there's also GnuTLS and PolarSSL for example), and not every version of OpenSSL was vulnerable (older versions were not).
They have a list of popular sites that have been impacted and when and where you should change your passwordss
Just looking at the dates certificates were issued doesn't tell you enough.
Asking publicly using social media like Twitter or Facebook often works.
Interestingly, none of the sites in the Banks and Brokerages list were impacted.
