Then I add each table one at a time and check the results again.
I am especially concerned when the number jumps up really high unexpectedly or goes down unexpectedly.
Do not ever use select * in a multiple join query like this or you will be returning much more data than you need and thus slowing the query as at a minumum the join fields are repeated (plus it is truly unlikely you need every field from 20 joins!
Don't stop with the first find, it is possible in a long query like this that you have multiple problems.
If it does then the inner join is appropriate, if  it doesn't then I need to decide if it is filtering records I should be filtering or if I need a left join.
Then I add the from clause and any where conditions on the first table.
You may need a derived table or a specific where condition to resolve.
When I am not sure why the record counts are off from what I expect, I use a select * (temporarily) just to see all the data, so I can determine why the data is off.
First I list all the columns I want on a spearate line and comment out all the columns except those in the first table.
When you are building complex queries, you should build them in stages checking the results as you go, not build one whole huge query and then try to figure out what is wrong.
I can almost always tell what the problem is when I see all the data.
I often check each inner join with a left join to ensure that I return the same number of records.
In the case of the number jumping up high, you may have a one to many relationship that needs further definition.
To find you issue, you are going to have to repeat this process.
In the second case, you generally have an inner join where you need a left join.
This is especially true if the field or fields you are getting from the table are almost always the same.
Start with just the from clause and the where condtions on it and add tables until you find the one (s) which are causing the query to eliminate all records.
The number of records went down because you did not have a matching record in the joined table.
Now I'm not saying it always bad if the record counts go up, only if they go up when you didn't expect them to or when the result set looks suspicious.
