Often you get then some more (better) recommendations.
Without knowing your exact statistics I can probably not give you a better answer.
I obviously have the resources available but I presume MySQL / Apache are limited in some way.
I would just like some general advice on settings I should be tweaking and things I should be doing to make the server run well.
This perl script gives you many recommendations on what configuration variables you could set or change.
I would say that switching to 5.5.x and InnoDB would be a smart move...
My problem is, things work very well for a while and then start messing up and just don't seem to respond.
I was trying to mess about with file descriptors on my other dedi box but ended up losing root access for some reason so only want to do this again if someone can point me to a VERY good tutorial.
MySQL's Opened_tables is at 15.6 million (that a a lot?)
This makes me think I have some options I can tweak somewhere.
Server Spec: Linux CentOS 5 with Plesk 9.5.4 and MySQL 5.0.
I have 16BG of memory and only 20% is used and my CPU usage is averaging about 2.0.
What I can highly recommend you is reading the MySQL Performance Blog.
Keep in mind that myisam tables are locked during insert or update so the select queries will wait.
Furthermore you should run this tool about 48 hours after you changed the variables the first time.
There are LOTS of select statements happening every 3 seconds as well.
There are really a lot of good articles (One I already linked to).
You can speed up inserts with concurrent inserts option but do not expect miracle.
Then you will learn about many new variables you can set.

I have about 150 cron jobs running that process between 6 and 10 inserts every 3 seconds.
I recommend you as well too look on the MySQL website for each variable MySQLtuner recommends you what exactly it is doing.
