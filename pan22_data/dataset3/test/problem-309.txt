You can deal with a primary key changing, but you don't want to.
If you create records in multiple (distinct) databases and then need to consolidate these records into a single table then you may want to use GUID as your primary key, since you don't have to worry about key collisions in the consolidated table with a GUID primary key.
Sometimes IDENTITY is an issue because of insert hot-spots, in which case a random integer may be necessary, but that is a special case.
Beyond that, when choosing a surrogate key you should use the simplest and smallest one which works for you.
You should avoid using natural keys except under very specific circumstances.
In such cases the risk of a change may be worth the reward of keeping things a little simpler by using a natural key as a foreign key.
A natural key is visible to a user and in most cases is subject to change or be duplicated.
An exception to this is something which is strongly regulated by an independent body, like country codes or currency codes.
