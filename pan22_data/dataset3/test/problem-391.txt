At my workplace, I can recover/restore a 350Gb database to any point within a 5 minute period for the last week using DPM.
File Shrink is only a tool to use sporadically when an unregular event occurs that overgrew your logs or DB files (infinite loop or such).
Don't forget that if you are to the point of restoring a backup after a major failure, you are probably already under a crapload of stress and pressure.
Then, you definitely want to get a powerful 3rd party tool (like DPM) that can handle backups (and recover from catastrophics events in a flash and minimal fussing around) alot faster and alot better than any script you can pull off the Internet.
For the rest, definitely look into Ola Hallengren's index script, and adjust the parameters to your needs.
Knowing how to use them in an emergency is another.
You don't need the additionnal burden of digging up and writing up flawlessly the RESTORE DATABASE statement with 12 transaction log files... And praying it doesn't fail you...
Personnally, I coupled it with a scheduled task that make it run for an hour each night with no rescan, so it handles the worst indexes every time, and force a full rescan of the fragmentation every saturday, or when all the indexes in the list have been defragmented.
If you have disk space pressure, shrink will only delay the inevitable anyway.
I tilted on your "data loss could have legal ramifications here" comment.
Lastly, I add my voice to the "don't shrink your files automatically, ever" group.
