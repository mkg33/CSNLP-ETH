You will always get the latest drivers from NVidia, as opposed to Windows Update.
You can roll back the drivers, or reinstall the drivers now that your updates are done.
I have run into the same situation with my Dell M6600.
There are a couple of options for Quadro (ODE, Performance, etc).
According to the Dell Re-Image Guide it appears you need to install either the "Control Point System Manager"  or the "Dell Feature Enhancement Pack â€“ DFEP"
In fact, Go directly to NVidia and either have it detect your chipset, or pick the most up to date drivers you want to install.
After some testing, I found that I needed the Intel video driver from the Dell site to make it work.
Go to http://support.dell.com, choose one of the three options on screen, then click "Drivers & Downloads" or the like, then enter your service tag (found on the underside of your laptop), then you'll likely want to select "All files for ... " that's in about the middle of the screen, refine the search results it gives by selecting your OS, under the title of "System Utilities" you should see something similar to "Dell Feature Enhancement Pack".
The Intel driver I had downloaded from Intels site doesn't support this feature.
Suddenly the dimming stopped working, I still got the popup icon on the screen though.
I am only guessing, but it could be the same situation for your model too.
