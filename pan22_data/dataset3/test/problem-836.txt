On next reboot check with hostname and hostname -f which should report ubuntu-sylario and ubuntu-sylario.example.com respectively
But, the alternative, if you don't want to buy or fake an fqdn (you could tell it you were foo.amazon.com if you wanted) is either to install from source (eg using life with qmail) or use something like qmail-rocks.
So, pressurise the BOFH wannabe package maintainer to take out this silly requirement.
And while they're at it, they could offer something useful in the kind of way exim installation does, such as asking if you want to use a smarthost (you probably do if you're installing on a machine without an fqdn, and you need to specify it in qmail's control file smtproutes).
You would need something like ubuntu-sylario.example.com, you can set by making /etc/hostname contain ubuntu-sylario and /etc/hosts to have (on the line containing either 127.0.0.1 or 127.0.1.1 if you use Debian/ubuntu and make sure it has FQDN followed by hostname, i.e: 127.0.0.1 ubuntu-sylario.example.com ubuntu-sylario.
The real answer is that the installer is demanding something that isn't needed by qmail, or indeed by smtp.
The problem you'll then get is that when you distribution upgrade your system it's likely to break your qmail installation.
