...which is basically just normal "Read And Execute" permissions limited to "This Folder".
That said, small-scale testing has been completely fine so far for users simply moving, copying, and removing files on the server and users completely working off of the server copies of documents, etc.
I have not tested this in production yet to see if there are any odd side-effects from paring down the "standard" well-tested traversal rights template of
They will be able to navigate through the top two directories and get to dir3 where they have more permissions, but will not even see what files exist in the top two directories.
You are mistaken in your original assumption, which renders the rest of your question moot.
This will most likely be problematic to your users, though - so I would recommend Traverse Directory and List Folders.
the permissions are set on that file/folder, but not necessarily anywhere else further up the file path).
The minimum permission that a user would need on dir1 and dir2 is Traverse Directory.
Permissions like Read & Execute and Modify are just collections of individual permissions.
Here are the results for those who want to lock things down tight.
Supplementary Info: The "Bypass Traverse Checking" user right allows someone to passively traverse to a subfolder, however many levels deep, that they have access to directly (i.e.
They're the first thing you see, because they're the most commonly used.
If there are no permissions at all for Bilbo on folder1 and on folder2, but Bilbo has modify (for example) on folder3, \server\folder1\folder2\folder3 will take him right there, no problem.
I didn't believe this when I was told, but testing proves it out.
Amazingly, if the individual has the full path to a subfolder on which they have at least R permissions, they require NO permissions on any of the parent folders, not even traverse.
(They must, of course, have read permissions on the share; just not on any folders above the level they want to access).
If you need to get very granular (like this situation), click the Advanced button and dig into the options listed there.
So I've been testing this in the following environment as I wanted get a final, tested answer, on the bare minimum required permissions for simply traversing folders via browsing (i.e.
This is counter to what I thought I knew of permissions in the Windows world, and I suspect will be a surprise to many.
