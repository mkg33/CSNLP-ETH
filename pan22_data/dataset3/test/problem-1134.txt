Also, I do not believe testing DB's out of the box with out of the box OS configs.
They are also the ways by which Oracle will support your entire stack.
They should be checking Oracle goodies for .NET either way.
if your server admins knows only Windows (MS-only shop) - you should use Oracle on Windows... or do you want as a DBA to maintain O/S, install O/S patches, handle O/S security, do O/S backups etc etc?
I suspect any performance test that says windows performance compares to linux is an out of the box test or the tester just doesn't know how to customize the combination of linux and oracle.
It would be silly to not consider that as part of the performance test.
Now, you can't be in a position where you're reliant on external support for basic day-to-day operational stuff.
If that is the way tests are being done they are not useful.
If you can do it all in-house, more power to you, but it's an utterly huge beast these days, requiring a lot of dedicated resources to get the best out of, so like as not you're going to be calling on external support a bit.
I think that would be Linux, but I also think you'll get decent support on Windows.
It's down to a combination of which platform you'll get the best support from Oracle (or other external support providers) on, and which you're most comfortable with yourselves.
In my experience for high performance SLA's I can find performance differences in different distributions of Unix/Linux let alone *nux vs Microsoft.
Than release the db in both OS's and see how close you are to your SLA's.
Those Os's offer more options to customize and that DB can also be customized for Linux to a greater degree.
Also, I'd be suspicious of your DBA advocating Linux; OS platforms should be somewhat outside of a DBAs remit.
Linux vs Solaris can be interesting in particular because there is a often a slower ramp up time for solaris to reach maximum throughput than many linux distros.
I think that Windows sounds like the right choice for your shop, though, since that is where your skills already exist.
But anyway, for your developers, accessing Oracle on windows or linux is the same, totally transparent.
In my experience Oracle can be very high-maintenance, meaning that the quality of support is utterly crucial.
On the other hand, and from the sound of things, your in-house skills are primarily Windows.
Most db's and os's can be customized to run better in different combinations.
Based on that alone I'd definitely be leaning towards Windows.
When you have the option to support both, clearly define SLA's for your app.
However, in case of mixed shop, I usually recommend Oracle on Linux for various reasons (some might be subjective):
Every performance test I have ever done I have always found ways to make Oracle on some *nux version  run orders of magnitude faster than windows.
The general rule is that Oracle is best on Solaris, then on Linux, then on Windows.
So which platform can you get the best external support on?
If you pay Oracle's own consultancy group to come in and design a 'turnkey' system for you that involves a DB there's a 98%+ chance that they'll install it on 'Oracle Enterprise Linux', which is their own rebranded version of RHEL.
Oracle now owns Solaris and repackages their own Linux (a clone of Red Hat / CentOS.)
