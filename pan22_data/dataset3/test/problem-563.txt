This will give you the locking query, how many rows/tables are locked by it etc.
will show all process currently running, including process that has acquired lock on tables.
If you use InnoDB and need to check running queries I recommend
Is there anyway to show all the locks that are active in a mysql database?
But no query is going on right now and nobody is waiting for a lock anywhere (yet at least).
Clearly the transaction above holds a lock, because the transaction is still active.
Also see this link for more information on using the innotop tool.
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_LOCKS is empty, which makes sense given the documentation, because there is only one transaction and currently nobody waiting for any locks.
The suggestions in the other answers so far won't help at least.
You can use INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TRX, performance_schema.events_statements_history and performance_schema.threads to extract the queries that any active transactions have executed in the past as outlined in my other answer, but I haven't come across any way to see that someTable is locked in the above scenario.
AFAIK there's still no native way in MYSQL, but I use innotop.
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS is useless: someTable is not mentioned at all
Disclaimer: I don't have innotop installed and I didn't bother.
None of the answers can show all the locks that are currently held.
It's free and has plenty of other functionality as well.
The problem with using SHOW PROCESSLIST is that you won't see the locks unless other queries are queueing up.
SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST is empty, because the culprit is not actually running a query right now.
