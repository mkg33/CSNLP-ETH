You should be able to modify the solution to fit your needs.
I will show you how, using a slightly different example.
Using the INDIRECT function and a bit of workaround you can actually extend the lists without touching the formulas.
I used a very simple condition that will only look for "b" but of course you could expand upon this idea.
(Lets' assume that my animals table starts from a1)
In order to make the first drop down (as you figured out), select it, goto data -> Data Validation.
In order to make the sublist, do it similarly but put a conditional statement in the souce field this time:
I can create the first combobox, but how to display in the second one only the Type related to the Family?
The first list are simply the inputs for the first combobox, the other two are sublists depending what has been chosen:
and I have another table where I want the user to select with a combobox the Family and the Type with comboboxes.
Overall the soltion for you is to add conditions to the data validation selection.
