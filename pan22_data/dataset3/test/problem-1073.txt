*PS cert:\currentuser\authroot> gci | where subject -like "UTN"*
It looks like you are using PowerShell Vs.2, that version had no support for the new where syntax.
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidArgument: (:) [Where-Object], ParameterBindingException
Peter Hahndorf has already answered this, but I wanted to expand on the error message you received:
Where-Object : Cannot bind parameter 'FilterScript'.
Cannot convert the "subject" value of type "System.String" to type "System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock".
You need to put curly brackets around the expression and refer to any properties with the $_.
Be sure to read the error messages and try to interpret what they mean.
when i am trying to execute the below PowerShell command, i got error .
This is saying that it can't convert a string into a scriptBlock, which implies that where needs to be followed by a script block like so: {code here}
