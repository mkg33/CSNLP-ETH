I've setup a bunch polycom equipment, they have very high quality hardware.
Every single factory, warehouse, and office we've worked with has it or is willing to get it.
But they need a slew of open ports for communication and management and lastly their pc software leaves much to be desired.
This does have some advantages, and I am considering that approach, but in my initial investigation, that looks expensive, inflexible, and proprietary.
It seems that Polycom best suits your requirement because of your exclusive video conferencing needs.
You might find this blog post about video conferencing with skype from Leo Laporte useful.
The rooms each have Tandberg Edge or MXP video units, I'm not looking at PC-based solutions like Skype or iChat.
It has serial control for the Tandbergs and an IR interface for the TV (if it does not have serial control).
Unfortunately, you'll probably need to spring for a NetLinx.
Since breaking partnership with the company we used to communicate with, when video calls come up we've turned to skype.
Have a look at one of the smaller 5" panels (http://www.amx.com/products/MVP-5150.asp) - the WiFi version is easy as pie to integrate with the NetLinx (just put a new WiFi AP in with a crossover cable to the interface, no need to touch the corporate network) and should provide a consistent user experience.
Anyone aware of an Open Source or Commercial product that takes advantage of the readily available web APIs, some simple touch screen PCs, and builds a product that is more like skinning an AJAX web app, and ideally more cost effective than the proprietary panels?
I have hacked together "solutions" running x86 Windows CE of questionable licensing integrity, but these usually end up sources of constant frustration as nothing ever works "quite right".
I have done quite a bit of work with AMX in the past and swear by it - but the only reason I use it is because I have never found an open source alternative.
Other alternatives for web video conferencing are RHUB, WebEx, GoMeetNow, gotomeeting etc.
I don't know anything about the internals, and there have been a few hiccups now and then.
I'm looking to improve the user experience in our video conference rooms, by simplifying the things users do all the time (setting up a call, muting and unmuting, panning and zooming between a few room-appropriate presets) and totally taking away the functions that we don't use or that are more likely to ruin the experience (changing the brightness of the TV, using the VNC presenter mode).
Unlike the costly polycom equipment and its video quality is outright amazing.
It's not the cheap way out but there are cheaper ways to approach AMX than going all out :)
My last couple of Places of Employment have used Polycom, which is more COTS, but interacts reasonably well with SIP.
On the other hand, the Tandberg video units I'm looking to control are  very thorough XML API (PDF), so some of the integration magic that Crestron and AMX consider to be a value add, I could reproduce at mashup speeds.
The classic way to do this would be to plunk down huge money for an AMX or Crestron panel.
They have a smaller version now (http://www.amx.com/products/NI-700.asp) which would probably be more suitable to your needs rather than springing for a NL2100 or something overkill.
Unless you have a need for advanced features (multiple endpoints for example - which we've solved with multiple machines), a laptop with a camera with skype can take you very far.
