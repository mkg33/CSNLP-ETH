Sometimes an idea is really awesome, but hard to reconcile with the rest of the system.
I also look at single things which could swing the battle in radically different directions, in terms of experience - it may be worth changing them.
Are there any parts where they could get bored, or where things spiral out of control?
If you can't follow it at this point, before the implementation intricacies, then it's probably going to be a bit much for a player (remember, you know it better than anyone!).
I usually write systems for pen-and-paper RPGs, so bear that in mind when reading this.
Rather than discard it entirely it may be worth smashing it to bits, working out why it works, then rebuilding it.
Look back at the chart and make any changes you think fit.
This is not the combat cycle, but a map of dependancies.
Next, I like to think of how the player interacts with the situation.
Another thing is to plan out how quantities such as strength, damage, action points and so on link together.
First, I look at what kind of experience I want to create.
Could a lucky hit lock the opponent down completely?
I like to jot down a few ideas for containers, data structures (well, the pen-and-paper implementations of them), and ways to tie these back to the feel.
Make up values that feel right, or use placeholders.
More complexity can be added later, as can more subtle differences.
