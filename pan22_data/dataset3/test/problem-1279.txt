For a public facing load balancer (one in a public subnet), your instances in your private subnet will go thru the NAT Gateway to the public side of the load balancer.
I want to use other listener in another port (10443 for example) for my internal microservices, only my servers must be able to connect to these servers.
I created and configured the ALB listener and rules.
I'm using an intenet-facing AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) with a ECS cluster(docker), and I want to use it for forward web standard and internal web services traffic.
I'm not using service discovery because I have to use another DNS service (not Route53).
The application load balancer has a listener for 443 port, it's used for the standard https web connections, it works well (I'm able to connect through browser).
The only way for connect is allowing connections from everywhere on lbSG for port 10443, but it's a bad security practice.
With these configuration my servers can't connect to the port 10443 on the load balancer.
This means that your security group needs to use the IP address (EIP) of the NAT Gateway.
