Is that correct, or did the last character get cut off perhaps?
A power outage isn't protected against; that's why you use UPSes and keep backups as well as using RAID.
You'd better find a specialist instead (in case you value them, of course).
I would try the remaining backup superblocks, just in case.
Ideally you'll be able to take a backup image of the current state of the disks; that will reduce the chance that further changes will damage the data irreparably.
Other than that, you might look for disk recovery software.
Now â€” never do anything to the array (fsck, and so on) until it's fully repaired.
(I could add small chunk size and NOT using LVM-2 as disadvantages too, but they do not strongly affects overall status, of course.)
From your description and the errors, it looks to me as though there are some serious data corruption issues.
      Used Dev Size : 1465135872 (1397.26 GiB 1500.30 GB)
Had a power failure and now my mdadm array is having problems.
         Array Size : 8790815232 (8383.57 GiB 9001.79 GB)
And I would strongly recommend you not trying to recover the data by yourself.
The one thing that looks odd to me  is the inclusion of /dev/sdb instead of /dev/sdb1 in the list of RAID devices.
Remember, RAID protects against a very specific issue; limited disk failure.
