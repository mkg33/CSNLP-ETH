If yo don't know what am I talking about simply try to create a ftp only user on OS X Server.
Other problem could be for example adding another extension into PHP.
Let's not forget this also gives you snapshotting in case you totally fubar something, and the ability to take full backups or copy the machine for development elsewhere, a major plus.
There are other solutions (Ubuntu, CentOS etc) which are way cheaper and in the most cases easier to setup.
being a big Apple fan (since 1992) and OS X admin I wouldn't recommend OS X based server for pure web/ftp/email hosting.
How can I set-up a Mac computer to be used for a production server?
I believe Mac computers come bundled with an Apache server, can this be used for production?
I've never used a mac before so I'm not exactly sure about this:
SANS publishes a guide on secure Apache installations on Macs here
This may sound like a lot of overhead, but my mind keeps thinking of having to build this and that from source and I'd personally much rather have the package management tools of Ubuntu or CentOS for installing and maintaining applications.
A client wants me to make a website for him and host it on his Mac server.
OS X Server excels in integration of services and user accounts which comes to mind in the service bureaus, labs etc.
Is there any program that allows me to set-up a production-ready server on a Mac?
Any Mac you buy today probably has enough horsepower to do this.
Yes, you can probably do this, but if it were me I would run Virtual Box or some other virtualization tool and run the website in a CentOS or Ubuntu machine underneath OSX.
The website is obviously going to be created with PHP and MySQL.
