Your clone might not be working either, but I'd try the cables first.
Can someone please point me in the right direction?
In case you need to know, my computer is an ASUS m51ac-us004s.
The BIOS sees the new hard drive, but it just won't let me boot from it.
Everything seems OK and Windows sees my new hard drive.
I just bought a new 3TB hard drive and installed it in my computer.
I'm a newbie when it comes to UEFI and I suspect there is something I'm missing to allow it to boot from the new drive.
Switch the SATA cables and let me know if the other hard drive becomes bootable.
I went and downloaded Farstone's DriveClone to clone my drive.
What I'd like to do, if cloning isn't possible, is to just start from scratch and reinstall Windows 8.1.
Unfortunately, I do not have any DVDs for Windows.
Currently I'm running Windows 8.1 with a 1TB hard drive.
My issue is, I go to reboot my machine and enter the BIOS (its an UEFI BIOS) and I go to the boot menu to select which drive to boot off of and the only option my BIOS is giving me is to boot from my original 1TB drive.
What I wanted to do was clone my current drive onto my new drive, then boot off my new drive.
