Try ls -lZ /etc/init.d/rc5.d/ to see the scripts' contexts
If so is it turned on and is the context of your script the same as the other start up scripts?
There should definitely be a way to do what you want from the /etc/rc*.
With vixie-cron it's possible to specify tasks to run on reboot with the @reboot keyword in your crontab:
It's also worth checking /etc/inittab to ensire that you're booting into runlevel five by default, look for a line like:
you should have your link named S99something, where S stands for starting, and 99 stands for the order in which the scripts in that directory are started.
Search for "vixie-cron specify tasks on boot" on Google, and it's the first result.
As mentioned in the article, it's a great way to allows users to run commands at startup without granting them root access.
Besides: you may want to rework the script to honour start / stop arguments, and add a K99something symlink to make sure the services are properly stop when leaving this run level.
The above table is from a blog post by Jeremy Zawodny which I'm not allowed to post a link to as a new user.
* files that are run at different parts of the startup.
On RedHat derivatives (like openSuSE) runlevel five is the default when running X11, runlevel three is the default to boot to the console.
That's from my debian laptop and shows that I boot into runlevel two by default (which is debian's default).
Another alternative you might want to look into is cron.
Have you tried adding a call to the script in your /etc/init.d/boot.local?
Try getenforce to see if selinux in installed an turned on.
There is a pretty good explanation at Cool Solutions as well
