If you control the server and the SSL/TLS certificate, wireshark can import the certificate key file, and decrypt the packets.
Depending on the server configuration, you may not be able to even login to the mail server with SSL/TLS disabled.
In other words, IMAP can access the e-mail headers, but they aren't specifically IMAP headers.
IMAP doesn't have "headers", in the way that I think you're thinking of them.
As Wil says, the IMAP command-set is rather large and complicated.
Can I also see the headers when I login to an IMAP server using telnet?
Those are the headers that are most useful in terms of tracking down where an e-mail came from and reporting it for abuse.
What are the headers of the Internet Message Access Protocol?
E-mail headers are a part of the message itself, which IMAP can give you access to.
You may have to disable SSL or TLS to be able to view these connections.
When people talk about e-mail headers, they typically mean the e-mail message headers (RFC-822/RFC-2822 headers) and not "IMAP headers".
As far as using wireshark to view the headers, this is likely to be complicated by SSL or TLS.
Running Wireshark while I retrieve my emails with Outlook & IMAP, would give me the headers of IMAP, right?
