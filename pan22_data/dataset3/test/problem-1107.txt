In 286 protected mode segmentation was extended to introduce protection and extended the physical memory supported from 1MB to 16MB.
It's a pretty complex topic, and I don't think a concise overview over the x86 memory management architecture can just be given within a superuser answer.
But the CPU still only had 16 bit registers which meant that any contiguous block of data larger than 64KB was problematic to process.
But Linux would configure all segments to start at address 0.
All of that changed with the introduction of the 386.
If you run a modern CPU in 16 or 32 bit mode it still supports segmented addresses for backward compatibility.
I'm afraid I can only ask you to read an article on the 386 and operating system design for x86.
But in 64 bit mode you only have 64 bit linear addresses and paging.
It only used segmentation because that was required to control some of the protection features.
Does 32 or 64-bits CPU use segmentation addressing on Linux?
When AMD designed the 64 bit CPUs they decided that some historical features would not be supported in 64 bit mode.
I know on older CPUs like the 8086 used segmentation for memory addressing but not sure if this method is used on 32-bit or 64-bit CPUs for Linux operating system.
Originally (before the 286) segmentation was mostly a hack designed to make it possible to address more than 64KB on a 16 bit CPU.
CPU registers were extended to 32 bits, and paging was added as a new feature.
However, segmentation is not one of the terms one would use to describe that architecture.
The 8086 didn't really have an MMU comparable with what modern x86 CPUs do; with 386 and later on, things were radically different:
One of the things they did was to enforce a segment start address of 0.
So at that point segmented addresses were no longer supported neither by hardware nor software.
Linux use of segmentation was minimal, some of the protection settings were controlled through segment descriptors which meant that you could not completely avoid the need for segmentation.
Linux was originally designed for the 386 and made use of the paging feature.
In other words: Linux never used segmented addressing.
Paging was a much more powerful way to map between logical and physical addresses than what was achievable with segmentation.
