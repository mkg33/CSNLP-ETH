If you cannot do that, then you are out of luck -- unless you want to get a USB serial cable and use the Pi's serial port, but in that case, it would make more sense to get a USB ethernet adapter.
Presuming you have a wifi adapter for the Pi, you can then set one or the other up as a wifi hotspot and have the other one connect to it.
I can't connect via an ethernet cable because my macbook doesn't have an ethernet port.
Or - use a smartphone with hotspot, Fing (to scan for the R-Pi IP and scan running services) and JuiceSSH (for the SSH bit)
Since you can't use an ethernet cable, the Pi 2 will have to have a wifi adapter.
Of course, you may find it easiest to set the Mac up as the hotspot instead.
The adapter must support access point (AP) mode; most of them do.
I've successfully connected through a shared network, but I want to connect to it in a place I don't have a router/switch available.
Note that much of that may focus on sharing internet, which obviously you don't have to be concerned with; you are going to end up with a network of 2.
This will allow you to watch the system boot and run commands.
There are many tutorials online and some Q&As here about setting up the Pi as a wifi hotspot.
I'd suggest a USB to LAN adapter (very cheap on eBay) and set static IP addresses on both devices.
I've spent days trying to figure this out and am at my wits end, and I can't seem to find a solution anywhere that specifically solves my problem of not being able to connect via ethernet with a pi-2.
If you've ever shared your phone's internet access with a non-cellular device, this is exactly the same idea, except no one will have any internet to share.
Near the top should be a list, "Supported interface modes", which will include "AP" and/or "AP/VLAN" if the adapter is hotspot capable.
I'm trying to SSH into a RPi from a Macbook Pro so I can run commands on the pi without hauling around an extra keyboard, monitor and mouse.
They are slightly more expensive (say $20 vs $10) but ethernet will be much, much, much better than a UART (serial) link.
It requires you hoot up the adapter to the header pins.
