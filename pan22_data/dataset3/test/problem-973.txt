I often send emails with inline screenshots and they always looked exactly as the source PNG.
In my experience this will preserve the image as a PNG file in the outgoing message.
I never had a problem with screenshot quality in Outlook 2003.
To use Word as the editor select Tools -> Options -> Mail Format and then click "Use Microsoft Office Word 2003 to edit e-mail messages".
The issue is not with the exchange server itself, it's with the outlook text editor.
But unaltered pngs that are pasted inline will be preserved, both in sending and receiving emails from outlook.
Do you have the full Microsoft Office 2003 suite installed?
This isn't very helpful, but as far as I know, as one who sends a number of screen caps, there is no way.
Blurry is okay (since I've zoomed in a lot), but artifacting is not:
If so, you can use Word 2003 as your editor and use it to inline the PNG image.
Now, open a new message, click into the body of the message, and click Insert -> Picture -> From file.
Here's a simple test of emails sent through the outlook client.
Anytime an image is modified using the outlook editor, it will get automatically converted into a JPEG once sent.
At home I use XnView Don't know if that helps but could be worth a try.
Outlook/Exchange always converts it to jpeg, and I haven't found a way yet to change that.
I use Irfan View and copy the images from there and paste them into Outlook.
Since you're using Outlook 2003 this won't be very helpful for you but I've found that Outlook 2007 doesn't convert inline png images to jpg.
Note that I have only tried this using Rich Text messages and haven't experimented to see what will happen with HTML messages.
