If it's RHEL 5 or 6, then don't use any of the two LSI controllers in virtual machine definition.
See this VMware KB article for the supported configurations and migration procedure.
In my case I needed to change the controller for the root disk from Paravirtual to LSI Logic SAS.
Second step - Shut down your VM, Attach a 1 GB disk using the SCSI controller type you'd like to change your root disk to and bring the system back up to modprobe discover it.
To resolve this, you'll need to rebuilt the initrd file using the following procedure:
Can anyone help with this as I am unable to find much information on it and really dont want to rebuild the machine.
Third step - run the following command to add the correct driver to the RamDisk (Remember in my case I was moving from the VMWare Paravirtual to the LSI Logic SAS driver.
If you need to revert for any reason, simply boot back into rescue mode and revert /etc/modprobe.conf and the initrd-*.img file, then reboot.
The problem is that, when the system boots up, an initial ram disk is created from the contents of a file which contains certain drivers the system needs to continue booting.
I have a VMWare Redhat machine that I need to change the SCSI controller on the machine from a  LSI Logic Parallel to LSI Logic SAS.
You may not need to do this second step, I did it in the theory that the disk controller would initialize itself if introduced to the system through an additional disk, just like you'd do for Windows:
The LSI Logic SAS virtual controller is really only there for Windows 2008 to allow for clustering.
If that initial ram disk file doesn't contain the drivers for your system, the system will not able to boot.
It's likely you are going the opposite way, but you just need to change the driver type:
Whenever you are working with disks, it's best not to involve snapshots.
Change the controller for the root disk to whatever driver you just added to the ramdisk, and boot up the system.
I have done this through vmware, but now when the box tries to boot it kernel panics saying that it cant mount /dev/root
First, if possible, clone your machine, don't snapshot it.
After doing this, shut down and remove the 1 GB temporary disk.
In RHEL 7.x this is a bit different as modprobe.conf doesn't exist.
As the previous posts suggest, this needs to be done in two places, the regular disk and the RamDisk as both will need to boot with the new driver.
