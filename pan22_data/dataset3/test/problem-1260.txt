Just boot from the CD, and look for it in the menu.
Why not install VMWare for free and run it as a virtual machine?
Use SysrescCD which comes with gparted and huge amount of other hd utils.
This will make the 'slicing' procedure less prone to failure and loss of data.
You should also make sure you have a valid backup first.
Microsoft's Virtual PC and Sun's VirtualBox offer free virtualization solutions which provide quick and safe ways to "install and try out" systems/installations without hacking up your system into little pieces.
It allows you to resize partitions without reformatting.
Please give serious consideration to installing virtualization software.
Although this tool seems to go overboard in being "safe", if you were to lose power or something in the middle of a critical step, you could lose access to everything.
As mentioned in other posts - you should defrag your windows partition from within windows before doing this.
As another users has already pointed out ideally i would tidy up the hard drive partitions before this.
The home edition is freeware and it often compared to Partition Magic as a free alternative.
I would also recommend running a defrag program to tidy up the data pieces on HD.
Also you can buy Acronis Disk Director Suite and repartition your harddrive using it (it's also great tool but it's not free).
You also can install Gentoo linux using it (you can install gentoo using almost any live cd with 2.6 kernel).
You should take a look at EASEUS (http://www.partition-tool.com/).
I would recommend Partition Magic however as previously stated ensure you back-up your files.
I have seen some people create seperate partitions for page files and programs but this always seemed excessive to me.
Most live linux CDs have a "Partition Manager" or gparted that can do this for you.
