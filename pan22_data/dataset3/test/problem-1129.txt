If you can't manage this, then you'll probably have to contact Google.
GMail actually gives you more protection as they do verify that you have access to the mail account before they start Sending As, there's absolutely nothing in the original mail protocols and SMTPs to stop this.
My ISP still allows this with absolutely no issue on their SMTP server and Thunderbird as a mail client (though I'm sure even Outlook let you change the sending address).
Even if you remove the "google mail send as account" thing, email protocols are not really secure enough and it's easy to forge an email with the sender address you want.
He is still able to send emails from his gmail account that appear to the recipient as from ourcompany.com.
That's why google doesn't even bother, with this features I guess.
You'll need to find some way to revoke the verification required for him to send emails like that, which would have been part of the initial configuration he did :
At the very least, you need to get him to remove the option from his account which hopefully would mean he couldn't re-verify it.
An employee of ours set up his gmail account to send emails as employee@ourcompany.com, which was fine, but now he has left the company and we have disabled his company account.
Of course even if you solve this from the GMail angle there's nothing to stop him setting up a standard POP3/SMTP account somewhere else and going into his mail program's options and changing the send as address.

Is it out of the question to just contact the guy and ask him to change it?
