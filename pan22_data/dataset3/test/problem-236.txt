Buying donuts, yelling at people on the phone, and going to a manager are all appropriate actions in this case.
I've inherited an intranet site that gets hit by hundreds of different users per day.
This will end up causing a lot of work to support.
If you don't have admin rights over your users computers, I would replace the homepage on the old servers site with a download link and instructions to run your script.
The guy that built the site and ran it was supposed to be getting this done in March, but put it off until he left the company and now the admins are all over me about it due to deadlines.
They all know how to get to the page, simply type http://oldservername/site and enjoy.
I would also try to get all documentation that has the old server name replaced with the new one.
They don't want to cname, they don't want to leave the old server on once the new server is deployed, and they don't care much because this was supposed to be done in March.
My only strategy would be to create a script that adds an entry to the users host file.
I told the admins this is far from ideal and asked for some DNS love and got shutdown.
A little information about the hosts file can be found at http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/
If we shut down the old server, http://oldservername/site (the site everyone has bookmarked and has been running for over 10 years and is listed in all kinds of random documentation and SOPS), no longer works.
If this is not an option (I am not sure I can accept it, but I will try to move on).
I just found out about it all this week and going back in time is not an option.
We've got the site moved over to the new server and all is well.
If you have administrative control over any of the machines you can simply over wright or append to the host file.
They would have to use http://newservername/site to get to the same page.
The problem is that the old server is getting retired, and they want to do it ASAP.
So without a cname, the old server still running with a warning page & redirect, or a time machine, what are my options?
It sounds like you already have a counting solution, but if not add a counter to the old website so you can see and more importantly communicate with your bosses how many users will be affected if the machine is shut down.
