I'm at a loss here, I've scoured search engines followed guides and nothing seems to make sense here, for one how can a route to 127.0.0.1 go to 2 different addresses?
(The same is very commonly done on the Internet, with hundreds of DNS domains resolving to the same web server's IP address.)
If I'm missing configuration files, comment and I will add.
* server running right next to each other using the following:
The only interesting part is in how Apache distinguishes between HTTP requests belonging to different domains – this has already been repeated on this site, but the short answer is that browsers include the domain name within the HTTP request (by adding a Host: HTTP header).
No, the hosts file should be interpreted the other way around: Two different names translate to the same 127.0.0.1 address ("if you want to reach py.localhost, contact 127.0.0.1") – like two people sharing a phone number.
This does not affect IP-layer routing at all; it's still the same 127.0.0.1 no matter how it was obtained, and packets to it go the same way.
