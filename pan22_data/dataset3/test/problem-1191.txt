You can do this dynamically with a routing protocol, or statically with static routes configured in the routers.
Router 1 has interfaces on both networks net1 and net2.
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.2.250 but I get the error RTNETLINK : no such process.
You need to have routing set up on the routers so that every router which is on the networks of the two hosts knows how to reach the other network.
Static routing doesn't scale, and it can't automatically respond to changes in the network.
The whole point of routing is that the routers know how to reach the other networks, even if they aren't attached to the networks.
In the diagram below, why is it that I cannot ping host 2 from host 1?
This would work if each host's gateway was Router1, but that may not always be the case.
Does host 1 have a default route via router 1, or a specific route to host 2's network via router 1?
The only thing i guess, you need to do is to add a route on host1 and 2:
Router already knows hoe to reach the two networks, Â´cause it have directly connected.
What rule do I have to add to the routing table to tell router 1 that it can access net 2 on its 2.250 interface?
Does host 2 have a default route via router 1, or a specific route to host 1's network via router 1?
I am trying to set up communication across a network, and I have run into a bit of a problem.
As you've provided no useful debug, it's difficult to guess what's going on, especially as your diagram mentions many devices, but we're only interested in three of them - two hosts and a router - simplify the problem for yourself, and you may find it easier to work out the solution.
