One thing I haven't seen mentioned so far is that Such a system isn't just for ingress filtering, but also egress: having a box dedicated to ensuring what leaves your network is at least vaguely legitimate is something you probably want to consider at some stage.
All this can be done in other ways, but it can be useful to have a box that makes this easier.
Since Server1 exposes software to the world at large, that's definitely a consideration, I think.
The application / server is the more important element to focus on.
Currently, if Server1 is compromised, you may not be able to find out what left the network, or to where.
Either solution (router or firewall) may provide other functionality, not necessarily 'purely' security related, that still makes your service more resilient (a means of doing load-balancing, packet inspection, null-routing, etc).
Adding something that can do a first layer of filtering is not without its advantages.
If you have a secret to keep do not store it in any format, including ink on paper.
Router ACL's can turn off / disable unnecessary types of traffic to the point of protocol and port number.
Edit: should really read all other comments more thoroughly before making rash statements.
Whether you need a router or a dedicated firewall is another matter.
Also remember that security also includes availability of a resource (see DDOS attacks).
A router removes that issue to a point (until, of course, the router/firewall is compromised.... turtles all the way).
