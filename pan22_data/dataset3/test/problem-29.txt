The reason you are being "blocked" is because Windows now has "Aero Snap" which, allows any [native] window to be snapped to an edge of the screen.
So to circumvent this problem, Microsoft decided that it would be best to block the blocking only if the cursor was exceeding a certain "speed".
It appears like Windows thinks that I want to "snap" the window to the side of the origin monitor and won't let my mouse cursor cross the boundary to the destination monitor.
Thus, avoid stopping close to that edge or increase your cursor speed.
I am using Actual Windows Manager with Windows 10 and it has settings to replace the standard Windows 10 snapping with your own custom windows snapping features.
If so, and if you are not dragging the window very slowly, this might actually be a bug.
As @Mik has said, it is all about the speed of your cursor when dragging the window.
Right click on desktop -> Display Settings -> Multi-tasking -> and turn off the top slider.
Is it snapped to the right side of your left monitor?
When I attempt to grab the title bar of a window and drag it to another monitor - I have two side-by-side monitors - Windows frequently prevents it.
After enabling AWMs snapping features this is not an issue any more and my UI elements only snap how an where I want them to.
If you move a window slowly towards (or do a brief stop close to) the edge between your two screens, your chances that Windows will think that you want to snap that window are high.
If you move your window more quickly you won't have this behaviour and you'll barely notice the small circle that is displayed when snapping.
In your screenshot, to the left of it, there is an open window which appears to be snapped.
This is due to the "Snap" feature, if you don't like it you can simply turn it off.
If you move really fast, Windows won't even display that circle.
The Aero Snap feature cannot work properly if there is no blocking.
