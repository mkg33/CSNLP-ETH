Mounting /var/lib/docker as a separate partition is common on docker hosts.
And for the more granularity, a loop device may be created to mount a fixed size file with it's own filesystem.
These all have the advantage over ulimit in that they limit the total filesystem space, rather that the max a single file can grow, and they only limit that volume without limiting other directories inside the container.
From the perspective of the process inside the container, the different volumes are different mounted directories, and limits apply to all filesystems.
The size limit is applied to the process and it's children, not to the filesystem itself.
Each of these options needs to be configured on the host outside of docker and then the volume mounted from that restricted environment.
Filesystem quotes may also be enabled if the filesystem supports them.
Typically, if a sysadmin is concerned of disk space usage by a container, they often isolate the volume to a partition on the host of a limited size.
I don't believe I've seen anyone limit the max file size with ulimit, but see no reason it wouldn't work.
