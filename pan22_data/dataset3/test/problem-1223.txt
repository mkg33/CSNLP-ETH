The best solution is to configure and run ntpd in daemon mode.
Would there be any side effects for syncing up the clock to the correct time?
You may have problem at the first sync: apache logs will contain some "duplicate" entries.
From my research it appears that the best way to change it would be the command:
If you do sync with a ntp server regularly (ie every day), you won't have any problem.
This is a Fedora 7 (yes we are upgrading soon) web server with apache and php on it.
There will be the ones from "old hour" and the ones from "new hour" so yous statistics won't be accurate for this timeframe.
I am having an issue with the time on a production linux server being 2 hours fast.
To install, set the clock, and run ntpd you can issue the following commands:
Provided your clock is not too far off the time server, 1000 seconds by default, then your clock will slowly be adjusted.
Maybe you just have the wrong timezone configured on the machine.
I need the time to be accurate for a particular project I'm working on, but am a little nervous to change it, as I'm not sure the ramifications of this.
Of course, since your clock is more than 1000 seconds off, you will have to manually set your clock the first time.
