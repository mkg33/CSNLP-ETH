Copy seems to disregard the selection and copy the whole image instead.
Same thing happened to me, the non-Python build is broken on OSX.
To see the pasted image, zoom out to see the whole image!
So clicking on the pasted layer only showed the copied area.
You have to install the one with the extras, current link is http://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/Download.html .
Merely closing and re-opening the image wasn't enough.
Quitting the program and restarting it solved it for me.
If the entire image is copied and pasted over the entire image then the result will be no change, which may be what you are seeing.
I know it's an old thread but here's how I sorted it.
Possibly you need to use 'Copy Visible' not 'Copy'.
I'm having this issue too with Gimp 2.8.10 on OSX.
[No idea what happens when layers are selected but not visible, or vice versa; in previous experience it has been important to ensure careful selection of layer(s) whenever something doesn't behave as expected, but I found this problem with a single layer.]
I was zoomed in the lower quadrant of the image and GIMP pasted the clipboard onto the top-left corner.
[GIMP seems to have a strange idea of what a selection is for the purpose of copy and paste, amongst other misnomenclature.]
