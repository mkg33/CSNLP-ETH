It's very easy, just press WIN, type 'cmd', then press ctrl+shift+enter.
Launching a PowerShell window as an admin user (and I'm not talking about run as administrator here) and entering 'explorer' or 'invoke-item explorer.exe' will launch the window but with only user rights; however, typing 'CMD' in that same PowerShell window and then just 'explorer' will work.
Note: This does not work in a PowerShell window and I've no clue why.
You want to go back to the Win XP days where everything runs as Administrator?
GUI applications should all invoke UAC, so there's no need for this hack in that case.
Whit this enabled you should be able to run a 2nd copy of explorer.exe elevated...
There is an option in the Explorer "folder options" to run every new explorer window as a seperate task.
The normal "Run as Administrator" is by default ignored for Explorer.
You're basically destroying the purpose of the account division as far as security is concerned.
As to the original question if you are running the ENTIRE shell with admin rights you might as well log in with an admin account and be done with it.
You're giving up all the security gains made by Vista and Windows 7.
But there is a nice workaround if you don't need these elevated permissions very often:
What I'd recommend is running explorer as a separate administrator account.
then everything you launch will be launched elevated.
You can modify and delete protected files and you can change ownership to your standard user.
So if you start Notepad as Administrator and open the "File Open" dialog, you can use it to manipulate files with Administrator privileges.
The file dialogs (Open, Save as, ...) of any Windows applications are nearly complete Explorer incarnations, and they inherit the user rights of their application.
Not something you should do normally, but if you need to then you need to.
If you need to run command line apps as administrator, simply open an administrator command prompt.
mspaint with the runas command (runas /user:yourdomain\youradminuser mspaint) and then go to file - open.
As far as I know you can't create an account like this, but if you log in as "Administrator" (Not merely as an account that is a member of the Administrators group - that's not good enough.)
Or even simpler, you can make a shortcut to cmd, and in the settings set it to 'Run as administrator'
Most people don't know this but there's a check box to always run PowerShell windows as administrator so you don't have to always shift-right click and select it (since most of the stuff you do in PowerShell requires admin anyway).
It is correct that starting with Win 7 there is no simple way to run Windows Explorer with admin privileges.
