(You could then create A records for each subdomain in the DNS, each pointing the same IP ... or better yet, using CNAMES.)
Is there a reason why Name based Virtual Hosting isn't an option?
DNS as far as A vs. CNAME when it comes to host headers is irrelevant.
IIS will then know where to send the site based on the DNS name.
at least with IIS, you can use host headers to detect which web site should respond based on a DNS name.
So if you want IIS site 1 to respond to sites such as "testsite1.com and www.testsite1.com" you simply add those into the host header of that given IIS site.
The 10.x addresses are the internal addresses, and as you mention, DNS won't help you there.
Typically what we do with IIS, is we create an A record for the servername it self, and then we use CNAME's to forward to the servernames A record.
Then on a second iis site, you could have "testsite2.com and www.testsite2.com" asigned and IIS will pickup on those domains.
Do all the servers respond to the same external IP address?
