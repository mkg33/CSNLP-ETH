For 2 drives, RAID 0 and RAID 1 are the available options, RAID 0 being the faster one.
By I/O I mean the data read and written to hard drives.
I suggest that besides RAM, invest on higher RPM hard drive (or drives and set them up as performance RAID devices).
15000 RPM scsi disks are what you want in raid 1 or raid 10 configuration (RAID 5 and 6 will be significantly slower for database ops).
The speed you're interested in most is random seek time, not read write throughput, because database operations are many small reads/writes, not continuous streaming.
Yes, you should be able to at least double, but .. judging by the current stats you're listing, I don't think RAM is even your biggest problem.
There is RAID setup for performance, RAID setup for fault tolerance and RAID setup for both.
As for hardware, as Matt said IO operations are what you want (but that's not the same as the MB/s stat listed for drives).
Probably schema changes will do more for you than beefy hardware if you really need to do 15K inserts per second.
Solid state drives are another option to look for, but if you're wanting 15K inserts per second or more, they might be too slow.
You should be more interested in the I/O speeds of the HDD.
