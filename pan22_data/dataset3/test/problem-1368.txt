Use the RAID10 for any database/app stuff, then the RAID5 or RAID6 for file storage.
Unless you want to become a hardware expert, I'd first of all suggest software RAID.
Never put a production machine into the wild without disk level redundancy!
If you need to go higher volume, then RAID 5 is the next best option, although you will sacrifice some write speed, especially for your database.
If you're concerned about that, it'd be best to try it out with your hardware and software.
The key point to performance will be setting your stripe size, which should be configured based on the size of data you plan to store on it.
Too much info on that to go into detail here, so Google is your friend.
If you can, I'd configure two separate logical volumes... one RAID10 and one RAID5 or RAID6.
Something like a HP MSA 70 and P800 controller - or similar.
The appropriate RAID level depends on your data volume.
It's much easier to set up and manage than hardware RAID, and for a medium-traffic site like you describe it certainly performs just as well.
I'd buy a 6Gbps SAS-based dual-PSU DAS box with lots of 300GB 2.5" 15krpm disks and a quality matching hardware-RAID-10 capable disk controller.
If you can afford it and the data fits, you can't do much wrong with RAID 10.
