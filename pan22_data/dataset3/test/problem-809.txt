Also, viewed from a vocational lens, there is a quite reasonable shot that they won't actually need the things we think they will.
It's not easy, but it's possible to get kids really excited about learning all sorts of things.
We have seen this issue come up in other questions and answers.
I am pretty sure that every sort of learning is either inherently interesting to that particular learner, or is being learned to further something else that is the actual interest.
Ordinary school subjects must be taught regardless of interest because they form the basis for further learning.
First of all, what they will do for their work seems very abstract and far-off.
this is an activity the student does not want to do.
Some students love school and think of it as a place where they can thrive, but some others are a little broken and burnt out, or feel unsafe either about approaching difficult topics, or about their surroundings, and these problems can make intrinsic motivation very hard to tap into.
Add into the mix the speed at which the world seems to be changing, and our predictive abilities just get worse and worse.
To get students to have intrinsic motivation I argue that a teacher should never use rewards.
Learning to apply these ideas to your classroom is hard.
There are a few things that the students need to know, and these should be directly taught and modeled at every opportunity.
So in my class only those students who have completed their theory homework can take part in practical lab sessions.
If someone is interested "because they enjoy it" (reason #1), then that would play out regardless of money being involved, or social support or anything else.
Once the beliefs above are in place, we can actually do the work of motivating the students:
They might not be going into (or might not think they are going into) the careers we are thinking of, and in any case, jobs are so heterogeneous that to make almost almost any statement of what work requires nearly meaningless.
These attitudes are not sufficient by themselves to motivate kids, but if they're not there, nothing else is going to go right.
If they are interested "because they have to make a living" (reason #2) then that means the student is learning something in service to some other goal.
Various lecturing staff suggested treats, days out, cinema vouchers.
This means that the subject is a primary interest.
The problem that I have is to determine how to instill a primary interest?
It is the Great Divide of motivation, and people on either side cannot seem to understand the folks on the other side.
Perhaps by breaking down the issue of Motivation in to these two sides, we can make some headway on it?
If you watch some videos of amazing teachers (YouTube is an incredible resource here), you can watch this motivating work taking place at every grade level and in every sort of classroom imaginable.
The end-goal is to help kids feel safe to try their best, that the ends are actually achievable, and that the material connects to their current world.
For a student that is motivated, extension exercises are a good reward.
People, including kids, are intrinsically motivated to learn when conditions are right.
For some (like me), the subject must be interesting for its own sake, for others, some external motivation is good enough.
But we have to get a lot of different elements all moving in the same direction, and for some students, this is easier to manage than for others.
Now the student reasons that the barrier is there because the activity has an intrinsic reward so great that the barrier is worth overcoming.

Any clever student will reason that if a reward is offered for completing an activity then this indicates that without the reward the student might not do the activity i.e.
Let's start with a few ideas that have to come from the front of the room.
Students, at least in grades k-12, are not terrifically motivated by what they will "need" in the working world.
Watch an amazing third-grade music teacher, and then watch an amazing 11th-grade math teacher, and their practices will seem very different at first glance, but the core underlying ideas are actually the same.
They should not be part of the general curriculum, pushed on everyone as 'literacy'.
I am a big fan of Bem's theory of self perception when it comes to student motivation.
On one occasion I attended a staff meeting where the Head of Department asked how we could reward students who tried hard.
The OP lists "two motivations in life", which perhaps are universal.
I said "extra homework" which made everyone stop short, but I was right.
But non-ordinary subjects, like Programming or Computer Science, should only be taken up by those who either are inherently interested, or can clearly draw a path through them to another goal.
