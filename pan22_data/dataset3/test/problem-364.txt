In your case it can't find the file because the php-fpm process doesn't have permissions to read the file.
I created a file named index.php in /home/user/index.php.
That's right, you don't need any execution permissions for a PHP script (unless it's a CLI entry point).
The only problem I have is with linux permissions to files/folders.
If I create now a file index.html, or index.htm - nginx works in a browser!
Well, the question is what are your file permissions?
Hmmm, that's really interesting for me, what did I do wrong?
This way the web server will be able to "cd" to this directory and read the php file (providing it has read permissions to it)
Then apply the following permissions (assuming /var/www as root for all websites, which is best practice imho):
The reason for this is simple, PHP scripts are not executed, they are parsed (read).
Next it needs to go into "user" dir, and as nginx user is in user's group, so nginx can make a next step to use "g" permissions (user/ dir permissions) to come in.
And it doesn't that for displaying the .html, which is obviously only read, not executed.
Now everything should be fine for anything that you execute with nginx, PHP, and php-fpm and that's below /var/www.
Ok, I did "usermod -a nginx -G user" and changed permissions for "user" dir to: 750 (so now nginx belongs to user's group, and can read or execute contents of the user dir).
The process simply can't find any PHP file at that location.
Nginx said (/var/log/nginx/error.log) that I have no permissions.
It's generally a good idea to use the same user/group for nginx, PHP, and php-fpm if it's your server and nobody else is messing around.
But what is making nginx can't see index.php (and sees index.html and .htm)?
Firstly, my nginx configuration is well done (for me - i.e.
The interesting fact is, if I change user dir permissions to: 755 (from 750), nginx sees index.php.
I'd like to get some answers or suggestions to my problem.
Wanted to answer over at Stackoverflow, but your question was closed to fast, glad you moved it here.
Ok, maybe my knowledge has some bugs, but I need to ask, why does it happen?
yeah.. now I want to create index.php, to write some code.
If I understand correctly, nginx goes first through the "o" permissions into /home dir (r-x).
Because you're running the php as a cgi, it probably needs the a +x for the group on the .php files, which it probably doesn't have int he normal case.
Try changing the permissions of the directory from where you serve your files to drwx--x--x (that's 711).
Primary script unknown is reported by php-fpm and almost always a problem with the path that you pass (from nginx) to php-fpm.
