I am by no mean an expert on TS, but here are a few points comming from my experience :
And I'd guess it would be hard (impossible) to connect and use local (like USB) hardware with Terminal Server?
Particularly with the Windows 2008 Remote Desktop Gateway.
On the cost side, the equation is not as straightforward as it might seem.
One advantaged others have not mentioned so far is that having a Terminal Server environment makes it pretty easy to setup remote access.
Setting up users to be able to work from home or a remote location is pretty easy.
You still have to pay licences for the clients, and even if you now only have one server to manage and not a bunch of workstations, the job is more difficult and require more qualifications...
Or for testing (we have access to old versions of Windows / IE).
There's nothing you can benefit from with a TS system that can't be acheieved by good sysadmins in a non-TS environment but it can be easier for a less skilled/experienced sysadmins to manage a TS system.
I do know a few companies which have vitrualized all workstations, but it seems to work much better when you have simple requirements.
Where I work now, we use TS for some simple applications that are only rarely used by everybody.
What else are the reasons for or against switching to Terminal Server?
Some things I can guess: easier administration (don't need to install/update office/stuff on 20 computers but only on the server).
What are the advantages of using a (Windows) Terminal Server and thin clients instead of using a normal Server and full clients?
Pros - tight control of the environment, generally easier to have good security, system consistency for users, generally easier to do code updates.
Cons - generally lower performance from a user standpoint, often tied into one vendor's systems (i.e Windows).
Easier backup (no need to backup client computers).
So far I've only really used normal servers and clients, but now customers ask about terminal Server, and I'd like to know pro's and con's of using them instead of an "old-fashioned" client-server network.
