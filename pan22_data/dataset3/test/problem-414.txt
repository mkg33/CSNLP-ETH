If I change the setup of one router to match the 192.168.2 network, but start the IP range at 100 so its 192.168.2.100 would this fix this problem?
You have to tell your computers how to talk accross your routers.
I have 2 routers in the office currently, Router 1 has the ADSL modem built and no wireless and Router 2 is mainly for the wireless connections but there are wired devices connected.
Flatten out your network so that you only have a single IP space.
I'm currently on the server trying to see the other computer on the network but I can only see computers on the 192.168.2. network.
I'm currently facing a small problem regarding a new network setup.
I have a few desktop PC's and Ethernet printers that all need to be connected via an Ethernet network.
You probably don't need to have the separation there.
I'm afraid you shouldn't use routers for your needs.
I have a desktop PC plugged into Router 1 along with 2 Laptops via Ethernet with the IP addresses being 192.168.1. and the final Ethernet port connects to the WAN port on the back of Router 2.
The same goes for the desktop PC's - I can only see computers on the 192.168.1. network.
How will you NAT people behind your wireless router ?
I have a windows server 2008 R2 plugged into a Router 2 with the IP address of 192.168.2. using 2 of the routers Ethernet ports and 2 printers in the other 2 Ethernet ports.
Make sure that there are routes between the two routers and then set up DNS.
Or is there something else I could try without having to change IP address's about?
Turn off DHCP on Router 2 and hook it up so that it's acting like a WAP and switch, don't use the WAN port on it.
