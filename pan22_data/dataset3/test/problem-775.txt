If you're using different DNS records on the 2 DNS hosts, it's possible some of your traffic may go to unexpected IPs for a time about equal to your TTL setting; you should be prepared to deal with traffic continuing to go to the old IPs for a short while.
As long as the MX records are not changed, no, your emails will not be lost.
If the new DNS host has the same A, CNAME, and MX records as the old provider, it's extremely unlikely you'd even have any connectivity problems; your hostnames will resolve to the same IPs before and after your change propagates.
You will not lose any data stored on other servers by changing your DNS.
Your DNS provider (unless you're using bundled services) has no control whatsoever over your actual web and email services; the wording there is incredibly stupid.
At worst, the SMTP server that tries to send email to you won't be able to resolve your domain name's MX records for a while, but all that happens is that the emails get queued on their side to be retried again later.
