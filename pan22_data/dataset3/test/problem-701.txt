Check the Hide spelling errors in this document only.
In previous versions, the right-click pop-up on a misspelled word would allow me to ignore all spelling in that particular document.
Uncheck "Check spelling as you type" and "Mark grammar errors as you type".
For Word 2013, if you want to ignore spelling errors for a particular document while still check spelling errors for other documents, you can go to the Exceptions for: section at the end of the File -> Options -> Proofing section.
But it's not there anymore and I can find no reference to being able to do it, neither in the app nor online.
Your current document should be selected in the drop-down as default.
Should be an option to turn off grammar/spell-checking for your document.
file-> Options-> Proofing-> Exceptions for: -->  check[ Hide spelling errors in this document only] (& if you want to ignore grammar errors also then) check[ Hide grammar errors in this document only]
Here is a view of the settings windows (with relevant options highlighted).
