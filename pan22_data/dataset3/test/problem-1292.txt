I checked the result in GParted and the disk information shows
From my experience, letting btrfs take over a whole disk with no partitions will not result in proper logical/physical sector alignment.
According to this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Btrfs#File_system_creation  the default block size is 16KB.
Perhaps I should just create a disk-spanning BTRFS-partitions on both drives, that is aligned and then use those in RAID1?
BTRFS is extent based and it does file packing (multiple files in one block) inodes are alocated dynamically.
for both drives, which seems wrong, since normally GParted aligns the first sector to MB, which would have a first sector of 2048, as I have seen for a BTRFS partition I created on another disk (but I am not sure).
So, considering I couldn't find anything, can I trust BTRFS to just 'do the right thing'?
I had planned to use the whole disks without partitions in the following way:
Since I am keen to get it right the first time before copying data to it (yes it will be backed up), my question is whether it needs any special considerations regarding sector-alignment and size for Advanced Format disk.
BTW: Is there any pros/cons of using whole disks vs. partitions I should consider?
In the past I know I had to take care of this, when setting up MDADM+LVM and ZFS (ashift=12) for example, but I cannot find any information for BTRFS regarding this (apart from SSD-specific stuff, e.g.
I've tried this with 3.14.1; latter versions may do this differently (current release is 3.18.x).
I want to set up a BTRFS RAID1 setup with two WD Red 4TB disks, which possess 4K sectors.
My suggestion is to use properly aligned GPT partitions and tell BTRFS to use a 4K sector size with mkfs.btrfs --sectorsize.
Hope someone with some experience can help me out.
