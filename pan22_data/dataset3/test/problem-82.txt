Not just if a zombie sees you, but perhaps if you wandered an area you could leave a 'scent trail', putting a zombie into the LOST state?
This will be fairly "realistic" (as far as zombies go) because players usually don't look at enemies for a long time (they usually run from them/attack them).
Instead, you would want zombies to do things like:
If there's enough of them the crowd will fill in any dead ends and force the additional zombies to go around so they can actually get to the character.
You may be over-engineering it, a basic implementation is just a state machine with a state "Shamble" which will cause the zombie to move around a bit (checking it won't hit walls and such perhaps, or stay out of the light etc, it can be expanded upon) and a "Follow" which will cause the zombie to move toward a player (maybe using path finding like A*) and attack him/her if the zombie gets to close.
I'm taking all my zombie-related facts from the Zombie Survival Handbook.
I'm pretty sure a simple state machine would be useful - either WANDER, FOLLOW, OR LOST.
Something interesting may be to have different target checks.
This second one could have an area-of-effect radius, giving a swarm-type pattern since all the zombies will end up in one area, and then move as one.
Or if you fired a large weapon, the zombie would be attracted to your position in the LOST state?
As for implementing, it wouldn't be much more than having a check to see if the player has been seen, then some very dirty pathfinding - quick and dirty rather than something like A* - a zombie isn't going to go the optimal route - and a state machine.
As for the target searching, each zombie could have a field-of-vision check.
A stereotypical zombie would be very stupid - so it wouldn't need AI for things like:
If target can be seen, change state and set the direction to go.
Just make sure that your random walk does have some form of obstacle avoiding - I really hate it when enemies just run into buildings for ages.
