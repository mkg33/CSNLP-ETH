A simple solution might be to use something like disk2vhd.
VHD files can also be converted so you could boot into a VM compatible with Vmware hypervisors, Virtual box and other popular visualization tools.
I already have multiple backups of the server on disk from the past but they are through Simpana Commvault.
It will use VSS, but you should stop most services for the best results.
One mildly crazy-seeming option would be to boot up a Linux live disk and use dd to make a bit-for-bit copy of the entire drive.
I know the built-in Windows backup is great, I just don't feel like running it for a restore job on this.
Run it as an administrator and it will create a partition level or disk level backup, either to a disk image file or another partition or disk, and skips empty space.
I believe I can use robocopy just fine, but I'm not sure if it will grab the Windows directory, system files, and full user profiles correctly even with the /ZB option.
Is Robocopy /E /ZB /COPYALL /DCOPY:DAT /MT:32 /R:5 /W:5 /LOG:copylog.log the way to go here?
I'd like a backup that will simply copy the file structure, ACLs, timestamps, etc.
I'd like an option where in the future it won't require a program to run a restore.
It's small, simple, free, and in my experience very very useful.
If you are using this, you may need to use something else.
This way if someone says "I need x file on the server you decommed" I can search the external drive real quick instead of firing up Commvault, cataloging, restore, etc.
This will create a VHD file, which a drive image format that is compatible with Hyper-V, and can also be directly mounted on Windows 7/2008 R2 and above.
This is not the fastest method, since it doesn't know to skip over unused blocks, but it is guaranteed to get everything.
I have a Windows SBS server with about 500GB of data that I'm decommissioning but I'd like to take a final backup of the server and place it on an external USB drive.
The one issue I have found is that disk2vhd does have some issues with the Windows software RAID.
I'm a big fan of SelfImage even though the homepage is dead and you have to download it elsewhere.
As with all backups verify it by attach to it on another system.
It works without Linux, without a reboot, without nagging about open files.
