From much of my other research, temperature has been an issue but I have a pretty good cooler on it and lots of case airflow.
If that does not solve it, remove the video card, and re-install the system*.
My temps from "SpeedFan" never really seem to climb above 45 from my monitoring.
I have ensured that I have the latest drivers for that and everything is plugged into it correctly.
If there is sound going when the freeze occurs, typically whatever the last noise was will just play at a constant rate.
* instead of re-installing windows, just download some linux live-CD or live-USB image and run that directly from the media.
Also, I just remembered that in between some of the complete freezes, there have also been BSODs.
When I say freeze, I mean that nothing is responsive on the computer, CTRL+ALT+DLT doesn't respond and even the lights on my RGB keyboard stop moving.
I seriously and sincerely appreciate any and all help with getting my computer back to a working fashion.
I have since taken out my old RAM and have in only the new RAM where at first I had added the new to the old to double the memory amount.
The time of use before a freeze seems pretty random but it typically doesn't last more than a couple of hours.
I don't really think you get BSOD because of temperature, the computer just shutdown on those cases.
If the problems come back up, I'll perform the steps that y'all provided.
I have performed an entire clean install of Windows of this PC because in my trying to fix this issue and fiddling with things, I broke some registry values which were really screwing things up.
The only thing that I have been able to do to get it back is to physically hold down the power button till is shuts off and then it comes back up without issue.
Again, thanks for the help on what looking at now was a pretty crappy post haha!
I have tried many things to get this fixed but I am pretty much stuck and now at the point of looking at buying an entirely new rig, which I can't even afford right now so I'm willing to work to test out any debugging and troubleshooting routes that you have to suggest.
I didn't have that in very long before I swapped more components so I don't really know if freezes happened right after this.
I upgraded quite a few different parts so I'm not sure what was the thing that lead to this issue but now my computer reliably freezes whenever I use it.
I would usually put some more in there but it was a moment of hurried laziness before I went on a long trip.
I still don't feel 100% in the clear but I do believe that the new RAM was my issue which makes sense because my symptoms pointed to memory issues.
Run without the driver, then with the driver and see when it fails.
I have a pretty old built PC that I was recently upgrading.
From my earlier statements, I talked about upgrading which is the Delta here so I'm sure that somewhere in there lies the issue.
I first got a new graphics card, a Gigabyte Windforce 760.
I don't remember what they said but they do happen every once in awhile.
since you got BSOD that is either memory corruption or bad drivers.
I swapped them out this morning and my PC has been running for a couple of hours without issue.
Thanks a whole whole lot for all the suggestions and troubleshooting steps.
I would start by resetting BIOS to factory defaults, as the most common cause for memory error is overclocking or custom voltage.
Now that I'm back, I did actually realize that I made the stupid mistake of keeping the new RAM in instead of going back to the old RAM that I knew worked without issue.
