So only when you use Sketch and only when you press "command" the Y axis will be reversed (the zoom)
This means for scrolling, if finger goes DOWN, content goes down.
So I explained him the problem and within a week he manage to fix the "Sketch" problem for all the types of mouses (including magic mouse)
I bought a sketchApp License, I got a bad headache and finally I understood that the problem was the reversed behaviour of zooming that makes the program unusable.
Hi I found the solution both for a normal mouse and Magic Mouse 1 or 2, thanks to Marc of "Smart Scroll" http://www.marcmoini.com/sx_en.html
Even if I de-select natural (that is not an optimal solution) in that case EVERYTHING will be reversed, except the zoom.
The definition of apple 'natural, scrolling is: 'content tracks finger movement'.
For ZOOMING it means that if finger goes from USER to SCREEN, content is pushed away (ZOOM OUT) and if finger goes from SCREEN to USER content is pulled (ZOOM IN).
Settings for: "Sketck" >> so it will affect only sketch.
If you use a normal mouse with scroll, you need to edit  "scroll weel +" while if you have magic mouse you need to edit "multi touch +"
