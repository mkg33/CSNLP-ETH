He has found that they are roughly as reliable as 1TB drives.
Like (hard) disk drives they are made from multiple sub-systems and components, and can fail in multiple ways.
Talking to sites that use many SSDs, they found that SSDs tend to fail catastrophically, compared to HD's that degrade gracefully over time.
Therefore, it is much more likely that you will not loose data but, if you have unsaved documents you won't be able to save them (in the worst case scenerio).
I think all newer SSD drives (anything beyond 1st generation) are designed to still be readable but you will start to have problems writing to some blocks which I presume SMART will tell you.
This article published July 2011 talks about SSD failure modes: http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/ssds-are-fast-but-do-they-last/3621  .
(Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) systems that disk drives use to keep track of problems, and (if queried by the BIOS/OS) alert you of potential failures.
Sounds much better than using mechanical drives which (in my experience) tend to fail mechanically which results in catastrophic failure.
What I have heard is that ssd's fail on write and not on read.
