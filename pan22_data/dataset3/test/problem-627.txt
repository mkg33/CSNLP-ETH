As far as I can see, I would need to install to the NAS mount point, right from the start.
The device is fully sufficient hardware-wise (as I verified using the "Live" environment), except for one thing: The internal storage (~4GB) is not big enough for a full-blown installation.
(Like, wrapping the NFS mount in some way so the installer "sees" it as a block device?
I am about to install Linux (Mint) on a first-generation Eee PC.
Trying to search the web, I found lots of advice installing from NFS, but none for installing to NFS.
That shouldn't matter that much - it wouldn't be the first network-booting system in my home network that relies on my NAS storage for its root filesystem (the first being a Raspberry Pi happily doing its chores).
However, the installer dialog only shows me /dev/sda partitions to chose from, not mount points.
However, with the Raspberry things were different - I had a fully functional installation, which I merely copied over to the NAS, tweaked the bootloader, and there you are.
