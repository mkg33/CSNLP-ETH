$docker tag my_api asia.gcr.io/firebase-mytalk/my_api:latest
So the GCS bucket corresponding to gcr.io (or whichever GCR domain you want to use) and the desired cloud project must already be created and your GCE instance's service account must have the necessary role/permissions for push operations.
From the Before you begin section of the instructions you referenced:
$gcloud docker -- push asia.gcr.io/firebase-mytalk/my_api:latest

I launched one VM giving same IAM service account access.
I faced this same problem when I was trying to automate GCP kubernetes deployment using Jenkins by putting image in GCR and I created one service account giving admin permission in gcp IAM.
after the bucket is created add to its access control the GCE instance service account's role/permissions for push operations
