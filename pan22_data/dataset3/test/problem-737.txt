should I even bother to do all of that, or would you just recommend to get a raspberry and start working?
There is no way to emulate VC4 and hence the 3D and vector graphics capabilities or even the hardware media en-/decoder.
I am a decent Linux user looking to develop on raspberry, I don't have one yet.
I was thinking of a raspberry3b whose emulation might be hard on my cpu, since it is just an Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU E4500  @ 2.20GHz (don't judge me, it works... hard to think that my work PC is barely superior to a rasp T_T, or even smaller, not sure how would you match a quad core @1.2Ghz.
The cheepest way to use GPIO is to buy a Raspberry Pi Zero and use it as USB-Gadget like described on raspberrypi.org.
You can only emulate the CPU, not the VideoCore VC4 or GPIO.
Regarding the communication ports, all I need is the GPIO emulation (besides the access via terminal of course) and again, my naivit√© tells me that they are just serial ports which could be emulated from my debian environment.
to have a virtual raspberry?, In my naive mind it isn't but that's mainly because I haven't really done anything like that before, I could learn tho.
because it would take me a while to get my hands on one.
Is it hard to use qemu or something like it to emulate the processor?
In my mind the ideal workflow would be to startup a virtual rasbian instance,  connect to it via terminal and develop away, test it out by and somehow emulate the GPIO pins and finally move the result to an SD and plug it into the pi.
I've seen that there is a x86 virtualbox version but I don't think that anything compiled on that environment can be transferred to an actual raspberry.
