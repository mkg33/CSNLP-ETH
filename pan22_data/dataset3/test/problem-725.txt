Set up all your frame and window sizes and positions the way you like it, and type Control-c s, and your layout is stored.
This includes all window sizes, number of window splits, and what buffer is in each window, and where each window is on your desktop.
I was wondering if there is a way to mark certain frames in a split window emacs session as inviolate to changing.
Third option: here is a solution in elisp (you could just evaluate it in the scratch buffer to try it, and add it to your .emacs if you like it)
I would like to mark the latter frames somehow so that they will never be split or have their contents changed by emacs.
One option could be looking into how gdb-many-windows works - this mode is very aggressive about preserving a specific window layout.
I normally have 4 frames for sources files and 2-3 frames for other views such as compilation/grep-find/etc.
Then type Control-c f to recover it if the layout gets changed.
Also, it is possible to save a frame / window configuration to a register, and to retrieve that configuration from the register later.
I made these key bindings just to reply to this question just now, but I like them enough I am actually going to be keeping them in my .emacs now, thanks for the great question.
This way if I click on a search result I don't have my compilation window splitting and a source file inserted.
I want any source files to go in my source windows and to stay out of my misc-view windows.
