Click the Office button > Word Options > Advanced and click on Show document content.
For instance, in the file word\document.xml there is something called <a:blip r:embed="rId22" r:link="rId23">.
Unzipping the docx-file and rummaging around in the xml-files within I saw that some images was linked to websites that were since long gone.
Strangely enough I can right-click and Save Image As... to get the image out as a JPG/PNG file, and if I view that file it's fine.
As soon as one scrolled to one such image, a placeholder would be shown or with older Word it crashed.
After opening a few documents that are about a year old, a lot of them show blank placeholders for some of the JPG/PNG images.
Is there a checkbox for Show picture placeholders?
Also, in the Read Layout, they show up fine, but not in the Print Layout.
What I did however, is make a powershell script that simply removes the r:link="rIdXX" altogether.
I had placeholder images in a lot of older docx documents, unzipped the docx, removed all instances of r:link="rIdXX" inside the document.xml with a regex search and the document started working again.
But even if I try re-insert those images, they're still blank.
Word 2016 would only show placeholder images and sometimes crash.
In my example it looked like this: <Relationship Id="rId23" Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/image" Target="http://servername.se/images/series1/image.gif" TargetMode="External"/>
A user of mine had this problem recently, what happened is that when opening documents in Word 2013, the document would crash Word.
The r:link is defined in word\_rels\document.xml.rels.
The best thing is that the images are still stored inside the docx-file so once I did this, the document was restored to its original state with all images working and Word 2013 stopped crashing.
So, with this information, one can either try to fix the document or delet
