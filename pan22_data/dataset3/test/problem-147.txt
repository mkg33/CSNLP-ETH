1- It takes too long time (days or perhaps months!)
Now unfortunately I forgot the password, I remember that password was something like "The C++ Resolvents" or "The resolvents of C++ exercises" or ...with upper or lower cases.
I would make a list of any and all words you even suspect might appear in the password, then use a shell script or a C program to generate the permutations and try them.
2- I think they do not support spaces between password, while I'm sure there are at least two or three spaces in my password.
Does any one know is there a quick(er) way to recover my password?
You have to use brute force option which may takes months.
It is nearly impossible to break a rar password with off the shelf programs.
I know there are some tools to recover .rar file passwords such as  RAR_Password_Unlocker and so on, but:
to recover that long password and my machine should be On during this time!!
Then saved all of these source codes into a folder, added it to a .rar file by WinRAR tool with a specific password and saved that file into my USB flash.
I have a book about C++ Programming that two years ago solved all of its chapters exercises successfully.
