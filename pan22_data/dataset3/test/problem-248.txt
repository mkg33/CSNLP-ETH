I used it myself to simulate/optimize network traffic between Germany to India - but in my local test environment.
I've used VMWare simply because I don't know of any alternatives.
It's a utility available as a bootable iso or a VMware appliance.
With it you can create networks using and test your software on actual hardware.
On its own ESXi (or ESX) wont allow you to directly replicate things like intermittent packet loss, networking issues related to routing problems (these are switches not routers) and latency but you can build VM's into your design that will allow you to replicate those issues if you want to go that far.
On an ESXi host you can create up to 127 virtual switches each with up to 1016 virtual Nics and up to 4096 Port Groups (VLANs) per ESXi host.
The Emulab project at the University of Utah was made for this very purpose.
I've been using VMWare to simulate a simple LAN (a DC and several workstations hosted on a single machine).
You didn't state which VMware product you were using but VMware ESXi is free and it will give you the ability to create very complex networks - DMZ's, multiple VLAN's and it will support up to four virtual Nics per VM.
Although the current requirement is simply to provide a virtual LAN, it would be ideal if we could also simulate various problems that might be encountered in the wild.
The LAN will be used as a test environment for software that is currently in development.
This should allow you to build almost any LAN scale environment you may need to replicate although you will almost certainly max out on the number of VM's that you can run on a single ESXi host before you max out most of those limits.
If you're running cisco equipment, you can use GNS3 in conjunction with VMWare to build even more complicated networks.
It can simulate various network characteristics (bandwidth, rtt, packet loss/reordering/corruption, jitter, etc) by setting the parameters in a simple web interface and routing your traffic through it.
