Solution to this problem in Excel after pasting click option.
Hector's answer is nice in that you don't have to exit Excel, but this works as well, and is pretty quick and easy.
I found a solution that works for SQL 2012/2014 here.
In the event the field type is different to nvarchar(max), then identify the offending field or fields and use this same technique.
I don't remember this happening before Excel 2007, but it may have.
I always have to go back and set it back to tab delimited before I start copying and pasting again.
If you don't want to go through the link, here's how to fix the issue within your SQL:
Then select all row records and do a custom sort on the ID column.
I've found that if I exit Excel, and then restart it, and reload my spreadsheet, it clears the text to columns options, so the paste will work as expected again.
If you cant save without an alter you can temporarily turn of relevant warnings in TOOLS | OPTIONS.
This is, apparently, not an issue in previous versions of SQL Server.
The data may still exhibit a carriage return but at least your data is all on the same row.
If you've used Text to columns recently, it will apply those settings to the Paste operation.
All of your records should now be intact and consecutive.
If your table contains an nvarchar(max) field move that field to the bottom of your table.
Check "Tab", check "Treat consecutive delimeter as one" -> Next
A similar situation I encounter from time to time is rows being split into multiple rows when users have use a carriage return/line feed character in a column intended for comments.
