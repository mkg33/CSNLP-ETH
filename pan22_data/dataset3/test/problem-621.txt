So it's best to pay $30-$40 more and have printer with integrated printserver supported by the manufacturer.
After several weeks of research, as of March 2011, there are several, including Hawking HMPS1U and Linksys WPSM54G multifunction print servers that will work.
Generic cartridges are cheaper, but may cause harm to the printer.
Since the distributor lists the product as "phased out", I do not expect any updated 64 bit drivers any time soon.
Yes, there are MFP servers that are 64-bit compatible but they have been fairly hard to find.
As @harrymc mentioned, any new printer will work with both x86 and x64 Windows.
Right now, we are using the Longshine LCS-MFP101-2 to connect to our MFP device (printer/scanner combo) over LAN.
It's better to verify the number-of-pages per cartridges and their price.
Consumer websites are an important source of information, for example this comparison.
Because of that, I am searching for a relatively cheap SOHO MFP print server (1 USB port should be enough) which can be used with 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Windows.
Just beware that a cheap printer might be quite costly on ink, so that in fact a printer's price means nothing.
Which one is best for you depends on your exact needs.
Any modern multifunction printer will work on both 32-bit or 64-bit Windows.
Amazon Rating is also very interesting, as are user reviews.
However, it required both the firmware (v. 1019) and windows setup wizard software to be upgraded in order to be 64-bit compatible.
More information is available in product details or on the manufacturer's site.
You can start by asking the query on Amazon in descending order of price, and pick out products by any of the well-known printer manufacturers.
I'm not sure about when the Hawking came out, but the Linksys one began supporting 64-bit Windows OS starting the same month you posted your question (12/09).
However, the required driver (RMVUSB, Remote Virtual USB) cannot be installed on 64 bit Windows operating systems such as Windows XP x64 or Windows 7 x64.
I know this post is more than a year old but it's still hard to find info on this subject even in 2011.
What I can add is that external USB printservers are unreliable at best (printer manufacturers also don't help the situation).
