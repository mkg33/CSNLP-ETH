As a user, controlling these conditions is beyond most folks out there but may in fact, be the culprit in puzzling situations.
A much better idea is to move the router to a much higher location by extending the hard wiring and power then you still get maximum power to the aerial and little noticeable loss on ethernet cable
Usually, losses are specified either per meter or per 100 feet and are frequency dependent, so let's see if we can try that for this cable.

Unfortunately, they did not specify exact manufacturer of the cable, so we need to go and look for some generic answers.
So on TP-LINK's downloads website for linked product, you'll be able to download the datasheet.
What is missing is the VSWR conditions in the setup.
The best I can offer is , if you must maintain maximum performance with minimum losses, consultation with professionals in RF is highly recommended.
Do keep in mind that the numbers are not for the specific cable you have, but for category, so don't be surprised if you find slightly different values elsewhere.
You get about 10 metres of cable before you need some kind of amplifier/booster/repeater, otherwise your signals about as good as dead.
One you do, you'll be able ti find the exact cable type used there.
Go to Google, type RG-174 coaxial cable losses 2.4 GHz.
Looking there, you can find that RG-174 has around 1.7 dB attenuation per 1 meter, giving around 2.2 dB loss for the 1.3 m piece that comes with the antenna.
If the antenna/cable/receiver input is not a match then unacceptable losses mount.
When you're trying to get actual practical information about the product, first step is to take a look at the product datasheet.
