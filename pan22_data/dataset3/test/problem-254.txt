So if customer list is type 2, user is an "artist" and can add new stock, but if they are type 3, they are "customer" and can only edit quantity.
I want user 1 let's call that "sales" to add new items, edit and delete.
So I'm creating a webapp that is essentially an online art gallery store.
Do i add type 1 "sales" as admin with certain rights?
Can I contain new users type 2&3 in a customer list and have that list manipulate the inventory list with rules?
I want user 2 "artists" to be able to add new, edit what they added and delete what they've added to the inventory list, along with their own info.
I also want sales to to the same for a customer list.
Would I need to create separate rules for all others?
The database will contain an inventory of items and possibly a customer list (this is what I'm not sure about).
Got a uni project which I was hoping y'all could help with.
I want to allow for various levels of manipulation to the inventory list.
I want user 3 "customer" to be able edit one field in the inventory list (quantity required), along with their own info.
I want an admin account to oversee the db and all connections.
