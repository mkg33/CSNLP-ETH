You can Google for the sound and descriptions of the problem.
As you can see in the picture below, they commonly apply glue at the factory to dampen the vibration.
The most common cause of high-pitch audible noise is something loosely known as coil noise.
If it's not under warranty, and it uses a standard form factor, I would replace it with something that has met the criteria for 80 PLUS certification.
When my PC is turned off and I bring my head very close to the PSU, I hear a high frequency noise.
My ethernet port blinks so the pc is using some power even through it's off.
High frequency noise coming from a power supply usually comes from a leaking capacitor.
To answer your question, it's not "normal", just a common flaw.
It is harmless to the electronics, but annoying to people and animals.
It may not be an immediate issue, but it probably won't get better.
Personally, I find such noises unbearable, and a sign of poor manufacturing.
I can't hear when I am like 2 metres away from it.
Most people live with it unless it really bothers, then they replace the PSU.
If the computer is under warranty, I would ask for the power supply to be replaced.
