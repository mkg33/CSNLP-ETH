I have an lvm ext3 partition that is larger than the drive I would like to clone it onto, but is nowhere close to full, so all of the data, itself, would fit.
-depth -print0 | cpio -pdmu0 /newstorage", "rsync -a /oldstorage/ /newstorage/", or the like.
While not a high tech way of going about it, this will suffice for most people's needs.
If you're not willing to first shrink the LVM logical volume, you're looking at copying the data with "cp -a", "cd /oldstorage ; find .
I would prefer to not have to resize the partition first, if possible.
This can be done using gparted (also known as Partition Manager)
For a logical volume that is not nearly full, it is more efficient than to do this than to copy an entire volume that includes unused space.
I have not used LVM, but the process would be to shrink the filesystem first, to a size that will fit on the new drive, before copying.
What would be the best way to clone this drive to the smaller one?
An easy way to do this is to plug the new drive into your computer, configure LVM and otherwise partition this drive the way you want, make the file systems, and then use rsync or just cp -a to copy the files over.
