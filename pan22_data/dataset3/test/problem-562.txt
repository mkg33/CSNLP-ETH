You can put a script which does that in cron on a single machine and now you're maintaining one crontab and one copy of the script which is automatically replicated.
Are there any other options available to make this process more user friendly and maintainable?
People are naturally going to suggest things like Ansible, and that's a good idea if you're doing multiple things like this on a regular basis, but suppose you don't need all that right now.
I feel this option is little cumbersome to maintain if custom metrics script keeps changing.
Once option i am familiar with is creating cron jobs on every one of these VMs and report result to an endpoint.
This server cluster consists of 10 virtual machines.
The base requirements on the endpoints are ssh access and a Python installation (nowadays you really should make sure they can run Python 3 - Python 2 will EOL on Jan 1st 2020).
Running a script on another machine is actually pretty easy:
I have a requirement to collect custom metrics (a shell script) from a logical server cluster every five minutes.
Managing deployment of similar things and similar configurations on multiple machines sounds like a great reason to learn some Ansible.
Liked the server/agent model of Zabbix which makes it very flexible in monitoring larger fleets.
