I would like to know about tips to optimize the guest Windows7 so the performance will be acceptable.
I've installed Windows7 in VirtualBox 2.2.4 and worked like a charm.
In my own testing, I've noticed that Win7 is a lot harder on the disk I/O channel than WinXP is.
But compared with my WindowsXP virtual machine, the performance is slow.
Windows 7 has a native support to VHD boot, which means you can boot right to the VHD file without hosting OS supporting it.
), then as you say look at the actual guest settings such as services etc.
Make sure you've allocated enough resources to the VM, and that you have those resources free to allocated.
This is a problem on my work VMWare installation, where I have my VM disks on an XFS partition that suffers from poor meta-data writes.
I was thinking about stop some services, but I don't know that services are necessary in the guest OS.
Maybe it's the next awesome way of virtualizing desktop.
Here is my blog post about Native VHD boot on Windows 7
Also switch off any virtual devices you don't need (serial ports etc.
I've installed Windows7 in (non-virtual) machines and the performance was better than XP and Vista.
The big thing is to avoid swapping out to disk where possible, so make sure you have enough RAM allocated to the VM.
I've optimized as much as I can, but Win7 is just plain pokey compared to my WinXP.
