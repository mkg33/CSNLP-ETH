The key observation is that whether the substitution theorem holds, depends on the definition of substitution.
One paper you might want to look at in addition to the ones that gallais pointed you at is my paper with Nick Benton, A Semantic Model of Graphical User Interfaces, which defines and proves the correctness of hereditary substitution for a mixed linear/intuitionistic calculus (in section 5).
For the usual definition of substitution of terms for variables, the substitution theorem is only true for substituting synthesizing terms for variables.
So this suggests that the usual substitution operation is the wrong definition.
The keyword to search for is "hereditary substitution".
Indeed, if you introduce separate grammatical classes for synthesizing and checking terms, then using the usual substitution operation to replace a variable with a checking term will leave you with an ungrammatical expression.
However, this leaves you with the option of defining a different substitution operation.
