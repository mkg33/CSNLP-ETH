I'm using Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8), but how do I make sure that DNS queries are going through the SSH tunnel?
If it's a SOCKS 5 proxy, and the client program supports it, DNS will go through the proxy.
I'm then configuring OS X to use localhost:8080 as a SOCKS proxy.
I'm using this to access the internet without being monitored.
If you want everything to be tunneled you need a proper VPN.
Run privoxy locally, and you can use ssh to tunnel the Socks 5 traffic.
If your goal is privacy on the web , you really should use something like privoxy.
As pfo says, SSH tunnels are only for TCP traffic, and the application has to be aware of SOCKS proxies.
You can use google's DNS from the far end box then.
Most browsers support DNS through a Socks 5 proxy, but may require special configuration to do it.
Set the network.proxy.socks_remote_dns property in firefox config (type about:config in address bar) to TRUE (just double click the property to toggle the value) to enable dns lookups over your local/remote socks5 proxy.
I am using ssh -D 8080 my server to create a SOCKS proxy.
I know the answer is bit late, but for the reference and for those who are still looking for the answer,
Privoxy will cleanse the headers of your web requests and ensures all traffic, including DNS, goes through the Socks 5 proxy.
You can't do that out of the box since the SSH tunnel is for TCP/IP connections only - UDP traffic won't be able to be cross that tunnel without a special setup.
Basically you need to create a fifo to do some trickery with netcat as described here.
