When I tried to connect to it, there was no timeout, and no other reaction.
If you have VSS snapshots, and there are either too many of them or they are taking too much space, RDP can drop you right out.
This won't be a common problem, but it was odd and difficult enough that I thought it was worth mentioning.
Sometimes restarting the VSS services will bring it back on, other times you'll need to enable and start telnet, go in, and get all vssadmin on it's ass.
This mystified me until Google later helped me find the answer.
Out of Remote Desktop/Terminal Server License numbers.
I entered the IP address, hit ENTER, and it returned to the same screen asking me which remote desktop to connect to.
Remember Win2003/2008 license contains 2+1 admin connections.
I updated the video driver on the remote desktop host (not client), and after doing so, it allowed remote connections in.
I had a desktop (WinXP) on which remote desktop failed to respond, sort of.
What are the most common things that will cause a Windows Server 2003/2008 to stop responding to Remote Desktop connections, even though other services on the computer are running fine?
