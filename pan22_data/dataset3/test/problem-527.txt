If you are thinking of doing WOL with a PC over the internet, I don't it would work.
You could try wake-on-modem if you're prepared to dedicate a telephone line to your computer (and hope you don't get wrong number / telemarketing calls).
If there isn't some other machine on the LAN that you can get to then it can't be done.
You need a computer that supports it, and to enable it in the bios as you mentioned.
You need to consider where you want to send the message from: if it's from your LAN then you can use any old software (google it).
If you do want to use the internet, I think there are some websites which will send the message for you.
Would this do what I'm after, and if not - would anything else?
Wake-On-LAN needs a specially-crafted packet sent from another machine on the LAN (hence the name) to work.
With the newer BIOS' it actually works, but beware since the drivers have to compatible or when your PC wakes up it crashes.
I believe you can also wake it up from the internet, but there are some things to consider.
I've heard of Wake-Up-On-LAN (well, I've seen it in the BIOS) but I've never been 100% how to work it.
