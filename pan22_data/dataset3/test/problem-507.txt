The only portion that people maybe have gotten bored of is openings (which is why Bobby Fischer proposed a chess-like game that had randomized starting places).
"I've seen this, I know what to do here" is maybe uttered a lot, and the mastery comes more from execution.
I think what you're experiencing is games with limited situational variety, at least on some level.
Chess remains popular because there's an exponentially large number of situations, and each of these situations may need a unique application of logic.
Chess actually has a small set of rules, so what can be gleaned from its success is that it's not necessarily the number of rules and stats and such that keep a game interesting.
I'm surprised nobody has mentioned this, but chess is a pretty good example of a game where the meta is so hard to master that people have been playing for centuries.
Knowing what to do in a given chess situation, on the other hand, is probably rarely straight-forward.
In general there's two solutions: have a game rely heavily on strategy that builds up over many moves or actions (like chess) so each application of strategy can produce exponentially large amounts of responses (situations), or rely on randomness to create a large variety of situations (procedural generation, or multiplayer (other humans can be very unpredictable opponents)).
This probably all plays into Erik's answer about problem solving.
