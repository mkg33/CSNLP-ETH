While a AD might help in some configs, it's not required... but for remote users, a vpn might be recommended to avoid publishing a PC on to the internet.
As for Adobe, Java, etc., you could use psexec (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx) to script an update kick-off, but you'll need to run that as an account with credentials for the local machines (which it sounds like you have).
We use Solar Wind's Patch manager for pushing additional products and updates via the standard WSUS agent.
It is possible to run WSUS directly over the net using HTTPS and (I believe) client side certificates.
Ninite Pro is a bit more versitile than standard Ninite and can download apps to a local store rather than having to download them over and over again.
You could also use PsExec to remotely execute it if you do not wish to open an RDP connection.
For updating apps such as Adobe Reader, Java, Flash, etc, take a look at Ninite (and Ninite Pro).
There are several non-MS solutions that can help you.
Put together this provides a ready way to manage your updates remotely.
You can run WSUS with machines that aren't in a domain.
you can use Npackd to manage the software on the computers.
Some require a remote service, others can be done with cli or psexec (winexe if you are in linux) or even puppet and similar.
There are others that work only locally , with more or less features, but might also be useful, specially for free software, open source, freeware,  etc:
The first 3 are free, the other 2 have both a free and paid version, with different features.
(don't even try the windows vpn, all pptp vpn are very weak).
* For setting up a openvpn, check this easy manual, in a few minutes you can interconnect all your machines just like a big local network.
It's a fire-and-forget way of updating a lot of commonly-used tools.
There's a set of registry keys that'll let you do this.
