YOU MUST ADD some route on your modem router with destination 192.168.1.0/24 across gateway 192.168.1.69/24.
Of course I have no Internet connectivity from the test PC.
I have a strong feeling this may be related to my connectivity issue.
Now this is where it gets weird: From the router's CLI I can successfully ping 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.69, 192.168.10.69 and 192.168.10.13.
The router knows, by default, all the networks it have been directly connected to him.
In order to have a second "backup" gateway for my company network, I tried to implement this topology:
If you want to ping your modem (192.168.1.1) from your test PC (192.168.10.13), you must to add a route in your modem for the network 192.168.10.0/24 via 192.168.1.69 (your router).
This is the way that packets from 192.168.1.0 will be reply to that destination.
Your ICMP Echo arrives on your modem but it can't send the reply because it has no route for this network: 192.168.10.0/24
When trying to ping 192.168.1.1 from the test PC it fails.
It can reach the two networks, but, your modem router, only knows that it wil connect to internet across the serial link or something like this, iÂ´m talking about the link connected with the cloud.
After some more inspection, my routing table looks really fishy.
It is pretty straightforward, with the network between the modem and the router being the 192.168.1.0/24 and the network between the router and the stations being the 192.168.10.0/24.
By default, your modem doesn't know where is the address of your test PC.
Why have the directly connected networks been broken up like that?
You ping from your router all IP's addresses beacuse they are all connected to him.
The problem is this, the REQUEST arrive without problem, but the modem UNKNOWN the location of the network 192.168.1.0/24.
From the test PC I can successfully ping only 192.168.1.69 and 192.168.10.69.
I have also configured my test PC with an IP of 192.168.10.13, mask of 255.255.255.0 and default gateway of 192.168.10.69.
Then, the same happens when the modem receive a packet from an equipment located in the network 192.168.10.0/24.
I have never before seen The interface IP addresses mentioned in the routing table as separate "/32" directly connected subnets.
The actual IP addresses are the ones on the sketch.
The status of the interfaces on the router is like this:
The modem knows this network cause it has connected DIRECLTY.
As you can see I have configured the modem's IP address as the gateway of last resort, so that the packets take that way towards the Internet.
