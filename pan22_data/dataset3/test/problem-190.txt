So maybe a combination with a "file history" tool on the NAS?
I'm currently not using the snapshot function of the NAS, it's running a standard RAID setup.
I have slight trust issues with proprietary backup formats and it would also give me access to the files from my phone.
Finally, I would also like to backup the whole NAS to some cloud storage in an encrypted way.
I have a QNAP TS-251+ NAS (connected via VPN + SMB if it matters) and would like to backup files from two machines to it (running Windows 8.1 and Windows 10), mostly user profile data (My Documents, etc.
I guess robocopy would be the standard choice here?
It would be a one-way sync, so that I can delete stuff from my PC, but it would still be available on the NAS until I delete it manually from there.
I think it would be nice to copy the data on a file level to be sure they are accessible later.
For instance in case files get corrupted locally and I don't notice before the server has been updated with the changes.
I guess this would be difficult/impossible to do on a file level if one wants to keep the directory structure etc.
