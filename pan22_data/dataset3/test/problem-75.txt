it seems to occur related to how many users are downloading a file.
The server is running Windows 2000 IIS; unfortunately it cannot be upgraded anytime soon due to the funding/red tape issues.
For example if you start downloading a 100MB file it may download ~36mb, then finish (no error, it just finishes as if the file was completed).
If so, look in the event log to see if IIS terminated the process that was generating the file.
When tested on files not being downloaded by anyone it happens less, and having multiple users download files simultaneously at different sites it happens much more often.
We've tested from multiple sites and it occurs seemingly anywhere.
When downloading files from our web server often files will only download files part of the way, then end as if they finished downloading leaving a partial file.
I'd also recommend migrating off of W2k if at all possible.
You may need to extend your process timeout period on the server to allow for a full download.
We've verified the files on the server are good by copying them back from the server directly and working with them.
When you try to open the file of course it's corrupted or has some error that goes to say that the file isn't all there.
Has anyone heard of this issue or know a possible way to fix it?
Is this a file that is being generated when the user requests it?
