If using a linux system (including a RPi) to burn your base image, it is possible to mount the partitions on the new card after burning the image, and doing some tweaking there (e.g.
I have a Rapberry Pi 1 Model A and would like to use Etcher to burn Raspbian Stretch Lite to it with some custom modifications:
If you resize the / partition on the card to be just large enough to hold the required files, it will reduce the image size.
apt-get packages), then create the image of that card as your base image and burn that to new cards.
This isn't possible to do with Etcher and instead one needs to use a combination of chroot and qemu tooling.
Or do I need to load the Raspbian image into a different tool and customize it (run apt-get, manually install my app, etc.)
editing hostname), but things like properly installing packages require a running system.
I do this for all my installs to save time with things like localization, installing defaults, configuring editors, etc.
I was wondering if anyone in this community has used Etcher to burn OS images to a Raspberry Pi.
Etcher or any other imaging tool can't do it out-of-the-box, but you can easily create a small microSD card running raspbian stretch lite, boot it up and customize the configuration (e.g.
