Do I need a journaling filesystem for both host and guest operating systems when using virtualization?
For journalling to work, it is essential that the OS is in control of the order in which data is written to disk.
What filesystem layout will give the best performance?
Reiterating what's already been said here by others:
Journalling in the guest OS can give a false sense of security in case of an unclean shutdown of the host OS.
Without being totally sure, i think that the disk in a virtual is actually the RAM (afterall ... the virtual machine is an application -full virtualisation machines - )
Or, conversely, should I disable journaling in the guests?
Or, conversely, should I disable journalling in the guests?

Journaling overhead is typically a negligible amount of overhead compared to other things that could be tuned, like the disk sub-system.
Is it worth it to set up a different partition on the host just for the guests, with no journaling?
When that become cost prohibitive then look at non-standard file systems.
IMHO, it depends on how you plan on crashing your virtual machines (Ask yourself: Why do you need a journaling filesystem for in the first place?

The result could be that upon reboot, the guest OS replays old journal data and overwrites more recent file data, possibly with unnoticed massive filesystem corruption as a result.
Using VirtualBox, I've got a few Linux guests for different distros running on an Ubuntu host.
The guest OS may think it is in control, but there is no guarantee that the host OS actually writes the data to disk in the same sequence.
