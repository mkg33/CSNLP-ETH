I would expect them to, it sounds like a hardware problem.
Could also be a malfunctioning Ctrl or Alt or Windows key sticking.

If reseating the connector for the keyboard cable doesn't fix it, your best bet is to replace the keyboard.
brings up many hits for new keyboards in the $10-$30 range, almost all from sellers with very high feedback ratings.
If its still not functioning, you can get a replacement from Dell.
If the keyboard has not been damaged (say by liquid spills) the most likely cause for many of the above reports is one of:
If it happens, try pressing the Ctrl, Alt, Win keys (bounce the keys several times) to see if the keys are stuck and then the letter key by itself again.
However in my case problems included B and N as a response to just pressing B.
I would find the manual for your laptop, it should be on the Dell website and find out how to remove the keyboard.
I've bought several replacement keyboards for Dell laptops (I've been using them since the C-series) on eBay with 100% success.
If the key gets stuck in the down position, some keys will no longer work since the key combo means something other than the plain letter.
Once it is out, gently tap it, often crumbs and other debris can get under the keys and cause them to function poorly.
If they function correctly, then its most likely the keyboard itself.
The laptop is a Dell Adamo 13, running Windows Vista.
Don't mess around putting pieces of paper in the machine, etc.
All of these can easily occur with age, be intermittent, respond to pressure or to changes in temperature, etc.
I had something similar with B and N keys on a Dell notebook that was fixed when I pressed the strip connector plug more firmly into its terminal.
Google searching hasn't produced any hits that seem precisely analogous to my case.
The Dell web site in the "support" pages has a service manual for your Vostro with R&R instructions for all field-swappable components, including the keyboard.
You might even get a can of compressed air and blow the in the keys to dislodge anything.
