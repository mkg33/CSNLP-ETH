Other than for 1000Base-T, these devices aren't very popular as a optical 50:50 splitter is more economic, assuming sufficient optical budget is available.
As such they have no understanding of the framing (although the CONV2004 is an advanced unit, and so has a electrical tap of the GMII which examines the symbols on the interconnection to do error reporting, and for that reporting it needs to know what the symbols mean, and thus if the traffic is ethernet/SONET/SDH/TV/etc).
They can be thought of as connecting the two SFP's GMII interfaces back-to-back.
Perhaps you are thinking of a SFP-based regenerator.
Even for 1000Base-T the wide availability of 4 port switches with a "port copy"/"span"/"intercept" feature gives strong competition to a GMII-based device.
Or perhaps you are thinking of the similar devices available for interception applications, with an SFP's GMII interfaced to another SFP's GMII, and a tap of that GMII bus running to two additional SFPs to transmitting copies of the east-west and west-east received traffic.
Although even these devices are increasingly using ethernet switching, to allow typical ethernet features on the links to the interception host, such as autonegotiation.
