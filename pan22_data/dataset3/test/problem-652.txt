To migrate data from the master/slave-system to the cluster one cluster node is set up as slave to that m/s-system (backup from master is imported, slave replication on the cluster node starts from the point where the backup is taken).
General replication in the cluster works fine like expected.
Our cluster was not replicating neither when we had just the cluster operational (without replicating from the master node) with repl.commit_order=2.
The cluster node never catches up to the master (seconds-behind-master is increasing).
But we then experienced that the other cluster nodes weren't replicating any more (though their state was synced and the wsrep%-variables did not show anything unusual, no throttling), replication within the cluster seemed to have stalled entirely.
When resetting repl.commit_order replication worked again.
we are currently testing if moving from mariaDB master/slave replication to a 3-node-galera-cluster is an option for us.
Setting repl.commit_order=2 improved performance, replication from the master to the cluster node went fine.
Load test shows that write-performance does not meet our requirements though.
