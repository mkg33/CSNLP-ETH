So we, the group of database programmers, decided that in every table is record one always the record in which the total record numbers is stored.
This assumes you have a fixed number of rating types, and that you don't need this table for other queries that would be worst with this new structure.
mutual_match_ratings_N, mutual_match_ratings_S, etc.
If that's the case, you should look for other approach, or maintain two copies of the table ( your initial table, and partitioned ones ) if that's affordable in terms of space and maintainability ( or application logic ).
We updated this number, depending on INSERT or DELETE rows.
After talking with Oracle and Microsoft programmers we was not so happy ...
I handled tables for the German Government with sometimes 60 million records.
We use this way now since 1998 and had never any wrong number of rows, in all our multi million record tables.
And we needed to know many times the total rows from a table.
You should perform a query for each type, but perhaps that's faster than the other way.
