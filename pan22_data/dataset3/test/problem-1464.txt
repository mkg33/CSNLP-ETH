I was developing a website using Dreamweaver, I was editing one of my php files and suddenly the electricity shut down and my computer turned off.
when I turned on my PC again and open the file that I was editing, all the contents were gone!!!
Whatever the case, the file was open and in some sort of transitional state on your drive when your computer crashed.
It sounds as though the file encoding was corrupted.
I don't know how Dreamweaver stores the files it is currently working on, whether they are cached in memory until written to the disk during saves, or whether they are saved in temp files on the disk (like MS Office).
You can see a similar long list of NULLs if you open an image or an mp3 file inside a text editor.
Whatever the case, proper backups are always a good idea, and setting your application to auto-save at regular and frequent intervals is always a good idea.
This isn't necessarily a problem with Dreamweaver, though there are ways the program could operate that would make the files less prone to this sort of thing (Microsoft Office, for instance, writes just about everything to a temp file that is then dumped to the actual file you're working on, this is what allows it to display a list of "recovered documents" when you start it up after a crash).
When I look to the php file size it was 10 KB so that means it is not empty, so i decided to open it in note++ it showed me a long string of nulls !!
This transitional state is unrecognizable to your system.
