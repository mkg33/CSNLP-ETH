Left button is number 1, right button is number 3.
Using xmodmap you can swap mouse buttons like this:
One gotcha: You have to turn the standard "swap buttons" function off before installing Intellipoint.
It's possible that 3rd-party mouse drivers will also work better than the standard drivers.
If I want to switch from left to right or vice versa, I just click a toggle switch.
The built in track point and track pad in my Lenovo x230 does not carry my settings over to a remote session.
And when connecting to the machine from elsewhere, Intellipoint does not swap buttons.
However, the Intellipoint software does not swap the buttons over on a non-Intellipoint mouse.
However, I wasn't able to get this to work under Win7 last time I tried, so when my new work PC arrives I shall probably buy a Microsoft mouse to go with it.
X-Mouse Button Control does its changes by intercepting clicks, so they carry downstream to any Remote Desktop session.
Otherwise when you remote desktop to that PC from elsewhere, the buttons get swapped.
I have found this SteelSeries mouse that claims to be ambidextrous and driverless.
Microsoft Intellipoint mouse drivers handle the swap buttons feature in a different way to the standard mouse drivers, and remote desktop works correctly: A left-click on the physically-connected mouse is sent to the remote machine as a right-click.
This drives me nuts when working in a remote session on the road.
So, my home workstation has an Intellipoint mouse to the left of the keyboard, and the supplied Dell mouse to the right of the keyboard.
Works a treat, for both left- and right-handed users.
My Penguin Ambidextrous Vertical mouse works very well in remote sessions.
I wonder if modifying a normal mouse is worth the saving.
You can use X-Mouse Button Control to swap the mouse buttons.
Beware that I haven't tried it myself and it's expensive compared to a normal mouse.
In an X Window System, you can use  xmodmap (utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings in X).
I guess you can swap left/right buttons by clicking another button.
Fortunately the mice have different hardware IDs, so I've modified an .inf file in the Intellipoint driver's installer, and convinced it that one of the mice was made by Microsoft.
