If you want to do more yourself and not pay monthly charges I'd look at Prometheus.
If that runs, say every hour, and dumps data in an XML or CSV or whatever conventional format of the plugin, can I distribute reports with that data using Jenkins using a special plugin?
There are various "single sign-on" solutions out there.
But squeezing everything into the jenkins UI just because that is the only login people have seems like asking for trouble.
Centralizing user logins is certainly a reasonable goal.
Most of them will also let you interact with the graphs to zoom in on certain ranges of time or subsets of servers.
Alternatively, you could output the status information as text and include it in the body of an e-mail sent to the less technical users via the Jenkins Email-ext plugin
Since you seem to be ok with using whatever output format that a plugin would need, perhaps you can save the output as HTML and then use the Jenkins HTML Publisher plugin to generate reports.
There are are other choices available of course, but these are some of the better result-for-the-effort-put-in choices out there right now.
If you want to do less yourself and monthly charges are survivable I'd look at datadog.
I understand there are separate apps that do system monitoring but the fact of the matter I am trying to make Jenkins my one-stop-shop for what my less technical usership needs so, because I enabled them to run builds and deployments using Jenkins as they wish, I would prefer not to give them a different interface with a different login and other overhead.
Either way it will be a much more natural process than reinventing the wheel to make it work through jenkins.
These reports would be viewable on the Jenkins build page.
You'll want to ease logins to other systems like email or PagerDuty eventually so finding a nice general solution to this will be handy for a long time.
If so, then your script could do something as simple as using sh to call curl or wget to query the information from those servers.
If I understand the question correctly, you want a way to distribute status information of other servers, not specifically the Jenkins server, to less-technical users.
Are there any plugins that would enable me to distribute system monitoring and reporting via Jenkins, if I provided it with data in a required format.
Any of these solutions will take data from a variety of inputs and let you have a coherent dashboard.
I would like to write a simple script that would display the status of every server and maybe some metrics.
I'd let everyone see my dashboards without logins before I tried to make it all work through jenkins.
But even something hacky like copying a htpasswd file around can work.
I guess the follow-up question would be, do the servers in question already have some sort of API or other interface to query the status?
You can usually let your users create their own dashboards as well which will reduce the number of innane tweaks that you're asked to make over time.
