Your functions are not exactly the same, as they handle invalid input differently (none of them handle it well).
I think it's good that you have comments, and they actually helped me in understanding your code.
You can remove the warnings about incorrect input if you don't care about it, or you can add error checking and throw well named exceptions and add extra comments for them, to clear up the comment a bit.
As @Martijn said, letting the database perform the sort might be a good alternative.
In that case, I would probably just add a rank column to the table.
It would also be interesting to know why you even need to do this in the first place.
then the second function will return a different result than the other two.
Without actually looking at the code in-depth, I had no idea what the functions might do, or how I could use them.
Here are two more examples for different results between the functions:
It might seem overkill, but anyone actually using your function will be glad that it's there.
