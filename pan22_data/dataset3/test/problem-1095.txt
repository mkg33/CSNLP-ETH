As far a I know, extenders still don't support ripped dvds out the box.
And since your movies are on a NAS you cannot create sybolic links.
It could be slightly different for Win7, but here are the instruction to enable dvds on your extenders for Vista and hopefully Win7 too.
But of all the luck, the same people also have instructions on how to use a NAS or WHS.
Maybe the XBOX 360 cant read the codec that the video file contain.
Going back over this, have you thought of dumping media center and using the video library instead?
If you're just ripping DVDs as VOB files, you'll probably still have issues - transcoding the videos will save you space, and fix your issues.
If you have previously used it on say vista media centre you have to delete that association first, it should work after that.
The video library is more flexible than Media Center (although not as pretty).
There is also a chance you can get your NAS to run as a host on it's own - many NAS devices support DLNA out of the box - this would remove the need for having your computer, NAS and 360 all running.
