This will atleast give you whatever errors you may be seeing.
This is the default state in some distributions as it helps lock down the system from outside tampering right from start.
You might also want to check your hosts.deny and hosts.allow files in /etc.
In some distributions, these are set by default to block all connections from external sources but allow any connections from the local machine.
This file typically has an "ALL: 127.0.0.1" line in it allowing any type of connection from the local machine which is why ssh may be working from the local machine but not from an external machine.
If it didn't create the keys, that means that they were previously generated and you're O.K.
can be a specific IP, FQDN or a wildcarded version (i.e.
If the file has nothing but comments this isn't the problem.
2 Open a terminal, su into the root user, and type /etc/init.d/sshd start
3 Enable firewall Verify that the firewall isn't the problem by connecting from remote host
This may be why you are able to connect locally but not from a remote system.
If hosts.deny has the "ALL: *" or maybe "ALL: PARANOID" line present and uncommented then this will be rejecting all connections from outside sources not explicitly allowed in the hosts.allow file.
You may notice in step 2 that the computer is generating your keys, which may have not been done sooner.
Assuming the "ALL:  PARANOID" line is present in hosts.deny and you leave it alone, to enable ssh connections from a specific source you would need to add a "sshd: " line to your hosts.allow file.
You most likely have selinux running; recent Fedora installations enable this by default, with a pretty restrictive set of policies.
1 Disable firewall to host (only long enough to verify it isn't the firewall
Any errors from this, if you post, we might all be able to help.
