usually i monitor status of raid with default command
You may have dual-domain cabling in place (multipath SAS).
At the same time, hpacucli in the report said that all HDD were normal.
HP Proliant bl460gen6 with controller smart array p711m Ubuntu OS
The P711 is a blade server SAS RAID controller and meant to connect to the Blade Chassis expansion ports (SAS switch) and link to a larger enclosure (like a D6000 35 or 70-bay SAS JBOD).
Also, you shouldn't monitor the RAID status the way you're doing it.
You can just install the HP management agents and the system will email or send an SNMP trap with health status changes.
By chance I noticed that the diodes are signaling of broken two HDDs on the storage system.
Replacing one HDD continued to monitor the situation, the recovering of the raid took place in the normal mode, however, the numbering of the HDDs in the list is given the wrong with doubling drives numbers
Whats get wrong, how i can fix it and why different hpacucli commands return different HDD status
There are 35 hdd drives configured in raid 1+0 with 1 disk in spare
After googling the problem I got another version of the hpacucli syntaxis like

After its implementation, it confirmed the existence of problematic HDD
