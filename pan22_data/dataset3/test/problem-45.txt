This is one area you went wrong the xbox cant handle a .esp file alone it has to be inside a container like.
Download a .esp file and use a program called Le Fluffie to create a dlc file.
One this is done bring your pen drive to your computer and use a program called horizon to modify and change your settings.
This would at least give you filesystem access, from there caveats are sure to abound.
My self I have over 40 mods running on mine as well as some custom textures but thats another whole story.
The answer is that it is probably possible with a great amount of reverse-engineering effort (but what isn't?).
My suggestion is to look up info on Horizon and Le Fluffie as how to use them.
You could try installing the full game on the 360 hard disk and then grab some linux FUSE drivers for the 360 filesystem (http://code.google.com/p/x360/).
Downlaod and install the latest TU7 on the pen drive.
The problem is that there isn't a means by which you can get the modded content back onto the console.
There simply isn't a way to do this on the console.
There was an interview with Todd Howard on this topic and he said that identical content could run on PC/Xbox 360/PS3.
This will allow you to install the game to the pen drive as well as install DLC and a new profile.
Many of us even with modded boxes are having trouble modding the game with anything more than simple .esp files.
This has nothing to do with running signed vs unsigned code, this has to do with modifying the data files and stuffing them back into the game.
Then follow the same steps as for the title update to inject it into your profile.
If you dont have a modded box you have a long road ahead of you.
