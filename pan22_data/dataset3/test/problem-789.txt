If you don't have the agent, use the Scheduler to call a script like this:
Instead, you can choose to write your own T-SQL scripts to do database backups.
One option is using the Windows scheduler to call sqlcmd with a backup script.
What tools are available to perform this task and how reliable are they?
Network backup is possible with SQL Server Agent...
You just need to change an account wich used for start SQL Server Agent service to account with access to network share (and system service operations for sure) - e.g.
The problem is that maintenance plans suffer from a lack of flexibility and have some restrictions.
We link to some good backup scripts off that video link too.
You can script result check/distribution to several servers and so on...
But local disk backup and xp_commandshell it's really much more reliable.
First, Maintenance Plans will build a set of actions that can back up your database, defragment your index, perform DBCC checks, and more.
If you do have Express, you'll have to be a bit more creative.
I talk about it in my tutorial video on maintenance plans:
If you have the Express edition (the free edition) it does not come with SQL agent.
I don't see any built in mechanism for scheduling nightly backups in SQL Server 2005.
Remember that C:\ cannot be a network drive it must be a locally connected drive.
The Agent is a job scheduler built into SQL Server.

Second, no matter which method you choose (maintenance plans or custom T-SQL scripts), the jobs will be run on your schedule by the SQL Server Agent.
