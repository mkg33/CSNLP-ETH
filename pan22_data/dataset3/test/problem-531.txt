In addition to that, a parity calculation will be performed across all of the data, and distributed across all of the disks in the array.
100 + (100/3) = 133, meaning 44 per disk in a three disk R5 array.
100GB will look like 100GB - the additional space required is already calculated in to the extra drive in the array.
In a 3-disk array, 100GB of data will actually consume 133GB.
If I'm reading your question correctly, you are asking how the 100GB of data would be stored on the RAID 5?
Raid5 is N=(N-1), so if you had 5x 100GB disks, You'd have a 400GB group.
But that's not really important - all that's important is that you remember that in a RAID 5, your available space is N-1.
Check this one out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID_5#RAID_5 Available disk space is shown there.
This way, if any single disk fails, all of the data that was on it can be re-created from the Parity information.
Wikipedia actually has a really thorough walk-through on RAID technology and raid levels.
Your 100GB of data will be written across all disks in a RAID 5.
For this reason, a RAID 5 is excellent with Read speeds, but slow for Writes.
RAID 5 works by striping data across multiple disks (must be at least 3 disks), and also performing a parity calculation.
The REALLY short version is it combines several physical hard disks and creates one(or more) logical hard disks, that can be configured to backup each others data across multiple hard drives, or to span the entire group.
However, the parity calculation does increase the space required to store the data.
