My database cluster is stored in /var/lib/postgresql/9.0, but there is no pg_hba file there!
to search the entire filesystem for files named pg_hba.conf
Yes, you need the pg_hba.conf file from the old database server.
Now, from I have read online, am I correct in thinking that this requires a modification to the pg_hba.conf file.
On yours I think it will be /var/lib/postgresql/9.0/pg_hba.conf
You will also want to make sure to grab the old postgresql.conf and put it under /var/lib/postgresql/9.0 as well.
So, as I alluded to in a past question, I moved the database to a new server, but the DB can't be accessed by the old code.
Dumping and restoring the database will not copy this file; all it does it dump and restore the table structures and the data they hold.
Someone might have moved it away from the default directory, and stored it who knows where.
The pg_hba.conf file should be located under the data directory; on a default install (at least on SuSE) this would be /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf.
So, my question is that, can I fix the user not authenticated problem by editing the pg_hba file (I had thought that when you did a pg_dump and restored the DB, authenticated users would come with it, but maybe that's wrong), and if I do need to access the pg_hba file, how can I find it?
After putting this file in place, you must reload Postgres for it to take affect.
