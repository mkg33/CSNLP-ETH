        Remember to replace # with the number of the inf file you want to delete.
•   2nd Stage   Again from Elevated Command Prompt - Remove Driver Packages from drivers store.
All the actual devices will be re-allocated from COM1
5) From the Action menu, select 'Scan for New Devices'
    The driver store is a protected area of the computer that contains device driver packages that have been approved for installation on the computer
I found that this tool works excellently for this issue.
It may be problem with XPVCOM.SYS (this driver reserved 14 COM ports) To uninstall in console
ie type cmd in search bar then right click cmd.exe selecting Run as Administrator
If previos answer doesn't work and has installed windows mobile 6 SDK.
4) Right-click on all the devices and remove them (no need to tick to delete the driver)
I have a simple solution that worked for me... my count was up to 45 com ports in use!
3) Expand 'Ports (COM & LPT)' category from the list
Also you may have driver package loaded on as program that may need removal using control panel/programs/uninstall a program.
             set devmgr_show_non_present_devices=1

Just load it up, click on "Display Mode", "Show only hidden/detached devices", Check "Ports" (which selects all the unused com ports), then click "Remove all checked", and confirm the removal when the warning appears.
Enable "Show hidden devices" in the menu, and uninstall grayed-out COM ports.
Note all oem###.inf instances of the prolific driver where # (hash) is the number.
2) From the View menu, select 'Show Hidden Devices'
If the computer reports that the driver package is in use by a currently installed device, then you must either uninstall the device first, or use the -f on the pnputil command to force deletion of the package.
If you do all that before loading the correct driver package and try to keep the Com device inserted in the same port rather than moving it around your ports you will have fewer problems with the Prolific driver.
