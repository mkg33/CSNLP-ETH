As such, it makes no difference whether you use a built-in or add-on NIC.
Additional NICs are a good idea for redundancy and additional bandwidth reasons though.
If you take a strike on a network cable, it'll go right through the card and into the PCI bus, which will make your system just as dead as if you'd had the NIC built-in.
An electrical surge normally occurs on the power line, not the network cable.
So the minimal difference a separate NIC will make is so small in the scheme of things as to not be worth considering.
The only even slightly likely way you could see a significant surge on the line is something drastic like a lightning strike though, and in this case any arc that affects the NIC is going to be able to jump across to other nearby machine parts too (or may at least fry the PCI bus that the card is plugged into).
The chances of getting a dangerous power surge on a network cable are very low, but if such a surge did happen and was only moderately dangerous then a separate NIC may afford you a little protection (it might pop a chip or other component on the NIC and but not affect the motherboard, were-as on the motherboard most of your I/O tech is controlled from one chip so if it pops everything could go).
We're ranch style now, but in our previous building we had multiple floors and ran fiber between floors instead of copper.
I've never heard the electrical isolation argument and frankly I share the view in the other answers, the scenarios where it might be true are going to be vanishingly rare.
Small surges (perhaps caused by malfunctioning equipment at the other end of the line, or just normal day-to-day random conditions) network adaptors are designed to cope with anyway.
If you're really concerned about power surges passing into your systems, which I have seen, especially in multi-level installs, replace the copper with fiber.
