I've been reading a lot about Nginx, so would that be a suitable addition to our architecture for handing more requests simultaneously?
and updates users at regular intervals with this updated information (every 10 seconds or so via.
So, we've got an AJAX request sending off the lat/long every time the user moves so we can show the marker if they're in the right area.
How do others handle this type of polling using the LAMP stack?
At a set time, all users will be dropped into Google Streetview and they need to run around finding markers.
I'm building a game at the moment that monitors external actions (tweets, FB likes etc.)
The idea of the game is the markers are hidden until the user is near them, and because of this, we can't store these in JS (too easy to view in source).
We've got a few hundred people playing this game at any one time, and expecting more.
We're on a LAMP stack, with 4GB of RAM (we can change this as we're on a cloud), but I was wondering if there's a better, more scalable way of handling this.
Response times are around ~10/20ms, and we're making use of APC, but when we're hitting a few hundred users, the server response time is slowing considerably (especially when these people are running around streetview, and making a request or two, each, every second).
