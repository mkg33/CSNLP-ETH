Download all the dependency RPMs which are not yet installed, put them all in a folder and run your command.
Fedora 13 is long end-of-life, you won't get any packages for that.
As you seem to have been using this machine with little change for several years, perhaps you should move to CentOS.
But I am getting the error "svn-backup-dumps: command not found", Many forms suggests to install 'subversion-tools' to make this command works.
If you've setup package manager and have live internet connection then use it to install SVN for you.
I downloaded package and tried to install , but it shows dependencies, Again I tried to install that particular dependency , again it shows another one ,, is there anyway to install all dependencies in a single shot ?
I written a script to take backup of svn repositories using command "svn-backup-dumps"
Better update (but that probably means reinstalling from scratch).
As a RHEL clone it's management should be mostly familiar to a Fedora user.
Downloaded subversion-tools-1.7.8-1.tar.bz2 and extracted that archive, then copied "svn-backup-dumps" to /usr/sbin , Now the issue is solved!
For stuff that isn't included in CenTOS proper, look at EPEL
