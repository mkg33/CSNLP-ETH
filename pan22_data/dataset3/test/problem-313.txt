I've looked in forums, the doc, and the code, and I'm thinking this isn't currently possible, but maybe I'm missing something, so just to be sure: is there a way to set a group as child of and actor?
I'm trying to make sorta of a strategic game, and I have things like "empires", "kingdoms", ""cities", "buildings", "people", "objects", and I thought initially that maybe would be a good idea make these things actors.
So you'll add to the stage a bunch of Groups (Empires in my exemple) containg themselves other groups (Empire is a Group containing other Groups like Kingdoms, themselves containing other groups and so on..)
But I can't find anything like addActor inside Actor class, or addGroup, it seems there is no way for "kingdoms" to have"cities", for "cities" to have "buildings", for actors to have child actors or child groups.
Everything that can contains one or more type of Actors is a Group.
We don't know which things are containers and what they can contain.
or, in other words, how do I create a hierarchy of actors?
