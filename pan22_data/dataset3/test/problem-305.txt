It seems to me the ideal thing is to cap the number of actions they can use during a day to some reasonable number.
I'd build a system that rewarded spending a chunk of points all in one go.
Determine what your 'ideal' user is doing, and then make the point system reward that.
you might decide that someone could reasonably log in multiple times over an 8 hour period, and tweak the system appropriately.
Or someone might check it before they go to school/work in the morning, check it when they get home, check it again after dinner, and check it before going to bed.
If players spend point to attack other players, and points are limited, the obvious abuse seems to me to be to create multiple accounts.
To do this I'd have a variable recharge rate on the points.
Every time you spend points, the recharge time to get the next point increases... so if a bot is spending points as fast as they get them, it will take longer and longer to get the next one, whereas if a person spends all the point they accumulated overnight before leaving the house in the morning, they will have got them all back by the time they get home from work/school (8-12 hours later).
(2) reward people for logging in multiple times per day
If you successfully manage to limit people to a single account, then the issue with bots to me would be that under your system people can fire them off when they are asleep or at work.
