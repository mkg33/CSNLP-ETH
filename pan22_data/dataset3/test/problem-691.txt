if you want single sign on you will have to deploy ADFS as well.
Problem is, during the setup of AD Connect, the option to Enable Single Sign-On was not available.
I am trying to set up my domain for Single Sign-On to Azure-Connected services (Primarily, SharePoint Online).
For detailed information, here is an official article.
It simply was not on the normal User Sign-In prompt during setup.

Has anyone else seen this, or am I simply missing something?
I see my users in Azure and can sign in using an account.
Did you have to uninstall and reinstall to get the option on the left "User Sign-In" this is all I see
The next logical step for us is to enable Single Sign-On, so that our users are able to connect easier (our users are actually located on a subdomain, which is transparent to them and does not completely match their email addresses).
if you only deploy Azure AD Connect you can configure what is sometimes called Same sign on but not single sign on.
I have already run through the setup for Azure AD Connect and am currently able to synchronize my directory to Azure.
