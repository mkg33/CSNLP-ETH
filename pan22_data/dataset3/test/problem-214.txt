Overall it has been working fairly well, although I'd like to hear some suggestions from gurus who have been working with these sort of circumstances for longer than I have.
You don't mention what kind of perimeter security you have in place.
This prevents an entire class of DoS attacks by preventing an attacker from opening a large number of 'half-open' connections in an attempt to reach the maximum number of file descriptors permitted per process.
By default it's unlimited, which offers no protection.
With Cisco firewalls you can limit the number of embryonic (half sessions) that your firewall will allow before it cuts them off, while still allowing full sessions to go through.
So I'm wondering what the best practices are to approaching these sorts of problems in a corporate environment?
Hardware-assisted load-balancers such as Foundry ServerIron's and Cisco ACEs are great for dealing with huge numbers of the main types of DOS/DDOS attacks but aren't so flexible as software solutions which can 'learn' newer techniques quicker.
Currently I have been using (D)DoS-Deflate to manage such situations on numerous remote servers, along with Apache JMeter for load testing.
One measure which they only mention in passing (and which is worth researching further) is enabling SYN cookies.
The former is somewhat dependent on what exactly you're serving, but usually comes down to some combination of caching, overflow handling (detecting when the servers are "full" and redirecting new connections to a low-resource-usage "sorry" page), and graceful degradation of request processing (so not doing dynamic rendering of images, for example).
Don't host game servers, gambling/porn sites, and other things that tend to get people annoyed.
The latter requires good communications with your upstreams -- have the phone number of your upstreams' NOCs tattooed to the inside of your eyelids (or at the very least in a wiki somewhere that isn't hosted in the same place as your production servers...) and get to know the people who work there, so when you call you'll get immediate attention as someone who actually knows what they're talking about rather than just being some random johnny.
I'm sure those working in the web hosting business have had their fair share of dealing with these situations.
Preventing a DDoS is mostly about not being a target.
