It keeps you from worrying about that if someone somehow got the password for your domain name that he could essentially gain access to the whole system.
This also keeps me from using the account for a second purpose.
Dropbox works on Windows, Mac and Linux, and there are programs that use the passwordsafe format on all three platforms aswell.
I save passwords in passwordsafe (or one of its variants) and keep the passwordsafe database in a folder shared by dropbox.
We use Keepass/Keepassx and the files are stored in a subversion repository, that is only accessible via SSH with key-based authentication.
For a fuller list, see the related projects page that shows platform support for Windows, Windows Mobile, Mac, Linux, BSD, Solaris, perl modules, C# support ...
I use Linux, and mostly use the command line pwsafe and occasionally MyPasswordSafe - both available in the ubuntu repositories.
The account name will match the purpose and may be a long long winded name.
There is no reason that the password database file can't be kept on a network share, and there is an option to open the password file in read-only mode.
I keep the database file on a DropBox volume, so it is accessible from anywhere.
If you keep your password file on the server, what happens when that server fails, or if it stored on the internet, what happens when the internet fails.
(Dropbox syncs files online and across multiple computers).
The original works on Windows, there is a java version that works on Windows, Mac and Linux.
Using the VCS allows us to keep a copy of the password vaults offline and up-to-date.
I use the open source PasswordSafe application for storing my personal passwords.
If I have to do something with it I reset it again knowing that it has a single purpose.
When i am setting up services that are rarely going to need to be logged into i try to use the most obscure password (start of an md5 hash for instance) and then just store it in an encrypted/password protected spreadsheet.
