According to the Intel Processor E2000 Series Datasheet your maximum operating temperature should be 73.3 degrees celsius.
Honestly I would check your heatsink and re-seat it.
When you ran prime95 did you run two tests at the same time or just one?
Since your processor is dual core, you may not have stressed it 100% and your 60 degrees could point to the problem.
In my case, my water pump had broken and the processor kept stalling itself to keep from overheating.
My BSODs had an IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, one referencing the USB driver, and the KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED.
Since you stated that your maximum temperature is 60 degrees I would guess that shouldn't be a problem.
Once you have confirmed that I would run a test like the Windows Memory Diagnostic or memtest86+ to confirm your memory is ok. Again, random BSODs that are unrelated usually have to deal with hardware corruption.
Each message was different and occurred at different times.
That being said, in my personal experience, I was having random BSODs with Vista x64.
Once I fixed the water pump, all of the BSODs went away.
