If you have other issues with this file, you may check this article on file extension prn for further guidance.
A PRN file, which is short for printer, is being generated by a postscript printer.
If you can print the file on Windows, you can install PDF printer driver such as CutePDF, which generates a PDF for you.
Actually .PRN file may be of different type depending on what printer it's generated for (one may use file command to see the details in Linux environment).
To ensure that it's a postscript file, select 'Metafile to EPS converter' or something like as a printer when you 'Print' your .PRN file from a Windows application.
