Unfortunately, you cannot expand stopPunctuation, since content in parentheses (like this) does not lead to a new sentence.
While your code works and uses type signatures, it's missing documentation.
So all in all, well written, but without additional explanation or documentation there is no way to check whether the function actually does what you want.
Documentation and tests are therefore highly welcome.
Your quarrel about the line endings also comes from segment, since it hard-codes the allowed punctuations:

Also, it's not clear why you've added an underscore to replace_.
And your code is missing at least one include for =~.

It's not clear from your description or your code what splitter's intended result will be on a given input.
That being said, the fullstop library is—according to its own documentation—a placeholder library:
I assume that you just forgot to include that import line in your question and it is in your actual code.
