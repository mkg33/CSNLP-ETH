The office is about 700' from the furthest camera, and quite a few are over 500'.
There would be LESS than 250' between each switch.
That might reduce or even eliminate the amount of remote cabling you have to run.
Is this possible, chaining the switches like this?
You could link the Wifi cameras to one or more wifi routers, then run a single cable to the router rather than a whole bunch of cables to all of the cameras.
There are 31 cameras total, with more than 18 of them over 500' from the office.
I have a fairly large (for me) security camera system to install and the cost of cabling is keeping this project cost prohibitive.
Running a single analog video/power cable to each camera requires a LOT of cable.
Some chains would be shorter with fewer cameras and switches.
I have 13 apartment buildings that need to have cameras mounted on the outside of them.
On each building, use IP based cameras, attach them to a small PoE network switch (with power applied at each switch for it's cameras), and then run a single CAT5 cable to the next building into that building switch's uplink port.
Some buildings have 4 cameras, some have 3 and some 2.
The end of each chain would terminate to a video surveillance NVR.
The most switches on a single chain would be 4 with a total of 55 megabits of video data.
I'll outline what I'd like to do, and welcome comments on the feasibility.
