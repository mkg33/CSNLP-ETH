Hence any validating recursive nameserver (such as Google ones) will detect this case as a terminal error hence the SERVFAIL because it may be either a misconfiguration or an active attack, and both case are not discernable externally.
You need to quickly arrange this situation: if you do not understand anything regarding DNSSEC, stop trying to use it, go to your registrar and ask them to remove the DS record from the .COM zone ; if you do really wish to enable DNSSEC on your domain (a worthwhile and noble goal, but not without pitfalls), you need to fix your current configuration.
As long as you stay in the current configuration, your domain name will be broken for any kind of validating recursive nameserver, the situation will never fix itself.
Since dig +trace dekyfinweb.com appears to work, I expect things to clear up when the ttl expires off.
(the lastest case specifically requests not to do DNSSEC validation, and hence things will work, comparison between these 2 cases show that the problem is related to DNSSEC, as well as the dnsviz output above)
and at that IP, port 80 only, an "Under maintenance" page.
In short, the com zone has a DS record for your domain but you do not publish any DNSKEY record.
You have DNSSEC problems, see http://dnsviz.net/d/dekyfinweb.com/WUhiXg/dnssec/
