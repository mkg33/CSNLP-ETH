We use VMware and have enabled features like DRS and HA.
In addition to the SQL Server licenses, WonderWare sells SQL Server Client Access Licenses so clients can 'legally' access the database(s).
The licenses for SQL Server came packaged with WonderWare products (WonderWare Historian for example).
These instances all run on VMware virtual machines.
These features will automatically migrate a running virtual machine from one physical host to another.
Now, none of the SQL Server licenses that came with the WonderWare products we are using are covered by SA; They simply do not offer this option (or at least, they haven't offered it to us in any case).
So, our virtual machines are licensed with a server license and our clients are licensed with a CAL.
In other words, am I violating the terms of my license agreement by using DRS and HA?
My company has 6 instances of SQL Server 2012 Standard.
Microsoft states that you can assign a SQL Server licensed to another 'server' but only after a period of 90 days.
Does migrating a virtual machine (or virtual operating system environment) from one physical host to another qualify as moving a license from one server to another?
