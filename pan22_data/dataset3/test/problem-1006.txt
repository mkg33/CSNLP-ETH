Retrieving the logs via the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard returns a cfn-init.log that includes this:
Googling for the string "Error encountered during build of Infra-WriteApplication2: Command 01downloadVersion failed" returns people asking similar questions, and then saying that it was due to IAM permissions...however, the IAM permissions have not changed since at least September.
As of December 7th (as I said, it was used very infrequently), there's been a problem: an instance will start, and a few minutes later will be terminated.
This has apparently been repeating for the last 6 weeks.
I've verified that the download_source_bundle.py file it's trying to download is valid.
Unfortunately, I don't see any more details about why this command failed anywhere, in any of the logs.
Other lines in the log refer to installing RPMs from https://s3.amazonaws.com, so I do not believe it is an outbound network issue.
Since it's now below the autoscale properties, it'll start another instance...which will terminate a few minutes later.
I'm not 100% that the above command is what is causing the termination, but I see no other errors in the logs.
I have a small Elastic Beanstalk environment, used /very/ infrequently for demos, set up that has worked for years.
To the best of my knowledge, nothing has changed in the environment since September of last year.
