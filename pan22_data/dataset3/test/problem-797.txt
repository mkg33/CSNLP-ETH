If you were to replace it with a high capacity battery, it would take a little longer to charge.
To charge a battery, you need a source voltage that is higher.
That difference of a few tenths of a volt is just a labeling choice; the actual battery voltages are the same.
The values that are used range up or down a few volts, but that 19.5 V value matches what your specific laptop expects to work with.
The charger regulates the power going to the battery.
Assuming that adapter is the original that came with the laptop, its 3.33 A capacity was sized to the laptop's needs.
As long as you replace the battery with another designed for your laptop, it will be fine.
The batteries have the same chemistry, or they wouldn't work right with the charging circuit.
The battery's mAh rating reflects how much energy it is able to store, which translates to how long you can operate the laptop before it runs out of juice.
So a label that says 100-240V means that your country's 220V is in the range it can handle.
You have to look not the battery voltage but the input voltage of your laptop.
A higher mAh rating means you will be able to operate longer before needing to recharge.
When they are fully charged and under no load, they have a slightly higher voltage, which quickly drops to a nominal voltage when you start using it.
I had been charging this with 220v plug socket without any problems.
That adapter needs to handle the utility power in your country.
The new battery's 2600 mAh vs. the original 2670 is a difference of a few percent, which translates to a few minutes difference in run time.
Can you please tell me if I can use this new battery without having to buy an adaptor?
That rating reflects the maximum current the laptop can draw without burning out the adapter.
If you ever need to replace it, you will want one with at least the same capacity.
Different manufacturers sometimes pick different characteristic voltage points to label the battery.
Also, the charger I use says Input: 100-240 V ~1.5A, 50/60 Hz.
The 14.6 V vs. 14.8 V on the battery is immaterial.
Now I am worried whether this would cause a problem.
So bottom line, your new battery should be fine, and you don't need to change anything else.
If the trafo (that's how the "converter" is called) is the original to the product, you don't have to worry about that.
Maybe it's marketing (a higher voltage sounds like you're getting something better, right?).
The power adapter that you plug into the wall converts your household AC voltage to the DC voltage the laptop needs.
The laptop only pulls what it needs when it needs it.
So if you ever need to replace that adapter, you would want another with the same output voltage.
I am sorry if this seems a silly question but I am worried about ruining my laptop.
Any utility voltage in that 100-240 range will produce the labeled output voltage for the laptop.
It's common for those adapters to be sold for use all over the world, where voltage standards vary.
The battery charging circuitry is actually in the laptop.
