What you need to use is the user pointer of the collision shape.
But you need to do something only on collision of specific objects.
where fallRigidBody is a dynamic body - a sphere and earthRigiBody is static body - StaticPlaneShape and sphere isn't touching earthRigidBody all the time.
It seemed to me that there's always a collision with your static plane and other objects.
I also pass positions and collision normal to the listener to achive more fancy effects.
I would like to have detection between two specific objects.
I have got also other objects that are colliding with sphere and it works fine.
I'm familiar with JBullet but as its the java port of the original the concept should be the same.
I have also added after declarations of rigid body:
It doesn't matter if the objects are or aren't colliding.
I have got problem implementing collision callback into my project.
Here's a piece of code from my own engine in java.
I have got normall collision but I want one object to stop or change color or whatever when colides with another.
Here GameEntity is the class I wrap my objects and CollisionListener is another class of mine which I use to implement what collision does.
