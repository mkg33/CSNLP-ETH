Realistically, you can probably expect most if not all of your visitors to have a 1.4 JVM at least, a 1.5 or newer most likely.
I assume the reason for this requirement is the matching JDK version I used to create the applet (I am new to Java).
if you compiled with 1.6.0_24 it would run fine on any 1.6 JVM, not require a JVM update.
Those are out of support by Oracle (formerly Sun), and users should upgrade anyway (and will be forced to when visiting some other website if not yours that uses applets).
Is there a best practice concerning which version of Java to use to make the process of using an applet easy for end-users?
Personally, I'd not bother targeting a 1.4 or earlier JVM any longer.
Theoretically, if you don't want to require anyone to download a new JVM if they already have one, you must target Java 1.0.
Any reading material on this would be very helpful.
Should I be using an older version of Java if I don't require new features?
The fact that my applet requires a Java download/update for users who already have some version of Java installed is a big concern for me; the applets I'm creating slip into a web comic, so it's very disruptive.
Having used the most recent version of Java, it seems as though I am able to assume that most of the readers I get will have to update Java to continue reading/playing.
I recently deployed an applet that seems to require Java 6 Update 24.
