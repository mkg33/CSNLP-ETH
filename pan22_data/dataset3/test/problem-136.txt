I did a bit of googling and found out that Windows 10 has a half-hibernate feature that allows it to boot faster, but requires the partition to be read-only even when Windows has shut down.
Boot Windows, then click on the screen to access the login window.
There is a way to turn this off in the settings, but I can't access the settings as I can't log in!
(That assumes that you already created /media/sda3.)
Boot into Linux and go ahead with clearing your Windows password.
By the way, as mentioned in the article, you will probably have to disable Fast Startup again after each Windows "edition" update.
Once you're able to log into Windows, disable Fast Startup so you won't run into this problem in the future.
In the lower right corner, click the Power icon, then click restart.
If you had used the remove_hiberfile option, such as sudo ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sda3 /media/sda3, then ntfs-3g would have deleted the Windows hibernation file hiberfil.sys for you, which would have solved your problem.
Please note that using an external program to delete the Windows hibernation file is dangerous, because any data saved only to the hibernation file will be lost.
Is there a way to use chntpw while the partition is locked, or alternatively a way of shutting down Windows so that I can write to the partition?
No hibernation data is written by Windows when restarted, only when shut down.
See https://www.windowscentral.com/how-disable-windows-10-fast-startup for how-to details.
On Windows 10 if you hold shift while clicking shut down on the login screen it goes into a full shutdown, which let me write to the partition when I tried it.
I tried using the 'chntpw' software to change/remove the account password, but when I run the program in the correct folder I get the following error:
This procedure is only to be done as a last resort.
The account was just a local account and not a Microsoft account, so I can't recover the password that way.
Before you ran chntpw in Debian, you had to mount the drive with a command like sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sda3 /media/sda3.
On my new laptop I entered a new password for my account the first time I booted Windows.
I am a linux user and have installed Debian alongside Windows.
