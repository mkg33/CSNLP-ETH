However now when the server starts now there is a beeping error code and the server won't boot up.
It previously had 8GB installed (8x 1GB slots) and was working fine.
Furthermore, do note that "ECC" and "buffered" are not the same (but more often than not confused for each other), nor imply each other, and any combination thereof must also be supported by the chipset.
I have an IBM 346 server that can support up to 16GB of memory.
OK, net search says x346 has E7520 and 8 rank limit.
The description of the memory rank is often omitted with cheap memory, or flat out wrong.
Since you have already checked the clock and ECC, verify that the chipset can deal with the the Memory Rank of the particular modules you're trying to use.
It has been ages, but didn't E7500 chipsets have a limit of 12 DIMM ranks?
In laymans terms, this means that you have to look out on how much memory a chip on the RAM module holds, and how many of these chips are on a module.
This code is not listed in any documentation I can find relating to this server.
Reputable manufacturers at least let you determine the Rank on their homepage, should your local dealer have omitted it for whatever reasons.
How should I do to resolve this, and where else could I find information about this specific error code?
