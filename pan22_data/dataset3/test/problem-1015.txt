So I'm guessing that I, somehow, have a bad motherboard, but I figured I'd post on here to see if anyone has any thoughts.
It was working great till Saturday morning when one of my new 750GB drives failed (DOA presumably).
When I turn the power back on the computer just blinks on, then goes off and then repeats that cycle.
That was no big deal though as I had another 750 and my 120GB SSD, it did require reinstalling windows though as I had moved the users folder to the 750GB drive.
Everything was working great and I even got some gaming in.
I tried a different PSU, swapping the memory sticks around and using just the power on button on the motherboard.
Sunday night I put it to sleep and when I wake up Monday it appears that the computer is on.
I finally just decide to switch the power on the PSU.
It is unresponsive to any input so I try restarting it, but that does nothing, so I hold the power button down and that does nothing.
Just bought a new computer last week and got it all setup Thursday night.
I installed some more stuff and then play some games.
So round about 2pm Saturday I was finally ready to start installing games and applications.
I then had to reinstall a few more times to get everything setup right (I don't recall all of them, but one was because I entered in my password wrong and couldn't figure out the right combo).
I put it to sleep that night and Sunday it is working great.
