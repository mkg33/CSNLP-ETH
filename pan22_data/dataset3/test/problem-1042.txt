I do believe there's supposed to be a way to just run xterm over x as well.
For a list of Window managers, look at http://xwinman.org/.
The moment you have x installed, you wouldn't need to use screen to switch - run the programme with an & at the end to start it, use xkill or similar to stop it  (though you could get a keyboard centric window manager of some sort) - and for moving and switching you can treat it just as you would any window.
I would like to run applications which got a gui but without using a desktop environment such as gnome, kde etc.
You can run twm and xterm over a plain vanilla x install - gentoo does this for testing purposes, and run screen on that xterm session that.
It isn't exactly what you want, but it should give you a close enough result.
I was wondering if running X would be enough to run the applications and then use screen so I can switch between different gui applications running.
No matter what form of windowing manager you run, you can still run screen.
When you have chosen which system to work with, then you will need to figure out how to start the system (for the most part it is the same, but each window manager has their own convention).
There is no correlation between screen and a windowing environment ("window manager").
Desktop environments all have a window manager running underneath so you could still choose a different window manager and keep your desktop.
The question then becomes what lose/gain by moving away from a desktop environment to a windowing manager.
