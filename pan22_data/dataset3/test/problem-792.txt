If you want a vendor agnostic test to get your feet wet with, you may want to start with Network+.
In addition to the excellent GNS3 emulator that Peter suggested, you will probably need Packet Tracer, a free simulator from Cisco.
I am looking to learn more in the switching and routing world and I'm trying to understand which kind of certification would be a nice balance between money spent / valuable certificate / a good amount of useful skills for everyday work.
If you want to work with some Cisco gear, you can use Dynagen & GNS3 though you will  need to supply your own copy of IOS (the operating system that Cisco gear runs).
Normally GNS3 would be more than enough but unfortunately it can't emulate Cisco switches (it offers only simple, unmanaged switches).
I am an MCSA and Linux enthusiast planning to give LCP-01 in December.
But this isn't really important, just go with whatever path feels right for you.
Having said that, you can get free access to real Cisco equipment over at the Packetlife Lab (haven't tried it myself).
Most people start with the Cisco CCNA Routing & Switching track.
Real switches and routers definitely give you better insight but GNS3 + Packet Tracer will suffice for the CCNA exam.
Is there a better certification about this subject than cisco's?
People usually suggest the one-exam path if you have some decent networking experience, or the two-exam path if you are more of a newbie.
Of cource CCNA is the way to start but it's made by different exams...
In contrast to what PP is saying, I don't believe it's difficult to pass the CCNA exam without access to real Cisco equipment.
You can find forums, advice etc at the Cisco Learning Network.
This is more of a requirement as you go further up the chain of Cisco certifications (e.g.
