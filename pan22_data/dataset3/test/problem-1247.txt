and the list from SHELL32.dll doesn't seem to contain the icon as well:
(since I have Programs organized into folders of my liking, I've deleted some folders with links "restored" in Programs by update; but it would be weird to store the icon only there)
After a recent update, notepad app lost its icon: it is not displayed in the corner of the window:
In my opinion the correct settings for Notepad.exe should better be:
Could it be located in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs itself?
In the Properties of Notepad, click the button of Change Icon....
in the file system and basically everywhere (the screenshot below is for C:\Windows)
Notepad is not an UWP app if I understand correctly (and notepad is the only app that lost its icon as far as I can see); for start menu (I'm using Open Shell) I tried to set the icon manually and it tells that "notepad.exe doesn't contain icons":
(well, I won't make screenshots covering the whole set, but you got the idea)
Enter as file name %windir%\system32\notepad.exe and press
