There are multiple domains pointing to the same server.
I have been asked by a client to install an ssl cert on a domain that lives on a server he looks after.
This is causing issues with outlook and other services, and I just want rid of it!
So my question is how to find out why the second cert is even being looked at and how to get rid of this connection.
I used certbot to create a certificate for another domain print4.co.uk.
I'm out of ideas and the guy who set the first one up can't remember what he did.
On running a test https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=print4.co.uk the first cert is valid, but there is a secondary cert with the common name of elitemi.co.uk.
Someone before me has used certbot to install a cert for one domain: elitemi.co.uk.
This is a little hard to get across, so apologies if it's unclear.
I have checked the config for print4.co.uk and it doesn't have an entry for the other cert, and as far as I can see there are no defaults set for nginx or nginx.conf to point to the elitemi cert.
