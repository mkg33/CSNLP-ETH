It is up to the admins of any given mail server what email they choose to accept.
I think they're foolish if they don't check SPF records and reject accordingly, but it's up to them.
What I think SPF does do is allow you to disclaim any further responsibility for email that claimed to be from your domain, but wasn't.
It gives just an indication to other servers that the mail is spoofed, but most use this only a one of several factors to decide if the mail should be blocked.
I know some people like DMARC, but I think it's a hideous idea myself, and I won't be reconfiguring my email server to accept/reject based on DMARC; doubtless some people feel the same way about SPF.
The fact that you advertise an SPF record in no way obliges anyone else to honour it.
Any mail admin coming to you complaining that your domain is sending them spam when they haven't bothered to check the SPF record you advertise that would have told them that the email should be rejected can fairly be sent away with a flea in their ear.
Anyone can spoof any email address, but SPF (Sender Policy Framework) gives email service providers & clients the ability to better identify & flag as spam or eventually bounce messages entirely if that is part of their process.
