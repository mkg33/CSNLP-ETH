In previous versions of Windows with the machines belonging to a workgroup I could have achieved this by adding the Steve-VAIO\Steve account to the machine users, power users or administrators group on the Steve-PC machine and vice versa, then granting the appropriate account the desired level of access to the share.
If I choose R, all other machines can copy from the share and if I choose R-W, all other machines can copy from and to the shares.
Now my two machines are called Steve-PC and Steve-VAIO and I have an account called Steve on each.
My question is; how can I have each machine see the Steve account on the other as being equivalent, or at least having the same rights, as the Steve account on the other?
I can set up shares on either of my machines and share them to the home group.
In our home I have a desktop and a laptop, my wife has a laptop and my two sons each have a desktop.
The aim is to be able to create a share on either machine that I can have R-W access to from my other machine while the other machines in the home group will have only R access.
