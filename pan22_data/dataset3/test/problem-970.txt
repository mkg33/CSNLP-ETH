Task Scheduler > Microsoft > Windows > TaskScheduler
There are options on a lot of motherboards letting you wake your PC up at specific times.
You may check in task scheduler processed to automatically run:
By default the maintenance is set to 3 am and automatic wake up at this time is enabled.
One of the usual culprits is Windows Media Center Update(mcupdate_scheduled).
The little known powercfg command can help you find out what's causing it.
Right there you will see the settings that is so arrogantly starts your PC in the middle of the night.
My suggestion would be to check your Task Scheduler in windows 8 and see if any tasks (usually updates) are set to start around 3:00am and disable them.
You can either disable automatic wake up or change the time.
