Are USB ports grounded or anything that would protect them?
Often when I reach to plug it in, there is a small electric shock (especially during winter).
The external shield for the connection pins is required to connect to the ground wire that runs through the cable.
The short answer is that unprotected electronic equipment can be damaged or distroyed by static electricity.
Yes, USB cables are grounded, provided your computer itself is grounded.
Cheap imported electronics like USB hubs for $5 probably don't include such protection so it is always a good idea to be careful.
I have a USB cable that I plug my iPhone into while I'm at my desk.
That is why when you buy memory or other chips they are in special static safe packages and require special handling during installation.
Most all of the top quality devices and most average devices will include ESD protection on the USB and other connectors to protect against static.
I know that electrical equipment can be damaged by small electric discharges.
It sounds like you are experiencing a discharge of static electricity built up by walking on the carpet etc.
