Then I thought it must be the driver but I successfully installed Mint 18.3 on the new drive in the Lenovo laptop and the device is recognised by the BIOS, so that cannot be it?
Does anyone have any idea what this problem is and what can I do to resolve?
I am trying to replace the hard drive on a Lenovo Ideapad 100s.
This is also seen in the command prompt Diskpart at this stage of the installation, but I cannot make any changes to the drive as I get the error "File not found".
But as soon as i place into the Lenovo laptop, I always get the same result.
I have checked on Lenovo Support Website and this drive is listed as a suitable replacement.
I have booted the laptop (to commence the windows installation from USB) in UEFI and Legacy with the same result.
I have used Windows Explorer / Computer Management / Diskpart in Windows 10 (laboureous as this is the drive I want to replace), windows 7 desktop and windows 7 Netbook to format, convert to GPT, partition, delete partition, create volumes, delete volumes and so on.
It allows me to clean the drive, saying clean successful, but a new command list disk shows no changes, still size 0 free space 0
My understanding is that SATA interfaces are backwards compatible, so if the drive is SATA I (laptop has SATA II Interface) then it should still work (I think the replacement drive may actually be SATA I).
I have used Linux Mint 18.3 to do the same and every time the disk is visible, accessable and correct with 298GB of unallocated space / free space as a single volume, 2 partitions and unallocated space and any other variation that I could think of trying.
The new disk is a WD3200BUCT and is seen in BIOS, however when starting install, windows set up shows Drive 0 Unallocated space Total size 0 and free space 0 "windows cannot be installed on this drive" (the partition is too small).
Is is simply no more complicated than I should replace like for like and replace the old drive with the exact same model and capacity?
