We use a SAS connected Powervault 124T with a LTO-4-120 drive in it.
I believe I was talking about the Quantum SuperLoader 3 with and LTO-4 element when I wrote that comparison you're referring to.
A simple RAID-0 or RAID-10 of SATA disks ought to be fast enough to stream data to an LTO-4.
I am not sure who outside of Quantum and IBM even makes drives anymore.
We're an HP shop to begin with, so I'm biased, but if you're in the same boat you'll probably want to go with HP as well.
If you can't feed the LTO-4 fast enough you may want to consider getting some "nearline" disk and doing disk-to-disk-to-tape backups in lieu of attempting to pull directly from the source servers to the tape.
We also looked at the Dell TL2000, but couldn't justify the price delta.
I would not use tape based backup again unless there is some amazing drop in prices.
And at $2800 you can swap it out and keep using the LTO3 tapes until you've exhausted your current supply then switch to the LTO4 tapes (or switch now if you need the storage now).
I have Customers with the LTO-3 version of that SuperLoader 3 model and it's been a real champ.
I'd recommend getting an extended service plan on the unit for the desired operational lifetime.
Theoretically, using the slower LVD interface shouldn't slow down the drive any, but I wouldn't bet on that.
It'll add some cost, but I wouldn't gamble with not having replacement capability available in case of failure after the initial 1 year warranty.
We just bought the internal version of the HP EH922SB yesterday after searching around a bit.
It is available with a Ultra 160 LVD SCSI interface as well.
Hardware setup was a breeze; we are using it with BackupExec.
However, I will tell you that we switched from LTO to hard drives over a year ago.
We did have to have it replaced once, but other then that we are pretty happy with it.
