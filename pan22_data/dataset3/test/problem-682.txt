As of version 9.3, you'll still need to keep your existing configuration for printing of AR Receipts -- there's a bug that causes them to not print properly to server-based print queues.
ntp.exe is part of the standard MUNIS (product) installation, and, as far as I know, is a product of MUNIS (company), now Tyler Technologies.
A compiler signature that is shared with some of the vendor's other files might be enough to attribute authorship.
HP has a nice PCL reference on their site that I pulled this from.
The other thing you can do, obviously, is just ask the vendor.
The string '\033E\033&l1S' is a PCL reset followed by a Simplex/Duplex toggle to long-edge binding duplex.
If you haven't searched it for strings yet, do so.
It appears to be a remote print queue control CLI for Windows NT print servers.
Rather than fighting with ntp.exe, I'd recommend upgrading to MUNIS 9.1 or higher.
Unfortunately they do not specify where it came from or any docs, but perhaps this adds some clarity to the discussion.
I've never heard of it, personally and I think it came from your vendor.
In terms of sending a duplex command, I suspect you could use the -u argument to supply a different initialization string that contains the PCL duplex command.
I found some MUNIS release notes that reference ntp.exe.
Here is a mention of it in a Yahoo Group from 1996: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/lprng/message/1800
It (properly) supports server-based print queues, and you can set the printing defaults on those queues as you would on any other windows print queue.
