I found a really good article here about this subject in detail and relates it specifically to NAS'
I imagine the most common issue you might find is that the drives will not spin up in the amount of time the NAS expects, at which point it will kick the drive out of the array, causing a costly rebuild of the array once you add the drive back into it.
It seems that I was correct in assuming that home/small office NAS' use software raid internally and he comments that software raid is more tolerant  than hardware raid.
I asked a friend who has a QNAP 4 bay NAS which type of drives he used and he went for standard desktop drives from Seagate.
I have read comments around the web that say that unlike hardware raid, linux software raid (mdadm) will not drop drives that stop responding which would happen if the drive went into error recovery and which TLER is meant to prevent.
It depends on your needs, and whether or not the NAS is designed for consumer drives as well as raid drives.
After reading this, I would buy Hitachi Deskstar 5K3000s.
If you mean SAS drives, no, you do not have to stump up the cash for them for home single-user use.
Therefore a desktop drive will work in a DS211 NAS.
The NAS might also have options that allow you to tune these kinds of timeout values so that this issue doesn't arise.
Normal SATA drives should do, and using RAID will give you some protection against HDD failure.
Based on this and the responses this guy received from Synology etc, it would seem that it may not be such an issue at all.
