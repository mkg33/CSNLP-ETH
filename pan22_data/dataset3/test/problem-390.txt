You're going to have to go into windows server to format your C partition, afterwards depending on how you set up your boot system you might have to repair your boot.
If, after booting from your H partition, you can see your C drive and the files therein, then your C partition is mounted and you'll have to unmount it as described in a previous answer before you can delete it.
System partitions (and other partitions that are in use) can't be removed, so you obviously have to boot from the OS in H:.
Even though you boot from the H partition and aren't "in" your C partition, your C partition may still be "mounted", meaning it is still "in use".
Try removing the drive letter (in Administrative Tools/Disk Management), and then remove the partition.
Booting off of an ubuntu live CD and using gparted should work well if you're comfortable with that route.
Of course, make sure you have a backup of everything.
If you are unable to unmount it, then some program may be "in" your C drive or using a file in your C drive.
The partition can't be removed when it is mounted.
