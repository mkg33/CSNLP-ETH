I would recommend using the existing MacOS X install, and looking at the built in unix features.
It's a simple command-line tool that will compile and build applications for you.
Sorry for posting this as an answer, I don't have commenting privileges on this board.
Also, I'm not exactly sure what I should do before reformatting to make sure that all of my files are going to be readable.
But Mac OS X is after all a certified (BSD-based)UNIX built on closed and open source components.
A friend of mine gave me the 8.1 disc1 iso file and said that's all I need, but I'm a little confused on how to reboot with it.
The open source part is the Darwin kernel which contains FreeBSD code among other things.
It's my first time ever reformatting and I want to do this right.
You are risking losing all of your data and rendering your computer inoperable.
I attempted to install PC-BSD on my Macbook Pro 13" Early 2011 Intel Sandy Bridge/HD 3000 i3.
PS: Using time machine will store all of my files correct?
Installation was unsuccessful due to the motherboard and other components not being supported by the kernel.
PC-BSD is in fact FreeBSD 7.2 in disguise with a GUI installer and features applications that can be downloaded as pre-compiled binaries (PBI).
I am asking for help finding the resources to do this without damaging my computer.
The aqua interface and quartz graphics layers are pure Apple.
Plus I really like the aesthetic qualities of KDE.
My next computer will not be a macintosh, so I would like to get familiar with other GUIs.
The operating system is much prettier, and nicer to the end user - and it includes almost all of the FreeBSD functionality out of the box (what's not there, you can easily obtain from the web).
I was not born knowing how to externally boot a computer.
You state that you do not know how to boot from a CD, and you seem to misunderstand what the process of formatting does, or how it relates to re-OSing your computer.
Have you thought about installing MacPorts or Fink?
Installing a new operating system, especially on a MacBook, is an extremely dangerous operation.
I would recommended using MacPorts to port over yours favourite FreeBSD applications to OS X.
I understand that these two operating systems are fundamentally similar but I am learning GNU right now and I want to get more involved with Open Source software.
I found this to be the best solution for me anyway.
Does anyone know of any simple beginner guides that could get me through this tonight?
Is it not true that I can transfer backed up files back to to my computer and reboot Snow Leopard from an external drive if I change my mind?
