Partially it is the fact that some updates are rolled out faster then they should be.
When you test software, you test against a range of normal and abnormal inputs and then you're ... ready for beta.
Lots of other software probably has similar or more numbers of bugs, but they're not usually exploitable since you need to convince a user to expose them to the wild internet.
It's impossible to test for all interactions, because you'd need the entire Internet -- present and future -- in your test suite.
Your browser has to run code/markup, plugins, etc., deal with user input, plugins that run code, etc.
But one prevailing fact is a blog post Jeff posted awhile back here when ran as admin anything can happen.
Also as chris says, that's where the money's at, meaning that browsers are a very interesting target.
Also since each computer is different running different things it isn't always the browser itself that has an exploit.
Many answers here, all touching on different reasons, but the fundamental answer is "because that's where the money's at."
dmckee's answer is right on, but it can all be summed up with one thing: complex interaction with unexpected inputs.
