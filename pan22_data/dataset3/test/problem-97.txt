There are several companies that manufacture hard drive cradles that you just plug a drive into directly.

Actually, it looks like the company that makes the tray you described also has "docks", too: http://www.icydock.com
The ones I have seen are single-drive only, so may not be exactly what you're looking for.
Depending on what interfaces you are looking to connect with, NewerTech has the Voyager line of External 2.5" & 3.5" Hard Drive Dock Solutions.
They have a range of interfaces from Firewire800/400, USB 2.0 and eSATA for connections to multiple types of machines.
They've got some sweet looking multi-disk external enclosures there, as well as "docks" like the StarTech that I have.
I'm not aware of any that the drive goes inside like you're showing, but I have one of these and realy like it:

I wonder if there is trayless external hard drive enclosure available?
I use in my Server a trayless hard disk rack, something like this: http://www.raidsonic.de/en/pages/products/mobile-racks.php?we_objectID=4343
