Linq to XML has excellent support for managing those kinds of files, both  creating, parsing and querying.
There you can see how declarative style could minimize the code to write by attaching Attributes to the Game-Class and/or its properties.
You have basically created a procedural implementation of your own mechanism to serialize a game object to and from a file wich is ok if you want to be in full controll of the file format.
I would rename the methods GetGameID(), GetGameLength(), GetGameMap()... because they look like getters, that could be called in any order, while they are actually performing parsing and must be called in a given order.
If you were saving the log in binary perhaps it could be excused but seeing as you're working with text files, why not go with xml?
Have you looked at the concept of dotnet-serialisation?
ReadAllText method, as MSDN says: Opens a text file, reads all lines of the file into a string, and then closes the file.
Seems like you're doing a lot of unecessary and standard managing of a simple logfile.
