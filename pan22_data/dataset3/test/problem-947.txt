As studiohack suggested, It might be a resolution problem, could you post your default screen resolution?
The date should be displayed by default, no matter what part of the screen you select for your taskbar.
Changing that to Smaller - 100% fixes the problem and as a bonus it throws the day of the week in there too, but makes things very very small.
I had the "Appearance and Personalization" / "Display" setting set to Medium - 125% (default).
Any other thoughts on tweaking the date display here would be appreciated.
Right click the taskbar --> properties --> Uncheck "Use small icons" --> the date will appear also.
However, there's a little more information so i'll post it here.
On my widescreen system (Windows 7, 1440 x 900 resolution, small icons), I have both the date and the time:
If you're using Windows 7, right click on the desktop - Gadgets - Calendars.
I just tried every possible combination and I always get the date right below the clock.
Try going to Taskbar Properties, click Customize and select Restore default icon behaviors.
I prefer this rather than widening your taskbar (so ugly) or using large icons (uglier).
I'm going to accept studiohack's answer since it is basically right.
Well, back at the Medium 125% setting, i changed the short date format to M/d/yy and it's pretty close to what i want.
