In Windows, this seems to be only possible using task manager.
4)kill particular task/application by taskkill /f /im taskname
You can kill tasks using command prompt just like linux terminal.
If you're using Windows 10, you can switch to another desktop using Win+Tab and then open the task manager in desktop 2 to kill the full screen application in desktop 1.
I couldn't resolve it with any of the above but finally tried using a Snipping Tool keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Print Screen) and that somehow kicked it out of whatever it was stuck in.
In Linux, I can just switch over to terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and use the terminal to forcefully close a misbehaving program.
If a frozen window is set to stay-on-top and full-screen mode, Alt+Tab and Alt+F4 don't work and I can't even use the Task Manager.
If I had important work in the background, say, and I'd forgotten to save it, I can't just restart the computer!
Eg: If you want to kill notepad, type taskkill /f /im notepad.exe
I've been using Windows forever, but one thing that has annoyed me is how hard it is to terminate misbehaving full-screen applications.
This works even if the application is set to stay-on-top.
I had to hit the Windows key, then in the search bar, type: c:\windows\system32\cmd /c taskkill /f /im snippingtool.exe
