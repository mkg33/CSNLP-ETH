The downside, of course, is that if I need a rescue OS over PXE, I need to first log in over IPMI, come into the firmware setup, and change the boot order back.
If I press enter with "debian" selected here, I get grub loading, and indeed, the system boots up completely and correctly!
The expected behavior is that the PXE will exit and pass the torch on to the next item in the boot order.
When I just turn on the server and let it go, I get this:
How do I convince the server to boot up Debian from power on without manual intervention?
When I set UEFI:debian as the first entry in the boot order, it boots all by itself, no intervention needed.
So it looks like, for some reason or another, having the PXE firmware be first in the boot order (which is how it was when I first got the server) breaks UEFI booting.
However, if I "force" (override) the boot order, either in the setup screen or by pressing F11 to access the boot menu, it works:
The highlighted one in white is the one I want to boot.
Note that the PXE is not currently booting to anything, and the default configuration from my hosting provider is to have the PXE at the top of the boot order to allow a "rescue" PXE environment to be loaded using the control panel.
