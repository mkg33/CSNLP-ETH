Your OEM will have affixed the COA with the needed key to the computer.
Beware that if you bought the system pre-installed, the distributor most likely used their product key for the initial setup, which won't work with your installation media.
The product ID is completely different from the actual product key, and the latter cannot be derived from the former.
As others have noted, your only real choice is to purchse a new copy of Windows 7 and likely re-install as the key for a retail copy will not work with the OEM install.
Win 7 stores the key in the registry ("HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentrentVersion\DigitalProductId"), but it's binary so that your average 'human' doesn't interfere with MS's quest for more money.
You can get it out with a little VB Script though.
), as well as the locale; it is used when getting technical support from Microsoft, it does not prove ownership of a Windows licence.
The product key is stored in the registry, and you can retrieve it from there with tools like KeyFinder.
Unfortunately, I lost the Windows case where the key is at, so I am wondering if there is a way to retrieve the product key just by using the Product ID?
I re-installed my Windows 7 installation and I am being asked for the Product Key.
If not, then I'm afraid your only option is to buy a new copy of Windows, since you've lost or erased all traces of your previous licence.
The product ID is generated during installation and contains information like the exact Windows version, channel the licence came from (retail, OEM, MSDN etc.
If you backed up your previous Windows installation, then you should be able to use a utility like Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder to load the correct registry hive and read the product key.
Save the code below as eg "getkey.vbs", run it (double-click) and a little pop-up msg tells you your key.
But alas, stupid me, I had jotted down the Product ID and not the actual Product Key.
I don't know about win8 or win10, but theoretically all you need to do is change the 'registryLocation' value in the code (if at all).
