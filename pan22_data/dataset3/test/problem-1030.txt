Connect scan uses the system call of the same name to scan machines, rather than relying on raw packets as most of the other methods do.
3) Finally the reason why nmap stops the scan is because IMCP Type 8 (echo a.k.a ping) doesn't return an ICMP Type 0 (echo reply).
Can you please try those commands and post the output ?
1) To figure what is happening with  your machine I would suggest using the extra verbose mode (-vv) or --packet-trace to see what happens.
It is usually used by unprivileged Unix users and against 1Pv6 targets because SYN scan doesn't work in those cases.
This is far and away the most popular scan type because it the fastest way to scan ports of the most popular protocol (TCP).
2) Another approach would be to force an unprivileged scan as privileged user using the following commands and see the result.
By default an unprivileged scan uses -sT (TCP Connect) while privileged (root) uses -sS (TCP SYN Stealth).
It is stealthier than connect scan, and it works against all functional TCP stacks (unlike some special-purpose scans such as FIN scan).
