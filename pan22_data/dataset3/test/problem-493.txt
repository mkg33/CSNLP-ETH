I've only used it with CD/DVD devices, so I don't know how well it will work for you.
We have a xfs partition over a hardware RAID that stores our RAW HD Video.
Of course that can be either good or bad, or a mix :)   I don't have a direct comparison, but I've asked the nocache folks for one
then, you can start whatever application you want with
Most of the shoots are 50-300gb each so the linux cache has a hit-rate of 0.001%.
there is a solution which perfectly fits your use case: http://code.google.com/p/pagecache-mangagement/
Note that the similar tool pagecache-mangagement - A tool to permit the management of the pagecache usage of arbitrary applications, as noted by rmetzger, is still in the same state as it was in 2008.
I have tryed the sync option but it still fills up the cache when copinging the files.
If you require this for certain applications then they should be modified to pass O_DIRECT to their open(2) calls.
The nocache tool is designed for a similar goal: preventing specific commands from spoiling the current buffer cache.
How do i disable the linux file cache on a xfs partition (both read an write).
You can bind a raw device that bypasses the cache with that.
