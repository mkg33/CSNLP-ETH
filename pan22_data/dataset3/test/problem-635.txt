Regardless, you won't be able to install/run 64-bit software from within a 32-bit runtime.
Which you should be able to do by booting from the Win8 install disc, assuming your CPU is 64-bit capable.
A 32-bit operating system will boot/run the CPU in "protected mode", while 64-bit software requires that the CPU operate in "long mode".

It just seems to be more responsive for some reason.
To check whether or not your PC is "good" for a 64-bit OS, you'll have to find out which CPU you have, which you can do with System Properties (hit WINDOWS KEY+PAUSE).
This would most likely rule out the ability to perform an "upgrade install" as well.
In short, you need to install from a native 64-bit runtime.
If you have 2GB or 3GB RAM, even with a 64-bit capable processor, I would install the 32-bit of Windows 8 Pro.
However, upgrading from a 32-bit OS to a 64-bit OS (even on a PC that supports 64-bit operating systems) is not supported as far as I know.
Then look up the CPU that you're using and see if it supports x86-64.
Is your CPU 32-bit, or just your current install of Win7?
he can't run any 64-bit os,because of his cpu doesn't meet hardware requirements for 64-bit os.that cpu doesn't support Hardware Virtualization Technology,as you can see on Intel's page above.
If it does (most modern CPUs do) then you're good to go.
