The result was that you could always be prepared for a shootout and and that some waste was acceptable, but 1-round mags were totally averted.
The reason for this is that we wanted the game to be very tense and give the marine players  much more to worry about.
A lot of games encourage reloading before the clip is empty because this would be faster then let the system autoreload on empty magazine (Some more engagement of the player, because he has to monitor his clip and press the reload button instead of just holding down a button).
Call of Duty, in recent years, has been a great example of this philosophy.
In tactical design, teamwork, tradeoffs, and thinking as you play are vaunted, but you lose some of the addictive adrenaline.
I was involved in the development of the halflife2 mod hidden-source, which enforces the 'full reload' strategy.
Lone wolf, run-and-gun styles that make very little sense outside of that game world, or even in it, but are a cheap hook to get lots of players.
In short, there are two main stylistic camps; tactical and adrenaline.
This sort of design is often more popular with smaller studios who can make non-mainstream calls like that.
This let them focus each weapon on role rather than a hierarchy.)
Give them lots of ammo, tie ammo to mags, and let them sort it out!
If the game is planned for the second demographic in the above example, then a realistic reload system would just frustrate the players.
People want to think that when they shoot 6 bullets, after reloading it should be -6, and not -whatever magazine size is.
The conclusion is that you should use whatever fits your overarching vision for the game.
One could argue that during a fight, no soldier would do this.
While in a survival or sim, you want the real experience, and make a conscience disission if you want to have the benefit of a full clip during a burst/support or you rather preserve ammo
But no soldier would throw away a half emptied magazine either, there are no benefits for him doing that, except maybe that he is more capable of performing a longer burst/support.
We wanted to discourage spray-and-pray tactics by giving firing your weapon a large cost.
Adrenalin design is much like it sounds, almost the candy of video games.
Except maybe for a revolver, it would reload faster with less bullets to fill the "magazine"
Allowing them to reload partial magazines gave them too much freedom and changing damage/lowering ammo count made the weapons and the marine loadouts look unprofessional and unrealistic.
Actually in real life you use a dump pouch where you can quickly drop a non-empty magazine so you can refill it when there's a break in combat.
This allows clever players who aren't necessarily as "twitchy" to stand on a level field with their hair-trigger foes.
However, some games, such as Halo, use the magazine limit as a sort of damper on weapon effectiveness for balance.
A great example is Frontlines: Fuel of War, where the assault rifle loadout got about a dozen magazines and half dozen launcher grenades.
There are people who enjoy playing realistic military simulators, and there are others, who enjoy more arcade-style shooters.
(For example, in Halo Combat Evolved, most human guns were good for 4 kills per magazine if every shot hit.
The reason is that games usually have an audience they wish to target.
I think you have to make a difference between a simulator or survival, versus a more arcade game.
There are plenty of video games using realistic reloading, but they usually have a different playing style as they target a different audience (these usually have other realistic settings, like bullet ballistics, reduced carrying capacity, more lethal wounds, no easy healing, horrible accuracy while moving, etc.
Refilling or redistributing cartridges would probably not be well received by most modern gamers but if you are going for a more realistic take then I'm sure military personnel and gun-nuts would appreciate your focus on detail.
Instead of throwing your magazine away, couldn't developers choose to make reloading a half-emptied magazine longer.
This sort of design is often pursued by large, established studios where executive meddling is more rampant.
Since the player would need to remove bullets from a full magazine and place them in a half empty magazine.
Because they consider magazines very similarly to cool-down or spin-up, they don't use them as units of ammo like in the real world.
