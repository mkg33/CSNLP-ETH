This can be done manually appending your id-rsa.pub to /root/.ssh/autorized_keys (on CentOS), or automagically running ssh-copy-id on Cygwin.
However, failure to authenticate via authorized public key manifests as repeated password prompts, which can be confusing.
Setting it to "without-password" has the effect of only allowing root to log in through ssh by having an authorized public key in place, which keeps Mallory from attempting to brute-force root's password.
Also, be aware of the PermitRootLogin option available in the server-side /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, which is described,
You overwrote root@xxx.xxx.xx.xx public key with your Cygwin public key.
You should, instead, add your public key to root@xxx.xxx.xx.xx authorized keys.
It will prompt for your password and then you should be fine.
Also, you should recover root@xxx.xxx.xx.xx public key, or generate a new pair, if it's not inconvenient.
I am trying to get passwordless SSH authentication to work from a Windows 7 machine to local server.
