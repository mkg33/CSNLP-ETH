I have not thoroughly tested this but it's been working for me.
To make this permanently available, you can easily make a automatically loading add-in:
When the text is just the right size the extra row is there to hold the LF character.
(Why they picked size 11 as the new default, I have no idea.)
In my experience, Excel has this problem with certain fonts and font sizes more than others.
Take your example and change the font to Courier while leaving size at 11.
I think Excel is trying to auto-fit in a way that will ensure everything is almost always visible no matter your zoom level.
Resizing the column width as other people have suggested will resolve that cell's issue, but if your spreadsheet has lots of varying size values in this same column, it is possible that your fix for this cell will cause another cell in the column to have the problem.
Courier is worse than Courier New, size 11 is generally worse than 10 or 12.
Essentially it will auto adjust all sheets then go back through and set the column width to the original width, unless it's been extended by the auto adjust.
It's the hidden LF character that is at the end of every field.
I only had 10 columns and never more than 1000 rows so adjust the code as needed.
I assigned it a shortcut key (Ctrl-Shift-J) and it works like a charm for me.
If you reduce the zoom percentage to anything less than 100% (99% for example.)
select all cells, and click on the line that separates the rows twice... it'll automatically do it.
That isn't the only problem you will have with AutoFit.
As you can see, cell A1 appears to be given 1.5 extra lines.
In addition, the way a word-wrapped cell is printed won't always match what you see on screen.
