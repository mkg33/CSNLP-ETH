I work in an office complex that has two seperate ADSL connections, which they use to provide two seperate networks (actually both the ADSL routers go into a Cisco managed switch with two VLANs, one for each ADSL connection).
Zyxel P-663H) which will support two internet connections and balance outbound sessions across the two links.
It would obviously mean changing public IP etc, but your new IP would be spread across the two connections, not dependant on either line seperately.
Circumstances have changed so that 95% of the users are all on one ADSL connection.
So, is there a sensible way to take two completely seperate ADSL lines and use them to provide a single internet gateway?
Basic algorithm for choosing line switches between them for each connection.
The alternative is to swap to an ISP who can bond lines so that each line is properly bonded.
Balancing inbound traffic resiliently is a lot harder, since you have to publish an IP address for each inbound service, and those IPs can only ever be associated with one link.
It will work on any BT line that can have broadband.
For example first connection goes thru line A, second thru line B, third thru line A, etc.
This algorithm needs support only on your site - your router.
When new connection appears, loadbalancer decides which ADSL line will use.
Are there any more specific reasons why you wouldnt want to move ISP?
And if you went for a bonded provider that does it without using MLPPP then you don't have to worry about linux boxes or unsupported equipment in the future.
Ecessa makes some reasomnably priced load balacer/failover devices.
It would definitely be worth considering a fully bonded connection.
For IP routing reasons this almost always involves NAT, although if you're already using NAT that shouldn't be an issue for you.
It would be great if there were a way to join together both connections to emulate a single connection at double the speed, but the ISP doesn't support bonding.
