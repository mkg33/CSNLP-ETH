When proxy_pass sends the request to starman, i'm expecting it to set SCRIPT_NAME.
Instead when you make a request to example.com/ff/home PATH_INFO is set to /home (as expected) and SCRIPT_NAME is '', so the application generates a redirect to example.com/home instead of example.com/ff/home
At this point I'm ready to just flip over to fastcgi but i'm stubborn and want to figure out if this is possible.
request => [ nginx, proxy_pass ] => [ starman:5000 ] => [ perl_app ]
This affects the urls generated by the application.
If I were using fastcgi, i would do fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME something or use fastcgi_split_path_info.
It needs to know where it is mounted so that it can properly generate the urls.
I have a perl catalyst application that i'm mounting on a specific url (vs mounting on a subdomain) and am having problems setting SCRIPT_NAME on the request to the backend.
I've attempted to set fastcgi_params anyway just to see if it would affect the SCRIPT_NAME sent with proxy_pass but it doesn't as far as I can tell.
So the application is on example.com/ff and the should redirect to example.com/ff/login if you try to go to example.com/ff/home without being logged in.
