You can use opsview community instead of pure nagios if the infrastructure must be managed by people without linux/unix skills.

It scales well, and there is support for it in Windows.
On enterprise server hardware you can use tools like the insight manager (HP), opemange (dell) and have the passive checks query those tools.
If you need to burn cash for support, you may also get it.
With those tools you monitor all hardware in the servers (except if you add other hardware yourself, obviously).
Opsview is nagios with a nice interface, but all the plugins for nagios just work with opsview.
Just download the vmware image and start monitoring from the web interface.
While not directly designed to monitor disks you can use SNMP for this kind of monitoring.
I would probably use nagios with passive checks if I could not set a nagios server on the remote network.
you could setup nagios and put it behind a password protected website page ?
Off the top of my head ZenOSS, HP OpenView come to mind.
check_openmanage does that for dell servers and check_hpasm for HP hardware.
