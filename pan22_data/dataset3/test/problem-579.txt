Obviously just watch out for mem usage running all those VM's.
You could use one of them as a router/dhcp-sever/whatever for the network which would save you buying a piece of hardware.
Dunno what host OS you're using but to decent choices of VM software are VirtualBox and of courseVMWare
Each of these machines can then pretend to be on your local network or you can create a network just for them.
Yes its very possible to do this with a bunch of VM's.
Any ideas on if this is possible / how I would do this?
The article cleared up my understanding of how networks work, but there is still a lot I don't understand and I'd quite like to have a go at setting up a network that I can play about and experiment with.
Hamachi is very popular on the gaming scene allowing people to play a game as if they were on the same LAN together.
My first though was to buy myself an expensive hub / switch and play around with whatever old computers I could scrounge, but then I wondered if I would be better off creating a "Virtualised" LAN (not sure what the correct terminology is) between some VMs
I've just finished reading an article on ARP spoofing, and I've become intregued by the subject.
You can look at vmware appliances to download some ready made images of servers.
