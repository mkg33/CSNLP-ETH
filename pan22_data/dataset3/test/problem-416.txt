Ensure you have a valid product key and/or get a utility to read it from registry.
You could omit the count=10000 and do the whole drive, but that takes hours and is unnecessary for the task at hand.
Download the Media Creation Tool from Microsoft and create a bootable USB, NOT the same stick as step 1 as this one will be reformatted.
Make sure you don't accidently select your USB stick or another drive.
In this case with the installation screen up press F8 or is it F10.
There is a slight chance windows may not allow this.
First back any import documents up to a USB stick that isn't encrypted.
If that fails hold down the SHIFT key and press those buttons.
This wipes out ALL DATA including traces of encryption, and make the disk appear blank.
You can run gparted (some include this) to verify which drive you want to clear.
Boot of the USB stick from step 2, and attempt to format the drive, and install windows.
You may or may not have to restart, but the drive should be free of encryption.
