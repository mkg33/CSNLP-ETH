Just to be sure I uninstalled the newest update to no avail.
I set my routers firewall setting to low and all the sudden it started working again.
The exception I am getting is "Remote Desktop can't connect ot the remote computer for one of the following reasons..." in researching I found some older posts which pointed to older updates... but nothing recent.
Also please note that I am a developer... so I am still learning the technical side of Servers and Networks
I know it's not just the domain as I am unable to even log into other domains as well.
After hours and hours trying to figure this out...
All the machines I am trying to login to are Azure VM's my machine is using Windows 8.1
I did do an update earlier today... but it's weird that it would be working fine one minute then cut me out the next.
Any help would be greatly appreciated as I have a tight deadline to make today.
This doesn't tell me why all the sudden it cut me off in the middle of a session.... but it will have to work for now.
I was literally in the middle of a remote desktop session doing work when all the sudden the session disconnected and now I can not log back into any session anywhere.
