Now I do have IIS installed and plan on setting up websites in the future, for now there is only the default site installed.
I think you're going to run into major issues running both IIS and VisualSVN, which installs and runs on Apache, on the exact same server.
If yes, try to disable it (RRAS uses SSTP by default and it listens for 443 port and lsas.exe process which is using port in your situation is used for IPSEC also).
Sorry for the bad wording in the title, 'doesn't help' is not allowed as a title, I am definitely able to stop IIS.
When I stop the website the listing for port :http and :80 disappear from netstat and Process Explorer, 433 is still there though.
Same goes for stopping the entire IIS server in the Manager window or just stopping the IIS service(s).
If I were you, I'd separate them out and give each web server their own VM.
Do you have routing and remote access service installed?
After looking through dozens of forum entries and checking netstat (screengrab) I was only able to find out that PID 4 caused the issue, and Process Explorer confirmed the port being listened in the properties window (screengrab).
Now in all those posts Process Explorer was referred to for finding out which service is the culprit, but I cannot really figure out which service in particular opened the port, all I can really see is the listing under TCP/IP.
I know this doesn't directly answer your question but I'm wondering if your original posted problem is not a symptom of trying to run both web servers on the same VM.
While trying to install VisualSVN I ran into the problem that port 443 was already open.
