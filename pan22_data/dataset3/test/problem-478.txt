It can have bad headers, messed up MIME encoding, etc., which trigger a reject without a bounce because the email is taken to be possibly malicious if it isn't following the relevant RFCs for email format.
If you are getting a "250 OK Sent" type of status on your end, the only thing you can do is have the client at host B talk to their service provider, ISP, or IT department and ask what is happening to their email and why.
Try to look in the maillog of the MTA on the CMS system and any secondary MTA system accessible to you which is used for SMTP relay.
Only the remote site's logs will tell the story when they are not bouncing the email back to you.
You are not going to learn anything from a packet capture unless you have a MTA you wrote yourself that needs debugging.
Do you get an 250 OK status for delivery of the mail to the remote host B?
If not, we need more detail on what was the error in your log to tell you more.
The problem can be that the next hop doesn't like your email.
If so, you have successfully delivered the message.
Chances are the problem has something to do with the downstream hosts.
