I have been researching the use of Application Roles within Microsoft SQL Server and was wondering if there is a way to limit a user to only be able to set specific application roles.
Therefore, if John from accounting e-mails the Accounting.exe application to Bill in finance, Bill can execute the Accounting.exe application without issue, which is undesired.
For example, let's say John works in Accounting and uses an application named Accounting.exe, which is hard-coded to set the Accounting_appRole once connected to the AdventureWorks Database.
Bill works in Finance and uses an application named Finance.exe, which is hard-coded to set the Finance_appRole once connected to the AdventureWorks Database.
Both John and Bill must, at a minimum, have execute permissions for the sys.sp_setapprole stored procedure of the AdventureWorks Database.
All I can come up with is modifying the sp_setapprole stored procedure to use SUSER_SNAME() to limit the value(s) of @rolename that can be used.
As I understand, any user of the database with sys.sp_setapprole execute permissions can set any application role they choose, as long as they provide the application role name and password.
I think there should be a way to limit who can set a specific application role, does anyone know of a way?
