In addition to TeamViewer as suggested above, LogMeIn is a great free service which runs on Windows and OSX.
They have a free version which works just fine for most use, and a Pro version with extra features that aren't really necessary for most users.
The free version only lets you control the desktop which is fine for most uses.
LogMeIn also has an iPhone app, but it is not free.
If you download the "TeamViewer Quick Support" option on their downloads page and run it on your computer, it will automatically generate a link which you give to the person you're supporting.
The paid version has a lot more features like file transfer and file sharing.
Logmein does require installation, though it's fairly easy to set up.
A unique feature of TeamViewer which makes it ideal for your situation is the ability to have somebody run it without having it preinstalled on their machine.
They download a file at the link which they run, giving you control.
No installation needed - they just click the link.
I have never used TeamViewer before so I don't know about that product, but I do use LogMeIn free version all the time for my computers and my families computers.
