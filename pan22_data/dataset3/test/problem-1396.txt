Perhaps there was a glitch in the server, or it wasn't up for a short while.
Maybe it is not happy serving the file to a command-line wget from a Pi (might want feeding with a download-tracking cookie or some other thing that a browser does that wget doesn't bother with / avoids).
As already mentioned, the server didn't like something.

Try replacing wget with iceweasel, and see if it downloads then.
Mount doesn't output anything (unless an error occurs), so that means it in fact did work.
Whatever it was, the server and network and stars aligned right for me tonight.
The best guide to Kali Linux on Raspberry Pi 2/3 with Adafruit PiTFT can be found on the "Sticky Finger's Kali-Pi" website:
Well I am able to download the file to a GNU/Linux (Debian) PC, and Wikepedia's article on 403 responses suggests there is something about that request that the Server didn't like.
Also, if the mount command succeeds then there isn't anything for it to moan about and unless you use the --verbose or -v arguments there is no output!
It also has the newest kernel for Raspberry 3 support and wifi injection patch.
I just double-checked, and I typed in what you had.
I believe that this kernel is outdated now, but I just tried the wget command from my linux laptop and it worked.
That kernel package and these instructions are outdated.
