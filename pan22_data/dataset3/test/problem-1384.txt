(In this case, a standard issued authentic Apple macbook charger)
Some laptop brands offers tools to limit charging to a lower percentage exactly to prolong battery life (Lenovo in its Thinkpads via Vantage SW, some Fujitsu Lifebooks, etc.)
indeed suffer if they are permanently charged to 100 % capacity.
Dell laptops requiring 90W charger do not charge if a 65W charger is inserted, although they may run with such charger in a safemode with the lowest CPU frequency etc.)
And in this time, it won't count your battery circle and also keep the battery around 40 to 80.
Apple does provide some official guidelines that Apple users should follow:
There are other factors influencing Li-ion battery life, such as the current draw (rendering video/playing games while on battery damages it quicker than just writing text in Word), temperature (high temperatures above 60Â°C really hurt Li-ion cells), and keeping the battery totally depleted (which can eventually irreversibly destroy the cells, and the circuitry prevents any future charging which would be dangerous).
I need to use macbook pro for a long time a day, because I don't have a desktop, and I don't want to damage the battery.
Some devices may draw power directly from the battery if the charger does not produce enough power.
It will either just charge more slowly (which in general may be better for the battery than quick-charging), or as some laptops do, refuse to charge at all (e.g.
If you have a weaker charger charging the device and the device is draining power more than the output of the charger, it could cause damage to the battery or break the battery because of heat.
Another user on the mac forums suggested that it is good to leave the battery at 75% once a month to keep the battery exercised.
In addition, the charger could break because it is trying to meet the power demand from the laptop.
My concern is when you use a program which need a lot of power, the 45W charger may not be able to charge the MAC normally, and keep the MAC power down.
Essentially, it is important to try to avoid excess heat generation because it could cause irreparable damages to the battery, device and charger.
If you are concerned about what battery percentage you should leave you laptop at, I would suggest trying to keep the battery percentage always above 30-50%.
Since many battery expert believe 100 percent battery would hurt battery's life.So m y theory is, when you use like 45w charger which has lower than apple's original one( 96 power), you can keep your mac's power very slowly increase from 40% to 80%.
It is highly recommended to always use a charger that is designed for the laptop or battery.
The wattage of the charger does not influence whether it can charge the battery to 100% or some other value.
If the vendor does (Apple) does not offer any tool to reduce max charging to less than 100 % it does not make much sense to try to somehow workaround it.
This method helps the battery to maintain overall storage power capacity.
Generally it is still better to have the battery charged and run most of the time on the AC than to have it use it mostly on battery and charge it then, which eats the recharging cycles.
A good rule of thumb is to avoid using the device when you are charging it.
Is it a good way to use a small power to charger mac?
