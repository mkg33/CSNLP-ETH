Here a simple one-liner to clean container log file:
Here, the fd is /proc/17511/fd/25, so we truncate it:
logspout is useful for colelcting logs from all your docker containers and sending them off to somewhere.
IF you're only just needing to consider this, then sending them to the host's syslog daemon might be a good approach, and you can use the usual mechanisms for arranging those into files and rotating them from there.
if you run sudo lsof | grep '(deleted)', you might find that there are a lot of deleted container log files left open by docker
echo "" > $(docker inspect --format='{{.LogPath}}' <container_name_or_id>)
These are logs that belong to a deleted container.
Another way to free this space is to find the relevant file descriptor and to truncate it:
If you want to free space, you can do in this way:
One way to have these closed is by restarting the docker daemon itself.
Where 17511 is the pid of docker and e49d81fc is part of the offending logfilename / container id.
A late answer, but anyone in the same boat might be better off exploring options for exporting their docker logs to somewhere sensible for managing them.
For larger multi-host environments, you might look at shipping to an "ELK" stack.
