You can review the folder permissions with the following command (from cmd.exe):
Safe-Mode doesn't start the Third-party process, so there is no handle on the Folder expect a System file handled it.
(Also you can use Unlocker to find the process and end it)
The issue is that your user does not own the folder.
then you can stop the process using this command in CMD.exetaskkill /IM [PROCESSNAME]
Common cause of this problem is that a Process (like a Program) using the specified Folder right now.
You can use "Resource Monitor" program that have in-cloud with Windows.
in the CPU tab, at Associated Handles drawer you can put the Path of folder and search for process which have using it.
If the ownership doesn't look correct, you can take ownership and give yourself Delete permission:
There are many methods you can see which process are using the Handles.
The other method you can try is deleting folder from Safe-Mode.
Once your user owns the folder and has the correct permissions, you should be able to rd /s /q C:\Users\username\Desktop\folder.
You can use Resource Monitor by typing "resmon.exe" in Start Search-box.
