The problem you will have launching these apps is that if you installed windows to a fresh partition, all shortcuts will be invalid and anything in the registry will no longer be there (new windows - new registry).
You might be able to mount the drive in a cradle or as a secondary drive, but the apps will still not function.
Additionally, your saved games could be stored in your previous Documents folder.
There are also certain folders such as %appdata%, %temp%, %path% etc which are used to refer to other folders - these folder paths will have most likely changed - and even if they havent, the data in them will not be the same after a reload of an OS.. which may render apps unuseable.
This information may include the location of the executable file, some basic settings and license data (amongst others).
(Primarily with older games, some of them stored your progress in the game directory itself.
You could, for example, reinstall the affected games to the existing folder, which may or may not work, or you could just delete the old folder and install the game again (maybe to your SSD to gain some speed in the process).
Also, if the old drive is no longer present in the machine, the data is gone.
The old hive files that make up the registry will be present on the old drive, but will not be much use to you.
Be sure to transfer any saved games you might have in your old Documents folder to your new SSD to keep your progress.
If you have the SSD and your old "spinner" in the same machine, all your old program files will exist still on whichever drive letter is now assigned to the old drive (assuming windows took "C:" when you installed the SSD)
Many applications will leave traces of information in either the Windows Registry or your AppData folder (can be found by typing %APPDATA% in Windows Explorer).
You may get lucky being able to launch and repair a few programs, but best advice will be to reinstall them!
If this is unacceptable (and you havent re-used the old drive) you should still be able to plug it back in and boot to it to transfer all your stuff off.
Make sure this is not the case with your games before deleting any data.)
When you start with a clean installation of Windows, these pieces of data will be missing, therefore interrupting the operation of those programs (or games).
