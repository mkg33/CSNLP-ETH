To me this applies to the scenario where everyone is competent and you can fix anything.
Did I mention I am also not a Security Expert or Network Engineer either?
Restarting the server is probably one of the most damaging things for performance.
The people, who created and maintain one of our major 3rd Party Databases, barely made it functional.
To me the question then becomes: Should I Restart SQL Server more often than every 3 months?
I don't like saying you NEVER need to Restart it to troubleshoot an issue or verify failover, but I do have a problem with scheduling Restarts to keep an unknown performance issue from randomly occurring.
It means you force a cold cache for data, a cold cache for query plans, and all SQL Server internal caches are also nuked in the process.
Maybe it'll come, maybe it won't, but you won't know for sure what caused it to rain.
Not to mention that by throwing away all the statistics collected in the operational stats DMVs, you diminish your chances of ever investigating something successfully.
Even then, you should look for fixes, share them with the owner, and raise hell till it's resolved.
If a crap plan is cached and applied to inappropriate subsequent calls, then the miracle of rebooting allows the common/correct plan to get cached.
I am a Software Architect and part of that involves building entire Database Schemas from scratch and, unfortunately, working with 3rd Party Databases that I have absolutely NO control over.
If that's the case, there are infinitely better ways of correcting the behaviour as other have indicated.
Scheduling Restarts for the promise of an extra inch of performance, is like dancing for rain.
There is no official guidance backing this practice, I have never seen it mentioned in any good practice reputable work, I never hear of a reputable expert ever mentioning this as a practice.
I agree with the sentiment that if you are doing everything right, then you may not need to Reboot/Restart your MSSQL Server.
If it speeds up queries, parameter sniffing might be involved.
The Only exception to this is if you manage a rogue 3rd Party Database where rebooting it every week or two seems to be the only way to keep it operating and you are not allowed to fix or even touch it.
But until they stop rebooting the box, there's no way to perform root cause analysis.
