All the values, along with the % the item will rise every time you move up the map can be reset every few travels.
Each and every transaction that takes place in your market will have a knock on effect not just on the thing that was being traded but to the market as a whole.
In other words, simulate other merchants(not individually, but via "popular routes") that influence the economics as much as you do.
The market would be reset every few space travels.
What resources are available that I could look at to get an understanding of the algorithms I'll need to perform the simulation?
You were supposed to travel between solar systems each containing 6~ space stations orbiting planets.
Look at the real world, a barrel of oil makes more than 1 product, from fuel, to plastics.
The Tonic's price is highest in the other corner of the galaxy on Ni'mrodd 9 solar systems away.
Anyone know of any useful resources I could look into?
And that's a very basic example, when you consider something as complex as your mobile phone it goes completely bonkers.
Now depending on how your game works, if a player can buy a product from a far away region from anywhere in the galaxy then price displayed should be offset by your transportation cost.
Modelling something that is near impossible to do "right" but you can give a reasonable model of the economy (eve online is the most successful close match I can see that matches what you're trying to do)
Talidor: 2000; Ginouya: 2200; Eanya:   2400; (...) Nimrodd/Meenkk: 3800
If you feel strong, you can also make more "production sites" which would change the items value using the simple arithmetic mean, using the same method as before "The more times you have to travel, the more the price will rise".
You can create a "flow of merchants" system which edits the routes' popularity based on the length of the journey and the income and adjusts the prices according to the amount of goods transported there.
any industry that depends on any of those products would be affected by the price of oil.
Start with a table that contains all your products and give them an arbitrary value (don't worry if your model is any good this should sort itself out later).
Product A in Region A might be of low value because there is lots of it and getting it to this region is cheap.
Each station had its own shop, with its specialities, beverages and whatever you might think of.
Links to products on a market can effectively be traced to virtually every other product on that market ...
A Google search of "economics simulation algorithm" and similar terms turns up little of use, and nothing I've got the background to understand.
I'm designing a game reminiscent of Elite or Escape Velocity, those old space trading games, where you play a traveling merchant in space.
If I were to set up that system I would make one, or more "production" sites, and the further you travel the more +X percents you will get to the items value.
Lets say, it has been the only place where you can buy the "Talidor Tonic", it's price would be approx 2k in that station.
One big hurdle is that I'm pretty horrible at math; so a simplistic explanation would be ideal.
Now you can write some sort of GetPriceOf(Product product, Location system) type function that determines based on the output of a chain of rules what the price of the given product might be in the given system.
Product A in Region B might carry a higher value because it's not so abundant in that region and thus has the cost of being transported to that region.
Then just keep building and building on it until the model feels real.
I have played a mobile game called Galaxy on Fire, where you would be a space pilot.
but the oil drilling industry needs things like drill bits so will be affected by the price of say diamonds, metals, ect.
Where the price would be much higher, Lets say, for instance 190% of the initial cost making you earn 1800 credits from each Tonic you sell.
I figure an interstellar economy wouldn't be all that different from a global one; certain things can only be manufactured in certain places (due to resources and technology levels), shipping things takes time and money, people in different places need different things... just instead of cities, they'd be planets.
I'd like to have the game's economy at least resemble a real one.
Now set a load of rules and implement a method / function to implement them.
It'll likely never be perfect, very few companies actually get it right and even when they get it right it's still not real like in the real world.
But metals need to be proccessed before they can be used and then manufactured in to drills so the metal workers need oil.
The approximation would be completely random (I think FishLabs made it +-7% of the initial item value) to give the player a feeling of reality.
The other thing you could try is making money as hard to come by as in the real world then based prices on the real world stock market ... could be a bitch to wire up to your game though.
What I find works best when im playing a game is models that shift by themselves.
