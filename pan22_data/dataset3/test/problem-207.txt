You just have a single DHCP server give the phone router as a gateway for phones and the network router as a gateway for computers.
On various switches and IOS versions it might be different, but this may give a start.
This is best if you want well defined "phone" ports rather than letting phones be plugged in anywhere.
And it's a good idea to use separate VLANs, one for phones and another one for computers, because of
Here's a small example like it might be done for instance on a good old 2650 switch with, let's say, IOS 12.1.
I've done it on a second hand Cisco Catalyst 3548; any other enterprise level switch should have the same features.
You can have the phone router and the network router on the same subnet, assuming you can disable DHCP for both of them.
If you add a VLAN to a switch, ensure that it's in server or transparent mode:
If you're network has multiple bit switches, you'll have to set up something between them to sync the VLAN information, Cisco uses VTP for this.
With that said, all you need are switches which support VLANs.
The switch will let you put each port on a (set of) VLANs, so you would set eg your phone ports on VLAN 1 and everything else on VLAN 2.
