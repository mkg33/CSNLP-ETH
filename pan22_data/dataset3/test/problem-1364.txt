Note that this is not a "logical" arrangement -- You have a pair, then two pair with one straddling the other, then a 4th separate pair.
BeemerGuy, note that it's not sufficient to simply have the same color wires attached to the same numbered pins on both ends.
If I had to hazard a guess I would say you probably have a bad cable run from one of the following:
It's been awhile, but the pinout goes something like this:
It's often easier to just re-run the cable in situations like this -- if you want to debug the problem more thoroughly you'll need something more than a simple continuity tester (a cable verifier, or better a cable certifier) -- These tend to be hideously expensive for home use ($500 and up, good certifiers are upwards of $1000) and I would only recommend buying one if you pull cable for a living.
The time and money lost re-running the occasional wonky cable over a lifetime is probably lower than the cost of a good quality certifier :-)
In addition you have to have the PAIRS in the cable correctly connected to PAIRS of pins on the connector.
