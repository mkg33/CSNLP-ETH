USB A sockets are remarkably sensitive to being restricted by their housing.
You can use digital calipers to confirm that your socket will accept a plug of that size.
If it doesn't, you've received a badly manufactured socket and should return the device.
If you can't fit any of your USB devices into any of the 4 sockets across the 2 modules then the problem is far more likely to be with your insertion method.
The Pi 3 includes 2 separate USB socket modules, each of which houses 2 individual USB sockets, providing a total of 4 sockets.
The chances of both USB socket modules being incorrectly manufactured are very very very small.
You could try jimmying them open a little further using a small screwdriver.
The dimensions of a USB A plug should be 12mm wide by 4.5mm tall.
Assess the way you're trying to plug your devices in and, if it's extravagantly weird, consider reducing any run-up, follow-through, gestural motions, radial arm-swinging, jiggling, shoogling, or unnecessary revolutions.
It's just about conceivable that they may have been accidentally bent in towards the centre of the socket opening, resulting in a higher required insertion force.
In the above image I've circled the flexible tabs used on a common USB A socket.
If the socket is inserted into a casing that restricts the movement of the tabs you'll find it incredibly difficult to jam a USB plug into it (as I found when designing wooden enclosures for USB power supplies).
Verify that the problem only exists in one of the dual-socket modules.
If the Pi is in a case, make sure that nothing is preventing these from flexing while you push in your plug.
