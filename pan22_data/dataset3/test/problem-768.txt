When you say that you are connecting to the router successfully, what do you mean?
Remember Ping is your friend and traceroute will also tell you many things in this type of situation.
Check your third-party program to make sure that it has all of the information for the Gateway and DNS Server(s).
If the encryption key is off, you will not get an IP address via DHCP.
If it is a 169 address then you probably are using the wrong encryption key.
The third thing I would check would be that your wireless access point is configured properly to point at your default gateway.
If you do not have dhcp on your wireless segment you can always hard code an address on the same subnet.
second make sure you have an actual IP address on your internal network.
Being that the computer is Win2k, I've found that some of the third-party programs to connect the computer wirelessly cause issues.
You can be connected but not be assigned a valid IP address -- you would have a 169.xxx address instead of the typical 192.168.xxx.xxx.
First make sure you are associating correctly with the access point/proper SSID
If you do not have an IP address then I would double check your encryption key because this can keep it from working.
