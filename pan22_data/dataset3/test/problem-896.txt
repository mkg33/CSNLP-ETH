The Windows NT 6.1 installer will then allow installation to an EFI partitioned hard disc.
As Rod Smith explains, one therefore has to manually construct a Windows NT 6.1 install disc that bootstraps in the new EFI way.
The Microsoft documentation explains how the installation CD-ROM is in fact dual-boot.
It's quite possible — and indeed is becoming ever more desirable these days — to have an EFI partitioned disc on a machine that has old non-EFI firmware.
Microsoft erroneously conflates has an EFI partitioned hard disc with has EFI firmware.
The Mac's compatibility support module bootstraps the install disc in the old PC98 way.
But unfortunately when a CSM is present the CSM picks the wrong — i.e.
One of the several consequences of this error is that the Windows NT 6.1 installer has to be invoked from an install medium that has in turn been bootstrapped from EFI firmware, in order for it to accept the idea of installing Windows NT 6.1 to a disc partitioned with the EFI partitioning scheme.
When you boot the Windows NT 6.1 install disc on an Intel Mac, that's exactly what happens.
Unfortunately, if the Windows NT install disc is bootstrapped in the old PC98 way the installer will think that there's no EFI firmware, and so declare that it cannot support EFI partitioned hard discs.
