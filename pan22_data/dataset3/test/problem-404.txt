Bonus options that aren't required but might be nice: Limit what sort of files they can upload?
I have seen this successfully implemented before in this context, although I haven't done it myself.
This does the same in a more complex way, but it goes a lot further and allows you to also harden it against IP.
I couldn't get the bash script to work and sanitise an rsync input properly, maybe i missed something, instead i discovered a perl program called authprogs

I'd also like to be able to limit the amount of disk space they can take up, so they can't use more than (say) 200MB of my disk in total.
I'd like to give them passwordless ssh/scp/rsync/sftp access.
I want to give someone permission to host some simple files on my Ubuntu webserver.
However I want to be able to restrict what they can do, I don't want to give them a full ssh shell in otherwords.
A possible solution is to chroot-jail them, using an ssh dummy shell.
