Even when the Data Type and Length of the columns identical, this warning still appears on occasion.
This is when I delete the copied element(s) and build them from scratch.
You have to edit this manually or you could use the Suggest Types button to have SSIS sample your data and suggest appropriate data types.
For some reason, all the fields in flat file connection manager seems to have 50 OutPutColumnWidth.
What I've experienced is that this error shows up occasionally after I've copied and pasted existing Ole DB Destination/Source element either from the same Data Flow Task or a Data Flow Task from another package and then start changing the details within.
I would bump that width up in the connection manager definition to a larger variable and retry executing it.
My guess is that the metadata is fouled up during the copy/paste.
Truncation may occur due to inserting data from data flow column
Sounds like you have data in one of your columns that is longer than 50 characters.
The default behavior of SSIS is to assign 50 to the width of the columns in an flat file source.
to resolve this warning,right click the destination source,select show advance editor option,select the input and output properties tab,expand the input and output variable and check the length.if they are different then make it same using the data conversion operation.
This warning message displays when any time source column data type length will be more than then length of destination datatype.
It reads the data from flat file and inserts in to database.
this comes up because the length of source variable and the destination variable is not same.
Your error message should indicate which column is the issue.
If you don't know what column it is, try using the Suggest Types button to have SSIS adjust its data types and lengths based on your data.
this is just a warning.your package will execute anyway.
