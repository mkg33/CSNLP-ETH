But if there is a date that would keep only the latest ones to be installed then it doesn't matter the sequence of installing a few at a time.
These would all be updates that were available for several days and yet they arent returned for the first query.
I know that there is discussions in this and other forums that touch on the sequence of module types, but this is about an internal date/time control.
From WU's behavior we can deduce that it likely does dependency and date checking.
It might be possible, when I have a long list of a hundred updates to install, that I might release the ones on the end before I release the ones in the beginning of the list.
If there are two or more updates for the same code/module then it might end up with the earliest module in place once all the updates have been installed.
I would like to know if there is a control technique that is embedded internally in the Windows update modules to ensure that EARLIER modules don't replace or overlay LATER modules?
This has nothing to do with the question of installing what TYPE of modules first before other TYPES.
For instance, is there a creation date in an update module that is being installed that would make sure that modules are installed in the correct sequence?
