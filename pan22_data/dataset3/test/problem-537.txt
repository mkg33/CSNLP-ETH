This is not really a solution, but you can hack a workaround for this if you know a little Javascript by making a bookmarklet that fills out the username and password fields.
I just entered my username and password in the value fields in the form by inspecting the elements and saved that as a html page, grabbed url from that page and I book marked this new url, its working for me :).
For example, if the page you want to fill in has fields with IDs of 'user_name' and 'password', this javascript would fill them with whatever you define near the beginning.
This is not secure at all, of course, if anyone you don't trust may open your browser; they can click to edit this and see your login info.
I can't find a way to delete attributes with Chrome's Developer Tools, but you can change it to autocomplete="on" or change the attribute name to e.g.
This feature has been implemented in the Google Chrome 34.0.1847.116 Stable channel for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
But it's not much worse than having the browser remember your passwords if it doesn't use a master password to encrypt them; some digging around in the menus will let you view those.
Create a new bookmark on your toolbar and save this long line as the url:
And anyway, you shouldn't let people you don't trust use your computer.
Here is a bookmarklet that removed the autocomplete.
