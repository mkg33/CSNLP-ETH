I'm trying to develop an Excel formula that would calculate the actual time duration for a string of a time range of the following format: 1:00am – 3:00am
I wonder if the problem might be that my string of text has no "date" component in addition to the time.
For example, to get the hours, minutes, and seconds between two times (4:55:00), the article says to do the following:
And format the cell as a custom formatting h:mm:ss.
The big issue is the time needs a space between the minutes and the am/pm: 1:00 am - 3:00 am or 9:00 pm - 12:00 am.
Is the only solution to being able to do the subtraction operation to "fudge" a date into the strings?
You need the space before "am" or "pm", as Lance Roberts said.
I'd also like to compensate for any potential pm-to-am spans of time, such as 9:00pm — 12:00am if at all possible.
Or is there another alternate approach, other than simply breaking down the hour and minute components individually and calculating the duration that way?
According to this article it seems it should be as simple as subtracting the two times.
