You could use avahi-daemon mDNS reflector feature on the gateway .
How do I enable CUPS browsing on the second set of machines so that they can see the print queues defined on the first machine?
PS: One could need to mangle the packets to increase Time To Live.
Once this was defined, all the CUPS clients on the same subnet could see the two print queues automatically, no problem.
NB: If you nat at the gateway you will need to set NONAT for packets incoming from the parent network.
forward 224.0.0.251 the packets are stuck on the gateway border.
This is a topic that needs more investigations though here are the shorewall/start, raw iptables tweaks:
Gnome control center "printers" here send a ttl f 255 (the maximum) so it is not required.
As far as I know there is no way to automatically make it available to other clients that are not on the same subnet.
I use twenty locally though it is not set in stone.
Now I have a collection of machines on a separate subnet, reachable from the first subnet by a router.
The 'native' way is to have a CUPS server (they don't need printers, just the CUPS software) on each subnet, and configure those servers to act as a Browse Relay server.
I have a CUPS server with two print queues defined.
That CUPS-running server will then respond to subnet-local browse requests with the remote server.
Mostly depends on the number of routers crossed in between printer and client station.
You can still use the printer from another subnet (if the access controls are right), but you have to add it manually refering to by its IP address.
The second subnet is A.B.D.0/24, and there is a router with arms on both networks.
There is also a way to do it via multicast and the Service Location Protocol, but it isn't documented well at all.
