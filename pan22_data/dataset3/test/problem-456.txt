5) Assign each record a general topic ID and a sub topic ID
I'm training an LDA model with gensim's LdaMulticore.
1) train LDA model on all records to get general topics
I've come across this implementation of Hierarchical LDA, but I'm having a hard time implementing it (no community support).
After running LDA, shouldn't your result already look like: Record1-> 71% topic 1, 14% topic 2, 15% topic 3, so topic 2 and topic 3 would be subtopics of record 1?
The topics look great, but knowing the domain I know there exists topics within topics but I'm not quite sure the best way to model this.
If you want to find subtopics of topic 1, you could search all your records, where topic 1 is the general topic and look for the most common topics that appear in records where topic 1 is the general topic.
3) for each topic, retrieve only the records that were assigned that topic
4) train a new LDA model only on the filtered records (for example, where topic ID == 3) to generate sub topics from filtered set
2) use this LDA model to assign each record a primary topic
And I don't think gensim's hdpModel is what I want, given this discussion.
