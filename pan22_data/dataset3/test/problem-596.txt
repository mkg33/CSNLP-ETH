Is there a way (a software perhaps, a free software perhaps), that will allow me to keep several (the same) icons on mac dock instead of grouping all windows of one app into one icon?
I want to have as many chrome icons in dock as separate chrome windows are open.
You can also use exposé on conjunction with minimizing the windows
Two options - neither perfect, but using no additional software…
There is a post here on how to set it up: http://www.iwebss.com/tech/361-pc-style-windows-taskbar-on-mac-os-x
Go to System Preference under Dock, uncheck 'Minimize windows into application icons'.
This has been driving me nuts on my Mac at home too.
The only negative is that you can no longer move osx dock to the bottom right corner, so now it stays in the middle along the bottom so depending how many windows you have open, the dock will cover some of them up.
What you can is minimize each window and the will show up in the right side of the doc then you click on the instance there or you can use exposé by default the shortcut is option + arrow down at the same time which will split out all the windows so you can choose which one you want.
I have 2 monitors & 6 spaces, so 12 'desktops' lets me put pretty much everything in a space of its own, with single key switching.
My Mac at work treated different Chrome windows separately in the dock so I knew there had to be a way.
I'm struggling with this issue from months, please help!
I use DragThing and then create a Window Dock along the bottom which sort of mimics the Windows style taskbar.
But it mostly gives you one click to jump between windows.
For example I usually open many windows of Chrome and to operate between them I need to right-click on the chrome icon on my dock then select the window I want to pull up.
