You can either get a secondary IP address and use that in your second VirtualHost (and then get a new IP for every new VirtualHost you need), or you can uncomment the NameVirtualHost directive.
There a number of ways in which the ePages Apache configuration differs from a more "normal" site.
So in your example above, if my.ip.add.res happens to be the default IP of the server then your VirtualHost block will be ignored in favour of the one that came before it.
It rewrites most of the config files every time the ePages service restarts.
Meaning that if you define your own VirtualHost, and your server doesn't define a PROXY environment variable, your VirtualHost will be the only one and will therefore be in effect for all requests.
If PROXY is defined, your epages VirtualHost will be ignored, otherwise it will be a necessary filter.
Note also that ePages relies on mod_rewrite, so this "safety net" VirtualHost will need to enable it.
This might vary from version to version, but in my case (6.14.3) the one and only VirtualHost block sits inside an <IfDefine PROXY> block (conf.d/zzz-epages-httpd.conf).
If you look in conf/httpd.conf you'll see the NameVirtualHost directive is commented out.
It defines a VirtualHost inside an IfDefine block.
To be safe, define two VirtualHosts: one that will work for epages and one for your other site.
Anything with a "zzz" prefix (which is most of the files in conf.d) will be rewritten, so don't bother editing those files.
This means your VirtualHost directives will be activated by IP address, not hostname.
