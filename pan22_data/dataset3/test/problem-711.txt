As another recent starter in Data Science, I can only add that I don't think you're experience is unique, my team of about 10 apparently hasn't done any DS in over a year (one small project that occupied 2 of the team).
Result of the paper reflects my experience as well.
Processing it includes knowing the same pieces of information, so it is partially work you would have had to do anyway.
Trying to be flexible when you're designing your wrangling code is also a good idea - having an intermediate dataset of processed data I think would be useful if you're allowed to (and can't do it in MySQL).
But it's having you do other things instead, which could be done by other people who are some combination of more capable, more motivated or less expensive.
Of course, at the end of the day, somebody has to do the data wrangling.
Until this area matures, a lot of the data scientist job will indeed be data wrangling.
Or at least they will give you a sincere explanation of why it has to be that way.
If it could be done faster by someone paid the same salary, the same logic applies.
Now, it sounds like this company could benefit from setting up some sort of free MySQL (or similar) instance to hold your data.
It sounds like you took a job to do some tasks (which you mean by "data science") but you are having to do another thing (which you call "data wrangling").
He says that there are a number of open problems in this area: Ingest,    Transform(e.g.
Coming at it from this perspective, you might find it much easier to make your superiors see your side of things.
Apparently retention has been fairly poor in the past and there's continuous promise of a holy-grail MS Azure environment for future DS projects.
If you look at this from the perspective of "this isn't my job, so why should I do it" then that's a fairly common, general problem not specific to data science.
Ultimately, your job is to do whatever the boss tells you to do, but in practice there is little reason for the boss to be dictatorial about this and usually they can be persuaded.
3) I'm sure there's companies out there who are better than others.
You could also look at it from another perspective: Is this a good use of your time?
If the data wrangling could be done by someone making half your salary, then it makes no sense to pay you twice as much to do the same thing.
But as far as appealing to authority, there is no official definition of "Data Science" that says you can only do at most X% data cleaning.
There are number of companies/products trying to solve this problem such as Tamr, Alteryx, Trifacta, Paxata, Google Refine working to solve this problem.
You could try to claim it's not part of your contract, but what are the odds they were naive enough to put something that specific in the contract?
In his talk "Big Data is four different problems", Turing award winner Michael Stonebraker mentions this particular issue as a big problem (video, slides)
Therefore it is a waste of resources (especially money) to have the company assign this task to you.
Job descriptions and personal feelings are a bit beside the point here because there is something more pertinent: The company presumably pays you a good amount of money to do something that only you can do (the data science).
Google actually measured it and published a paper "Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems" https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf
But of course you're still setting up things from scratch.
2) No you're correct, but it's an uphill battle to get access to the data you want (if it even exists).
You need to work with and understand your data - which includes simple stuff from fixing inconsistencies (NULLs, empty strings, "-") to understanding how a piece of data goes from collected to being displayed.
This is due to the promise of an effective pipeline the team's been working on, but still just isn't quite delivering the data.
This is not an easy process, but this "learning experience" is at least good to put in your CV.
It may be that the cheapest, fastest, easiest way of doing it -- the best person for the job, is you.
The authority is whoever is paying you, so long as they have the legal right to stop paying you.
If you can't stand it at your current company, 2 years is a decent length of time, start looking for brighter things (be careful how you phrase your desire to leave your current job, something like "looking to work with a more dynamic team" would sound better than "my old company won't give me data").
Vast majority of time is spent in acquiring, cleaning and processing data.
