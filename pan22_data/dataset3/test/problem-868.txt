It's a platform for sharing on collaborating on Jupyter notebooks, and it's really easy to use.
All the graphics are embedded in the HTML file and anyone can view it in a browser pretty easily just by clicking on the file.
This will capture the Juptyer notebook (and also the Python libraries required to run it), and upload it your account, giving you shareable link.
I am also a beginner so any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.
GitHub has built in support for showing a notebook.
You will just need to run the notebook yourself, then upload the file to Github like all other file types.
Step 3: Upload the notebook to your Jovian account by running
Here's an example: https://www.jovian.ml/aakashns/jovian-tutorial
Your viewer will be able to see your notebook without any installation.
I would like to share a Jupyter Notebook with somebody who is not a programmer (via a URL).
If you want to share your Juptyer / IPython notebooks online, try using jovian.ml .
Viewers can also run your notebook on cloud platforms like Google Colab, BinderHub and Kaggle with a single click.
However I dont know how to correctly publish my .ipynb file onto Github.
I understand that I must publish my work to github and then use http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to render the notebook.
It's a tool for tracking/sharing machine learning and data science work.
Step 2: Import the library inside your Jupyter / IPython notebook
If you want to run notebook/lab everywhere and simply share a rendered .ipynb via URL you may want to take a look at neptune-notebooks extension.
