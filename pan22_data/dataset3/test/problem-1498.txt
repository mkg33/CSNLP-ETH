Each interface in the machine receives it's own Index number which you specify the Network Type.
Let me know if you need help doing that and I can explain exporting the firewall as well if needed.
Check out this tutorial on how to do this via powershell: http://www.1337admin.org/windows-server/windows-server-2012-r2/change-network-location-using-powershell-in-windows/
You can change this on a granular level directly to each interface via PowerShell.
Domain only gets selected after joining the domain so since you are testing I would suggest you test everything first not on the domain and then join the domain and I suspect everything will be configured like you need it to be.
The only caveat that you need to understand is that you can only change to either public or private.
You could also export your finished firewall rules to a settings file and human readable file and compare the human readable file using winmerge or something similar to verify or determine any changes after joining the domain.
