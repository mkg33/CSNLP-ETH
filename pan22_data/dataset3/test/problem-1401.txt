Access Points (APs) do not normally do any routing, they just bridge the network to WiFi and add encryption and authentication.
Cable Modem -> New Router -> CAT 5e Server Rack -> Wall Ethernet Port -> Computers
Is it possible to change our internet setup from this:
However that might get costly as the costs for public IPs can get expensive.
Cable Modem -> Wi-fi Router -> (via wired connection) Unmanaged Switch -> CAT 5e Server Rack -> Wall Ethernet Port -> Computers
A switch will not provide routing capability and should not be connected directly to the modem or ONT unless a DHCP Server is present elsewhere on the network.
A switch is used to provide additional ports, expanding the capability of the router.
Our company has a shared server room on another floor than ours, and our wi-fi router is far out of range to be of any use to us in that server room.
It takes information provided by the modem or ONT and routes it to the various devices that are connected, and creates internal IP address for the devices so they can be accessed.
Is the wi-fi router a necessary component in order to have internet sent through our switch?
Cable Modem -> New Router -> Ummanaged Switch -> Cat5 Server Rack -> Wall Jack -> Computer
A modem is provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) and provides a network access to the internet.
The switch only handles connections within the LAN while the modem translates the signals through the air or wires.
This will give you more control to as the routers tend to lock up more than modems in my personal experience.
The simple solution here would be to just go and buy a router and replace the one you don't want.
If it's in a shared location, then you'll probably just want one that has a single WAN port as well as a single LAN.
A somewhat decent router for basic usage can be from $100-$200 online depending on what all you want.
You could also potentially leave out the first switch in your equation if it's only bridging the connection between the router and the rack switch.
The router is the component that connects two different networks (your local area network or LSN and the internet).
At first glance I would say the setup should be...
That's really not a good option though as moving the router into your office space would be better.
You probably need more horsepower, how much would vary on the number of devices, speed of your internet, and how you use your network.
Cable Modem -> Unmanaged Switch -> CAT 5e Server Rack -> Wall Ethernet Port -> Computers?
We are looking to eliminate this router since its a rental from an ISP we just switched from that we will need to return anyways.
Just like you have it, except with a new router... and to fix the WiFi dead spots, you use a Wireless Access Point, which give you WiFi where you need it physically by bridging the Ethernet network to WiFi, you can connect this at perhaps the Unmanaged switch or plugged into a spare wall jack somewhere.
The cable that goes from the closet to your space, (if it's a standard LAN cable) is the one that you should plug directly into the modem and then have your router at the other end.
The WiFi portion of your WiFi router is probably not necessary, but in your case a router is in most cases to allow for security, firewalling, and basic network services such as DHCP and perhaps DNS caching.
If you got that setup to work properly, you'd have a very insecure network as all of the computers would have to be directly linked to the internet to work, (public IPs).
