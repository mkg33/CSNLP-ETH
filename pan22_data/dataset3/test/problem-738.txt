I realized that SATA config might be the issue and set it back correctly but again, Windows does not boot with a different error, this time it does not even get to the repair options, etc.
The one you 'recovered' let it unplugged and after everything starts, reconnect it and re-mirror the second drive onto the first (the altered one).
This may have a good chance to work: Use the second drive to boot in correct mode.
After you updated BIOS or cleared CMOS, You have to change the SATA mode to RAID manually before the OS boots.
After a BIOS update, apparently all BIOS settings was reset, which apparently changed the SATA mode from RAID to AHCI (default).
I have two Samsung 840 EVO SSD's in RAID 1 (Asus P87-Pro and Intel Controller) with Windows 8.1 Pro on it.
However, If you forgot to change that, you should boot your system with Windows Boot DVD and click the Repair... then you should use the command prompt and run the below command in Windows Drive (for example if your Windows Drive is C: you first run C:):
I hope that your problem resolved by that command.
Although my Windows should have theoretically booted (from one of the disks), it failed to boot and went to automatic repair.
