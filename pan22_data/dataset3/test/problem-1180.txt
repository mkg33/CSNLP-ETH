It's a pitty it wasn't done this time but you should make sure it's done on all of your machines now.
When filestructure problems are at hand and not just deleted files this will be a lifesaver.
It's worked for me even when the partition table was damaged and couldn't be reliably rebuilt.
I know this is an old thread, but for others that might be looking for help: in with photorec is a tool called 'testdisk' again, it is a misleading name, but it is a full recovery tool.
To maximize data recovery from the failed drive, you should use Roadkil's Raw Copy or my very own Raw Disk Copier, both will attempt to read the data sector-by-sector if a bulk read operation of multiple sectors is unsuccessful.
I've used Photorec (http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec) in the past to do this with a mangled file system.
And not to tell you something you already know, but backing up is imperative.
If that doesn't work, I think you'll need to take it to a data recovery place.
If you don't understand what you are doing, go to a professional or you can make a bad situation worse.
However, it won't recover names, or directory structures, so you might want to treat it as a last resort before shipping it off for professional recovery.
Here are some recovery scenarios test disk can help with: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Data_Recovery_Examples
The most effective tool Ive ever used for recovering files from a screwed drive is R-Studio.
When dealing with a failing disk, the first step is to clone the entire drive to an healthy drive, only then data recovery programs such as R-Studio should be used.
It includes some powerful partition recovery and rebuilding options, but be warned: read the manual!
Despite the name, it will recover all kinds of files from damaged partitions, including photos, Office documents, and so on.
