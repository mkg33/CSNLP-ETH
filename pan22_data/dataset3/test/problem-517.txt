Azure makes certain guarantees about region pairs including that it will not upgrade a service in both regions simultaneously.
This allows users to architect HA/DR solutions that use both regions and which can there survive an outage in one region.
Also, based on my experience, G and M series VM will come to EAST US in the future.
Deploying services into non-paired regions such as eastus2 and westus2 does not benefit from this - and theoretical could subject services to simultaneous upgrades of underlying infrastructure.
But for now, M series VM is not provided on US West and US West 2.
US East and US East 2 are two data center and they are all in Virginia.
This assumes the application has been architected to use both regions.
In cases where users want to benefit from pairing and a specific VM size is not available then an alternative VM size would need to be selected in the secondary region.
Please refer to this blog:Tips for Choosing a Microsoft Azure Region.
Based on my knowledge, there are no constraint on functionality if you choose the two location.
If possible, you could select US East 2 and US West 2 as a pair.
