Now make the first server to the master and override all data on the server2
The first "Secondary" is the server you are logged in and the 2nd "Secondary" is the other server.
I would suggest you to use active-passive cluster with drbd.

A complete alternative is to use the DRBD MC - the Management console created by LINBIT, its a java application running on a workstation and connects to the servers over ssh and make the configuration for you.
There should be a line with "cs:Connected ro:Secondary/Secondary"

Active-Active leads to more problems then it solves especially if you use MySQL as database because you can't run 2 MySQL Daemons on the same Database!
You have to do the following steps on both servers.
