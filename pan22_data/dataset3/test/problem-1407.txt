(Since you built your system I assume that you know what you're doing here.)
Even if there isn't a newer version I'd still try the update in case the one you have has corrupted.
Remove every cable, clean the contacts where possible, and reattach them.
Problems that early in the boot process are usually BIOS related, have you updated your BIOS?
Problems in cold POST can also be related to power circuitry being slightly bad.
A flaky one can cause all kinds of weird behaviour, particularly at startup.
Expanding on wetware hacking's point, it's likely that something, somewhere is not making a good connection.
Could be the CPU, could be an expansion card, could be a cable.
Slightly but not totally broken capacitors sometimes take some time to collect enough charge to work properly.
Try to unplug HDD cables next time if there is no start/beep.
If it's disposable, not rechargeable, battery swapping to new one might also be useful.
I would try taking out the CMOS battery, cleaning the battery and contacts with alcohol and then putting it back.
Wearing gloves, you could even remove your CPU and reinsert it.
