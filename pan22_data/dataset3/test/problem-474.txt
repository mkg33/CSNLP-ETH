Many many years ago (in tha age of WinXP) I had a similar problem, and this trick helped me.
This is because I do not want Windows to create "System Volume Information" and "$Recycler" ans stuff on it ( these are not created for removable drives right? )
I want to connect my external 2TB USB HDD that has 4 partitions, to be treated as a set of  removable drives on Windows.
Hotswap looks like the oldschool remove device thingy from XP.
I just want Windows to use the drive as simple plain old storage without cluttering it up with  its internal stuff and metedata - and as far as I know, removable drive is the way to go.
What finally fixed things for me was this little thing:
I have an external HDD that connects to the computer by USB.
exFAT would be the best option, because FAT32 doesn't allow filesizes greater than 4 GB, but AFAIK Linux and friends do not know how to read it (and neither do versions of Windows earlier than Windows 7)
Linux can read and write to NTFS, but the Linux NTFS driver runs as a FUSE module, and performance is comparatively poor.
@harrymc answered everything correctly (+1 to him) except this part:
I've searched around for a while on the web, and most points to hardware or partition issues.
It worked in WinXP but I haven't tested them on Windows 7/8.
Explorer then goes bananas, and eats up system ram until something crashes.
But beware, this thing can unmount any disk on the system beyond where the running OS is installed.
Every time I try to disconnect the thing, I'm told the device is busy.
If you want to support Linux boxes, the only really good filesystem that works between the systems is FAT32.
