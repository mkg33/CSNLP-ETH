Additionally, you can use compressed tables (or manually gzcompress text data defore insertion).
I have an account hosted at DiscountASP and for the database size they offer (300 -700MB) i have the feeling  that i would reach the limit pretty fast and will have to spend a lot more.
To test this why don't you install SQL Server 2005 Express on your system and see how big your database is with an amount of sample data close to what you expect.
If you're only storing information about the videos and images in the database you shouldn't reach that kind of limit quickly.
Does adding as many dummy entries to the database a good enough way to evaluate the database usage?
I am having a hard time evaluating how much size i need for my SQL2005 database.
I could make a number up, but you're taking hundreds of gigbytes very quickly.
The numbers heavily depend on your table structure.
There are several database size estimating tools via Google, but these all assume "fixed" width data: integers, strings etc and row count estimates
How do you calculate/test how much space you need?
If you want to store images and videos, then these won't be much use.
Also, most hosting companies give you the option to move to a larger database later so if you think it'll be an issue make sure to go with a company that allows this.
For instance, "comments" table with dynamic-width rows: avg-size = (uid [4] + flags [4] + avg-comment-length (100)) * number-of-records = 144 bytes per post * number-of-records = ...
I am creating a content based website (articles - videos - images - forums ) with user profile and was thinking about having probably a small to a mid size audience.Is there a way to evaluate how much space or how many databases i would need ?
If you don't then you can probably store a fair amount of information, probably hundreds of thousands of records, depending on the field types.
If you store the images and videos in the database you will hit the limit very quickly.
Also, if you're designing a web application: think of exporting long data from the database into files to save space.
