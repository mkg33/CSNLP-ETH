I'd like to write a script which will change the brightness by increments, for which I would need permanent write access to the brightness file.
Would that be the best way to achieve what I'm trying to do, or is there a safer alternative?
Such script should be put in /etc/pm/sleep.d/ (requires pm-utils), if needed.
For example, putting something in rc.local, using cron, etc.
I gather that I can change the permissions permanently by writing a udev rule, which I've never done before.
I would use the rc.local method simply because it is easier and simpler than writing and maintaining a custom udev rule.
In order to write to the file, I either run the command through sudo or change the permissions for the brightness file.
You might also have to write a script that re-applies the permissions upon resuming from suspend and hibernation.
I'd like to be able to adjust the screen brightness of my laptop while in text mode, which I can do by writing to the file
Unfortunately, since it's in /sys, it's generated dynamically every time I boot up, so I need to change the file's permissions every time I restart.
I often use my computer in text-only mode, so no X11, no window manager, etc.
