now the topology rules cleary stated in the intel data sheet.
can i have external links, or will you kick me off here like forum-seven did.
the 2GB sticks are easy,  and many work, 1.35v or dual voltage sticks.
the only 4GB sticks that work are ones with 16chips called low density.
i have 3 of these laptops build from piece parts cheap.... (retired tech)
and they DO NOT REVISE spec's on 5 year old processors to match modern memory
IRQ LESS OR EQUAL usually suggests a problem with memory also.
and is just a waste of time, it is the wrong memory here.
and runs great until it gets warm and fails memtest86, as it slows, from heat.
don't be fooled, i have this old (nice) 2gb Samsung stick that is 1.5v
This would explain why you're getting the "Maximum Capacity: 8 GB" in your dmidecode.
limited buy i5 or i7 mem, manager, not HP.its and Intel limit.

It seems the HP EliteBook 8540p can only support a maximum 8GB of RAM (4GB per slot).
and the memory needs match or better the speed of your processor.
if you go to the store like BB, they have high density memory that will not work,  with this old processor
this is complex, but not as bad as overheating, that i cured.
but not the 4gb, and 8gb sticks are not supported at all.
on the i5 with 2 SO-dimm slots only 2x 4gb is max.
