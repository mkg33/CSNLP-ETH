The only way I've gotten it to work is using my other linux server to forward using virtual hosts, and that has to use the ip address, too.
Then you just point your router to your internal DNS server as one of it's WAN DNS servers (make it the first one in the list)
My router doesn't recognize the hostname; it shows the mac address as the name.
This works for RaspberryPi, BeagleboneBlack and as far as I can remember also with Ubuntu.
This causes the pi not to show my website online (I think).
and if your /etc/hostname is set correctly this will show up in the network without a restart.
My problem is that the only way I can ssh into it with putty is through the static ip.
You can try what Lawrence says, or if there is a way in your router to specify static DNS resolutions, as there is in DD-WRT you could try that.
Some routers only use the netbios hostname and this is published to all Windows machines.
I would suggest setting up a real DNS server at some point, as it will simplify DNS resolution.
I've got a raspberry pi running raspbian server edition.
However, now that I have my other server off, the website doesn't work and I can't ssh (or find it anywhere on the network) using the hostname.
Check /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf and make sure the line that begins with 'sendhostname' is not commented out.
