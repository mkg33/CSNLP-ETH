Once I had a customer insist on a particular dress code, and I expensed the resulting dry-cleaning bill back to him.
I feel it's my job to present an attitude of confidence, reliability, and professionalism to those that I run across during the work day and the first step in doing that is through my appearance.
This has ranged from pants with holes in them (ok i just didn't notice the holes until i've gotten to work) and t-shirts (although I avoid any of my "controversal" shirts ) all the way to khaki's and a polo.
Linux sys admins have a bad reputation for dress code and I have to agree.
My office is right next to the division president's so no i don't change.
It really is true that people make judgements about you based on how you look.
I usually dress with jeans and a polo shirt, socks and black "trainer" walking shoes, and usually have my Tilley hat with me.
That said I do have a cowboy hat and a replica hand-grenade on my desk so I may be sending mixed-messages to be honest...
Unless I know I have a client meeting or something like that.
The old adage "the clothes make the man" still carries weight as far as I'm concerned.
Others in my office wear jeans and t-shirts but for me it's about presenting a certain image to my co-workers and customers.
Never shorts or sandals, occasionally t-shirts or button-down short sleeves.
For me it's khakis or chinos with a button shirt or polo.
When I'm at the corporate offices the dress code is pretty much the same, the "C" levels do at most business casual although they have been known to come in in jeans and t-shirts fairly regularly as well.
If you look like the plumber I'm not going to feel good about you touching my network.
My bosses understand that ties double my hourly rates.
All the great ones I have know have always been a little lacking in wardrobe.
Basically I roll out of bed and throw the first thing I see on.
No offense to anyone wearing jeans, shorts, or t-shirts.
When he challenged the expense, I just showed him the particular area I'd been working in, and told him that unless he wanted building maintenance to keep this area a lot cleaner, the cleaning expenses were directly tied to my observance of the dress code.
I tend to dress reasonably smartly - business-casual I guess, I certainly stopped wearing a tie a few years ago anyway.
I'm fortunate in that for the most part, the people who might care about my appearance both appreciate my ability to get things done and understand the job's potential for having to go digging around in dirty and unpleasant places; if appearance is super important for a particular function, they usually give me the heads up and I'll either make myself scarce or dress up for the function.
