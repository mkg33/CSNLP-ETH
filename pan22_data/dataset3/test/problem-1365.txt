Alternatively, you can remove the execute permission in the advanced permissions of the aforementioned dialog.
This wouldnt make them non-executable, but unable to be seen without some snooping.
You can limit the permission change to just the executable.
As @Biswapriyo mentioned in the comments, I just rename the executable file.
Be aware, all files with this change cannot be read at all, meaning a text file in the folder, or a configuration file, will not be able to opened or edited.
There are three methods I can think of off the top of my head on how this can be done, all permissions related.
Of course, you would manually remove the Start Menu entries manually.
I don't know if this is a solution that works the way you want it, but you can try it out and see for yourself.
If you move the required program away from this folder (to the desktop for example), it will no longer appear in your start menu when searching it in the start menu.
Optimally, you can write a script (I presume you are familiar with this) that automatically copies the program that's linked in the start menu to a seperate folder and back.
Of course, this doesn't fully hide it from all menus, as you requested, but it's very fast and easy.
I wont go in to much detail on how to do it, as there are countless guides you can Google on how to do this.
You can either remove a user or group's read access to a folder and/or files in the File Permissions dialog.
Normally all programs/applications will be shown if you start typing the name in the start menu.
Also, I don't think it'll work 100% the way you want it
If you right-click on them, you can select "Go to file location".
With the former method, the affected users will not be able to read the files or folders contents, thereby making it unable to be executed.
With the latter method, it is more targeted and only the executable would be affected and unable to run.
Then if I want it to work again, I just rename it to the original name.
This will send you to StartMenu\Programs directory.
