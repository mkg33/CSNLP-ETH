You can then use @Penang example (above) to verify if the files don't get created anymore.
As stated on wikipedia, "DS_Store (Desktop Services Store) is a hidden file created by Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X operating system to store custom attributes of a folder such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image."
If you run this in Terminal this stops them auto generated when you create folders, you can turn it back on if you choose.
If you are in /Users/username, which is your $HOME directory and there is a subdirectory named foo that you want to zip but ignore all .DS_Store files, then do the following:
Open Terminal (/Applications/Utilies/Terminal.app) and run the following command to show hidden files:
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE && killall Finder
I had to upload a zip file and every folder had that file in it and this helped me.
No goofy third party applications needed nor do you need to trash your .DS_Store files at all - just rely on all of the unix tool goodness built right in to OSX / Darwin.
You can delete .DS_Store files just like any other files without causing any harm to your directory.
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE && killall Finder
To interpret this, we are running the zip executable with the following parameters/arguments:
If you do not mind jumping down in to terminal, then this is pretty darn easy.
