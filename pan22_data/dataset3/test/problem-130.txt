I've always thought there should be a shortcut so you can toggle the case between upper and lower, for example when you're...
Are there any "common" text editors or word processors (Notepad, Wordpad, Word etc.)
In Word, if you highlight the text and press Shift+F3 , it should toggle between upper and lower.
I realize that it is not Word, Notepad, WordPad, but I guess it goes in the etc.
LibreOffice has an Auto Correct option "Correct accidental use of cAPS LOCK key".
Most likely the editors that you mentioned have similar options too, at least Word should have it, but I don't have Word here, so I can't say.
SynWrite (Windows editor similar to Notepad++) has it.
which allow you to invert the case of a string of text easily?
I keep meaning to write a macro or similar, but it never seems worth the effort at the time.
I would rather convert it with a few clicks than type it out again as:
With the lightweight Notepad2 or Notepad2-mod, simply select the text you want to fix, then press Ctrl+Alt+U.
