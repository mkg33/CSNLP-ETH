A 5-port Gigabit switch, which would add three more ports, is about $15.
Consumer applications that would have more than four wired devices in the same physical location as the router are rare.
So thats why you won't easily find a switch with 10 ports unless the last 2 are dedicated ports or expanders.
Consumer routers changed this to 4 due mostly to the much more common 4 port interface chips than the 1 port ones.
For some reason, the majority of consumer wifi routers are limited to 4 ports.
Having a switch with a factor of 2 ports would mean having double the number of switch logic chips.
Usually each port will be multiplexed on to several ports while some will be dedicated.
And they might have a printer that uses a wired connection.
On a home router the layout is usually a SOC with one Ethernet port and a switch module on the PCI bus totally 5 ports.
They don't have to worry about messy things like NAT, firewalls, port forwarding and the host of other messy things routers commonly do.
On business network switches there is usually one or two dedicated ports or these are used as expansion ports.
and economically its not worth bothering have a hybrid of some 4 port and some 2 port in the same device.
Is there a technical reason for limiting the number of ports on wifi routers to 4 ports?
An 8-port Gigabit switch, which would add six more ports, is about $25.
A typical home user might have a desktop near the router.
In function this means bringing in your WAN connection and translating it (using NAT) to your local network.
The router needs one port for its CPU to connect to the devices on the LAN.
The isolation transformers used for all category cables usually come in 4 or 8.
Beware the difference between a Router and a Switch
While many components such as the physical connectors come in packs of 4 or 6.
The basic point here is that a router is actually expected to have fewer ports as it's job is to 'route' a connection between two areas.
While not a full excuse in and of itself, it is worth noting that a router and a switch are functionally expected to be two different things (currently blurred by the existance of Layer 3 Switches).
In the old days Routers were naturally expected to have only two ports, one for the WAN and one for the LAN.
Typical cheap low-end switching ICs have five ports.
The ports will be in factors of 2 due to multiplexing.
The main reason is simply that most devices connect wirelessly today.
The reason for this has a lot to do with geometry and economics.
Switches, commonly, come with large batches of ports as their job is just to split up the traffic according to ARP tables.
A switch to expand the number of LAN ports is absurdly cheap.
