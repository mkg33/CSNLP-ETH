I do not understand why, because if you want to avoid this behaviour you can give your volumes different pass words.
I'm not sure how secure this is but better than using the --password option since that shows up in ps.
I find this so unhandy that I decided to stay with TrueCrypt, despite the security risks.
Obviously this feature has delibarately been removed with VeraCrypt.
There is a button available in the UI, or the following command will ask for the password/keyfiles/PIM once, and automatically mount multiple volumes, if they exist:
So I have multiple hard drives encrypted with the same password and instead of having to enter it multiple times I'd like to have it set up so that after booting I automatically get a password-box displayed into which I enter the password once and which then mounts all the encrypted hard drives and securely removes the password from cache/memory afterwards.
The "Auto-Mount Devices" feature is still available, at least in VeraCrypt 1.21.
If it's not possible via the GUI maybe via a script?
If, for instance, 4 volumes are loaded at logon and these volumes have the same password, then the password only needs to be filled out once in the text box.
