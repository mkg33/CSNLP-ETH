We are running the Cygwin SSH daemon to provide SSH access to the server, but for some reason when we log in to the Windows 2003 server using SSH we can no longer access the NFS shares.
gpedit.msc -> Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Scripts (Startup/Shutdown)
However, one use case that we have is that we need to access this server using SSH, and still be able to access the NFS shares.
Can anyone tell me why I am unable to see these NFS shares when logged in with SSH?
To demonstrate, here is the output of the 'mount' command, first from a Cygwin shell when logged in with remote desktop:
When I log in to this server with remote desktop, I am able to browse the contents of the NFS shares and everything works fine.
Notice the missing O: P: and Z: NFS shares in the latter.
And now, the same 'mount' command when logged in with SSH:
We have a Windows 2003 Server on which we have installed Microsoft's Services for UNIX, and we have mounted a few NFS shares that contain shared resources that we need to access from this box.
From within Cygwin shell, I have used "net use \\server\path\path n:"
