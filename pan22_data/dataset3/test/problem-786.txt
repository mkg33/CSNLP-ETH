If you got in the car and managed to drive it, IT HAS WHEELS.
I doubt very much any of the tutorial information you have read has instructed you to replace /lib, either.
The /lib/modules subdirectories contain kernel modules such as hardware drivers.
It is exactly as feasible as someone saying, "I was driving my car and someone said to look for the wheels, but I looked and there are no wheels!"
Add the output of ls -l / to your post if possible.
If the search results are taking too much screen space, use the following:
Most likely you were to add a directory for your new kernel to /lib/modules, or replace an existing one.
On any Unix system (even Mac), finding anything is easy when you know how.
Whatever you've done, if you've removed stuff willy-nilly from /lib and now have serious problems, you're screwed (unless of course you have a previous backup) -- you might as well just start from scratch with a fresh image on the card.
The slash "/" tells find where to start searching.
That would be (again, pure and simple) malicious, since the most basic and essential components of the system, beyond the kernel, are in /lib.
The pipe sign "|" tells that the output of find should be processed by less.
There is no possible reason for replacing the whole directory.
Although you already got a perfectly good answer, here I give a generic way to find your files and directories in the future.
It could be something like "/home" if you want to search only user accounts.
Sorry, Stijnb, but there is ABSOLUTELY AND COMPLETELY no possibility of a raspbian system working at all -- not even a little bit, not anything, no login, no init, nothing -- without the /lib folder.
If it is the latter, move the old folder to somewhere you can get it back from again (e.g., just rename it).
