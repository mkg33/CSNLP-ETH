Since GRUB is a boot loader, it doesn't know anything about mountpoints at all.
The typical usage is that you create a GRUB boot floppy with a filesystem.
For example, under Linux the following will install GRUB into the MBR of the first IDE disk:
If it is the first BIOS drive, this is the same as well:
Likewise, under GNU/Hurd, this has the same effect:
Therefore, you may run grub directly to install GRUB, without using grub-install.
You only need to specify one argument to the program, namely, where to install the boot loader.
By the way, as noted above, it is quite difficult to guess BIOS drives correctly under a UNIX-like OS.
The argument can be either a device file (like `/dev/hda') or a partition specified in GRUB's notation.
If the output is wrong, it is unlikely that your computer will be able to boot with no problem.
But all the above examples assume that GRUB should use images under the root directory.
Installing a boot loader on a running OS may be extremely dangerous.
Note that grub-install is actually just a shell script and the real task is done by the grub shell grub (see Invoking the grub shell).
Don't do that, however, unless you are very familiar with the internals of GRUB.
If you want GRUB to use images under a directory other than the root directory, you need to specify the option --root-directory.
Another example is when you have a separate boot partition which is mounted at /boot.
Thus, grub-install will prompt you to check if it could really guess the correct mappings, after the installation.
