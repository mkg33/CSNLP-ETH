When the external drive is removed, Google Drive reports the error "Your Google Drive folder is missing".
Sync your external or network drives to Google Drive with Insync’s “Plug-n-sync”.
You could use the Insync Google Drive client ($29.99 with 15 days trial).
Do you know why your external drive is getting disconnected?
Syncing will resume automatically as soon as you plug back that external drive:
Then you could start Google Drive after your external drive has already been connected.
This setup works fine as long as my hard drive remains plugged in all the time my computer is on.
I have my Google Drive folder on my external hard drive as my internal is a tiny SSD.
This is quite irritating to be doing on a daily basis so I was hoping there would be a way to automate it.
If it happens when you restart your computer, you could try stopping Google Drive from starting automatically.
The Official Google Help page describes how to fix that error, but I'm afraid it's all manual (click the error message and then the "Locate Folder" button).
If it is unplugged I have to go into drive settings and select the drive folder again to resume syncing.
