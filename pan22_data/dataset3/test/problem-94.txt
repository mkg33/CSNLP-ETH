Since your question is about how to get the most compression, you'd probably be happier choosing Ultra.
Generally speaking, text files can be highly compressed (even 90% or more) whereas some file formats like images are already highly compressed in their existing form and adding them to a compressed archive will do little or nothing to further decrease their size.
This is highly dependant on the content of the file(s) you want to compress.
Using 7-Zip as an example, when you create an archive you can select from six different levels of compression ranging from Store (no compression) to Ultra (smallest file size).
When compressing with Winrar or 7-zip, you have the option to use better compression at the cost of it taking longer.
Compressing already compressed data will only save you very little space.
Having said that, applications like 7-Zip usually have settings where you can choose the level of compression.
If it's 10 GB of random data, you won't be able to compress it at all.
Lossy compression usually gives smaller files due to the fact that it throws information away (lossy).
Compression algorithms like MP3 or jpegs do loose quality when compressing.
How much a file is compressed depends largely on what type of file it is.

When using lossless compression (think 7-zip/winrar) then, no.
But again, some files can be compressed a lot more than others and even choosing Ultra when trying to compress an image file may not save you more than a few bytes of space, if that (depending on various factors including original file size).
Higher compression requires more time to process, so if you're in a hurry or saving every last byte isn't critical, choosing something like Normal is going to give you acceptable results.
If you have a 10 GB file consisting of 10,000,000,000 repetitions of the letter A, it can be compressed into a few hundred bytes.
