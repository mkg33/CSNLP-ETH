Zenoss Core has a ZenPack for monitoring JMX: http://community.zenoss.org/docs/DOC-4027  Open Source and free, the JMX ZenPack is used by lots of users and customers on some really big apps.
The binary is called jmc on Linux and jmc.exe on Windows and it is located in $JAVA_HOME/bin/.
As others have mentioned there are some SAAS solutions as well:
You can use a combination of JMXTrans and Graphite.
Try the best solution in monitoring software: Nagios.
I am using Java Mission Control which is part of recent JDK7 releases and all JDK8 releases.
There are plenty of JMX tools that can do what you want.
How much effort are you going to be putting in to customise it?
The default sample rate is 1 second, but it is configurable for each MBean attribute.
Besides monitoring the items exposed by JMX you can run a profiler called Java Flight Recorder.
Nagios/Zenoss/etc are free, but easily extensible.
There are several JMX plugins on the net: nagios jmx.
ITRS/BMC/HPOV are all larger, expensive solutions.
JMXTrans will periodically get the values of your JMX counters and then store them in Graphite.
