Administrator accounts can generally see everything on the drive do to some weird quirks of NTFS.
If you are worried, encrypting the drive can mitigate that concern.
What I have found that works is to grant modify rights to the "Everyone" user on the root of the external drive.
The "S-1-5-21..." number is the security ID of the user account that created folders on the NTFS drive.
Almost all permissions set on an NTFS hard drive use the Security ID number instead of the display name of the user.
It will take some time to process, but it will open up the drive for any account to access the drive.
Most people use these drives to pass files around so they want everyone to be able to read it.
NTFS was designed for use in a domain when user's Security ID's don't change between computers.
NTFS formatted external drives will act like an internal drive and setup permissions in a way where only users of one machine can access the drive.
I'm assuming that you are not part of a domain since you switched machines.
This does introduce a security risk that it makes it easy for anyone to edit files on the drive.
