That may not be what you need, but ... it might help.
For example, sometime the network adapter just fails to transmit the start command to the power supply.
If you are trying to wake the host.. On a older HP I had to use an unused Ethernet NIC, not teamed, and sent the packet to its MAC to wake the server.
However, you stated that this is not the case so let me explain why I think that wol doesn't work in your case:
Or address it to to the physical MAC of one of your NICs in the team.
If you have to chance to do that, please let me know if it worked!
Because of that I would strongly suggest to use the iLO adapter to power on your sever reliably, if you have the opportunity to do so.
You could try to send a wol-packet to a single NIC without teaming, to see if it works.
Sadly I couldn't find any hard proof to back this assumption.
But since the server is powered off when you send the wol-packet, I don't think that the virtual MAC-address exists at that point.
I'm not 100% sure of this but I am pretty positive that the problem is the NIC teaming.
