), there's an option usually called "GPU scaling" which you should disable (use native) to avoid any stretching.
To get higher resolutions that display properly, they need a double-link DVI cable, which maxes out at 2560x1600.
If all scaling options are disabled AND the resolution is set to 1920x1080, no stretching of any kind should occur, the picture should fill the screen and the image should look crisp.
DisplayPort is the best option if available because it maxes out at 3840x2160.
Many people are trying to use a single-link DVI cable with a very high resolution monitor, but this type of cable maxes out at 1920x1200.
Another important issue has to do with cables and the different resolutions supported by the different connection standards (VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort).
btw, by second display, you mean you are using both displays simultaneously?
In your video card control panel (Nvidia/ATI Catalyst/Intel Graphics/etc.
You won't know that the cable is causing a problem because your graphics card may show it is producing an output resolution that exceeds the specs for a single-link cable, but you will get a bad picture with blurry text.
Note: Posted for reference, after having discussing it in your other question.
Also disable any other scaling or zoom options, such as Underscan/Overscan which may also prevent a native resolution image.
Next best would be to use double-link DVI cable matched to a graphics card and monitor that support the high resolution the user is trying to achieve.
