Simply do not have mailboxes on your front end server, use it purely for email exchange.
Anything that gets past your first line of defense should get caught by the AV.
Secure your front end servers (the ones that have SMTP running and that the computers on the internet send email to) so that people can't send email via the server from outside your network.
So, your problem is not the computer, your problem is an admin not able to secure something as simple as a dedicated SMTP sender.
Can't do nothing if they can't connect on port 25.
Get some sort of virus scanning going on at your gateway.
So, you can do this, but it shouldn't be your primary response to getting blacklisted.
Likeky your whole network and all netwroks assigned to you will be blocked at one time.
I think Trend Micro, AppRiver, and Exchange Defender all do this...probably many more...
Stop anonymous relaying on your exchange server, only allow secure connections and close port 25.
But then, with 2010 and not-stupid configuration you would not ever have the issue.
I think you're putting too many eggs in the wrong basket.
You'll be much better off protecting your Exchange server, then trying to figure out how to migrate exchange on the fly.
The spam-fighters aren't clueless, expect this to only work for a little while before they implement a larger block and start contacting your upstream ISPs.
Install some anti-virus software on all your servers and workstations.
Put good antivirus software on all of your computers.
Once all this is done you should be protected from spammers sending email through your servers and you should stop getting blacklisted.
I'm sure someone out there is blocking IP addresses in blocks.
If you can, create the SPF records for your domain (http://www.openspf.org/).
I assume, however, that there are blocklists that are smarter than that.
Basically 2007+ allow you to have different roles for a server.
However, unless you track down the source of this, and prevent it from happening in the future, it will almost certainly happen again (and again :-).
So if one gets blocked, you can switch to another.
To add to @mrdenny above, also prohibit workstations from sending email outside of the company network.
Block outbound connections to port 25 from every computer except your Exchange servers.
There's nothing to say that just because a user's mailbox is on one server that all of their mail has to go out to the internet from the same server...just set it up in Exchange to all go through a clean server.
As far as moving people, you can always route email through another Exchange server without moving the mailboxes.
That said, I never had an issue with spam in 15 years from any of my servers.
I know we hate it (I hate it too), but it's a necessary evil.
Install some anti-virus software on your exchange server.
The workstations should only be able to send email through the exchange server which will send the email out to the recipient.
It also goes without saying to have antivirus software installed on your workstations and exchange server.
An IPS at the same location would also be a great idea.
