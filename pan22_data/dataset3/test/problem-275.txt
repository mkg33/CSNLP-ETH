It's an opaque alternative zone (kind of like an alternate data stream on a file).
Of course you need to specify multiple records or make multiple QRPs if you have more in the zone.
Therefore, when you create a Query Resolution Policy, you are defining the rules by which a particular query chooses a zone scope.
By defining a zone scope with only 1 record HostA, and then defining a QRP that sends all queries from certain IPs to that zone, you are effectively saying they can only see that record.
You're trying to think of the zone scope as a sort of "transparency" overlayed on the original zone, but in fact it is not.
A query against that zone scope will never "fall back" onto the default zone.
Adding the FQDN to the QRP means that only clients from the specified subnet(s) who are also querying HostA.test.local, will be sent to the alternate zone scope.
You do this by way of the -FQDN parameter as shown below.
You did everything right except that you forgot to restrict the Query Resolution Policy to the specific records that are in the Zone Scope.
