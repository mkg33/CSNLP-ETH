I can't say that Macs (users) have fewer problems, maybe it's true that there are other kind of problems.
(maybe someone elses search skills are better then mine & can link a copy here).
You may be able to get away with having some users on Mac's, but not the whole business.
Here's a review of the whitepaper from a someone user who trashes it.
There are a few factors which will influence the ratio:
What you're really asking is: Do Mac's have a lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) when compared to PC running Windows?
What is important to realize is that the tools on a system is dependend on the role of the person.
For Linux (and most likely MAC) you as an admin can login remotely and install/reconfigure things in a (semi) automated way.
The reality is, this will not describe every user in your organization.
When fully automated the cost of supporting can drop dramatically.
I have to support both PCs and Macs in my network.
The hours you'll spend per machine on support will have far less to do with the platform than the user so make a decision that is sensitive to the preferences and skills of your users and proceed.
Most accounting & other LOB application packages are mostly Windows based.
Yes, it's not an aphrodite to athena   apples to oranges comparison.
There was a whitepaper a few years back that tried to do a comparison, although all links to it seem dead!
From my experience (Having supported a combination of Win95, WinNT4 and Linux from '98-'04) the time of managing the 'computers' can be automated for all platforms (dunno about mac).
Depends entirely on the applications involved, the tasks involved, the caliber and experience of the users, the caliber and experience of the IT staff, and a couple hundred other things.
Hell, the ratio wouldn't even be the same in different departments in my own company, let alone someone else's company with zero indication of what they do...
So if you can have a 'one size fits all' your cost will be much lower than a single platform (win, mac, linux,...) with different applications on each instance.
For example, simple incompatibility problems ("emails don't look like in Outlook", VPN configuration is different).
BTW: The most time is spent supporting users, regardless of the platform.
A 15 person company implicitly means "only 1 or 2 people peer role" so you'll have a a lot of diversity in usage patterns of those systems.
Off topic: Having a heterous environment is a huge challenge and dangerous, if sysadmins lack personal experience with the different systems.
If  your user are only ever going use is a browser, productivity apps like word, excel do some presentations then macs are probably the way to go.
But on the other hand it helps in understanding some underlying concepts, because you have multiple perspectives on the topics.
IMHO apple mac's these days are appliances (unless your doing objective-c dev work).
