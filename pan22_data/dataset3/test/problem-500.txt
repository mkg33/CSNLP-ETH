Genrally the daemon writes its settings when it exits (or is restarted).
In /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json, there are these options:
The program is smarter than usual and detects that your password is not a hash, so it overwrites the password with the hash to be secure.
The config file is ambiguous, and keeps getting overwritten when you restart the daemon in Debian, anyway.
This also means that you have to completely disable daemon-startup on boot, reboot, edit your settings.json and then re-enabling it to make the changes you do persist.
You can force the daemon to reload new settings by sending it SIGHUP:
Pretty annoying, but once you're aware of what's going on, it's fairly easy to cope.
BTW: I'm not happy that transmission-remote-cli wants to have the password on the command line.
However, remember that it writes the password it loaded with when it shuts down.
So doing /etc/init.d/transmission-daemon restart will not do what you expect if you've written the file while it's running.
Does anyone know how to set the password properly?
...then it will not overwrite your settings anymore when stopping.
It overwrites rpc-password, and the password it prints doesn't work anyway.
This means that any changes you do to settings.json will get overwritten on next restart, whenever that is.
While this post already has an accepted answer, I find it worth adding that in Ubuntu the transmission-daemon is actually not stoppable once started.
