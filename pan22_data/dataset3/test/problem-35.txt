The "bubbling " to user space is enabled by the listening port.
putting an IP on a bridge is pretty usefully if you want to bridge 2 interfaces  and communicate to hosts on both sides of the bridge.
2) packet arrives on eth1 destined for the MAC of the bridge.
(Unless a specific netfilter rule is used to intercept it - see other answer)
Pointing an IP on the bridge Means the  the  packets are destined for the Bridges MAC address and so the normal Local delivery packet  receiving process is invoked.
This isn't the answer, but there is limit of the comment lenght, so I have written this text as answer.
In addition I created an application with a TCP Listener on port 80 in the user-space on PC-A
Here the packet doesn't leave the bridge but instead is received by the  IP stack as an  normal inbound packet on br1.
Set the sysctl variable bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1 (kernel module br_netfilter should be loaded).
I set up a bridge interface (br0) on PC-A (Linux Ubunutu 14.04)
As what I understood from the documentation of Netfilter and bridge-utils is that the bridge suppose to route the packets through the kernel without bubble it up into the user space but when I connect a wired (p2p) PC-B to the bridge pc (PC-A) and surf to a HTTP web I can see the packets are being received in the listener which means that the packets got into the user-space.
Let's say we have  eth1 and eth2 connected via br1
The strangest thing here is that I have the same configuration in another location and the packets don't get up there to the user-space unless I add a broute rule (which is the expected behavior I guess)
This packet is then processed and then the  data is forwarded to the process listening on port 80 on the br1 interface.
1) packet arrives on eth1 Destined for an non-local MAC,  packet is forward by kernel through the bridge and out to eth2.
Any change anyone knows what can cause the strange behavior?
To redirect the switched frames to local port you can done the next steps:
I have to say that there are no ebtables rules in any chain that tells packet to redirect up to the user-space.
