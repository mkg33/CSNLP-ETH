I've got users using RDP to connect to a Windows 2008 with Windows Server 2008's Terminal Server Application mode.
On the Windows clients (that are running RDP to connect) - I can't run more than one session of tsclient (the Remote Desktop sofware.)
However, if I don't use a shortcut, I can have two RDP sessions going at once (haven't tried connecting to the same server yet.)
I've tried duplicating the shortcuts that the users use to launch the session, I've tried renaming the server (using hostname in one shortcut and IP address in another), but no matter what I do, it keeps focusing the already existing RDP session rather than creating a new one.
How can I tell Remote Desktop to open a new session rather than reusing the old one?
I can manage to seperate the users and handle everything on the Windows 2008 Terminal Server side - but I've got one major issue.
But our guys need to be able to run multiple instances of the app locally.
(Users RDP in and get an app that looks like it's running locally.)
