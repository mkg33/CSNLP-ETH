The last solution is to have a professional repairman examine the computer.
Literally just removing the button is easier, because when that button goes, you can't meet the switch without opening it again, however, more often than not... you can find a pen, pencil or elsewise "non-conductive poking implement" near by
If you press the power button kind of hard and wiggle your finger a bit for a couple of seconds, does it work better on the first try?
If this doesn't seem to help, try slightly squeezing the laptop (top and bottom) near where the power cord plugs in, and while doing that press the power button.
This completes a circuit which signals the power supply to turn on the rest of the computer.
otherwise start up in parallel all the connected devices.
Well you could do that, But its going to break again...
If the computer turns on immediately, then the power button needs replacement.
has difficulties to supply enough power to boot the computer.
Booting is one of the cases where more power is required to spin up or
If this helps, then the problem is probably closer to the power supply rather than the button.
Most power buttons simply cause two pieces of metal to touch when you press the button.
using a screw-driver or anything that is conductive.
You might be able to get a new one from the manufacturer or from other avenues.
He will have the tools to analyze the problem, and the spare parts to test
and it takes some time before it recognizes a press.
An additional possibility is that the power button might have gotten worn out
Thats why I dont warranty those buttons, because I know they WILL break again.
Another possibility is that the Power Supply Unit (PSU) is getting weak and
To test this idea, open the computer while it is turned off, unplug the power button
from the motherboard and bridge the two pins where it was connected
I've repaired these laptops for this issue many times...
The plastic frame backing of the power button is messed up so its not meeting the membrane correctly, even though it seems/feels like it is.
Or, if one of the wires going from the power button to the power supply is loose or has a bad connection somewhere, the same thing could result.
The existing answers cover pretty much most of the known solutions for this problem.
If yes, then it is probably related to the power button itself.
He might also give the computer a thorough cleanup.
Why dont I suggest "replacing the button" you may ask?
If something is blocking the connection between the pieces of metal under the power button, it could be struggling to complete the circuit.
