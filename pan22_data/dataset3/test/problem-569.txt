Below is the error output from running either of these commands:
I'm trying to ssh into my ec2 instance in order to deploy my MEAN-stack app but no matter what I'm receiving a timeout error.
These are the solutions that I've tried that did not seem to work:
All of your clues initially seemed to point to an issue with the Security Group attached to the instance, but your SG rules look fine.
For starters, reset your Mac's /etc/ssh/ssh_config to its default, because you didn't change the SSH port the server is listening on.
If that doesn't work, try putting your Mac onto a different network, perhaps turn on your phone's hotspot and connect to that or go to a friend's house or to a coffee shop.
On my mac I've tried connecting via FileZilla, Cyberduck and even using command line arguments such as ssh -v -v -v -i "<pem-file-name>.pem" ubuntu@ec2-18-207-106-113.compute-1.amazonaws.com and ssh ubuntu@ec2-18-207-106-113.compute-1.amazonaws.com.
That should (hopefully) work, then you can work your way back to tracking down what was causing the problem in your equipment.
Now the clues are pointing to an issue on the local side, either your Mac and/or your network.
There's a tool called hping that you can get on your Mac (via brew) that you can use to 'ping' port 22 on your 18.207.106.113 server.
I've tried so many solutions that were posted in other StackExchange threads but to no avail.
And if that fails, use a different machine altogether.
