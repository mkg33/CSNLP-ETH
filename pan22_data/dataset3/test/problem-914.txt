rolled back) during normal restore process when using sql back up files.
Lastly, to cover your question, it's a bad idea to not backup the transaction log.
If you've got multiple DBs for multiple apps, can your backup solution only restore ONE database (both the MDF and LDF) or will you have to restore all the DBs?
Not having the Trans Log when you restore one of these will make getting the DB back online and functional a much more difficult task.
The problem that you back up mdf files only (while allowing ldf files recreated during full restore) is that you may have "dirty" transaction data in your mdf files.
Even in Simple Recovery, you can have "in flight" transactions that haven't gotten to the point of being written into the MDF yet.
Frankly, I'd take the safe way out, turn off the VSS snapshots of your SQL data and log drives, set up a backup process using the native SQL backup command on a set schedule to a location that is covered by the VSS.
Do you have more than one database per-SQL instance?
More work for you, a bit more work for whoever's in charge of the VSS snapshots, but you'll be much happier if / when you have to restore a database down the road.
Quick answer would be that you'd better do full backup + differential backup.
These "dirty" data usually can be cleaned out (i.e.
As Kris G pointed out, how do you KNOW your VSS snapshots are restorable to a working SQL DB?
