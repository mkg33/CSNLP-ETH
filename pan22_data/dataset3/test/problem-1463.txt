I don't think that both users would be able to simultaneously edit this file.
I like mercurial (good tutorial here), but subversion and git are the classics.
This swap file helps if you want to recover after some sort of an error.
I don't think so, because Vim creates a swap file any time you open a file.
Somebody has mentioned something similar on Hackernews.
When the second user opens the file, his or her Vim will see the swap file and get an error and the options to ignore, delete, recover, etc.
I think the best way to have both users work on the same file is to use a version control system.
One dirty hack would be to sync your files over a file storage service like Dropbox.
You might also want to take a look at DocSynch (its peresently available only for JEd, a VIM plugin is supposedly still in development).
Sorry to dig out this old question but as I bumped on it and found an answer here it is:
i know it's dirty too but you may use screen for the first terminal then screen -x on the second one and so on when logged into a terminal with the same user from somewhere else
I'm not aware of any vim plugins for collaborative editing, but have a look at gobby.
