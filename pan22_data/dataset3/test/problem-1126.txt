If you're asking about actual front-end software, Drupal has been a very popular choice for portal/gateway/website/* because it's nearly infinitely flexible.
Hardware requirements are typical of web and database servers.
My company has a large SharePoint installation, and is very happy with it.
Since it's essentially just PHP and MySQL, you could do it on the cheap with database replication and revision control.
You could set up a test server for this on Amazon's EC2 for not too many dollars.
When you say "Portal" do you mean "Remote application portal"?
I've actually gotten Adito to work, but it's a pain.
Just to add to Sunny's suggestion of Websphere Portal.
I'd second the suggestion for a wiki with access-control.
This is relatively recent news, but Drupal Mavens have released Open Atrium: http://openatrium.com/
I imagine that you have significant resources available at your disposal, so I'll dispense with the rsync/mysql-dump advice and go straight to "get a content delivery system".
If you're brave, you might even have a look at Adito, the open source fork of the same product.
It offers the portal functionality you are looking for, with the ability to create team sites for departmental / divisional portals in addition to your corporate portal.
It looks pretty decently features, and sounds extensible.
The two I'd recommend would be Atlassian's Confluence or MindTouch DekiWiki.
I know that Cisco makes one (you'll have to Google, I can't post links yet), and I'm assuming that since this will be in your intranet that akamai is out of the question.
You may be able to do it cheaper by using global server load balancing (GSLB) to point people to the "right" server, if you do decide to do the sync-and-distribute on your own.
DekiWiki has an open-source version if that is what you are looking for.
If you are interested in wiki capability, SharePoint offers that as well, with enhancements coming in the next version.
If you run Microsoft servers in your shop, you should look into SharePoint.
I've never been a part of an organization that large, so I can't tell you firsthand, but I'll be paying attention to the rest of this thread.
