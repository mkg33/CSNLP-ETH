As well as the POP and IMAP interfaces you get a rather good web based interface too which I use almost exclusively (though you can mix and match, one of my friends uses IMAP for quick checks on her iPhone when mobile and POP for downloading to her local mail store at home) - I'm guessing that the web interface with Scalix is not dissimilar.
Do you have any approximate figures for what scale of data is stored and turned around by your current arrangement?
The scale of your mail operation will dictate what sort of hardware are you are going to need to serve it too.
Rather than trying to weld all that together yourself it might be worth considering something like Zimbra or Scalix, both of which do all the above out of the box and have open-source or "community" editions that are free from financial costs if that is a concern.
Provisioning domains and accounts can be done from both the web interface and the command line, though to get delegated administration (having different admin users for different domains or sets of domains) you need to pay for one of the supported versions.
As for scale, you need a more precise idea than just "a lot" when sizing up the capabilities of a mail stack.
I run two small-scale Zimbra servers (one for myself and family+friends and one for a small office), in both cases the F/OSS edition, and find it far more practical than putting a stack together myself (even though I could if I particularly wanted to).
