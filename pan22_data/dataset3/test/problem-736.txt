If you have many different flows they statistically distribute somewhat evenly.
In the best case, the application can be configured to distribute the traffic over multiple IP addresses.
In another case, you use a DNS name in the configuration that resolves to multiple IP addresses with round-robin and the application alternates between them (either by not caching or on purpose).
A single flow will not benefit from trunking at all.
Since your traffic flow is mainly from the switch to the backup server and the 5400zl uses SA/DA traffic distribution, the load balancing is completely dependent on the source and destination IP addresses of the packets - each pair of source and destination IPs will always use the same physical link.
Very few flows will not distribute very well, only by luck or fine-tuning (=selecting the combinations of IP addresses that result in the desired distribution).
Usually, it's preferrable to not use link aggregation in layer 2 but to use multiple independent NICs with multiple IP addresses and do the load-balancing in the application in layer 3 (=using the different IP addresses).
