The Acer Aspire 5560 has a buggy UEFI implementation, it doesn't like GPT disks.
It also prevents BIOS from allowing alternative boot devices or entering pre-boot setup until both AC and battery are removed.
Attempting a suspend (closing the laptop lid) will leave a blinking cursor on the screen, a forced power cycle is required.
Attempting to "fix startup" with the install disc I just installed it with says, the "...System Recovery Options are not compatible with the version of Windows it's trying to repair...", even though not a single Windows Update was preformed.
Same individual also discovered, when installing Enterprise on top of a fresh Pro install, the problem is also no longer present.
This failed suspend process trashed something, preventing a normal boot and preventing a "fix start up" boot.
A coworker discovered installing Windows 7 Pro (6.1.7600) does not exhibit the freeze problem.
But, when I try to install windows from a flash drive - I don't see prompt  "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD..." My solution - manually delete the EFI folder on the root of the media (source).
I just installed Windows 7 Enterprise (no sp, v6.1.7600) to an Acer Aspire 5560.
I checked on my coworker's Win7 Pro->Ent image, it is also MBR, thus why it worked.
A normal desktop session will also freeze on restart & shutdown, a forced power cycle is required.
An image of the working install can be successfully placed on other laptops, meaning I'm not dead in the water.
The first boot config session also froze when it should have rebooted, a forced power cycle was required.
The installer froze instead of rebooting, a forced power cycle was required.

Plus, I manually convert the disk to MBR, but I think this is not necessary.
This problem is 100% reproducible on all 7 of the Acer 5560's I've tried it on.
