2) Setup /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf like this:
Setup a couple of servers as your loadbalancer/proxy servers (for HA if you want it).
So your backend server is going to be serving up https.
x.x.x.a, x.x.x.b, x.x.x.c, x.x.x.d are the IP's of the load balanced servers.
If you went with the HA option make sure you set this option in /etc/sysctl.conf:
I terminate SSL at the load balancer and then serve unencrypted traffic from the backend.
This works for me, although my setup is slightly different.
These can safely be behind a firewall if you prefer.
If you want https you could install stud or similar in front of this (on the same server).
Just confirming, you don't want the SSL to terminate at the load balancer?
They don't really need to be super high end but reasonable.
3) Set the /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg with a config like this:
Some users may get broken connections when that happens, but a refresh should fix that.
If one of the haproxy servers goes down or the haproxy service is stopped, the other server will step in.
