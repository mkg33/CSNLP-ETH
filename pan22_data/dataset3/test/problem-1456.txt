Charge can seep away but magnetic spin is much more stable by comparison.
So clearly the technology isn't quite ready for prime time.
Every three months new, unexpected high-impact performance issues are being discovered.
Electrical storage media (these days) generally do not have as long a lifetime as their magnetic counterparts.
Given the physical characteristics of flash memory, are SSDs an appropriate long-term storage medium for backups, etc.?
The floating charges that are used to store the bits can degrade within a few years.
Sorry to be negative but I can't think of a worse use for SSDs myself - just on price/performance alone, forget their retention capabilities.
The more the flash memory has been used, the more likely this will happen.
Is their decay rate such that it is amenable to using them for rolling backups (thereby avoiding the wear issues)?
(The over-voltage used to erase the cells can be hard on the components.)
The technology is way too new to be used as a long-term storage medium of any kind.
If the data is valuable and needs to be saved, the solutions are:
