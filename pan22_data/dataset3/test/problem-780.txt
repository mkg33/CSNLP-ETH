This article comes close, but it uses paths Ubuntu 12.04 does not and extracts directly to the filesystem instead of a LVM logical volume.
I need to create a LXC container, on a LVM volume, under Ubuntu 12.04 from the OpenVZ precreated CentOS 6 template.
I have a lot of experience using OpenVZ, but I want to give LXC a try on a server where perfect isolation is not a concern.
Being so new to LXC, I'm sure I must be missing something.
I found it's very simple to create a container using the provided container templates, i.e., lxc-create -t ubuntu -n testvps -B lvm --vgname vps --fssize 20G --fstype ext4.
However, I have yet to find any substantial information that explains how to take a precreated OpenVZ template and use it as the base for a LXC container.
Any help pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.
I need to know where I should put the OpenVZ template tarball (or extract it) so the lxc-create -t` command can initialize from it.
The articles I've seen basically recommend OpenVZ templates as a good option for LXC containers.
The main reason for the switch is preferring Ubuntu Server LTS as the base OS, but the OpenVZ project currently only supports the RHEL kernel and the latest kernel patch is for 2.6.32.
