While P2V (Physical to Virtual) is usually straightforward, what you are planning to do is the reverse (V2P, Virtual to Physical), which is not.
In this case it means you will likely run into activation issues before or after the V2P process.
If you are using a Windows OEM license (if you are using a privately bought PC this is probably the case), you're not allowed to move this license to another machine (either virtual or physical).
There is a high probability the V2P process will not work as intended and will cause you to spend a lot of time troubleshooting.
If you run into issues, you would need to use a tool like Microsoft Sysprep on the VM to prepare the virtual machine before moving it to new/physical hardware.
This might work, but might not be straightforward.
Windows 10 is generally good at resolving these kinds of driver issues but it might not work in every case.
As the underlying hardware changes from generic "virtual" hardware to your specific physical hardware, there might be issues with basic drivers, disrupting the boot process or subsequent installation of drivers for your specific hardware.
It might cost you less time to just bite the bullet, backup or image your current Windows 7 installation, and perform a fresh and clean Windows 10 install on your (physical) PC.
