If you had to do it the hard way, you will get an outage of about the TTL period for new lookups until the NS records expire AND your parent updates their servers.
If you can, serve the data from the old and new hosting companies.
There is a domain in RU zone with NS records that lead to 1st hosting provider,
The domain is successfully delegated, but when i'm trying to reach URL, it leads to 1st hosting provider NS records.
Can't get an idea, why this strange situation caused to happen:
Point the NS records from your parent zone to your new ones (through your registrar interface probably.)
For future changes, I highly recommend doing NS record changes with these procedures:
Some, however, only publish once or twice a day, so it could vary widely.
I've managed to change this NS zone to another 2nd hosting provider.
"What time does it need to change NS records for domain globally ?"
You should keep the old site up for at least the TTL period of the longest TTL in your zone.
Without knowing your domain name, this is hard to answer.
What time does it need to change NS records for domain globally ?
org, net, and com happen fairly fast, as do info and several other TLDs.
This is mainly because the parent domain controls this, overall.
Both new and old should serve as close to the same data as you can, and the NS records should point ONLY to the new servers.
If you have both new+old running, you should get no outage.
It's all about the TTL set on that record, as others have said.
It's not a guarantee but is generally reliable in my experience.
If you cannot keep the DNS servers up on both locations it is harder and you will have an outage.
This ensures things won't break during the transition.
