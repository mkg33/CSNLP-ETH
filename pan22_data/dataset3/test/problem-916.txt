You will probably be represented with the DNS Root of your Registration or Provider.
Use NSLOOKUP to query check whether one or more DNS servers for your domain resolve wrong.
If the IP address tried to be contacted is correct everywhere, this can be ruled out.
It may just be a routing flap, where you home AS or destination AS is dropping routes.
I would suggest setting up a second service (monitis) to validate the results.
If you have a nested setup of DNS Servers you might also need to repeat the last step until you get to the autorative name server for your domain.
Apache is HTTP, not IP - basiaclly this is an error from the routing side, the request never reaches your server.
Once the requesting computer has the IP for the name, DNS is out of the question.
Set one of the nameservers you just received as server:
If it is DNS related most probably one of the Nameservers on the recursive way to your domain delivers wrong data.
Plus finding out which IP addresses are tried to be reached.
Use the settings querytype=NS to query only NS entries, norecurse to disable recursive querying (we will do this by hand later) and set the Nameserver to a.root-servers.net
If it is consistent AND CORRECT this is not a DNS issue at all.
It sounds like some issue with routing or with DNS.
Try mtr  and see where your packets cease to be routed correctly.
With the above method you should be able to iterate through the possible nameserver paths and check whether or not they are delivering correct data.
The fact that you aren't experiencing a 100% loss of resolution is a hint.
Unless some of their DNS responses are answered with the wrong IP... this is not a DNS related error message.
Maybe there is an issue at pingdom that makes them use the wrong IP sometimes.
You will receive a list of Nameservers responsible for the TLD of your domain
