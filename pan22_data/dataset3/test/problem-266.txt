3) Go to Disk Management and you should see the extra space as X amount of unallocated space.
These are just a few I could think of, there are a number of good articles on the internet describing a variety of techniques for freeing space, some safe, some likely to destroy your windows install if you get it wrong, so beware!
Go through the wizard to add the additional space to your system volume and you now have a larger one than you did before.
For Q1, you mean just the normal Windows Updates files that get installed through Automatic Updates?
The $NtUninstallKB folder in previous OS' doesn't exist in Windows 2008 so you can't just delete the uninstall files anymore.
I am not sure about freeing up space within the system volume by deleting "unnecessary" files and folders, but the good news is it is a VM, it is Win2008, and you can actually make the system disk bigger quite easily because of these 2 things.
I am running a Win2008 VM on a standalone ESXi 3.5 box.
You can free up that space by deleting the content INSIDE C:\windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
2) Reboot the VM (you may not actually have to do this step, but I did on mine - seemed too crazy to be able to resize the system volume without rebooting since it is Windows after all...)
Goes without saying that you could also do this to your Data disk as well.
Because this is a VM, all ESX does is make the vmdk file larger.
16 GB is pushing it for a system volume for Win2008 - a fresh install with updates has taken up 15 GB on my 2008 VM.
Even if this wasn't a VM you could still add another physical disk and extend onto that although you may be creating a less fault-tolerant configuration unless you are extending onto a RAID volume.
1) Edit the VM properties and change the hard disk size to something larger (I'd recommend at least 40 GB or more to ensure you don't have to do this again)
Files in C:\Windows\Installer are not related to patches or updates; they come with programs you install, and are needed for change/repair/uninstall oeprations (and sometimes for installing later updates to these programs, too).
4) Right click your system volume and select "Extend Volume...".
