I've tried setting up the new network exactly like so:
I'd hate to spring for a new modem or an Airport Extreme if it's not actually going to fix the problem.
Does this sound like a problem with the N600, the 2wire, the ISP, the network configuration?
Power cycling the N600 fixes everything... until the next failure a few hours later.
I've got a BellSouth FastAccess DSL subscription that has run on an ISP-provided 2wire HomePortal 1700HW combination modem/router for a few years now with no significant issues.
I recently acquired a brand new Western Digital My Net N600 router in order to boost range and provide access for network storage (the 2wire has no USB ports).
Caveat: Resetting the router fixes the issue for a few hours, so I won't be able to test the effects of anything that requires restarting it in real time.
I'm baffled at why one machine would be able to browse but not connect to the network, or why another would be able to load realtime webmail from one site only.

I'd love to hear some extremely basic step-by-step methods for getting a network like this established properly, in case I'm missing a simple step somewhere.

This has made it frustrating to test myself, but hopefully there will be some good ideas here that won't require it.
Here's documentation on the devices for reference:
But within 3-6 hours, the connection drops, with a variety of strange side effects:
Everything leads to the same result: a few hours of working network, followed by this mysterious semi-dropped connection.
