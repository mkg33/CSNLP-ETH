So if im logged into a linux-vserver and run the command top.
This will be for the "guest" or as you call it the "virtual server".
In my experience with Dreamhost VPS (which I believe to be running Linux-VServer) the top-level CPU usage is possibly from the host, as it appears to report numbers higher than the guest's usage, while the load average and CPU usage per process relates to the guest.
Is the fields 'load average' and cpu's for the virtual server or the host machine?
The top command in vserver will give you load average of the server not the virtual machine.
This is confusing and based on a experience from a single virtual machine, so take it with a grain of salt, but if it's right, you might consider this misreporting of CPU usage data in guests.

It really doesn't have much insight as to what the host is doing.
