timeFactor and vFactor are just arbitrary values, which happened to be 1 and 15 respectively.
I have an 'AI' bus in my game that needs to pull over occasionally at a bus stop.
The equation for the position x at time t, and for the velocity v are
Now impose that at v = 0 you want x = xs, and solve for a.
I don't want to simply use the distance between the bus stop and the bus because each time the bus pulls over, it could be traveling at a different speed.
where a is the acceleration, which is what we want to calculate.
The easiest way is to exert a constant force that will drive the bus to a parabolic (in time) curve ending exactly at the bus stop.
I ended up using a simple speed-distance-time calculation, and a velocity calculation.
In this way, you eliminate t and find the equation for x as function of v:
TL;DR: You have to exert the following force f on the bus:
Right now it uses the distance between the bus stop and the bus.
This may not work for most other people however as this was quite specific to my code.
It doesn't really work well though because if a bus is traveling faster, it will take a longer distance to stop and will likely go past the bus stop.
from which you get the force by multiplying with the mass m.
From the second equation, get t as a function of v, and plug into the first equation.
What I want to do is change the acceleration and brake force based on the stopping distance of the bus.
Let's say that at some point in time you have the current speed v0 of your bus, which is at some position x0, and it needs to stop at position xs (s stands for stop).
How do I calculate the stopping distance my bus will take to come to a complete stop?
