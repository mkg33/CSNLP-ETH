I had the same issue and as fortunate to receive some help to solve it.
There are many tools to make these links, but my favorite is Link Shell Extension.
I just started using Workstation 8, but it seems like the "sharing" part of it is kind of lacking in features.
See this link for details: http://communities.vmware.com/message/2015370#2015370
I hadn't tried this feature yet, so if VMware doesn't allow you to designate multiple locations, you could do some NTFS trickery like Mount Points, Junction Points, Symbolic Links, to make the program believe the data actually resides in that directory, but actually that directory is a pointer to the true location.
Works perfectly although if you need to "remove" the shared vm, do not use the wizard, just delete the link first.
I don't think you can actually do that, though I too really hope they added it.
I know this isnt really an answer, but just wanted to let you know that it doesn't seem (as of right now) that it can be done.
You can accomplish this by using a "symbolic link" using mlink under windows.
it works great, except the control over it is extremely lack-luster.
hiding vms from certain users, or only allowing the user who started the VM actually control the VM, other than admins... etc etc.)
So, what you probably could do is after VMware puts the Shared VMs in the Shared VM directory, you could move the VM back to it's dedicated drive and make a symbolic link at the location and name that VMware put the Shared VM, and have the symbolic link point to the dedicated drive folder.
Hopefully they release an update or something that will add some more functionality (like user control!
Of course you can change where that default location is where the shared VMs go to, but there are no settings to allow you to use different locations (sadly) as soon as you might move it, Workstations wont know where it is, and if you re-add it, it will just be a normal VM, share it again, and it goes right back to the same place.
