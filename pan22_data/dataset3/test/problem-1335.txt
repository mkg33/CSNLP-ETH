Learn one thing at a time and you'll probably have a much easier time of it.
Since you already know C++, now you just have to learn an API and theory.
Those are MUCH easier to learn if you don't have to deal with learning a new graphics library at the same time.
But it's probably not the fastest way to get there.
The main hurdle in learning 3D specifically is probably the math involved.
(And if you're an experienced programmer, learning the 2D stuff should really not take that long anyway.)
While 2D math is pretty easy to understand at a minimum level, 3D requires a more complex understanding.
It's also possible to learn C++ as your first programming language.
It is very easy to read, allows you to quickly implement a lot of common functions, and serves as a great base to learn more about DirectX and game programming.
There's also a ton of stuff like shaders that are definitely more relevant to 3D as opposed to 2D.
If you do plan on making a game though, I would take a quick 2D route just to get the feel for making a game from start to finish (and maybe get a working GUI system that you can port over!)
Going from "programming" to "game programming" requires learning a few things regardless of graphics: game loops, realtime input, and so on.
