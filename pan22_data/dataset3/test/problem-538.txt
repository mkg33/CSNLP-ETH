Second is when looking at AAA game development aimed towards the "core" market as the "real" industry, and everything else as peripheral.

an attempt to maintain your own value in relative terms not by increasing the value of your own efforts but by decreasing the (perceived) value of other people's efforts.
Some people, when presented with the phrase "game development", assume AAA games.
People defend the value of what they do (be it C++ game development) by trying to attach "not proper", "not real", "not valuable" to other things (be it flash game development) they feel is competing for attention, credebility and other kinds of rewards.
I would tend to say this is true to the extent that "scripting" and "programming" are two related but different skill sets, so it's important to make the distinction between them, even if we leave the snobbery out of it.
Personally, I think Flash is just as valid as anything else (heck, I've even seen some mighty impressive Game Maker games) so I wouldn't write off any game as "not proper" just because of its development platform.
If you are skilled and dedicated, it doesn't really matter what you use for developing your game, it is still proper game development.
Maybe elitism in rare cases actually is a matter of really trying to preserve some sort of valuable knowledge and competence, but from my anectdotal experience this is seldom the case.
I think this attitude is slowly changing, in particular with the massive success of some Facebook games (like it or hate it, FarmVille has more players than any console game out there) and the number of game industry veterans that are transitioning to that space, Flash is getting a lot of use by people who formerly only worked in C++.
Maybe even to the point of thinking console games.
Granted, there are very different skill sets and resources required to actually produce flash games vs. console games, but the fundamentals are the same.
I think you'll find two types of attitudes that would say Flash isn't "real" development.
(Just compare it with the discussions some IT professionals had in the beginning of the 1990ies when they were worried by the fact that web browsers allowed people without "proper" IT skills to efficiently access information on the internet)
a resistance against large scale systematical changes in whatever industry you are part of and 2.)
But I write this response so you can get a sense of where this attitude is coming from, so you can take those comments in context.
This is an old attitude that derides not only indie and small-scale development but also casual games, serious games, social media games, smartphone/mobile games, and so on as somehow being on the outside.
These kinds of discussions emerges in all kinds of areas and professions be it music, art, software development etc.
Elitism usually serves the purpose of protecting some person or group's interest at the expense of the larger community, as I see it.
Enough talent and hard work will even make developing a game based only on sticks and stones on a back yard to be proper game development.
And any other kinds of game making isn't worth studying or putting effort towards.
Maybe I'm a cynical and oversimplify things but I think this kind of elitism is 1.)
First is from hardcore (C++ or similar) programmers, saying that ActionScript is scripting rather than "real" programming, because it abstracts away so much and as a result has a bit less power, and lets you get away with understanding less about how to program properly.
