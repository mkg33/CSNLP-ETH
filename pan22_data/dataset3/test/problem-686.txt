Unless, of course, I stop playing sound, in which case it's fine.
Bus 3, device 4 is the mouse, device 5 are the headphones.
The sound works but the mouse pointer freezes after some time - sometimes almost immediately, sometimes after several seconds, but never very long.
I'm having a fairly frustrating problem with my Debian machine.
When the mouse freezes, there's no message added to dmesg output, so at this point I feel I'm out of good ideas.
I've tried disabling the autosuspend option of the usbcore module with no result.
Re-plugging the mouse makes it work again, and I've been trying to use the USB reset code from here, which also works - resetting /dev/bus/usb/003/004 brings the mouse back to life, until it freezes again in a few seconds.
There's also an integrated Intel sound card, output of arecord -l:
The problem is that the pointer of my USB mouse freezes shortly after I start playing sound through the headphones, which are also USB.
Life is great until I start playing sound through the headphones.
