I can run it manually and copy/paste will work just fine, but I have no idea why it won't start automatically.
Also verify that the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Wds\rdpwd contains the right entry for StartupPrograms.
I've done the usual of making sure the "Drives" checkbox is checked, but other than that I have no idea why it's mad.
It should contain "rdpclip", but you can also try the full path "C:\Windows\System32\rdpclip.exe".
Verify that rdpclip.exe is in its right place : C:\Windows\System32\rdpclip.exe.
When I'm using remote desktop to connect to my PC from my laptop(both running Windows 7 ultimate), RDPClip.exe never gets started.
The last-ditch solution, used when no better one is found, is to use a .bat file that contains:
On the remote desktop client click the options button and go to local resources and make sure that the clipboard option is checked before initiating the connection.
Even if you're using the latest version, re-installing the RDP client and rebooting might help.
Some people even added this script as a startup item, and report that this solved the problem (after reboot).
Ensure that you're using the latest Remote Desktop Connection 7.0 client update.
