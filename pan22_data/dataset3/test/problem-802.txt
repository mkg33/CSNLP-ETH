If you download the Sysinternals Suite from Microsoft and extract it to somewhere, start the tool TCPCon.exe (or TCPMon) This will ist all the services and processes including PID and tons of other information.
It was in Administrative Tools > Services > World Wide Web Publishing Service.
This will give snapshot of all the HTTP listeners.
I knew that was a possible suspect, but had a hard time finding it.
I had the same issue, and found my Windows 10 System was running IIS Web Server.
From what we learned, this service uses TCP port 80 by default, and our IT service didn't change the default configuration.
Find the "Registered URL" containing the port number you are looking for and the PID of the controlling process will be a few lines above it, like my own rogue process here;
If the service is not self-explanatory, upload it to virustotal.com
This can lead to weird behaviors though, so I'm not fully sure this is the best way to get the information.
We had to manually stop every services on our computer, until we found the service which actually used port 80.
