I am not downplaying the need for technical expertise in the least, as it is still very important.
Please edit your post and add the specific technologies that you would require an applicant to be proficient with as well as what skills and certifications, length of experience, etc that you would prefer for a candidate.
Unless there is a lot of politics involved in this job.
It is much harder to find someone who is a good manager and leader than it is to find someone who is good at tech.
And now I am working there 20-40% as an external guy.
One of the first decisions this guy made was to hire someone [in this case me] with a lot of technical skills.
And one of the main objectives is to teach the current system administrators.)
So you are looking for someone willing to learn, but already in the possession of reasonable social skills and always striving to improve stuff.
In this case I would recommend you to look more for a manager-type person and try to get the technical knowledge from an external guy.
even outside of IT, as having the ability to work in different careers shows an aptitude for transitional skills (sometimes referred to as soft skills) that have more bearing on management and leadership than whether the person knows the code d'jour.
Having a more generalized background shows that the person can pick up new concepts quickly, and will not only be able to learn your current environment, but will also be able to quickly adapt to changes in the future.
A manager should not necessary lead people, but make sure that there are no obstacles for the people who are experts in their field to do their job.
I mean, we learn how to calculate subnets and write in C++ in a short time, but it takes a lifetime to develop good people skills.
The team is too small to have a full time manager.
Just when you are getting good at the game you're playing (coding, sys admin, help desk), someone comes around the corner and changes the rules on you.
Problem finding good managers is because most managers regard their job as more important than it actually is.
Yes that could mean that you hire someone not having a background in management, but I would say that this is actually an advantage.
I understand that may be hard to qualify but most people are going to have a hard time interpreting what "qualified person" is for your organization.
As someone else already wrote, I would recommend you to search more for a Lead System Administrator than for a manager.
Or do you want someone to teach the former Geek Squaders how to be SAs?
This coupled with the fact that you already state it is "highly selective" means it is probably not worth anyone's time to respond to your post without more concrete information up front.
However, there are so many ways of doing things, that if you get someone who doesn't have the exact technical fit, but is an able learner with great communication, leadership, and management skills, you will be much happier than finding that person who has all the tech skills, but poor soft skills.
Problem with that is that those people usually set up their own business because they are sick of the incompetence they see around them.
You need to find a manager that is aware of this situation, knows how to play the game to do the right thing.
You may also want to look for someone who can nudge the team out of whatever internal social/cultural rut the group is in.
I would look for someone with a broad background, maybe (especially?)
Their Lead System Administrator quitted and the management wanted to have someone with more project management skills as the new head of IT.
Unfortunately most corporate settings are almost branded into classic management style and due to the specialized nature, the problem with classic management shows itself the most in the IT section.
