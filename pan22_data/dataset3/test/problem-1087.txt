It's possible  to remove limitation on concurrent connections by Terminal Services (RDP) by patching termserv.dll by using tool like Universal Terminal Server Patch.
Yes, the Windows Terminal Services server package.
Then in that session run a virtual machine which is left running in the background and can be connected to as a separate ip address.

BO2K with the BoPeep plugin can do this, plus, it's free!
