i found that when i switch form a windows base application installed by wine to any other application it performs poor so i thinks it might be due to lack or not proper functioning of memory cleaning in Ubuntu
You can get the secure the package with "sudo aptitude install secure-delete" and try the
"Secure memory wiper; used to wipe traces of data from your computer's memory (RAM)" command.
Is there any mean or software by which i could clear my memory after i quit a widows application in Linux
I just saw your comments - 2GB of RAM is on the low end these days, both for image processing and for an IDE such as NetBeans.
If this doesn't work you can free the swap space by doing:
Using an I/O monitor or watching the disk LED for activity may also provide useful hints.
You do not need to clear the memory or anything else on Linux after an application terminates - I suspect it's the same on Windows but I wouldn't really know.
You are bound to experience extensive memory swapping which will slow down things noticeably, especially when you switch from one application to another.
Since you do not provide any useful information in your question, such as the amount of physical memory on your system or how you came up with the idea that the memory needs to be "cleaned", I can only take a few of shots in the dark:
Look for processes that use too much CPU time or too much memory.
In any case you should monitor your system with a CPU and memory usage monitor before coming up with any conclusion regarding the cause of a slow down - htop is a quite useful tool for this.
