and saving it with the name and extension GoToDir.command.
I tried creating a text file containing the following shell script:
There is an app, "Go2Shell" that puts an icon in a finder window.
What I need is an icon on my desktop that I can double-click, and launch terminal, but already cd'd to  specific directory.
This usually save me an extra double-click in the Finder or an extra "cd" in Terminal.
Clearly, this .command is run as a one-off program that terminates, and that's it.
If there is nothing selected in the window (or if the selection is a file, not a folder), Terminal will open the folder/directory of the Window itself.
However, when I double-click on the file, Terminal launches with this contents on the console:
The feature that I like about this one compared to others I tried (don't know about Go2Shell, also recommended here), is that if the selection in the front Finder window is a folder itself, Terminal will "cd" into THAT folder.
I know how to configure Terminal.app to automatically cd to a specific directory on launch; I would like a quick way to launch into one of many directories (to work on one of several git repositories without having to navigate up and down the file system).
Click the icon and it opens a Unix terminal for the directory that the finder window is displaying.
