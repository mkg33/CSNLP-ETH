After several attempts to do this ourselves, we realized that hiring a 3rd party to do this for us proved to be way more cost effective.
Is there any site/services which allow "searching" through the registered lists of domain names (right now for .com only) and shows me what have been registered already.
I need to "search" for domain names that might be infringing on my companies' trademarks.
I doubt they'd help you even if you paid them loads of money
So you'd have to go to all the ones you cared about like the .com provider(verisign) .net(verisign again) and get access to their list of domains from the main databases(which must be huge and spread across multiple servers I imagine) and do a massive text based search.
so if your trademark is HAPPYFUNDAYOMG then searching for that wont show mispellings like HAPYFUNDAYOMG.
I'm not looking for a service which takes keywords and suggests new names for me.
Considering those guys index a good chunk of the web you can, using your name as a keyword in the search would give you potential possibilities.
Our company recently went on a hunt for infringing or cybersquatting domains for our brand.
2) That search is going to be awhile and only grab certain aspects.
A company that we've had great success with is CitizenHawk:
This sounds like the sort of service MarkMonitor is offering.
If you're serious about hunting down these cybersquatters, I suggest enlisting their help.
They've been able to recover over 300+ infringing domains.
It was a shock to see how many people cybersquatted misspelled versions of our domains.
