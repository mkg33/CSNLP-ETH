Well, sometimes you can get this setup working, but it ends up with your voice and all other sound echoing back either in your headset (if you send things to your speakers you'll likely get a feedback loop).
When I was recording podcasts, I ended up adding a second cheaper sound card dedicated to Skype and used the primary for music and recording.
If you wear headphones, then you can use your iPhone to play the music, which will be picked up by the microphone as is your voice (and you'll be able to hear the music as well, unless you're wearing some really soundproof headphones).
Ok, here's the unpractical, extremely convoluted and unflexible solution that I found that works in my case.
Thus, the others can hear both your voice and the music, but due to your headphones, they won't be able to hear themselves.
It is what we do here, when we need to play important messages to our phone clients, and also leave them messages, while still being able to talk live to them :)
The Virtual Audio Cable (VAC) is only part of the solution.
You already saw that by setting skype to use Stereo Mix, you can have your skype contacts listen to music on the call.
For example, you can send your microphone to just a virtual audio device that is being used by Skype and/or other programs for recording and broadcasting/streaming, so it doesn't echo back your voice in your headset.
So, open your Recording Devices, double click on the microphone (right click -> properties, same thing), click 'Listen On' and choose the proper device (usually the default speakers).
The rest of the answer is to use another app from VB-Audio (the developer of VAC), which is the VoiceMeeter donateware app.
Then in my other Skype account set the microphone to Line 1 and press play in VLC.
Set VLC to output to DirectX and Line 1 audio device.
Play Youtube videos or any music through the VLC media player.
Then get the Virtual Audio Cables program and have it create one more audio device for you.
Definitely a more complicated setup and not very cheap, but it's a solid setup.
More information on these programs, where to get them, etc., is in my answer to another question here.
You can then take up to 2 other inputs, one is the VoiceMeeter virtual input, which you normally setup as the system default device so all apps will use it.
But, if you are using Windows Vista or Windows 7, you can go ahead and set your Microphone settings to Listen on the Speakers for your system.
This way all apps on your PC will use the virtual VoiceMeeter input by default for their output, and you can have Skype go to the VAC device - this let's you route the Skype output only to your local devices, so you aren't feeding it back incoming sounds from other participants right back to them.
This app can pipe up to 3 inputs to up to 2 groups of outputs selectively.
The other will normally be setup as an extra virtual audio device from the VAC device you mentioned.
When you do that, you will be able to hear yourself on the speakers, which is true, but they will be able to hear you as well.
Meanwhile, all other apps on your PC will be setup to broadcast both locally and to your recording/streaming apps.
