The Want: opening a program at boot in a Weston compositor
What I've tried: creating a SysV init script with a low priority
Investigating the .service file that systemd autogenerates (also shown below) the program wants to run before the multi-user.target runlevel has been reached.
What Works: Weston launches, but my program does not
This device uses a Debian-like distro, with the exception that when it boots, it boots straight to a Weston compositor, rather than a login/desktop.
If I try manually launching the service(systemctl start appService), I receive an XDG_RUNTIME_DIR error.
I want to have it launch after the Weston compositor launches
If I try manually launching the service automatically generates (systemctl start appService), I receive an XDG_RUNTIME_DIR error.
What I've done so far is created a standard /etc/init.d script (shown below) that launches my program using start-stop-daemon and has a simple start-stop toggle.
Hello, I'm working on a program in an embedded environment.
The program is Qt based, and I'd like it to run when the device boots up.
This works if called manually, however, using update-rc.d appService defaults results in the program not starting at boot.
