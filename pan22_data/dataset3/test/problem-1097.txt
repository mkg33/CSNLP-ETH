On "Local Area Connection Status", click Properties.
I use one of those dns services that let you bypass region restrictions on Netflix and similar sites.
Manually specify the addresses of the DNS servers you wish to use.
I have no way of connecting to the router, as it came from my ISP and is completely locked down.
(Below instructions are for Win7 which should be very similar, if not identical)
If you arent using IPv6 at all you may want to uncheck that on the Properties window.
Is there a way to set up my system so that the DHCP's DNS servers will be ignored?
The addresses you're talking about are IPv6 addresses, so you'll need to need to configure your IPv6 settings.
The first two addresses are of the type IPv6 and not IPv4 that the last two ones are.
However I noticed that recently it stopped working, even though I set up the service's dns addresses manually in the connection's settings.
To manually specify IPv4 dns servers while using DHCP:
Click "Local Area Connection" for the network card.
...I see that the first two DNS addresses are unknown to me and not set up anywhere on my local machine - they must be coming from DHCP.
You can do that the same way you would IPv4, except instead of selecting "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" from the network adapater properties window, you need to select the "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)."
