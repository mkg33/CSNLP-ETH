/etc/apache2/suexec/www-data (unchanged, since I don't use www-data)
But then the users websites do not work, since they are located at /home .
If I change suexec/www-data.conf to /data , then the main homepage works.
Thus, if apache2 runs under www-data only the file /etc/apache2/suexec/www-data is being considered.
I am setting up a suexec environment with Apache2 and PHP 7.0 with FastCGI.
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=785740:
If I change www-data to /home , then my main homepage does not work, since it has its docroot at /data ...  How can I avoid that suEXEC queries the www-data config, and instead query the correct user config?
SuEXEC works so far, but there is a major problem: for some reason, suEXEC queries /etc/apache2/suexec/www-data instead of /etc/apache2/suexec/username , therefore I can only have my website at /data working, or the websites at /home working, but not both.
I do not understand that, since no script on my server is owned by www-data.
So, when I access my main home (/data/www), it does not work since suexec/www-data.conf has its docroot at /var/www .
