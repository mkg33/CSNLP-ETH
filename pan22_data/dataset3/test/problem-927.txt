I use a lot of AMD mainboards, and those that have this bios option will default to 64.
Is the information about the array written to the drives?
I've had problems where the BIOS settings would get scrambled and cause the card to not show up at all.
I decided to screw around with the card and success!
If the firmware versions are different, the disks won't import to the controller.
Is that how a different controller can import the array?
Although, I have found a bios setting that causes them to crash.
This is Dan who posted previously, this time I've created an account :)
I usually plug them into the PCI-e slot that is used for a video card, and they just work.
I have owned several of them: a few 2 port cards, a pair of 4 port cards, and one 12 port that I got used for a great price.
Just make sure it's the same or newer model and that the firmware versions are the same.
The only thing i would suggest you do is to toss the card in another machine, make sure it works, and is at the same BIOS level as your old card - downgrade if you have to.
Do ensure the firmware is no older then the old card (as far as you can determine), and you probably want to try and keep within the same series if possible.
You should be good, i haven't done it with that particular card, but with many other Hardware raid cards.
I had to reenable the PCI slot and also enable MSI for the 3Ware cards to appear again.
Anyway, I'm about to upgrade one array to 5 x 2TB drives and I'll have to swap controllers, so your answers have given me hope.
