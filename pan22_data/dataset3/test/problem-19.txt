My knowledge of genetics is a bit rusty, but I would reckon that your problems arise from disk bandwidth rather than disk latency (these are different problems with different solutions).
Storage volume is less of an issue these days, even with more complex indexing structures.
Starting from scratch, the most cost effective way to achieve what you need would probably be a system with lots of mid-range SATA disks (probably as RAID5) its hard to find cases/PSUs which will accomodate this easily.
By the time you went out and bought a SCSI enclosure, power supply, adapter and cables you're going to have nothing left to buy disks with!
But I would expect that if you did find that CPU was an issue then you'd get a lot more performance about running the comparison on a DSP/GPU.
Certainly I'd recommend upgrading your case/PSU rather than using a seperate enclosure connected via SCSI or network.
Agree with ConcernedOfTunbridgeWellsW - direct attached storage is the way to go.
OTOH, the fact you are looking for a storage system implies that you've already got CPU and memory.
