You always use a straight connection (cable and infrastructure) unless you are connecting two end user devices (MDI to MDI) or two network devices (MDI-X to MDI-X).
No one needs to remember which side of the infrastructure cabling needs to use which pattern.
In the first case, this works fine if the two devices are directly connected.
If the L2 network device always provided a crossed connection (MDI-X), and the end user device is always straight through (MDI), then it makes the "rules" very simple.
The ability to configure the logic into a device to sense whether a pair is being used for RX or TX in networking is relatively recent and until included (as an option) in Gig Ethernet, was relatively expensive.
But if infrastructure cable were used, then you would need a crossed cable on one side and a straight cable on the other.
In the second case, this can have several problems, but most can be avoided by combining with the first case and use crosses with both cable and infrastructure.
However the problem comes in when you go to manage the cable infrastructure itself.
It is much simpler to manage and less prone to human error if you were to use straight cables on each side.
Since this will cover the majority of connections/situations, this makes it less prone to error and allows an entity to maintain most of their inventory as straight cables with no or few crossed cables (as they can typically be ordered at the time of need - with the network equipment).
For proper communications, a "cross" was required at some point in the connection to make this work.
What if this were mixed over time (maybe by different staff with different personal "standards")?
The third case actually provides the simplest and most easily standardized way to introduce a cross.
So before this time, a pair was designated at TX on one side and RX on the other.
While considering this, one needs to keep in mind two "crosses" will negate each other (or that you need to maintain an "odd number of crosses").
Or, while less than ideal itslef, one runs into situations where two cables are "coupled" together and this would require a straing/crossed combo to work.
Namely, both sides (near and far) will use different patterns.
Again, this can be more complex to manage/troubleshoot as well as prone to human error.
What about the case where you have three (or more) rooms all interconnected by infrastructure cabling?
