Your hand never leaves the keyboard, and the visual cues involved in the process keep a more static background that is friendly on remote access systems like VNC.
This is very annoying and is the only thing like this.
The VNC server is integrated into VMWare so that even if I lose network connection on Windows 8, I can still access it.
(ie, scrolling in firefox doesn't have this kind of behavior)
Instead of opening the start menu and scrolling to find your program, they want you to hit the Windows key and immediately start typing the name of what you are looking for.
Bringing up just the start menu doesn't induce any amount of lag, but when I have to scroll it literally takes 5 to 10 seconds for the screen to draw for the 2 or 3 frames of scrolling.
I use Windows 8 on a virtual machine through a VNC connection.
So, in summary, to make the start menu work better with VNC:
Honestly, I don't really understand why it happens here either as it looks like something perfect for copy-rect to make fast.
They seem to be pushing a whole different workflow for finding programs.
Anyway, has anyone else had this problem and know of anything to try to make it better?
Overall, my experience with it is pretty tolerable, except for when I go to the start menu.
I don't think Microsoft really intended for anyone using a traditional PC to ever scroll the start menu.
