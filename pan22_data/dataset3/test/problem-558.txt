Is there any chance that I may use both ports at the same time, or do I have to buy a new laptop for that?
There is no way that we can tell you for certain WHY the laptop is built this way, nor is there any way we can advise you to adjust the geometry of the outputs to fit additional connectors.
I have to use a small kitchen knife to strip away the excess material on my headphones every time I buy new ones.
The right and left sides of VGA cables are so wide because they're designed with screws to more securely attach to monitors, but if you plan on just using this VGA cable for your laptop cutting away the excess plastic could work.
Or it could be sloppy engineering where they simple did a "good enough" job.
This would give you a clue as to which of the above reasons is the real one.
There are VGA cables with standoff screw connectors you can remove, so that you could barely fit the HDMI cable in there.
If I plugin a VGA cable there is no space for a HDMI cable anymore:
This may be engineered this way on purpose as the laptop may not be capable of driving three total screens with its GPU.
The maximum pixels that can be pushed is typically a published specification for any given GPU, and should be found on the support site for that GPU.
When the maker was designing / testing the laptop, they would not go to any lengths to test / make it work for a physically impossible port configuration.
You could always try using a dremel or another tool to cut away some of the right side of your VGA connector.
I suspect that the laptop might not even be able to handle that many video connections at once anyway.
Unless you can find cables that fit together, then no, there's no way.
There are small connector HDMI cables, but not slim enough for when the VGA plug is that much in the way.
I have a VGA and a HDMI port on my laptop like that:
I did not find slim versions of VGA or HDMI cable.
Like the above answer said, however, make sure this is just an instance of "sloppy engineering" and not an intentional feature because of your laptop's GPU limitations.
The male headphone jack doesn't fit with my phone's case unless I cut away some of the plastic.
You might even be able to do a physical hack and remove one of the VGA cable's sides, but I don't suggest it.
