I'm sure there are any number of utilities to assist with this in Linux, and it is largely a matter of personal preference.
If you are working in a minimal desktop that doesn't have a good file manager rox-filer is decent and usually an apt-get away.
However, keep in mind that the navigation is almost identical from the Windows command line as it is in linux.
The other is -sum to sum up the disk usage of all subdirectories one level down.
If I have an SSH login to a Linux system on a Windows and really need to do some hardcore exploring or drag-drop file managing, I'll login via WinSCP and use that as a file manager.
There are many references such as http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/where-is-color-of-ls-command-defined.html  or
There are two options I use a lot--one is the -r option to recursively list all files in a directory tree (by default it sorts by date).
I usually have WinSCP on any system I have PuTTY on.
It may not be quite what you want, but I've found it very effective for finding files quickly and also for quickly determining folders which are taking up a lot of space or have a lot of files.
I've been using unix and the command line for some time already, but my main method for navigating through files and directories is still cd path; ls; cd path; ls....
No images, no colors to differentiate files and folders.
Note that you have to double-quote wildcards for it, e.g.
Output is colored by type but not presently configurable like ls --color.
Hard links can only be created for actual data, i.e.
You can also define a shell variable "COLORS" then use that file (use echo $COLORS to check).
If you prefer working with terminals or don't have access to a GUI you may want to try ranger, which displays your files in a tree-structure right in the terminal.
Working natively on a Linux system (not SSH'd via Windows) I'm not ashamed to use nautilus when needed.
2) I believe that 'ls' is by default color-enabled, but if yours isn't, you can easily configure the color options to differentiate files, folders, etc.
The configuration file for the ls color command is /etc/DIR_COLORS for Linux.
So if you use a GUI in Windows, why not in Linux too, one of the bazillion-or-so file explorer programs?
Yes, navigating with only the terminal commands can be a pain at times.
Visually it is very difficult to get an overview of a directory.
1) If you want to get to certain directories quickly, create links to them.
I think most people use GUI file managers for most practical uses.
My personal favorite is (naturally) one that I wrote for myself:  wdir (http://willus.com/archive/#cmdline).
- hard links : Refer to the specific location of physical data.
The command line is versatile but there are instances where it's use is not indicated or warranted.
I can't comprehend how so many people live without a graphical file browser at all.
Some of the more popular ones are Nautilus, Dolphin, and Thunar.
This is my favorite way of browsing files since it has vi-like key bindings, color support, tabs, and file previewing and opening.
These two combined should keep you from using a lot of "cd" commands and explicit file paths to things you use often.

I still am much more productive using a file browser, when I want to explore.
I like this much better than ls -lR because each file is listed with its complete subpath.
- symbolic links: Refer to a symbolic path indicating the abstract location of another file
