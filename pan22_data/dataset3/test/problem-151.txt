When you begin with a - it means DO NOT allow them to login.
Try switching that to a + meaning DO allow the users in this netgroup to login.
I want to be able to authenticate users (via ssh) to specific groups of hosts based on the users' LDAP netgroup membership.
if you are using SSSD as claimed above, then the nsswitch.conf entries should be as follows for netrgoups "compat glibc mode" to work
Remember getent also looks at your local files (as defined in nsswitch.conf) for this information so be sure the information is only available via LDAP.
The distro is OEL 6.5 with openldap as the client.
Also use the getent command to check to see if you can see your users and netgroup proprely.
What I can tell you from my AD authentication is taht your netgroup statement is the opposite of what you want.
I am trying to get it authenticating against an old Sun LDAP server and am not having luck.
I can see the netgroups, I can see the user with "getent netgroup {name of netgroup} and I can su to the user.
My user belongs to the netgroup eeederp and is still able to get in using his LDAP password.
I have Red Hat 6 authenticating against AD using Netgroups successfully.
So I tried adding a netgroup to /etc/security/access.conf like so:
to disable any user in that netgroup @eeederp to access the server.
The only account we don't want to authenticate using LDAP is root.
