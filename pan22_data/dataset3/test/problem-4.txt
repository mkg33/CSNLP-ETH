Simple Backup Suite has a nice gui, does incremental backups, and can run on a schedule.
So, maybe you should use backup just for your data and try to be careful when upgrading the system.
It's 100% command line based so you can put it in a cronjob.
I am running on ubuntu 10.04 and I have and external harddrive over the network.
Anyway this way you always have at least a full backup, and then smaller sized deltas so the backup data size is kept smaller.
Reinstalling all the applications took some time, but restoring from backup ALL the system would have been time consuming also.
It would be good to write an ISO over the network to my External hardrive every other day or so.
Please consider that it is for private use so please do not suggest costly solutions.
I mean, if the upgrade failed, what would backup have helped ?
Still, given your scenario, I don't think backup is the solution.
By default it starts with a full backup and then go with different levels of differential backups.
Hello After my upgrade from Linux 9.10 to 10.04 failed and took me a long time to recover all the installed software, i decided to take some time to look at a proper backup procedure.
You would have had the old system again, and you would need to upgrade again.
The package in Ubuntu 10.4 comes with a good default configuration so it's easy to set it up and make it work.
One advantage of this is that it keeps also old revisions, so if you want let's say the status of one week before you can get it.
These are all configurable and automatically maintained.
If it goes bad, you can always reinstall, it is not that time consuming and you don't do it each month.
Uhm... it's easier to just use it and see what it does.
