Below is a table of specular reflectange of various metals & dielectrics at normal incidence for reference:
no roughness) but that they are all considered to be perfect reflections from an optical flat surface.
So, you could say such a mirror would be white, rather than having no color.
Schlick's approximation) but the surface reflectance is simply multiplied with constant term which is wrong.
However, in smallPt there's no Fresnel approximation (e.g.
Also 0.999 specular albedo is very high for any real material.
What "ideal" means in this context is that there is no divergence in the direction of light reflection vectors (i.e.
where f is the object colour of Vec(.999,.999,.999).
A more realistic mirror would use something like silver for coating, with an albedo of (0.972, 0.960, 0.915).
I'm looking at the code to SmallPt and see that one of the spheres has an ideal specular material:
A perfect mirror would therefore be a perfectly smooth metallic surface with an albedo of 1.
However, even for optical flat surfaces Fresnel equation is still applied in BRDF evaluation that changes specular reflection and is potentially wavelength dependent, which is a common characteristic with metals.
Only for non-metals is the color of the specular independent of the albedo, but it's also rather dim.
I guess as f is Vec(.999,.999,.999), effectively it's passing through the colour almost unchanged?
This color represents the percentage of the light of each frequency that is reflected by silver, so it needs to be multiplied with the color of the reflected light.
The specular of metals is a product of the light color and the albedo of the material.
I was surprised to see colour multiplication here.
I'm guessing this is something to do modelling a miniscule energy loss?
Ideal specular reflection is like a perfect mirror.
