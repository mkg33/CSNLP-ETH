I don't think that you can have two versions of nvidia drivers installed at the same time.
I have tested this configuration numerous times, and assuming they're roughly the same age (and not horrible old) you should have no problems getting them to run under Windows 7, simply install the GeForce and Quadro drivers seperately, it's smart enough to figure it out.
You might be able to test out how a Quadro would behave when playing games this way.
It can force your GeForce card to be detected as equivalent Quadro.
If you have a GeForce card available, get Riva Tuner.
I have a machine kicking around the office here with a Quadro FX380 and a GeForce 7600GS working fine like this.
The only problem, is that the Quadro series doesn't support SLI.
Guessing here, but from what I've seen it mainly depends on nvidia drivers.
Some of the fancier features might act strangely, though.
You have to get 2 graphic cards which certified for SLI/Crossfire.
But I can guarantee the cards will at least coexist peacefully.
Basically Quadro cards should be used with drivers certified for the particular program you're using.
You'll have to decide what you want - more game-play power (SLI), or more power for professional applications (Quadro)
EDIT: I don't know that you'll get the kind of performance that you're looking for, though.
If you want to work with dual graphic cards (ATI - "Crossfire"  /  NVIDIA - "SLI")
