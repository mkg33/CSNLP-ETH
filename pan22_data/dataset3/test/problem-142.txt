Now, I've tried using the new clipboard API in html 5.
THEN copy it (or drag/drop) from word and paste it to the other target program.
I dissected the PNG files that are generated by this process.
Try this: copy the transparent image, paste into MS Word.
The AutoHotKey script checks if Photoshop is currently active, and if so it intercepts the Ctrl+V key combination, and then it runs the utility.
I've used Photoshop to copy semi-transparent textures for some time while prototyping (with the destination of Axure RP).
The source code for the AHK script is provided below - if you haven't used AutoHotKey before, install it, then save the code to a filename.ahk file to the same directory as the ClipboardToPNG.exe utility, and then just run it.
If the utility did not save the image, the standard Ctrl+V key combo is sent to Photoshop and a standard paste is performed.
If I use the drag and drop API to copy a "Save as Web" PNG 24 file to the browser, it works as expected and transparent pixels work (and the alpha byte is not forced to FF).
Seems like depending on which software was used to make the PNG, the transparency is sometimes kept as it inside the layers, but some other time, it's kept in an alpha channel.
So I got fed up with this annoyance and made a workaround.
To create the Photoshop Action, just make a new action with the key combination mapped to Shift+Ctrl+F12 (or change the combination in the script file), and then while recording, go to File > Place Embedded..., and paste %TEMP%\clip.png in the file name field.
If the utility saved an image to %TEMP%\clip.png, the Shift+Ctrl+F12 key combination is sent to Photoshop, which I have mapped to a Photoshop Action to place the clip.png file into the currently open document.
Try saving file and then use Open File in Photoshop.
AFAIK, Paint doesn't have the ability to save transparency enabled png files.
Note: Even thought Photoshop says it's 24 bit, it actually exports it as 8 bit still (confirmed).
I found a paste into Visio from Chrome turns black, but works properly in Word, and then copied from Word it pastes properly and transparently into Visio.
If I use the clipboard (with a rectangular marquee) to copy a semi-transparent texture to the browser with the clipboard API, it sets the alpha byte to FF (completely opaque).
All the source code is available here: https://github.com/SilverEzhik/ClipboardToPNG, and the utility can be downloaded here: https://github.com/SilverEzhik/ClipboardToPNG/releases
For anyone wondering, if you get a black background color on a copied PNG file even when opening it manually, try checking if there isn't an alpha channel.
A trick when it's in the alpha channel is simply to CTRL+Click on the alpha channel's small preview to select it and then create a mask on the layer with the black background from the selection.
