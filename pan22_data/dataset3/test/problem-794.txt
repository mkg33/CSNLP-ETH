It make sense when all the clock goes back the ip lease becomes invalid, your ISP suddenly disown you and internet disconnects.
If you check the log the message there is a chance of seeing the message
So far I could  not find any documentation related to this issue.
Another confusing part here is even though my country do not use DST.
Today what I've found is the issue is related to the "time resetting" or time going backwards.
There is Automatic time configuration under Tools --> Time which will allow to set and synchronize.
After that there is something called WISH on your device.
i've  DIR-636L and go through this exact problem everyday.
but what is not making sense is why is it happening every day.
As a Fix: Try setting this clock automatic time configuration with a ntp server  with DST checked.
WISH is short for Wireless Intelligent Stream Handling, a technology developed to enhance your experience, when using a wireless network, by prioritizing the traffic of different applications.
Find and configure it with using this link: How do I configure WISH on my DIR Series router to enhance my wireless network?
(I've just made these changes hope this eternal issue gets resolved by this)
Check your DIR-636L firmware from the link and update to latest.
daemon.err: mDNSResponder: mDNSPlatformRawTime went backwards by 1253278268 ticks; setting correction factor to -921020662
NTP servers look for dst setting and gives the time accordingly.
