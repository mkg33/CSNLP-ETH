This tool verified my computer drivers and guided me to download the right one.
I had a very similar issue, where I had my laptop connected to just one external monitor, making it 2 monitors in total.
At a certain time, the external display was mirrored instead of extended, like it always was and in the display settings there were in total 6 displays showing.
I had the exact same problem on Windows 10 Pro and solved it by installing the IntelÂ® Driver & Support Assistant tool.
This is bug in the drivers from intel, they have a long discussion about this at https://communities.intel.com/thread/110642?start=60&tstart=0
If it says Duplicate these displays, change it to Extend these displays.
If you have two monitors and it's showing 1|2 instead of extending displays:
Scroll down to Multiple Displays section and drop down the box.
I think I have solved it by removing Hyper-V (came default with Win10 Pro).
After checking, I realised that there was a Intel Display driver update on the windows update history, around the same time.
After installation, I've rebooted my PC and the display issue has been fixed.
An update pushed to my Win 10 pc and reverted this setting.
After this I could both open Intel HD Graphics Control Panel, and install updated drivers.
Right click on one of them and go to Display settings
I ended up removing Hyper-V due to something else (Xamarin development), and noticed my screen blinking once.
I'm running windows 10 on a Lenovo T540p laptop and had as many as 7 displays showing up at one time.
