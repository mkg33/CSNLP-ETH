When a Linux device boots, it comes up to whatever the configured (or default) runlevel is, generally specified in the file /etc/inittab.
Yes, this not only possible, but is the default behavior in most cases.
I have a headless server running Ubuntu, and hardly ever log on to it (when I do, this normally happens via ssh since there's no keyboard/monitor).
As ErikA states, most services will have an init script that takes care of that.
The thing you want to research are called "Runlevels".
I am planning to set up a Linux server (lightweight basic web, PIM server) "appliance", i.e.
On your system, there will be a set of scripts in /etc/init.d/ and /etc/rcX.d that control the automatic startup of services.
For servers, that's commonly runlevel 3;  for workstations, runlevel 5.
What gets started and stopped are defined by the files in /etc/rcX.d, as ErikA explained.
For purposes of comparison, Windows basically has one runlevel, which corresponds to runlevel 5 in the Linux world.
I would like it to start whenever I plug it in and switch on the power button, without having to do anything else or user interaction (hence "appliance").
Or would the server start running when the system loads, and no need for a specific user to login?
Because of that, I am wondering if I need to login for the server services to start?
Have a look at the tool "chkconfig" as an easy way to manipulate the settings for a given runlevel.
The Init process handles the starting and stopping of services; no user login required.
I've used many distros over the years, and I think you're making the right choice going with Ubuntu.
Services will start irrespective of (and before any) user logins.
As a quick work-around, you can use cron with an entry like @reboot /path/to/something/to/run/when/server/starts  But that way it will start without any extra interaction from you.
If your application doesn't have an init script, the best solution would be to write one for it.
I might be installing an Ubuntu server, but the answer does not have to be Ubuntu-specific.
