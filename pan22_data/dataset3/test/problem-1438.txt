I read somewhere that the problem is gonna be fixed with Inkscape 0.48.3.
Note that I also have python and associated packages installed via homebrew/pip which may have helped.

Make sure you are using the system version of python, check by running
You can then either load Inkscape via the command line or make a link to your applications folder.
But I presume in a recent update of OSX they have removed the libxml library from the system build.
Basically the problem is that Inkscape is hardcoded to use the system python build, to avoid conflicts with other python builds.
Its quite easy, just inserting a line in the Inkscape start script.
Working on Mountain Lion, but not tested on a naked install.
I have installed Inkscape via homebrew, so this may not work with the website binaries, look here for a possible solution.
I renamed these, restarted inkscape and the extensions started working.
Under here, there are several directories, one for each Python version, and each contains a copy of lxml.
For me (Inkscape 0.48 on Lion), nothing seemed to help, but this did:
Secondly, I needed to install pip to the system python using
I had this problem and managed to get rid of it by installing lxml externally (I presume that's what your easy_install lxml command is doing, although I used sudo port install py26-lxml instead).
Finally, I installed libxml to the system python install with
Install python package manager pip, if it isn’t already
Firstly I had to delete my homebrew install of python, it’s the same version (2.7.10) as the system build so no loss.
