I want to encrypt and authenticate port 8078 on a server running Jenkins using SSH keys (I'll pass our the public or private key as needed), and keep 8078 from being accessed by anything but SSH.
D/ Would a VPN solution be better for this purpose?
But you'd have to bind the service to an internal IP which may become available only after starting the VPN service, thus complicating startup sequence.
C/ Is this a good long term solution to both encryption and authentication to a non web server application?
A) Once an SSH server listens on 8078 on the server, no other application can, Jenkins included.
B/ Will the decrypted request through port 22, when redirected to port 8078, be seen by a firewall?
B/ What IP/port will the firewall see when the SSH server redirects the unecrypted request on port 22 to port 8078?
D) A VPN solution would be superior in that it can be used for more than one service.
A/ Do I need a firewall to complete this to block 8078 from non SSH access?
I have just a few developers using the machine for now.
B) I get confused: SSH does not redirect unencrypted requests.
