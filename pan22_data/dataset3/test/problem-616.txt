As far as dealing with the "threat", you don't allow users to run with Administrator-level accounts (on Windows), and you don't install untrusted software (inasmuch as is possible).
AV hasn't complete blocked it, can generally be cleaned up in 30m-1h of effort with just these two utilities.
Do you think that updating your malware removal skills (or arsenal) is necessary from time to time?
Autoruns and Process Explorer from Sysinternals (now owned by MS) are your best friends.
Nothing can destroy security faster than a determined user, so educate them about the dangers of clicking on random links in e-mail or installing applications unless they are sure of the source (etc), making sure to tell them that this is for the safety of the network and their home computers.
Anything less is a disservice to your Customer and asking for trouble.
Read the warnings that popup when a new threat is found.
As far as "malware training" goes, the name alone is a bit too marketing-buzzword to inspire much faith.
If you stay on top of news, and keep your users in the know, then you drastically reduce your exposure.
The are pretty straightforward, and after your first few clean-ups you'll get a knack for knowing what needs to be killed/removed to get rid of the malware.
That said, every once in awhile you'll run across a peice of malware that isn't written by an idiot, so if you can't make any headway after 30 minutes, its time for a complete wipe/reload.
Sure, some basic skills apply, but if an admin (or support tech) doesn't already know those things, I'd rather they format the machine (for the reasons Evan Anderson pointed out) instead of taking a chance on their cleaning skills.
I have seen some sites offering 'Malware University', training classes on getting rid of malware.
The 1-2 infections I see a week where a user has opened an attachment or visited a page a shouldn't have, and the (up-to-date!)
Perhaps I'm too much of a skeptic, but I feel that any specific "malware topics" are going to be obsolete before the class is in session.
Keep in mind, this is more appropriate for SMB's where hardware isn't standardized.
My Customers and I do not have a problem with malicious software.
If you've got a system image and the user's files are backed up, it will be quicker to wipe/reload at the first sign of infection.
Beyond the sysadmin practices of not letting users run administrator level accounts and such, a lot of the responsibility falls on you to remain up to date on threats in the wild.
How do you become more effective at dealing with this growing, very complicated, threat?
