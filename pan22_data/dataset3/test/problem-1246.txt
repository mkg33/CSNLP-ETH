After investigation, I find out that the entry it's trying to apply was added on the master db right after I started the backup.
You have to tell the slave what was the last GTID executed on the master when backup was taken.
Running on Debian Wheezy with all the latest patches.
When that is done, I copy the resulting directory to the other server and run:
Slaving went b0rken due to some failures on our side, but we thought we could simply fix it by using xtrabackup to create a backup from the running server and importing it to the slave.
Slaving starts but immediately stops due to a 1062 error.
Data is in there and the database is running fine.
I can fix that, but I immediately get a new error.
/usr/bin/mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf -e "CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='10.x.x.x', MASTER_USER='replication', MASTER_PASSWORD='verysecret', MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1; START SLAVE"
We've recently upgraded a MySQL 5.0 master-master setup to Percona 5.6.
To me, it seems like the backup did not contain all the latest GTIDs, only the ones that were available at the start of the backup?
I thought this was exactly what XtraBackup was supposed to fix?
innobackupex --use-memory=4G --apply-log /srv/restore
innobackupex --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf /mnt
All goes well and I can start MySQL again (after I chown the /srv/mysql directory, which is our datadir).
Can someone shed a light on what I might be doing wrong here?
I've been trying to do that this entire weekend (partly because it's a huge database with an insane amount of databases and tables), but to no avail.
xtrabackup version 2.2.11 based on MySQL server 5.6.24 Linux (x86_64) (revision id: )
Server version: 5.6.25-73.1-log Percona Server (GPL), Release 73.1, Revision 07b797f
First, I run the following on the current in production master:
I see no alternative now to making sure no writes are done on the database during a backup.
