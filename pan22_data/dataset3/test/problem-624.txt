Under those circumstances LVM mirroring becomes useful in a situation where hardware RAID is not available.
For partitions which you want fast and do not care about backups for (e.g.
LVM operates on storage devices be it metadevices, or devices presented by the raid controller, or just plain disks.
I think I remember making some mirrors years ago with LVM, and I don't remember this "log" thing.
LVM is not for making your storage highly available.
with the -mirrorlog mirrored and the -alloc anywhere option, with two disks, you get two 4M mirror logs, one on each disk.
In one case it was LVM striping on HP-UX, (should not happen w/ LVM2 in Linux), and I could not extend the LV because the extension had to have the exact same number of stripes.
I'm annoyed that I have to override the policy for what seems like a most common situation, but oh well.
LVM on Linux is not related to the thing on HP-UX or AIX, just has the same userspace commands.
swap partitions for guest VMs), LVM gives you option of whether you want those mirrored or not, or whether stripping is better.
MD operates on disks (yeah you can also use disks presented by the raid controller, but what's the point?..
Or maybe I made the mirror with mdadm and put LVM on top.
I used it on HPUX which did not have the MD layer of Linux when I worked on it 10 years ago, not sure about now.
And, it's way easier to add a disk to LVM than MD.
It is faster (MD can do parallel reads in RAID1) and it requires only 2 disks (if you do not want to rebuild the mirror after every reboot) and MD is designed just to do RAID, and it does it very well.
Sorry for the complex not-to-the-point "question".
LVM on Linux internally uses the DM system, and therefore uses all the same code as MD.
Another time it was with mirroring (LVM2 in Linux this time), but now I cannot remember if LVM refused to take a snapshot of a mirrored LV or to extend it, effectively negating the benefit for having LVM in the first place (we did it in the end, but involved using lvconvert back and forth).
