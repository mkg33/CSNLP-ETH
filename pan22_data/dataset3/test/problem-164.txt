This roughly means that the hard drive's internal functions are not directly accessible by the controller or the operating system, but only managed by the on-disk controller.
However, you can't truly have an answer until you swap this hard disk for another; and this is what I recommend, especially if you keep important data on it.
After all, sector reallocation is a security mechanism: it's there to avoid crashes and prevent failure, not cause them.
If the hard disk is under warranty, you might even be able to RMA it.
Could SATA communication issues cause the hard drive to reallocate sectors?
The short answer is "probably, but most likely not".
If the new hard disk still fails, the problem is almost certainly on the motherboard end, which from my experience, is less likely.
Sector reallocation occurs when a bad sector is detected: Let's take a look at Wikipedia's article on bad sectors:
The bad sector issues might be covered by the manufacturer, so contact them and explain the problem.
I'm even more worried by the fact that it happens in bursts on your case: it sounds to me like the drive is more even more prone to failing.
A little vague, but I can assume that it is possible for a communication failure between the hard disk and the system to end up marking a sector as "bad".
If the on-disk controller can't read a command successfully, it shouldn't do actions that could cause excessive wear on the hard disk.
Unfortunately, you can't open a hard drive and fix an internal failure or fix a motherboard controller at home.
One can assume that even a faulty controller could be to blame for the issues that you're facing.
