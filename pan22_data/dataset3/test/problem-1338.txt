Voodoo Pad Lite's price is right and provides most of the functionality of the regular version.
As a plain text editor it's pretty good for replacing TextEdit.
The Pro version includes whole document encryption and a built it web server.
Both have demos available of the full version so give them a spin.
Something like Circus Ponies' Notebook or Voodoo Pad.
As well as more eye candy, stickies and post-it flags, and animations.
This way you don't have to save a new document each time you want to add a note, web link, image, or sound clip.
Notebook is a more complete experience, formatting numberd lists and sublists is easier.
Offers a good replacement if you're not looking for anything fancy.
VoodooPad has a higher geek factor, you can embed scripts in real languages (Python, Lua) and execute them from within Voodoo Pad.
Notebook also provides a service to clip from within any application and add it to your Notebook document.
Maybe what you are looking for is a note keeper/organizer where the notes are easily searchable.
Between TextEdit, Xcode, nano and Pages, I have everything I need.
