So I would say that SOME software design skills are extremely useful , but you don't need the abillity to build a huge program in C# / Java or whatever.
Why I like some SW skills is simply that your code probably looks way better than code from someone who never programmed for the sake of programming.
Today's enormous number of various resources on data science topics is mind-blowing, but this open source curriculum for learning data science might fill some gaps between your BSc/MSc respective curricula and reality of the data science career (or, at least, provide some direction for further research and maybe answer some of your concerns): http://datasciencemasters.org, or on GitHub: https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go.
From the job ads I have seen, the answer depends: There are jobs which are more technical in nature (designing big data projects, doing some analysis) or the exact opposite (doing analysis, storage etc.
1) I think that there's no need to question whether your background is adequate for a career in data science.
Most of the time, the latter code is very hard do understand / debug for outsiders.
You can do this in an academic program if you simply implement by yourself all the algorithms you learn about.
Also, sometimes your analysis needs to be integrated in a bigger program,an understand of the needs of the programms certainly helps.
2) I believe your concern about focusing on data science too early is unfounded, as long as you will be practicing software engineering either as a part of your data science job, or additionally in your spare time.
Having said that, theoretical knowledge is not very helpful without matching practical experience, so I would definitely try to enrich my experience through participating in additional school projects, internships or open source projects (maybe ones, focused on data science / machine learning / artificial intelligence).
CS degree IMHO is more than enough for data scientist from software engineering point of view.
3) I find the following definition of a data scientist rather accurate and hope it will be helpful in your future career success:
