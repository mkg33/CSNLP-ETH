The local display will most likely be DISPLAY=:0.0 and you can configure this for your Tkinter application.
If you want the Tkinter application to appear on your local display then you can tunnel the X protocol using ssh -X user@remotehost which will setup a tunnel and configure the DISPLAY environment variable on the server so that X Window applications will draw on your local desktop.
In X Windows you can specify a local or remote display using the DISPLAY environment variable or -display parameter.
Tkinter is an X Window System application and needs an X Display to show itself on.
How you do this depends on your system but if you want to display on the local display it needs to be running a desktop session and you need permission (typically via xauth) to connect to that display.
Works if you are using X Windows locally (ie: linux desktop or Windows with an X Windows implementation)
If not you can copy the token from the logged in user to your ssh user using:
Permission is usually handled via tokens stored in $HOME/.Xauthority so if you are using ssh as the same user that is logged into the desktop then just setting DISPLAY will be sufficient.
