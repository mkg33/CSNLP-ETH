The tabs in Vim are great, they can allow you to have a number of files and you can even yank y and delete d lines between open files in the same session.
You can use netrw to display the content of a remote directory with:
index.php writes on server as index.phz, index.phy, etc...
Idealy would be if i could cache the files locally with some syncing tool, and upload them to ftp mapping the path local -> remote, right after vim writes to a file, or i issue an upload command etc (without having to type file opened every time).
I've also tried n++ with WINE but no luck in openeing FTP files that are in a deeper directory level.
Or simply use a GUI FTP client like Filezilla or gFTP and its "Edit inâ€¦" feature.
I had sublime text 2 installed but cannot run it anymore after i installed new drivers for my graphic card.
I've tried syncing via curlftpfs, the files appeared in a local dir, but i cannot write to them, i get all sorts of errors, and when i manage to write files with random endings are generated on the server.
from there you can open a file in another window with P or in the current window with <CR>.
It's strange that there's not solution for vim since its a developer's tool mostly, sublime and npp already have that solved in a simple manner.
I need to edit remote files with vim, that are on a FTP server.
I know this is old, but another option is to use e.g.
There are plenty of files on the server so i cannot memorize them, It's important for me to have them cached locally so that i can access them fast and upload with a simple command.
I feel you pain, I love to use vim, and with the ftp client, it is almost like you have ssh.
I would really like to avoid anykind of repetition, rather set up a relative mapping.
Though you cannot simple use relative filenames (because the local working directory is different), you can use the filename-modifiers to refer to files relatively:
curlftpfs (Slackware build here) to mount the FTP server to a mount point, then use your local text editor of choice.
I've seen there are various approaches with vim to edit files on the FTP, but every single one needs typing like :e http://[user@]machine/path (with netrw plugin).
Don't panic if you loose the file listing: it's still there and you can get it back with :Rex.
