do not allow multiple MAC addresses to communicate through a single managed switch port, and if that is the case on whatever LAN you are connecting to it Won't Work.
If you want your guests to connect, you'll need to set up NAT/etc on the host machine and provide access that way.
Unfortunately, it doesn't create a matching address on your host machine.
I then turn that into a router machine, with a fake domain (fake.tld) DNS service, DHCP, caching DNS service for the world, etc.
3) Host Only - this creates a virtual network between your host machine and the guest(s).
4) Internal only - this connects machines to a virtual internal dumb switch.
You'll be able to pick subnet, if there is DHCP, etc.
and then spin up other VMS to actually experiment and do things with on the internal only network
This is done in the manager interface, in the settings for the machine, on the networks tab.
2) Bridged - this bridges across one of your ethernet devices in the host machine, and connects directly to the network as if it were plugged in to a jack somewhere.
What I do for a lot of practice/playground/experimentation is set up one machine with 2 interfaces - one on bridged, and one internal.
You can create multiple "NAT network" names and subnets, they do not see each other unless you go out of your way to set that up.
Network connectivity to your VM - assuming of course that it has a properly configured service to connect to - depends on what network type you've chosen in the VM settings.
1b) "NAT network" - Like above, but you have to configure a NAT network first.
If you have "NAT" selected as the network type and the card is active/enabled, the Port Forwarding button will be active and available.
There is a dhcp service available, but it won't provide a gateway.
The only way to connect is to forward individual ports, just like you would on your home router.
If you have multiple VMs on a "NAT network" they can communicate between themselves.
