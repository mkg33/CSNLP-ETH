most of the nodes in the Object explorer assume it, scripting of objects is one example i know of off the top of my head.
Same is used by SSMS when clicking on button which is used to select backup path or browse directory.
Rather that SQL Server Service Account can't access the location for the backup.
To fix this you need to grant access in windows to that path to the account that the SQL Server Service executes under.
There are lots of other functionalities that SSMS assumes you must have sysadmin rights in order to perform actions;
you'll get errors whenever you expand any nodes, when in theory they should be able to view it (that login can see the metadata via queries, of course.
The error is generated because "exec xp_fixeddrives" doesn't return any records when executed by a non-sysadmin account.When you run the same using user having sysadmin permission then "exec xp_fixeddrives" returns the list of drives.
SSMS uses "xp_fixeddrives" to list the drives in PC.
So it is the problem with SSMS ,and it is not a problem with any permission to the folder or account under which SQL agent services runs etc.
example: create a user with VIEW ANY DEFINITION and login as that user into SSMS.
