But, as a graduate student, I work in quiet, shared offices where other diligent workers are mere feet away.
Of the keyboards I've personally heard, I'd place the Apple aluminum keyboard as the quietest, the older Apple plastic keyboard and other OEM equipment as slightly louder, and the Tactile Pro as far louder than these two.
Here are some keyboards I've heard of, but I'd also be interested in assessments of other models I haven't heard of yet:
(I've seen a few videos comparing keyboard noise, but I've found it impossible to glean much from these.
I think placing the noises on a spectrum with keyboards I know from real life will be more helpful.)
I know someone with a Tactile Pro and the typing clatter is distractingly loud.
There are many great options out there—friends have recommended the Das Keyboard and the Tactile Pro—and I think I'm ready to make the leap.
If you have heard one or more of these popular "tactile" keyboards in person, can you rank its noisiness with respect to other options?
I'm hoping to replace my Apple aluminum keyboard with a more comfortable alternative.
This one comparing the Das Keyboard clicky and silent models, for example, makes it seem like the two sound identical.
