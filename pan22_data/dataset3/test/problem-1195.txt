The benefit is that everything is nice and neat, and organized...  Then, any infrastructure related cabling (connecting switches, etc) I run out to the side of the rack and then up/down to where it needs to go...
They sound like the ideal solution to your problem - assuming that you can get everything 6 inches apart.
I would also like to also suggest getting patch cables in different colors.
Each color could be for a department, vlan, printers, servers, voip, etc.
Typically, I'll put a 48 port switch between 2 24 port patch panels.
Then, I use 6" patch cables to connect the panel to the switch.
Personally, I try to put the switches as close to the patch panels as possible.
That's tidier in many respects as you can still get your hands in there to change them, the cables aren't in the way.
or.. make or buy (if you can) some cables that are just long enough (but not so short that you put strain on the plugs - give it an extra inch or two for wiggle room).
Similar to what you show in your pic, but a lot more disciplined - no cable gets added that isn't first put with the bundle on the side.
If not you could just make some custom length cables that are just long enough for where things currently are.
Surely 6 inch cables are just too limiting, get the longest ones you can and loop them together to keep things tidy.
This is the main reason I can think of why very short cables would be a disadvantage.
Our cables tend to be the long ones, but they are all pulled to the side, kept together and the other end pulled in - like you have a box of cabling at the side of the rack to store the main cable, pulling the ends out.
The main downside with a cable as short as 6" is that you may end up with problems if you use it to directly connect two interfaces, but for a patch between a panel and a switch (or two panels), it should be just fine.
