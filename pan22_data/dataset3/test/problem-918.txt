So again, the question: Interpolating the previous and current frame, will make me lag one frame behind.
A twitch game like quake would show the problem very clearly while in a typical rts, it wouldn't be noticeable.
The interesting part is that Glenn Fiedler tells you to interpolate the previous and the current frame, which lead me to the following question:
Doing such will make the rendering lag one frame behind the physics.
You can try and hide it through predictive animations and other things, but that's all smoke and mirrors.
Which you can accomplish by accumulating time generated by the renderer and consuming it in fixed step sizes.
Since I'll take one more frame to see the results of my actions.
The title says it all, but let me build more into the question:
One may be inclined to say that one frame doesn't make that much of a difference, but then, these three articles of Mick West, one of the founders of Activision and former programmer of "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater" series says otherwise:
How bad it is depends on your frame rate of course.
I suppose everyone by now knows the Fix Your Timestep article, and its proposal to free your physics engine steps from your rendering steps.
