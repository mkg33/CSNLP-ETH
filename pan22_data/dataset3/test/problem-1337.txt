If you want the adventure of building a controller/driver circuit that's fine but if all you want to do is get the motor to spin I'd look at a cheap Electronic Speed Controller ( ESC ) from HobbyKing or local RC store.
The voltage handling is often stated in "s" units.
Ask anyone who flys electric RC airplanes or a hobby store to help you power this "brushless" motor.
They're rated by supply voltage and output current.
Here is a list of many low-cost speed controllers from Hobby King......
The ESCs operate on a 1ms to 2ms pulse width (freq 30Hz-50Hz) the same as the actuator servos.
These brushless motors are sensorless, using the undriven winding as a sensor source.
If you're ESC has a BEC( battery eliminator circuit) then you can power the Servo tester from there instead of finding a separate 5V supply.
Remember, you will be powering the motor, and NOT the circut board.
( $8 )  The kind that is used to drive brushless motors in radio control models.
These ESCs are usually driven by an RC receiver output but you could provide your own PWM signal OR just get a Servo tester, which will give you a compatible control signal and a knob to play with.
I don't suppose an HDD motor needs a lot of current so a low current ESC would only be a few dollars.
All eclectric RC airplanes use a ESC and those guys will know what you need.
