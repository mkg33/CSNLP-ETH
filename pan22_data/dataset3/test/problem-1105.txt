Once you've done that, DBCC CHECKDB should be willing to cooperate.
Try a dbcc checkdb, post the results here so that we can actually help you.
That DBCC output looks like it can't get exclusive access to the database, so it's refusing to even run.
As to the actual question in the title, you don't want to just export the data and reimport it.
If it is then we need to figure out just how corrupt and recover what data that we can.
The first thing that I'd recommend doing is taking the application offline and running a checkdb to ensure that the database is not corrupt.
What happens when try attempt to manually run a database backup?
After you're finished, put the database back in multi-user mode:
If you want to throw everyone out of the database so it will actually run, use the following command:
Based on the fact that this is dynamics (and it runs your business) you might want to spend the money and get either PSS on the phone or a SQL consultant to look at it (even with a SQL consultant you may still be calling PSS).
To get checkdb to run at right now you'll need to put the database into single user mode probably then run dbcc checkdb for each of the databases.
