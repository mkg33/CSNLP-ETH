It doesn't matter in this case, since both your devices are below 16,  but keep in mind that lspci gives its output in hexidecimal and the xorg.conf wants their info in decimal.
If you have the proprietary drivers installed, that should be there, too.
Alternatively, you'll need to set that up manually.
inside the "device" section you give a unique name to each video card so X knows which one you are talking about, then some other options, such as where on the PCI bus the device is located.
Auto-configurating, like ati and nvidia do, is great when it works, but it doesn't always work.
The 0 and 1 are from your output of lspci in your question.
For example, by reading the xorg.conf device section, it knows video card 1 is at location "PCI:1:0:0" and the second card (in it's own device section) is located at "PCI:2:0:0".
Same with multiple monitors, if they are different, then you need to specify them so they are detected correctly.
You probably need to configure that in the ATI Catalyst Control Center application.
I know that the current rage is to have as little in your xorg.conf as you can get by with, but when there are multiple video cards that are not the same, you need to specify them.
You need to have 1 device section per each video card in your system.
I'm not sure where, exactly you'd find that under Gnome.
That's what I had to do in Kubuntu 10.04 to get my two monitors recognized.
In the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file there is a section called "device".
