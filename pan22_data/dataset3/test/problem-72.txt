Its totally CLI, which has been a fun, fascinating learning experience for me.
You may also want FTP access to upload new sites/pages/whatever.
Since it's a server, you'll want it running 24/7, so power consumption, heat, and noise will be your biggest concerns.
You'll want something relatively quiet that can perhaps live under a desk.
By "work the same" I'll assume you're referring to software.
I want it as a windows server and work the same as servers we get from hosting companies, what main points i should consider while thinking in that?
You'll want a battery backup/surge protector for power conditioning.
Ok..back to you..You will need to run a web host, like Apache.
You can do it with dynamic IP addresses, but it's not ideal and would require a dynamic DNS service to operate.
I want to create a home server which can host websites i build.
Until recently, I ran a Windows server out of my home, but after a particularly nasty malware infection, I reinstalled with Ubuntu Server.
Frankly, with the cost of VPS (virtual private servers) systems as low as they are, I'm not sure I would bother with an Internet server at home without a really compelling reason.
Also, I prefer remote access so that I can shove my server in a closet and forget about it, no monitor, keyboard, mouse to worry about.
A stable Internet connection with static IP addresses will also be in order, preferably with business class support.
For the box itself, the specs should be whatever will handle your application with some room to grow.
If that's the case, get a copy of Windows Server and install on the box and configure the services the way you want them.
I'd recommend putting any network gear on battery backup as well to keep the connection alive during a spike or brownout.
