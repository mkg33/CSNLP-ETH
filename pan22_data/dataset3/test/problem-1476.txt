If it were doing this while being accessed, I would just replace it, but it is nice and quiet when in use.
Is there something in Hitachi's hardware that is making this sound?
Process Explorer shows that only Explorer having a handle to any resource on the drive, but killing Explorer doesn't halt the song.
This is repeated until such time as the drive notices I'm listening in, whereupon it stops, embarassed.
Am I missing anything that I could do that would quiet the drive down?
The song doesn't play while doing a manual scan in WD.
I don't have any virus software installed (RANU, no install anything that is hackworthy or untrusted) except for Windows Defender.
For some probably useless trivia purposes, the system is Win 8.1, and the drive is a Hitachi HDT725050VLA360 500gb drive.
The drive is only used for long term local data storage (errything is backed up).
I have used Sysinternal's Process Monitor to watch disk access, and as the song is playing, I cannot find any process that is doing any IO work on that drive.
I've got an old Hitachi Deathstar drive that functions perfectly, but is now singing a weird tune when not being accessed.
Again, the only thing that seems to stop the song is browsing the drive or waiting for it to end naturally.
I have also made sure that the drive is NOT being indexed for search, nor is it set up for write caching.
I haven't found anything in the driver or in disk management that could be turned off which had any effect.
The noise that it makes closely resembles the following
More seriously, it starts some time after the last access and repeats until I specifically access the drive (e.g., browse to a subfolder in Explorer) or when the song ends (or perhaps the operating system pokes it; I can't tell).
