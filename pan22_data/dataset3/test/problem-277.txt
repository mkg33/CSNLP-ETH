I use the open-vm-tools 2013.09.16.1328054-r3 (VMware tools are simply too much trouble and pain to build).
I am running linux (Gentoo 3.15.5-hardened-r2) as a guest under VMware workstation 9.0.2, the host is Windows 7 Enterprise.
I can copy stuff (files and clipboard contents) from other VMs and the host into the linux guest, even using drag & drop, but the other way fails.
VMware guest isolation settings are enabled for drag & drop and for copy & paste.
This all used to work once without any trouble (older version of VMware workstation, VMware tools, linux kernel, KDE, Qt, etc.
My desktop environment in the linux guest ist KDE 4.12.5.
Rebooting and restarting everything does not improve anything.
But copying files or drag & drop doesn't work at all.
I can copy text and images from the clip board if I press Shift+Ctrl to release mouse and keyboard from the guest.
Moreover, when I try to leave the guest window with the mouse, the mouse appears to "stick" at the edge of the guest (the mouse pointer is "flung" back into the guest window a couple of times until I can proceed, the exact behavior varies).
