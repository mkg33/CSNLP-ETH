Instead, select Preferences -> Browse Packages... (or Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages... if you're on OS X) to open the Packages folder in your operating system's file manager (Windows Explorer, Finder, Nautilus, etc.).
Ask on Stack Overflow if you want to know how to do that.
First, comment out all the lines of advance_to_first_non_white_space_on_line() except the final return statement:
Open the Command Palette, type prv to bring up the PackageResourceViewer: options, and choose PackageResourceViewer: Open Resource.
If you want to go back to the way things were before, just delete that file and you'll be all set (the original is stored elsewhere, but is overridden when an identically-named file exists in Packages).
If you're really adventurous, you can clone the file, rename it, and modify it to include logic to only indent like this with certain languages, but that's beyond the scope of this answer.
Now, this obviously will change the behavior for all languages, not just Python, so be prepared for that.
Save the file, and just for fun try to comment out some lines in it - you'll see all the # comment characters are in column 1.
Continuing on to has_non_white_space_on_line(), comment out all the lines:
def advance_to_first_non_white_space_on_line(view, pt):
def advance_to_first_non_white_space_on_line(view, pt):
That being said, the changes you'll be making aren't that drastic, and are easily reversible.
Oh, to get to the file again, you don't need to go through PackageResourceViewer.
To undo the changes, just replace the two function definitions with those in the first code block above.
In Packages/Default you'll find comment.py, just as you changed it.
Scroll down a bit, select Default, then scroll a little more and select comment.py to open the file in Sublime.
Doing this involves messing around with one of Sublime's core files.
The first thing you need to do is install Package Control if you haven't already.
Then, create a new line after the return statement, indent 4 spaces, and paste in the following:
