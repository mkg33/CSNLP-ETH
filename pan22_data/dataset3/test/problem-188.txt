Here's a slightly different approach that works great for me.
Install Nautilus Actions and open the application.
Here is an updated version of @darthvader's answer for Ubuntu 13.10 with screenshots:
From now on, whenever you need to compare 2 or more files, select the files, right click on them, and select 'meld' listed under "Open With".
by doing this from the shell prompt: meld folder1 folder2
However, comparing folders is anyway a rarely used action.
Under the Action tab, use the icon path: /usr/share/app-install/icons/meld.svg
-- This trick is also great for setting the default applications to be used for opening different types of files.
Is there any way I can get something like "Select left to compare" and "Compare with" context menu for files that is there in Beyond Compare.
And under the environment tab, set the Count to be strictly greater than 1.
I use this because often the two paths you want to compare are in different tabs or windows.
Keeps the Right click context menu cleaner and also gets meld working from inside Nemo, without installing anything new.
