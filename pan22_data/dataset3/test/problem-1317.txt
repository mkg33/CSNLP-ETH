My internet access, like almost everyone elses, has to go through the web proxy.
Our total internet connection is somewhere around 2*2Mb for 2000 staff.
Other than occasionaly blocking TheDailyWTF forums when it notices certain words it doesn't cause me any issue.
Unless you want to maintain an exception list, please let me bypass the proxy so that I can do my work.
Also, I frequently work with not-yet-public (read: no DNS) websites residing on customer premises, and these sites are only accessible from specific computers (usually with a VPN).
And that's not fun when you're working on a remote system through a VPN while some developer is downloading a CD ISO, etc.
I see no reason why developers should be exempted from any but the most draconian internet policy.
If you have a problem with people not working by messing around on the internet, then limiting their internet access is only going to cause them to waste time in some other way.
as much you want, but for goodness sake, please use an autoconfigured proxy (preferably with WPAD) and don't force the developers to use it.
and if it is really urgent then there is a standard broadband line that comes into the office for exactly this purpose.
Blocking porn and streaming content (youtube, etc) should be enough.
You can do this with squid or a proprietary network appliance (like BlueCoat).
How you do this can take different forms depending on the type of job.
There is network security in place so that I can't just change the IE settings to skip the proxy.
If you want to stop the problem you have to address the root cause.
I think what's more important is to limit their bandwidth.
It is sometimes inconvenient when I need to download a service pack, but generally a little planning prevents the issue.
I've always been of the opinion that using IT to police HR issues is a bad idea.
I use my work laptop from a variety of locations (company network, public and private WLANs, customers' networks etc), so autoconfiguration saves a lot of hassle.
In a previous job, as a networkd administrator, i used to share the network connection with the dev team.
It's used to enforce internet policy, but we're responsive to fixing stuff being blocked that should not be.
