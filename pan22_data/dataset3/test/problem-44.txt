I saw this interesting article : http://mikaelronstrom.blogspot.com/2012/02/105bn-qpm-using-mysql-cluster-72.html and it made me get interested in MySQL Cluster.
Yet another option for DB clustering on the cloud is services like Xeround's cloud database, RackSpace MySQL, etc.
Some providers let you order special "cluster instances" which are connected using fast network technology (Infiniband or something similar).
However I'm not sure how the performance of these services measure up to an infiniband cluster.
MySQL Cluster On Cloud  vs MySQL Cluster On Dedicated Cluster
After little chat with hosting provider and i was told i may not be able to achieve to such performance on the Cloud Architecture which brings me to my question :
This makes the cloud option equivalent in terms of performance to a cluster in your data center - of course you will need to consider the costs, because the cluster instances are much more expensive than regular instances.
Here is a link to documentation of the cluster instance option on Amazon EC2.
Actually there is an option to get high performance networking between cluster instances on the cloud.
