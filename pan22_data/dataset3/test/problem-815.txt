It's not a big application and i am not expecting a lot of traffic.
This might be exactly what you need initially for free.
In general, Java hosting is more expensive than typical LAMP hosting.
All the hosts supporting glassfish is very expensive (about $40 a month) which is way to much at least in the beginning.
I have found that it is cheaper on servers which has JBoss or Tomcat but will my application work on these servers?
By the way, I don't work for eApps and have no commercial interest in them.
and so on, you can find even a cheaper one if you want it just for development/testing.
I've made a webapplication which runs on glassfish v3 on my computer.
In case that it can be done will there be any disadvantages and can you guide me to a place where I can read about how this can be done or maybe even help me do it.
I have worked with eApps in the past for a small Java application and was very pleased with them.
This is because most quality Java hosting services offer a separate JVM to each customer, which gives you more control but also consumes more resources.
Apparently it is possible to run JSF 2.0 applications on the Google Application Engine with a bit of elbow grease.

They specialize in Java hosting, which I found to be helpful when it came to configuring SSL certs and such.
Not sure about Glassfish but you can run Tomcat on Amazon AWS EC2 'Micro-tier' server which is free for 12 months when you signup, it is then easy to scale up when you need
You can buy a VPS(virtual private server) and install whatever you want(java,mysql,tomcat, etc):
The ones above are reliable hosting providers and you can use them as production servers.
