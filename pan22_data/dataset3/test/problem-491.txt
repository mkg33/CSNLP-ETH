The only way that the slave server at your previous host can affect name resolution for your domain is if it's still listed as a name server for your domain.
Here j.gtld-servers.net says, that name servers for att.com are ns[123].attdns.com, and ns3.attdns.com says, there actually is a 4th one.
If the slave server is used by any DNS clients and if the slave server still answers authoratively for your domain then it will affect name resolution of your domain for those clients, but all other DNS clients will be unaffected.
If you haven't changed your parent's notion, then this could be the cause of your issues.
Check the WHOIS information for your domain and check your domain registrar to see what name servers are listed for your domain.
Make sure you remember that your parent has a copy of the NS records and the associated "glue" (IP addresses) to associate with those NS records.
Run run dig +trace NS your.domain.com then ask each of the name servers above you what is their opinion about name servers for your.domain.com.
If the old slave server is listed then you need to get that fixed.
The important thing is that if you're dropping a slave, change the NS records in the zone and change the parent zone's notion of the NS records too.
So forget that problem, because it's not one you can solve.
you'll have complete picture, what a properly configured client can receive when he asks for a name server for your domain.
You need to try very hard to synch the servers as best you can in a small window, but even with that there is a always small window where the master is ahead of the slaves.
It may be a bit tedious, but if all the answers you get are sane, then your configuration is demonstrably correct.
in the example) what do they think about NS records for their domain (att.com in the example) and you have completely complete picture.
As for the slave server hosting a zone for your domain, it doesn't matter as long as they're not authoratative for your domain.
You simply can't fix admins that refuse to listen to the TTL setting.
Assuming that can't be solved, then if you've done all the other right steps then there is nothing you can do.
I can host DNS zones for Microsoft and Google if I want to but it only matters to DNS clients that use my DNS servers for name resolution.
Then ask each of the actual name servers for your domain (ns[1234].attdns.com.
As far as other DNS servers not honoring your TTL's, there's nothing you can do about that.
You did your part to shorten the transition phase, and finally all will be well, but you cannot do anything about ISPs purposefully ignoring TTL for DNS entries to lower load on their servers.
Once your name servers are listed as the sole name servers then you should be good.
