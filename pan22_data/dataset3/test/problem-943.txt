The site was not under source control nor was there a testing environment.
I saw several references to the exclude feature of Robocopy, but they seem to only apply to source folders, not detestation folders.
I accomplished this by creating a local folder, copying the web page data into it, and running hg commit.
Both the webserver and the local machine are Windows machines, and I don't have administrative rights to either.
Is there any way to exclude the .hg folder from deletion, other than copying it out of the destination folder before the robocopy executes?
Changes were made to a production system with no backups.
I want to use the Robocopy /mir option to pick up deletions as well as changes and additions.
My problem is that the /mir option deletes every folder it doesn't find in the source, and my .hg folder isn't in the source.
My first step was to do source control with Mercurial so I can quickly back out of changes that break things.
I recently took a new job, and one aspects of the job is maintaining the organisation's Umbraco website.
