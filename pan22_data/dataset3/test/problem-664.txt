The PDF Toolkit is a free, command line application that provides this functionality.
But if you want the PDF to be editable, you can always use ImageMagick:
It yields the following Document Properties in Adobe:
I have some PDF documents which cannot be edited with Acrobat, so, how can I reproduce this with LaTeX?
Currently, the documents I generate using pdflatex may be edited with applications such as Adobe Acrobat X Pro.
Other permissions can be set as well (from the Pdftk Man page):
Is it possible to generate a PDF that is not editable?
As was mentioned by the other people, you can decode the PDF to PS (which is possible because to some extent, this is what the PDF reader has to do) and then convert back, and you have an editable PDF file.
Once you can read the PDF on your screen, it means that there's all the information and the PDF can be edited.
I will add this as an answer, because it answers the question somehow and it is long and a bit complicated.
As it turns out, these security features is very much viewer dependent and there are ways around it.
Here's an example (from the Pdftk Examples page) that encrypts the document with 128-Bit Strength and allows printing only:
Adobe programs of course do not offer such functionality.
Afterwards, since the quality is very high, any sufficiently good OCR will be able to convert it back to text.
You set the "owner password" (owner_pw <password>) and specify which properties are allowed for the document.
Conclusion: You can protect the PDF from edits by "normal" users, but you cannot protect it from edits by people who know what they are doing.
