Having clustering traffic for servers on the same vlan as client access traffic does not sound like a good idea to me.
The multicast stuff might work better if they used a WiFi router or used what device they have in a router mode instead.
Is you block that your IPv6 connection will not work correctly.
I'd think separating the cluster control/state traffic from access traffic would be the constructive solution.
It sounds like your customers are bridging the Ethernet and WiFi traffic.
Barring that you can put a simple filter device (firewall) between the WAP and the main network that just drops any packets to/from the multicast address range...
Basic functions like Neighbor Discovery (ARP in the IPv4 world) is multicast and Router Discovery is multicast.
Of course then the link-local stuff will not work.
If your switch (or more accurately the client's switch) is capable of filtering the multicast packets by address (blocking the multicast prefix) that would be my first suggestion.
Maybe the servers have multiple network interfaces making this simple (and cheaper than managed switches).
It will have to change to be using a routable multicast address.
