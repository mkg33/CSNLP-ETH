It turned out 'ipmasq' had been installed and was running causing odd problems.
I attempted an 'arping' to the MAC address of the router while I had eth2/3 bridged, but it failed to obtain it's IP address as well.
I'm trying to create a bridge so that the second machine on eth3 can be connected on the lan.
I've tried to ensure my routing table mimics what it looks like when using eth2 normally, I cannot hit the gateway at all.
I've tried the following, however it hangs when attempting to get an IP address from the router.
I have two physical NICs (eth2 & eth3) with eth2 connecting to the home router/dhcp server and eth3 connecting to another machine which needs access to the internet.
I removed the 'ipmasq' package entirely and tried bridging the NICs again thinking it may have been causing problems, but it still failed.
One interesting thing I noticed was that attempting to bring down the bridge & reactivate my internet on eth2, I was having trouble pinging the gateway.
Likewise, attempting to give it a static route doesn't seem to work either.
When I stopped the ipmasq service, my internet started working properly again.
