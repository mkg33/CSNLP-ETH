This appeared to work, but ran very quickly - in fact it didn't.
If if you don't find it in your GPO's, look on the computer's local policies using gpedit.msc.
Neither the msiexec nor registry fixes worked for me (even after rebooting), but disabling User Account Control (as suggested by Ha Ly in this thread) and rebooting did the trick.
Look on your Domain Controller if you have a GPO disabling "Windows Installer":
There is probably a better GUI based way to alter the policy, but setting the following reg key as an admin on the machine does the trick:
I've run into this behavior, where MSI installation is prevented with "The system administrator has set policies to prevent this installation" before.
Verify that it is set to "Not configured" or "Disabled".
Note: the fact that you are a domain admins doesn't matter.
I believe it is due to default Windows Software Restriction policy and I've seen it on both Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012.
On a whim, I tried this inside the admin command prompt.
After spending time looking at group policy, as far as I could tell, there was nothing that was relevant.
I then came across this post that suggest I try launching a command promt as an administrator and running
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Installer > "Turn off Windows Installer".
This is usually due to a Group Policy or a Local Policy disabling Windows Installer.
