The problem is that most of emails sent by us are placed in spam folders in clients email accounts.
We use this SMTP only for sending emails with From addresses like info@business.com.
If it is on the list, if it's a new IP you have been given you can probably get your provider to give you a new one, if you've had it a while then it will be harder to prove that you are not the ones who got it blacklisted.
Clients have their email in Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.
Mailings are made using either desktop email clients or custom Java-based application which uses JavaMail for sending emails.
But as the number of clients increased, we have to order VPS and install our own SMTP server their for performing our mailings.
Your VPS provider should be able to setup a reverse DNS record for your domain.
It does a whole load of checks to see why your emails could be labeled as SPAM
So, now we have default provider mail server for receiving emails, let it be business.com.
Are there any service in Intranet where we can send test email and get an answer with description why this email could be considered to be spam?
Previously we received and sent emails using mail server of our hosting provider.
We use this mail server to receive emails and manage our email accounts.
During our business we have to make regular mailing to our clients: invoices, information emails, etc.
The only way to know for sure is to see the header information of the emails in the junk/spam boxes of your clients.
We have email accounts like info@business.com, etc.
Could you please tell what is the most probable reason and solution of described problem?
VPS has default DNS records created by provider, let it be IP.AD.RE.SS <-> ip-ad-re-ss.provider.com.
Most of the big providers require that you have a correct RDNS pointer record setup for your mail server before they will receive mail for you.
You need to make sure that your email server is setup properly so that these mails are not marked as spam.
As mentioned, one of the most common reasons is Reverse DNS.
You also want to check that the IP your provider has given you has not been blacklisted, use a facility like this one to check.
