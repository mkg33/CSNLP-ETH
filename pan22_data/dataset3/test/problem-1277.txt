WOL packets need to be issued from the network the machine to be woken is on.
Wake-On-Lan packets cannot be routed (they work on local network only, routers won't pass them through.
Your internal port will be 255 and your internal IP address will be your WOL computer.
I am using a Netgear R7000 with firmware V1.0.9.64_10.2.64 as my internal router.
Make sure your device manager settings for your network card is set to accept Magic packets only in the Power Settings tab.
Repeat the same port forwarding until you reach the router where your WOL PC is connected to.
On this router the external port xxxx will match the port number to above.
Create port forwarding xxxx (the port you pick for your outside WOL port of the computer you wish to wake) UDP to the WAN address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx and port xxxx of the next interior router.
External Port 2559 is    forwarded to my inner router with a Wan Address of 192.168.2.1 with Internal Port of 2559.
You will need to have your outermost router's WAN address or use a DDNS service to route
For simplicity, I suggest using the same port numbers for External and Internal Ports until you reach the router with your WOL computer which will have an Internal Port of 255.
Example:  My Outside Router has an IP address of 192.168.1.1.
I have an ASROCK|P67 EXTREME4 motherboard with support for Wake-On-Lan.
Use WOL software on your phone or computer with the MAC Address of your WOL computer.
There is a central 'Cisco' router for the apartment.
They are sent to a MAC address and so cannot be routed across networks - they cannot be forwarded by routers from one network to another.
My router, using DD-WRT, supports dynamic dns and the like (and I'm open to that solution).
Is the dd-wrt router on the same network as the PC?
The computer would automatically boot into an Ubuntu 11.10 that I would tunnel into using ssh or for graphical usage something like VNC.
I connect wirelessly using an old router of mine (WRT54Gv2) with DD-WRT installed as a client to the central wireless network.
However, according to Wikipedia article on Wake-on-LAN, there is such thing as "Subnet Directed Broadcasts", which, if supported by all routers along the path and by the target computer, could be used to send WOL packet across the router boundary.
So, I would like to send a magic packet to my client router (or to the central router, if that isn't messy) to wake up my computer remotely, so that I can access it when I'm not at home.
On this router External Port 2559 is forwarded to Internal Port 255, with
If so, you could issue the wol packet from the dd-wrt router
MY WOL computer has a static address of 192.168.2.21.
