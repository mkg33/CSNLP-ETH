We have not had any replication issues in 6 months, so I feel confident in moving forward with trying to get O365 working.
I've spent the better part of a year putting out fires and replaced a couple DCs and cleaned up ghosts of DCs past.
All the previous admins had their idea of the proper AD structure and best practices for groups and group policy.
Will I be able to setup a hybrid Exchange environment to test moving mailboxes to the cloud in a trial?
Shutdown DC and clean up AD so there are no ghosts left.
    The only working accounts have been created in the cloud
I have had zero experience with Azure AD or O365, so I'm not sure how to proceed.
    Accounts that are synced have user@company.local names
Try to fix the problems we have in our production domain.
A previous admin setup our company's O365 account and setup AD Connect, apparently without ever reading up or testing.
I need to allow this test domain to have access to the internet and O365.
Will I be able to setup a trial O365 account and setup AD connect to sync just like the production domain?
Do I set it to our users SamAccountNames or email addresses.
I need to stand up a test domain to try and fix accounts that have been synced into AAD.
Please let me know what I've missed and where I need to be looking.
