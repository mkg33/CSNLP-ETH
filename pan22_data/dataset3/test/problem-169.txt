I actually resolved this by updating my driver for my network card.
I recently installed Windows 7 and now have an annoying problem.
Also, it it happens mainly during browsing, you could try another browser to see if that helps.
-Hard Disk Indicator lights up (however i dont hear the disk chugging along)
My earlier disk-layout placed my SVN checkouts in \users\salmonmoose\svn which meant literally hundreds of thousands of files to be indexed - on a slow, laptop drive.
If you are running very low in memory you might be swapping out to disk when switching between tabs/windows.
There are some utilities that will display the Smart diagnostics which are present in most drives now,  for example ActiveSmart
I've previously run into this with Vista, and it may well occur in Win7 for the same reasons.
Sure it costs a few bucks but if there's anything wrong with the disk short of almost complete to total failure, chances are Spinrite can repair your disk to working order.
If you go into your task-manager and select the performance tag, you can launch the "resource monitor" - this will let you sort your processes by disk-i/o and find anything suspicious.
If it does, it would probably rule out network errors, but does not necessary prove that it the browser that caused the problem ad it  might avoid the problem because the current browser has an addon that is causing problems or because the files it uses are stored on a failing part of the disk etc.
I would recommend disabling all and try, afterwards enable one by one and check...
I am starting to think that this is not a hardware problem on machine (older Dell Precision 9100 with 4GB of ram and P4 3.2).
-When I look at the resource monitor the hard disk utilization jumps to 100% however I dont hear the hard disk performing a massive amounts of reads/writes.
(This could tie in with it starting when you moved from Xp to Visa which would require more memory, especially if aero is enabled)
Seems the fancy program to index your files can seriously hammer your system if you have too many files being scanned.
As well as Process Explorer, you could try Process Monitor (also from Sysinternals) which will tell you what files have been accessed during the 60 seconds.
I am wondering if this could be something with my network?
Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings in the left > Advanced tab > Settings under Performance.
It might be worth trying to run Spinrite to make sure there's nothing on the hard disk that's causing it.
You will get an lot of files accessed, but there are also summaries (under tools) which should show what process are performing the most disk-accesses and also which files/directories are being hit.
