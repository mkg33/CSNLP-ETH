As I understood, the only solution would be an update to PHP 5.6.
My server's current system is running since 7+ years.
Further is it needed to update Apache http server too for PHP 5.6?
Something about using wheezy or dotdeb.org sources and pinning.
So the last stable and supported PHP version for sqeeze seems to be the one I'm running.
The reason I need to update is a problem with PHP CURL that's best described here: TLS 1.2 not working in cURL.
After apt-get update there is nothing new (lot's of 404 sources not found errors).
I wonder if anybody has successfully updated PHP 5.3 to PHP 5.6 yet on Debian squeeze and would kindly share how this can be done.
On a Windows System I already verified that with PHP 5.6 all works fine.
I'd also appreciate if there is any other solution like only upgrading the package php5-curl.
Maybe the TLS problem can be solved in a different way, I couldn't find one.
I'm running php-cli scripts through crontab that connect to https sites and more and more fail lately.
Already was reading updating Debian to higher versions.
