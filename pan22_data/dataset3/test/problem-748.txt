I've been googling and researching the topic for over three weeks now and I've come up against the same problem over and over again and I haven't managed to get around it.
My assumption here is that I've configured RHEL correctly, but messed up somewhere in creating the RHEL based clients setup on AD.
Yes, I have enabled and configured the UNIX attributes, so its not that.
I'd be happy to 'dump' configs, if its so desired.
Specifying a machine account with the dollar sign, and KTPASS runs through without error.
Disclaimer: I am not a sysadmin although I have been forced into the position at work.
Could someone please point me to / show me the correct steps to add and config UNIX computers and users on AD?
They have an open source version available at their website http://www.powerbrokeropen.org/
The more thorough one would be: Authenticating UNIX/Linux to Windows 2008R2
So I checked and fiddled and googled and I've come up with nothing.
Followed the steps word for word, changing IPs and Hostnames to match my test environment.
Got the error message: getting target domain for specified user.
According to me the config on RHEL is correct and I've got the computer and user accounts created on the AD, no problem.
I've been tasked to implement an Active Directory (on Server 2008) config for our environment containing Windows XP, Windows 7, Server 2003, Server 2008, Server 2008 R2 and Red Hat Enterprise 5.10 boxes.
Get a quick guide online, setup a test VM server, connect my Win7 client to my new AD.
I've followed about 3 different 'guides' on how to setup Linux to connect to AD.
You may be able to simplify your life by using a tool like Powerbroker Identity Services or PBIS.
This is what I am currently using at work to join our linux hosts to AD and it has worked out for me across multiple versions of centos and ubuntu.
Repeat but try to connect a RHEL 5.10 VM to the AD?
