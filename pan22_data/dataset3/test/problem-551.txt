I could see the argument - more for the OS to manage, etc - but is that legitimate, or will the extra breathing room more than make up for the management?
Recently, I had our server admin tell me that the new servers we'd ordered with 140GB of RAM on them had "too much" ram and that servers started to suffer with more than about 80GB, since that was "the optimal amount".
It's possible the server admin you talked to knew this from practical experience without knowing the exact technical reason.
Was he blowing smoke, or is there really a performance problem with more RAM than a certain level?
I'd always assumed that more is better, but maybe there's a limit to that.
There is, in fact, a point at which more RAM will run slower.
(I'm neglecting the cost the cost of electricity to power the servers and the cost of electricity to cool the servers -- those costs can have a big effect on "optimizing" hardware selection in a data center).
Typical memory config with 12 slots filled will be 48G (all 4s), 72G (8s and 4s), 96G (all 8s), etc... when you say "140G" I assume you really mean 144G, which would very likely be 8G in all 18 slots.
Assuming the CPU can actually use the RAM (it's not one of the special thresholds that sysadmin1138 mentioned), more RAM can't possibly hurt performance.
If something other than RAM is the bottleneck, then adding more RAM doesn't help performance (although it doesn't hurt performance, either), and it costs money that could instead be applied to opening up the bottleneck.
I'm not asking "Will I use it all" (it's a SQL Server cluster with dozens of instances, so I suspect I will, but that's not relevant to my question), but just whether too much can cause problems.
In this case you say it's for a SQL cluster so yes, for that, too much RAM could slow you down.
For HP servers with 18 slots, like the G7, filling all 18 of the slots will cause memory to run at 800 instead of 1333.
However, since you have a limited budget, there may indeed be some "optimal" amount of RAM -- if you spend more money on RAM, then you have less money for CPU(s) and hard drive(s) and IO.
Now, from what research I have done it appears the slower memory speed doesn't affect a lot of applications, but one thing it is known to affect is database apps.
I apologize but most of these answers are incorrect.
