I'm moderately well versed in the command line administration of a RedHat derivative and don't see any reason to deviate from this path when I acquire more servers.
That's where the long term support offers from RedHat become important.
There are clearly differences between RedHat derivatives and Debian derivatives.
RedHat Enterprise Linux is simply found on almost every support matrix from commercial software and hardware vendors.
You might also find Novell/SuSE SLES on the matrix.
Meaning for every decision you make you have to make sure that whatever OS/software/hardware you are using is "supported" or "certified".
It is also very important to many managers that there is a company you can point your fingers at and open support tickets in case of problems.
If you are living in an enterprise IT environment you often find yourself in what I call the 3rd-party-vendor-support-matrix-hell.
RH just happens to provide support which is what you want (or better need) in an enterprise environment.
We use it because it's one of the few flavours of Linux that Oracle will (officially) run on.
Many enterprise class applications only "officially" run on RHEL, and they will not support you if you run it on a different distro, so the support angle is two fold.
And even then these vendors often only list RHEL releases which are at least one generation behind the current major release.
Simple answer: Support, Reputation, and Certification.
I chose CentOS for cost reasons (its free) and for support reasons (the comprehensive RedHat documentation applies).
