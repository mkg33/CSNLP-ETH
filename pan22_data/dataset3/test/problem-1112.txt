It reports the size of each subfolder and of "Files in this Directory".
It is a small Java app that actually gives you a disk space report that includes all sub folder for the selected drive or folder but then allows you to drill down into individual folders.
I haven't seen this mentioned but I highly recommend JdiskReport.
I have nothing to do with this program other than being a long time happy user.
Go to Organize, then in Layout menu check Menu bar.
There is an open source software that works on windows 32 and 64 !
I figured that when you select "Organize" and then under "Layout" you click on "Details pane" it shows the file properties.
If you right-click the "background" of the folder window, Properties gives you the total size of the folder, including any subfolders.
I am happy to have found this out, was scratching my head intermittently [since it was not the most important thing in the world :-)]
go to View in the menu bar, you can check the option of Status bar.
Right-clicking and selecting Properties displays the total size of whatever files and folders you have selected.
