if you want to save only a portion, then change the 'g' and 'G' to other movement keys.
If you want to have logging on as the default, add the following line to your ~/.screenrc file:
Usually with Mac OSX and Terminal you can scroll back as much as you want, and save with Cmd-S.
If the file exists, then output is appended to the file.
You can change the name using the logfile {filename} command.
It is possible to increase the scrollback and view it in copy mode http://www.samsarin.com/blog/2007/03/11/gnu-screen-working-with-the-scrollback-buffer/
You may want to set the filename using something like:
All output in that window is logged to the screenlog.N file until you deactivate by pressing Ctrl-a H again.
How can I save to disk everything that happens in a screen session?
The file gets placed in the directory in which screen was first started, but that can be changed with the logfile command or with chdir [{directory}].
You can also get this functionality with Ctrl-a :log.
But when I'm on SSH using gnu screen, then I can't scroll back directly from terminal.
Start it when you start screen by doing screen -L (or from within screen).
You will want to use the 'log' operation, usually bound to Ctrl-a H.  This opens a new file called screenlog.N where N is the window number.
I like to save everything I do on the command line, for example when I upgrade something and want to read back how the upgrade went etc..
Or, also from within screen, you could press Ctrl-a : H.
Note that this is not the same as hardcopy or the scroll buffer.
If you want to save the entire  contents of the scroll buffer, use Ctrl-a ] g <space> G <space> Ctrl-a :writebuf  This saves the scroll buffer to the file /tmp/screen-exchange.
This is the same functionality as the script(1) program, but tied to a single window and without calling a new program.
Maybe by default (every session automatically creates a file to disk...)
