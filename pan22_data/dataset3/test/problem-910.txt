You can't "route" traffic at layer 2, routing occurs at layer 3.
Is this "proper" or is there a better way of doing this?
The switch isn't going to forward that ARP request from VLAN 10 to VLAN 20.
Why don't you use the IPS as the Default Gateway for the clients and use the Firewall as the Default Gateway for the IPS?
The client traffic is going to die without ever reaching the IPS or the Firewall.

I'm assuming they're both connected to Ethernet ports on the Edge switch.
The point is I don't want to "route" from port 2 to 1 directly through the backplane, I need to force it to go through the IPS.
Without getting into a bunch of gory details, I'll just make the following points:
Essentially I would like the packet flow to go from PC1, to the Core Switch, to the Edge Switch, and to the Firewall.
I need to "bump the wire" to force traffic through the IPS.
What are the issues with connecting the IPS between the Edge switch and the Firewall?
The client is going to ARP for the Default Gateway, and being that the Default Gateway is in a different VLAN it will get no response.
Ideally I would put it inline between the edge and firewall but there are issues with that (different interface types) so I need to do it this way.
There are several other technical problems with your proposed design, but since the point I just made is a showstopper I'm not going to elaborate on anything else.
You show both of them connected to the Edge switch.
Before you laugh I am using a 2960 as the edge and a 3560 for the Core.
The switch is going to forward the ARP request only to ports that are in VLAN 10.
