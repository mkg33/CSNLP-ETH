Depending on your needs it might be better to go with static external IPs.
To complete the described setup you do not need a second VPC.
Can't I use the existing VPCs GCP has on different regions?
You only need to use two subnets in different regions under the same VPC.
Having said that, it is absolutely possible to place your Windows AD DS VMs in different VPC networks and add them to the same domain.
If they will only use internal IPs you might need to implement VPC Peering .
I have successfully executed that in single node setup and it works perfectly fine.
If you want your VMs to have access to Internet and be reachable from outside the GCP network you will need to configure them with external IPs.

That way I can access internet from DC and also DC is expose to internet for other servers from other cloud providers?
As there should be end to end reachability between AD server and the client machine.
Bear in mind that ephemeral external IPs change each time the VMs reboot and you might need to manually modify your configurations whenever this happens.
You can either work with the subnets that are already created in the “default” VPC network or create another VPC network with a couple of new subnets.
What if one of my servers are in AWS and I need to add that server to the domain where DC is hosted on GCP?
I was following the instructions mentioned location
You will also have to implement a set of firewall rules to allow the required ingress traffic so that a Windows AD DS VM hosted in AWS can be added to your GCP Windows AD DS.
