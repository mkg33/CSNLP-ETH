With mounting hardware you will sooner or later come across stuff that's supposedly designed for "standard" racks (there's actually no such animal) but you won't be able to mount it without modification.
Heres a nice Howto:Racks and Rackmounting article by Matt Simmons that you might want to take a look at:
The door also "fell" off so we ended up switching it with standard racks.
Chances are if you can rack one, you can rack all.
If you have a standard rack chassis, the short answer is yes.
If you start getting white-box rack servers, the rails they come with might not fit so cleanly.
Apart from the height requirements there are three important points to consider.
For servers, stays away from racks with tapped holes or round holes that use caged nuts.

If you have a non-standard rack chassis, it will depend.
In a previous colo, we had a bizarre and very cheap chassis that would not allow us to rack Dell and HP equipment.
Work out the greatest depth your devices require and then add a bit more to that to be safe.
Rack mount devices can vary considerably in their depth.
It's not so much the servers as the rails that you have to be concerned with.
There's precious little you can do about that other than be prepared for it.
If you stick with good-quality racks and name-brand servers, you probably won't have any problems.
Although I've intermixed devices and racks with round and square holes it's much easier if you have the correct one.
I've had to take the back door of racks before because a new server is just a tiny bit too long.
I've been fortunate enough to always have access to metal working equipment when having to deal with this little issue, resorting to cutting and welding on more than one occasion.
Check the length, especially with regard to storage arrays.
