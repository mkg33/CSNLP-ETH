It's a bit of a relief to know that it's not any of my disks holding my data that are throwing errors, but now the question is how do I figure out what sdg is and why is it throwing these errors?
The problem is, I can't find a figure out what device sdg is?!?
I have an interesting problem on my home file/media server that I can't track down(debian 8.11).
I've tried running fdisk -l /dev/sdg and the command just hangs.
There is nothing in /etc/fstab referencing /dev/sdg.
I plugged in a USB thumb drive and it mounted as /dev/sdh, so it skipped /dev/sdg for some reason.
I am constantly seeing the following message in dmesg for the last few days:
Other than running samba/ssh for sharing files on my home network, the only other application installed is Plex media server, however I wouldn't think any of those applications would be creating block devices on my system.
ls -all /dev/disk/by-id/ | grep sdg returns 0 results.
I am assuming it's block device of some sort, however there are only 6 physical drives in my server(sda, sdb, sdc, sdd, sde, sdf)
