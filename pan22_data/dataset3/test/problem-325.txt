Previously I tried copying them to the directory where perl.exe is, and other places, but nothing worked.
My "solution" was to copy the missing .dll files to c:\windows\system32, whenever the system told me that it couldn't find a dll.
Hopefully someone will find the real problem and/or fix for this.
I had the same problem with Windows Server 2003, strawberry, and Bugzilla.
I've corrected the problem by removing perl path statements in the windows environment variables.
This allowed the new strawberry intall to search the paths in the correct order.
I've installed Strawberry Perl (v5.12.3) on Windows Server 2008 32 bit and I was hoping to run simpledb CLI tools.
I had a small issue with HOME environment variable, I renamed it to HOMEPATH to solve the problem, but when I tried to run I got:
If you're using strawberry perl and you copied the install dir from another machine just execute update_env.pl.bat (found in the straberry dir) and reboot your PC.
The strawberry install added it's own path statements at the end.
They were at the beginning of the string from an old install.
The only exception was the libmysql_.dll file, which worked when copied to the /strawberry/perl/vendor/lib/auto/DBD/mysql directory.
