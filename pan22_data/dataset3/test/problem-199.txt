Acording to Bugzilla sudo Bug ID=590 the call to sudo -n true 2&>/dev/null ; echo $?
I think /usr/lib/sudo/<username>/0 has the time stamp of the most recent sudo execution.
At least on sudo 1.8.21p2, this approach works fine:
This is probably extreme overkill by most people's standard, but here is the (posixly correct) function I use to check if sudo is unlocked (the function will not waste its time if the user running it is root, as there is no need to unlock sudo):
According to the sudo manual, the sudo session is determined according to the time stamp file (/usr/lib/sudo/<username>), so you may be able to figure out how much time is left by checking the date/time of the time stamp file.

I know this is a really old question but here is I did in a script today:
However, in my system, the time stamp file is in fact a directory, and there are three files with cryptic content in them (and also some weird time stamps, but /usr/lib/sudo/<username> seemed to have a timestamp that coincided with the time I gave sudo my password.
