If you're not sure, posting the make and model of this device would be helpful.
Your done run one cable with splitter for 2 computers.
Here's why I'm not 100% sure I understand your question.
This is a data-link (second) or higher layer device for combining Ethernet connections.
They have this at Dollar Stores, eBay for $1.00, Radio Shack $10 I think you get the picture.
Yes there is such a device, we call them RJ-45 splitters but they are also called RJ45 CAT 5 6 LAN Ethernet Splitter Connector Adapter.
It's not clear to me exactly what kind of device you're talking about when you refer to a "modem".
There used to be simpler devices called network hubs that worked on the physical (first) layer.
Due to the location of the wireless connection, sometimes the signal is weak, so I normally access one of the computer via the ethernet, but my modem has only a single jack.
There are ways to split Ethernet cables so that you don't need a hub or switch, but unless there's some big reason you can't install that extra box, splitting cables is an unnecessary hassle.
If the "modem" does handle the WAN connection itself, than it's providing a network endpoint, and a switch or hub will work.
I have two computers side by side (one work and the other personal).
(RJ45 mentioned because you can do what you want if you used old coax to connect.
All three ends need to be female, the end with 1 female end will go to the cable that is connected to your modem/router, the end with 2 female ends go to each computers.
Assuming your Ethernet is connected via a RJ45 plug:
Is the WAN interface configuration built into your "modem"?
Otherwise, you need to move a level up from switches and get a router.
Actually a  lot more functionality than you need, but some layer 2 switches are so cheap (NewEgg has them for $10) it doesn't matter.
Is there a splitter or something that will allow me to access both computers at same time without having to swap the ethernet from computer to computer
Some people call switches hubs, but I'm a technical writer, and thus a semantic nitpicker.
I think the thing you're looking for is called a network switch.
Since you're using physical Ethernet, the router doesn't have to be wireless, though you probably won't save any by buying a wired-only router for a two-computer network.
Feel free to google for 10base2_t, but this is very unlikely)
Switches got so cheap, they drove hubs off the market.
