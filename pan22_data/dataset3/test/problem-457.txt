You already gave an argument against this by yourself:
This is a common operation though, and I wouldn't use this method anywhere else.
For example if someone else reads your code (fast fast-reading over it), he probably will not notice this - even if he is familiar with this.
This all assumes that the return value isn't boolean && the return value is used elsewhere.
If it is, either your function is way too long or your variables are not named properly.
I believe it's more readable, since the assignment is separated from the comparison.
I guess this is something of personal style/preference.
I'd still argue for the second way you present (assignment before the if statement).
I've seen this a lot, so much so that it's very easy for me to tell if the allocation is wrong.
I prefer the second way of doing it (not having it in the if-clause):
In my opinion this is the only argument against this practice.
If you code has any chance of being misread, you should avoid it.
Remove all comments from your code - it is even less lines then.
But this is my opinion only, there are probably supporters with good arguments for it out there.
