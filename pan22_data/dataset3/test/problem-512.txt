Another consideration is to set up a VPN between your home and work.
Your work will need to set up a VPN server to facilitate this.
I currently have 2 ISPs and one gateway from each company.
In the end, if its connected to the Internet its all part of 1 network, so what you are probably referring to is having systems on different LANS - ie what systems can communicate directly with each other.
This protects different aspects of your connection, and IMHO is way more important then isolating subnets, as, correctly set up, it protects against interception of data between you and your work.
Alternatively you could do something similar using only 1 additional router, in which case you would plug your home devices into the ISP router, and your work devices into the second router.
(FWIW, I work on the fringe of the financial services industry and I enforce VPN for access to the main offices - and dont worry excessively about what is on peoples LANs.)
The easiest and most comprehensive way to do this is with 3 routers - Connect 2 routers (WAN ports) to your ISP router LAN ports.
Provided the routers are using typical NAT configuration between LAN and WAN, the work network should be isolated from the home network (although the home network would still be reachable from the work one) - this configuration protects work routers from home, but not so much the opposite.
This would relate to the VLAN solution others have commented on.
The only things that should be connected to the ISP router are the 2 client routers and upstream connection.
How exactly you do this depends on your goals and criteri.
I use a Mac desktop and Mac laptop for work but at some point I may add a Windows pc.
A third option would be to use dd-wrt and configure 2 networks from 1 router.
The only thing is you probably need to change the IP range of the LAN (eg from 192.168.1.1 to say 10.110.1 and 10.1.2.1.1 on each of the 2 additional routers, assuming all routers come with the typical default of 192.168.1.1).
Connect work clients to 1 router and home clients to the other.
I would really like to eliminate one ISP to lower costs but I need to have completely separate networks fro work and home.
This is fairly technical to fully isolate though, and probably not worth the time compared with the 3 router solution.
Once that is done, I want to ensure that the work network is as secure as it can be because I sometimes deal with sensitive information.
