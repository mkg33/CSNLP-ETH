In the past the testing security team did not learn about embargoed security issues.
I would be tempted to run your tests and see if they pass.
The machine is hosted in a remote data center to which I have no access, and I am rather unwilling to go to the trouble of reinstalling a server from scratch if I can avoid it.
Testing is not stable, this means that they might introduce a change into a package that causes your system to break, that changes the format of configuration files, or many other things.
And after a while, I discover to my horror that I have just upgraded to a testing distribution (wheezy).
There is no simple method to downgrade in Debian based distributions.
I would be extremely cautious about running a production system on the testing distro, particularly if you can't easily get to a real console as your question seems to suggest.
Once upon a time I introduced the following line in our sources.list file:
to get a list of the packages on the system and copy the dpkglist.txt to a safe place away from the system.
If you must go back, then it is time to perform a restore from the backups you made.
The machine runs only services used internally which, although not mission-critical, would be a pain in the butt if they were to fail.
None of the services running on that machine appear broken and everything seems normal.
Like any techie in a startup team, I am just the de-facto Linux guy.
If they do, then it's probably easier to stick with what you have and keep a close eye on it for problems.
Fast-forward a few months, when I have completely forgotten about this change, and I decide to do a full upgrade of that server.
So there may be security patches released for a critical zero-day exploits for stable, but the fix for testing will be delayed.
Your system may be working today, but what happens when you run apt-get upgrade to get your security updates in a week, and you also get a new version of a critical service that you depend on, that was a major update and changed the config file format, or introduced a change incompatible with your system.
I did that because I needed version 3.4 of the octave package, whereas the latest version in stable (lenny) was 3.2.
The best solution is to reinstall and you may have to do that at some time unexpectedly.
An embargoed security issue is one which is not publically known, and its existence is to be reported to responsible organizations..

I believe this may not be an issue anymore, but it still mentions this on the wiki.
