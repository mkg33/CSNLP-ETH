However there are Wi-Fi networks with a firewall that does only allow devices to communicate to the NAT router but not with each other.
And by default this router won't forward UDP packets to the device.
I am working on a small project to make a client server program to make a connectionless implementation & I want to transmit Information between 2 devices which is connected to the same Wi-Fi hotspot & so they are showing same IPV4 address .
If only one device is in the Wi-Fi network (and the other one is in another Wi-Fi network), you will also have no chance:
And actually none of the devices inside the network is really connected to the internet, but only the NAT router or proxy server is.
If both devices are in the same Wi-Fi network, you don't have any problem:
However, these IP addresses are not valid in the internet.
The Wi-Fi network (the same is true for a home network) forms a local network.
In most cases all devices will have an IPv6 address which is valid in the entire internet.
So devices inside the Wi-Fi network can communicate directly to computers in the internet.
As I already wrote, the only device which is really connected to the internet is the NAT router.
All devices in the network have their own IP addresses.
So actually the global IP address is not shared between the devices, but the only devices really using the global IP address is the NAT router or proxy server.
To establish a connection (for example a TCP connection) to a computer in the internet, a device actually establishes a connection to a NAT router or proxy server, which then establishes a connection to the computer in the internet.
How can I differentiate between the 2 devices or could I possibly use IPV6 address to make client server program?
