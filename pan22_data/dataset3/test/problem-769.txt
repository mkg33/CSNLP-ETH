Should you have several disks you might need another name.
I really need some help with installing it without damaging Ubuntu.
Then your can chroot into the original installation, but that is a bit complicated.
I just got a laptop and I installed Ubuntu 16.04 on it as the only OS.
I would not worry too much about Windows10 destroying GRUB.
If you see the grub menu it would not have a windows entry.
Just boot into the CD by selecting "Tying Ubuntu" and not "installing" it.
Ususally I always install grub on the hard disk, not in the partition.
All partitions in a disk are named like that plus a number, e.g.
Actually I think it is better to let windows do that and fix it later.
Now I want to install and add Windows 10 to GRUB but how do I do that?
Grub is very easy to repair, even without boot-repair (which needs to installed form a PPA or burned to a self starting disk).
I already looked at some other answers on this site but they do not work for me.
On reboot you select your original installation (you will recognize the partition name, e.g.
In that case use gparted to look at the disks and note the correct name.
That will include the live installation but also your original installation.
Should you boot into windows only, you need to repair grub with a ubuntu live disk, like the original install CD.
The major thing is that you do not let windows format your whole disk and install it into another partition as your Ubuntu.
It should include something about your windows installation.
Then from Ubuntu, just run the two commands again, to remove the live CD entry and make your Ubuntu the default boot entry.
Other way is to just enter the two commands above.
I never had a problem that could not be solved with a reinstallation of grub.
sda1, sda5,.. On the command line you always need the full name with '/dev/...'.
There are other descriptions on this site to make Windows10 the default entry.
"dev/sda" is the name of the first hard disk in a linux system.
