this, however, will generate a loop at host B that will be resolved only by TTL running out, and will generate excess load on network.
It would be better to have a properly configured switch, or a separate link to host B->C to send these packets.
Generally, in order to accomplish this, you will need to do this:
Have a look at the man pages, this should be a start.
As your original question does not assume that the packet would be actually received by host B but just forwarded to host C I would do the following on host B:
If this is a application, depending on your protocol, create your own custom packet with a final destination IP (what I had to do).
Yes, it is possible to do that by updating source and destination MAC address before sending the packet onto the network again but leaving the IP addresses unchanged.
This is the simplest way how I would accomplish this.
In single-interface and non configured switch case you will always result in a loop unless you write a specialized software for this using pcap and you will have to trick the switch anyway by pretending to have the IP address configured.
If this is Linux, I might suggest looking into prerouting and postrouting.
This principle is used in some DSR based load balancers.
