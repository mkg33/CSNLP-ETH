Even if you don't use Group Policy to deploy it, you might find the msi installer works better in your environment.
A bit of info about the system if it could be helpful;
You can now deploy Google Chrome as an msi through Group Policy:
I work in IT at a school and we recently updated our database software, however the web access that the teachers use to do registration does not work too well with Internet Explorer 7 and we're thinking about switching to chrome (mostly due to me hating IE in general) but the problem we have is that users are unable to migrate their bookmarks over from IE due to account restrictions, is there any way to get this working?
The favorites are stored in %UserProfile%\Favorites in folders and files, so there may be something you can do there to let users make copies of those files and import them some other way.
Coordinate with the rest of the IT department to cure this part: "users are unable to migrate their bookmarks over from IE due to account restrictions" - because as the IT deparment, you set those resrictions.
The installer allows you to set policies like the DefaultSearchProvider and control extensions, autofill, whether it should check to be the default browser, and more.
Applications and system administrators should support user requirements and not the other way around.
Also, if they have some problem with alternate web browsers (IE honors group policy for example aka those account restrictions, other browsers may or may not, don't know) then they should at least upgrade to the newest released IE - which is 8, not 7.
If it doesn't work too well then the application needs to be fixed.
