Dynamic DNS will keep you pointed at the right ip address as your ip address changes periodically.
I have router, have set up dyndns in the past, and assume that I'll need to configure it to do port forwarding, but what will I need on the machine - the PC can run Win7 or Ubuntu.
I have a mac & a PC at home, and wondering what it will take to enable remote access to them.
Some residential ISPs in the US block port 80 to make you pay for the business class solution.
It will act as if you sat down at the computer and logged in, so you can turn on the webcam and see what's going on.
To view a usb camera without a remote desktop connection, you would need some software on your computer which will serve the camera's video up to the LAN, preferably on port 80.
If you want to remote into your computer and view the camera on your computer's screen I recommend LogMein over GoTomyPC because LogMein is free.
To get past this you can do a port transformation from an available port, such as port 70 to port 80 at the router, and this will allow you to serve up the camera while the ISP blocks port 80.
I suggest getting a true network camera, then just port forward from your home router.
Using a true network camera would be much easier than running a web server on your pc.
The quick and easy solution is to run a remote control program like GoToMyPC, or one of the free alternatives, then connect to the desktop.
