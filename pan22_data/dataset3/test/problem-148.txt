For a casual\puzzle game on ios you need a single programmer and one or two artists\musician, more people will usually only slow down development or be of very little help.
then questions like this can very easily be used to ask how "many other people do I need to do, or something like project X?"
I am freelance Android and PHP developer working mainly on intranet and b2b systems that are consisted by both android app(s) and server back end.
there are 2 competing ideas in projects for number of "workers", and they both have applications to programming/development

though this has also been the site of some debate, and statements of "I can do that", but the thought is that it takes more then one person (sometimes it takes people with specific talents) to get things accomplished.
Two people (plus outsourced music) is usually the best number as ios titles doesn't really do that much of an income in the average situation (read: the market is nowhere near the goldmine everybody imagine)
if person X is working on section Y of the project, and person A is also working on it then both peoples modifications have to be taken into considerations, and in many cases their work needs to be manually merged.
What is the average team size for mobile games like in
there is a "fallacy" in computer science that I have seen multiple ways called the "1 man month", it basically means that one person cannot create a fully featured solution to a computer science project in one month.
Although I really like this area sometimes it is hard to find new projects.
when the truth of the matter is this is not a question for others, but an honest self-reflective question for yourself.
This is a fascinating and insightful presentation on gaming development where he discusses the pros and cons of working in groups of developers for years at a time as opposed to working on games independently a few days at a time and pretty much everything in between.
then comes the question of time, and this directly relates to the number of people, but not always.
yes it is possible to find how many people made these games, but that doesn't "explicitly" mean that you will be able to do it with the same number of people.
According to: http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/off-topic/61675-angry-birds-10-things-you-probably-didnt-know.html
There are quite different by size and complexity games but I just need examples like: Game X was developed by N programmers for M months (or at least "It seems to me that game X will need N programmers for 5 months to be completed").
By "Team size" I mean mostly programmers (but I will really appreciate more info about other specialists that are needed for such project).
I know that it is maybe too broad question but please give me at least some guidance.
At the same time, every now and then, I receive inquires like "Can you create clone of game X and how long will it take" or "I have this idea for a board/puzzle game, how long it will take?".
Angry Birds was made by a team of four people and took eight months to finish because it was such a low priority for the company. "
the more works the faster things go (if everyone has a specialty, and can do their job well), and
then have you done a SWAT analysis (especially S, and W) of yourself, and your possible team?
How the process works and how few or many required is discussed as well.
So far I stay away from such projects but I am really tempted to start/join such project and I will appreciate any helpful information.
