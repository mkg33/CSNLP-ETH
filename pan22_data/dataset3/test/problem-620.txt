...copy the datafiles, temp, undo, redo logs, control files AND instance related files (initINST.ora, spfileINST.ora, orapwINST, etc) in $ORACLE_HOME/dbs
...copy the datafiles, undo, redo logs AND instance related files (initINST.ora, spfileINST.ora, orapwINST, etc) in $ORACLE_HOME/dbs
...setup the instance in the oratab file (or, if it is Windows, use ORADIM to create the instance related windows service)
You'll also need the redo log files, and you'll also need to create a new controlfile on the target system.
I have a large Oracle database (~300 GB) and I need to move a copy of the database to a new environment in a short period of time.
Copying the datafiles (while the database is down) from one server to the other is part, but not all, of what would be required.
You'll naturally need to have the same version of Oracle installed on the target machine with the same patches in place.
...copy the datafiles, undo, redo logs AND instance related files (initINST.ora, spfileINST.ora, orapwINST, etc) in $ORACLE_HOME/dbs
IF both are at the same version, and Oracle is patched in the same manor then the answer becomes a factor of:
I was looking at http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b31107/asmcon.htm but not sure if this is what I need.
If it is 11g, duplicate can use the "from active database" clause, so long as the instances can reach each other on the network.
If you're moving to another windows machine, there are some other issues at work as well.
IF the file structure will change AND the instance name will as well THEN
...recreate the controlfiles using the "create controlfile reuse ~ noresetlogs" command
If you're using RMAN with a recovery catalog to take backups of your database, it might be easiest to use the DUPLICATE TARGET DATABASE command.
Normally, I am a fan of the RMAN DUPLICATE, but if this is a one time thing, I probably wouldn't worry about it.
I was wondering if there is a way to just pick up the raw files Oracle manages and move them to the new box and bypass doing a dump and then another import?
IF all of the database related files will reside in the same place THEN
...setup the instance in the oratab file (or, if it is Windows, use ORADIM to create the instance related windows service)
IF the file structure will change, but the instance name will not THEN
...setup the instance in the oratab file (or, if it is Windows, use ORADIM to create the instance related windows service)
...recreate the controlfiles using the "create controlfile set ~ resetlogs" command
This is largely dependent on the differences is Oracle version, and OS version.
If this isn't 11g, you would be taking a separate backup, transporting that for use by rman.
