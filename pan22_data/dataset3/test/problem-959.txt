So use a stronger hashing algorithm if you plan on comparing a large number of excel documents or if you think someone might want to manipulate the comparison.
SHA256 is better again and should give you complete confidence for your particular usage.
As other answers make clear, it's possible to construct 2 different files which result in the same hash and MD5 is not particularly robust in this regard.
On the balance of probability with contemporary hashing schemes they are the same.
On the Windows command line, you can use the comp utility to determine whether two files are exactly the same.
It is relatively easy to find examples using CRC16.
Different values guarantee the files are different.
After you choose a hash function and stick to it, these are all combinations to consider:
The scenario in which identical files generate different hash values is the only one that is strictly impossible.
For your purposes, yes, identical hashes means identical files.
This answer is intended to be a handy map of scenarios that can or cannot happen, and reasonings you can apply.
The same values are not a guarantee the files are the same.
To add on the other answers, here are many examples of couples of files with the same MD5 hash and different content.
Refer to other answers to learn why hash functions work this way.
