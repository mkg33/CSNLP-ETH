Create a nice icon for it and copy paste or drag and drop multiple files into it.
As long as you drop them all at once, they are all attached to a single Outlook email which is immediately sent to the names you preconfigure in the script.
(The most I have done is make a portable version of Minecraft.)
So I don't fully know the process used by the last link, but hopefully it is enough to set you on the right path.

For outlook, it does look like it is possible using command line switches:

If you can add this the component please post back with it.
Dropping multiple files still remains a challenge, as Outlook does not allow attaching several files through command line.
And for Thunderbird this can be done with the Compose Switch:
I managed to do it for one file, which was really easy in the end.
However, I have never really worked extensively in batch files.
Save the code to a .vbs filename of your choice and put it on your  desktop.
And you can find how to utilize drag and drop support for a batch file from this link:
Just a batch file will not do though, you need to utilize command line switches for a specific program.
If you want to take a look at your handiwork before sending, comment out the final line "oEmailItem.Send".
Because of the limited filetypes accepted by Outlook as attachments, I would like to add the ability to zip all files dropped into the script but have not been able to get that to work yet.
Short Version: You can, and it's not too hard, surprisingly.
If you dont mind Using VBS instead of batch, this is a compilation from several places that I patched together to handle the same thing.
