If I want to see who is attending a meeting that I have not organised, I simply click on the relevant meeting in the calendar, then press the 'Respond' button in the top menu, then select 'Respond All'.
But as stated above, you cannot get the response status unless you are the organizer (that is where the scheduling tab comes into play).
Open the meeting request and click the Scheduling tab.
You'll see a list of all of the other people who were invited to the meeting.
This creates an email with all the attendees names in the 'To' box.
In Outlook 2010, click the Scheduling Assistant button on the Home tab; a list of invited people displays at left, along with their required/optional status.
If you have an iPhone and your calendar is synchronized with Outlook, you will be able to see the list of invitees and if they're attending.
It may be considered rude to ask, but with Outlook you can look for yourself and no one will be the wiser.
Note, however, that only the meeting organizer knows who is coming for sure.
Because only the meeting organizer receives the responses to the meeting request, and it's the responses that report back to the meeting organizer about who is coming.
