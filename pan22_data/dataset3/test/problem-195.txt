This requires, that either your provider allows you to control the DNS settings of your IP in detail (in this setup you will need an Elastic IP), or that you've setup your own nameserver.
Both setups are not very complicated to achieve, so it would be a good idea to check with us if you see the questionmarks forming.
Assuming you already own mycustomdomainname.com you will need to map it to the Amazon EC2 instance you are using.
Since you are (a selftitled) noob I will just outline the needed steps, since answering all of this in detail would be beyond the scope of this question (and way to much to remember and understand).
So I hope I can get you started in asking further questions from here.
Both setups I lined out would require that you'd read up on DNS.
With elastic IP you could setup either your own Nameserver (or the one provided by your provider) to resolve mycustomdomain.com to your EC2 Instance.
Without Elastic IP you will be required to periodically check the IP Adress of the Server (which can be queried via a Webservice) and update your own nameserver according to this IP.
