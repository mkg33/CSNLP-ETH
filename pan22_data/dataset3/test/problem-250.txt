Can we use some sort of automated check to scan everyone's computers, akin to Mozilla's Plugin Check but on a widespread scale?
We encourage Firefox, though a number of people still use IE7.
What is the best way that we ensure that everyone's computers are kept up to date with the latest versions of Flash and Java?
We have System Center Essentials set up to keep all the computers up to date as far as Windows Update.
Everyone is at different levels with plugin updates, and it tends to be the case that we don't find out about someone neglecting updates until they are affected by it in the form of some webpage with spyware in it crawling through an old Java or Flash version.
But lately we've gotten some spyware/virus attacks that have come in through outdated plugins.
Those of you who manage computers like this, how do you keep everyone's plugins up to date?
Our organization has less than 100 people all on laptops running Windows XP.
Can System Center Essentials come in handy for this?
We also have Trend Micro which has protected us well so far, so the issue is only of preventative maintenance at this time.
