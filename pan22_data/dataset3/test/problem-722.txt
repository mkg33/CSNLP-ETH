Just confirmed it on Google Chrome 43.0.2357.65 beta.
Found this superuser similar question and this Chrome team developer blog post.
Is one of these the new "Enable Offline Cache Mode”?
Both mention looking in chrome://flags for the “Enable Offline Cache Mode” property and switch it to "enabled".
Trouble is that may have been true for Chrome 35 (mentioned in blog post), but property no longer exists in 38.
Too often do I loose the content of these tabs because of Chrome trying to refresh it... which inevitably ends up with a no network error page.
Looking for a way to work offline (when in the train...), reading my already open Chrome tabs.
What I understood from your second link (http://addyosmani.com/blog/offline-mode-chrome/) was that the feature of automatically loading a cached copy has been replaced by the Enable Show Saved Copy Button option (where you initially get the "Unable to connect" page but with an additional "Show saved copy" button for manually loading the cached copy).
