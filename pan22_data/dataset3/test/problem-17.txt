If it is possible, I would highly suggest you simply create a "BRIDGED CONNECTION" on your system - which would be connected to Ethernet for your LAN network, and Wifi for your internet access connection.

You have two wireless networks, but you would like to connect to both of the wireless networks at one time using a device containing only one wireless network interface.
However if this is not what you mean, you may be referring to the idea that is discussed in the following link:
However, there are several pieces of software that you may attempt to use, and they may or may not be able to allow access to both; but if you are trying to combine a LAN and WLAN connection, Im not sure how well any of those things will be.
In order to give you a more concise answer, I would first need to know under which idea your question falls.
If you are unable to connect to Ethernet whatsoever, you have a very slim chance of being able to do this.
This is assuming you are able to connect one or the other to an Ethernet connection to do so.
I am not sure if I am correctly understanding this question, because it is phrased quite oddly, but I am understanding the question to be something like this:
Accordingly, if you do not have two wireless network cards, it is not possible to do such a thing.
