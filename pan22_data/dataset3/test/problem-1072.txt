For example, you can still download Windows 3.11 drivers for the S3 Trio video card that VPC emulates (you're looking for w3117004.zip, near the bottom of the page).
Even before then, you have to format the blank virtual disk, which you can't do with DOS/Windows3 because you don't have the floppies.
Check your 60MB ZIP to make sure you didn't miss a few critical hidden files, IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS, both in the root directory.
Overall, you might have better luck imaging the whole disk as suggested by AlanCF.
Also, it may not be quite as simple as copying the files back, due to some esoteric stringent requirements about IO.SYS.
Better odds that the sound card was a SoundBlaster 16.
If you're lucky, the actual video card in that old computer used an S3 Trio, and so the drivers are already in place.
VirtualPC is better than VirtualBox in this regard, because VPC emulates older hardware, for which Windows3 drivers are available (or even, ever created).
In any case, I simply do not remember how installing replacement drivers worked -- perhaps rerunning SETUP.EXE
Once you can boot the the disk to DOS and try to start Windows, the main problem you will run into is driver support; that is, the emulated virtual hardware is different than the actual hardware in the old computer.
