Although the files are being "deleted", as i mentioned, they are actually being moved to a different location on the file system... ie a Trash directory or something.
When you delete the file it just removes the listing from the directory but not the file itself.
I'm not even sure what to google to learn more about it.
That's a FAQ for Linux/Unix file system operations: "'df' command says partition is full, while 'du' reports free space" (see e.g.
I've noticed that on non-windows OS.... ie linux/mac i can do things like:
Note that a consequence of this is that the space occupied by a file can only be reclaimed once the last process using it has closed it.
As explained by Matt Jenkins, the OS (the filesystem) keeps track of files that are kept open by applications.
The programs that still have the file open can still access it.
link above will give you a starting point for more reading - see especially the "Link counter" section.
Also, with moving the file - if it's within the same filesystem - the file doesn't actually move as such, it just changes the pointer to the directory the file is in.
So it seems to me like the OS uses a pointer @ the file that is updated when it moves rather than accessing the files directly.
When the last one is removed, the file's space is freed.

If you need to free up space, it's not enough to delete big files (e.g.
- the movie still plays to completion (read from disk, not just buffered in memory)
As long as a process keeps a file open, its data stays on disk (even though it has been deleted and is no longer visible or accessible to other programs.
Can anyone shed some light on how this AWESOME capability is actually implemented?
logfiles), you must also make sure no process keeps them open (typically a problem with logfiles).
The file is only actually deleted when all the programs that are accessing it close it.
In unix file systems, a file can have one or more hard links to it.
The file maintains a list of references - processes that are accessing the file.
