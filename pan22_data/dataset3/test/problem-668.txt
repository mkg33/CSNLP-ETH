If you use slot 9a for signing, then the card will permit further signing until the card is powered down or removed.
The YubiKey tools do not enforce any kind of restrictions or limitations on the keys or certificates in particular slots.
It's intended to be able to be used for system login, followed by any number of web browser sessions.
Using that slot would enable any application to sign without user interaction.
As most guides with YubiKeys are intended to support authentication (rather than encryption or signing), they tend to use slot 9a.
9e does not require authentication, and is intended for things like door locks.
9a, being intended for authentication, only requires that the PIN be entered once.
Escrow is generally not a desirable property for authentication, as it leads to the possibility of impersonation.
9d functions similarly to 9a, though it is intended for encryption, rather than authentication.
The largest difference between the various slots is the PIN policy applied to them.
9c, on the other hand, requires a PIN to be entered for each transaction.
Having separate slots makes it possible to do things like have an authentication cert in 9a (with the key generated on the card), and encryption in 9c (with the key loaded to the card, and escrowed elsewhere in case the card is lost).
It is a very good property for encryption (as it means that the files are not all lost in the event the card is locked, lost, or damaged, or the employee leaves the employer).
In short, slot 9c is in fact the correct slot for code signing.
