They expire, so the next time it happens, check allocations to see if you have any doubles.
If these questions are all foreign to you, we can start more basically... what is the output of the command "ipconfig /all" on a machine that is working properly?
If so, you'll have some fun reading to do on dhcp lease expiration (I'm sure there are a few questions here detailing the broad strokes)
Expand the DHCP range on your server and you should be fine.
It is probably that your DHCP server is not setup to give out enough IP addresses.
Is it a Windows server of some type, or is it your router?
ie, one of the machines that you do NOT have to futz with every couple of days...
Do you have multiple dhcp addresses for systems that require static addresses?
Most DHCP servers will detect this and diable the address from being given out again.
Post it back, and I'll give you some more to troubleshoot with.
Also make sure your DHCP range is not overlapping with addresses that are statically configured.
I'm betting it is your router, because it sounds like the router is blocking access from IP addresses that it has not asigned, or that are outside its range.
If your have no or bad IP documentation I recommend you download the nmap utility and run it like this (assuming you use 192.168.0.0/24 network)
