the installation process does not wait for user to provide input.
Issue: 'read' is not working in the %post section ie.
I wrote the exact same lines of %post section above for "postint" section of building a .deb package and it worked fine there.
It basically completes the installation by placing files in the directories.
In such cases, or if the user runs a graphical RPM tool, any information your scripts output will be lost.
Situation: I'm trying to build a custom rpm to place a config file in a particular location.
User installing the deb package was able to make the input and this given value was placed in the config file with 'sed'.
In short, the %post section is not being interactive for user to provide input.
This read value is to be placed in those config files with help of 'sed'.
A user from "Unix and Linux" contributed this answer:
This section echoes user to make an input and 'reads' it.
The installation completes fine by placing config files in proper directories but the %post section is not working.
