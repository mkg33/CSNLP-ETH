If you want to learn, rather learn with the stuff your employees / customers will use, you know.
I would like to have these based on Linux if at all possible...
Seriously - using Windows all those are OS roles, there is nothing against installing them on one server.
dnsmasq is good for DNS/DHCP (lots of routers use it), Zimbra is a decent mail system (now owned by VMWare), and RT is a decent ticket system.
Using Linux is great - avoids some overhead, small.
If you have the hardware for it, I'd recommend using VMWare ESXi to host the VMs - you'll need a supported hardware RAID controller, but the OS overhead is incredibly small.
- The OS is heavily wizzard driven to make tasks simpler.
I'm trying to set up a little "Small Office" scenario on a bunch of VMs to experiment with actually being in IT, sort of a testing grounds to try out different things.
Especially as most are not using any load / memory worth mentioning.
What about fault tolerance, how can I specify more than one authentication / DHCP / mail server?
FIrst, a file server in a small office normally has no IO worth mentioning - small office != many people using it, it basically does nothing most of the time.
Incidentally enough it has 8 discs on a hardware RAID - the file server section serves files from a 4x500gb RAID 5.
I never was so far in a business where I was put in front of a Linux based workstation.
Question is a bit vague but LVS is probably the answer.
It provides: Domain Controller, DHCP/DNS, File serving, Exchange (Microsoft's Email Server) and much more all under one package.
No - you're not really improving security greatly by doing this.
I'm just trying to get together the best tools for the job, and what I'd imagine a typical business environment would need...
It would be best to store all of these in separate VMs to isolate them in case something wrong awfully wrong / gets hacked, right?
I'm a windows server tech so I couldnt tell you too much about *nix systems.
But totally useless in pretty much 80% of the real businesses which somehow do rely on windows.
Not a big impact - as long as you implement any software raid/volume management on the host box rather than the virtual box.
- simply not worth the effort in the real world, especially office side (something else for internet facing DNS).
If you are looking for a beginning into the world of Windows Server, it may be worth looking at Microsoft's small buisness server.
), and for image backup and maintenance I could use Amanda Open Source Backup...
To start up a basic small office server I would need:
Would it be a good idea virtualizing file server due to the hit in I/O if the HDDs are on that same machine?
I'd recommend having a look at something like GoSA for directory services rtather than starting with local authentication then trying to hack into a more scalable solution later.
I hear webmin is great for maintaining it (aside form the actual command line) and with samba I could setup the file server, Kerberos / Samba for user authentication and login, Linux as a DHCP / DNS Server, not really sure what I could use for the jabber / irc / mail servers, ticket tracker (no idea!
I am a big fan for virtualization, but I would not isolate my office DHCP / DNS server from a domain controller etc.
Personally I'd go for a database server (with ODBC access - postgreSQL?)
I have one core machine here in the office running:
So many questions buzzing around in my head :P  If anyone could answer them, I would be grateful, thanks!
I assume all that would either be done on the client, or the domain controller?
I'm not sure how Samba fares with Windows 7; you may be better off with Windows 2008 Server.
It also lets you allocate resources to each VM, create snapshots, etc.
Getting usable skills - how do you transfer that to a real windows environment?
