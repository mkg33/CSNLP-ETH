Be careful with ntpdate or rdate, it's usually not a wise idea to move the time the hard way, as many server applications depend on a continuous time.
You needn't do any fancy host-guest syncing, because the server is just .. on the net.
If you install the NTP daemon on your Linux guest as a client, it will periodically check and make sure your clocks do not drift in the long run.
For instance, it is specifically recommended not to use the vmware-tools timesync feature anymore.
There's an answer which is already selected (and it is the best answer, since vmware tools gives you so many other advantages), but another option is also to run regular ntpdate commands in the cron.
Long Answer: VMware has a best practices doc that is pretty good on this,
Dovecot for instance, will just quit if it detects a large shift of time.
This corrects your clock, however doesn't manage clock drift, but works in a pinch.

Note that it is somewhat contrary to some of the information in this thread.
Short Answer: proper kernel parameters and ntpd config
