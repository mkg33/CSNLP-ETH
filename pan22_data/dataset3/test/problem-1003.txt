Once you start typing your password, you can see a settings gear pop up next to the Login button.
I cannot login with any other user because i don't have any other and login with root isn't allows.
Then type reboot to restart your computer and get back to the login screen.
The standard gnome won't work on mine but the Gnome on Xorg option works fine.
I didn't have any password on my account so used to hit enter to login but now it just reloads the same login screen again.
For me it was a few lines that had tmux start automatically with a new terminal window.
If you click it, you can choose what desktop to use.
I had the same problem and it turns out my .bashrc was the culprit.
Hope this helps anyone who had the same problem as me.
I just rebooted my system after a week and now whenever i boot it up i am directed to the same login screen however i can no longer log in.
*** having trouble with this, then do it as root and change ownership to the user.
To fix it, from the login screen I hit Ctrl+Alt+F2 to get to terminal, then vi ~/.bashrc and comment out anything you think could be causing a problem.
Moreover whenever i try to log in through terminal with root, it shows the last login time for an instant and then restart the session and asks me for my password again.
