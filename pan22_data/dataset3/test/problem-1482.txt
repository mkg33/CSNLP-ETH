If you log in via a normal RDP session it's as if you logged into the server.
You don’t want to log into a new session and start a second copy of the backup application; you want to monitor the backup application running in the console session.
If you connect to the console you are effectively looking over the shoulder of whoever logged in at the keyboard connected to the server.
On one server I RDP into I see a totally different desktop if I connect to a console session or connect via a normal RDP session.
Think of the console as the monitor, keyboard and mouse physically connected to the server.
Apart from being able to take over applications that are already running in that session, it is also sometimes required to install certain software (like PostgreSQL) that will not allow installation through a regular session.
You will get the desktop, and start menu for your profile.
A typical example might be a backup application that is running on the console.
The console session is what you see when you look at a monitor that’s plugged into the server.
The big difference is the services and applications that are running when you connect to the console versus connecting via a normal RDP session - you may have different applications in your Startup folder or different services starting up automatically.
Often the desktop and start menu you see for the console is similar to the desktop and start menu you see when you log in.
Normally with RDP you get your own session that is not the same as what’s shown on the server’s own monitor.
It's indeed the existing, current session on the server, the same you would see when looking at a screen that is attached to that server.
You're seeing their logged in session, with whatever applications they are running.
