As suggested above use nLite in order to prepare an updated XP iso or dvd.
A good basis for building your "perfect" xp installer is pre-SP4 project:
I think the best you can do is install the latest xp service pack and visual studio service packs and then use windows updates to grab the updates released since then.
You could grab each hotfix/update separately as well if you wanted, but that is probably a lot of work.
I think you have to get the packages manually and save them somewhere.
However a lot of hotfixes won't be integrated, so you will have to run a batch to finish the job.
I think you'll need xp service pack 2 and xp service pack 3.
I'd have thought setting windows update to autiomatic and just letting it go through and update woulod be the easiest
You need to download the offline install packages.
IMHO,  it is possible to reuse updates already downloaded, but, although their files are expanded on c:\windows\softwaredistribution\download, one must find a way to recover installation scripts and install order to know what to do with them.
Apart from slipstreaming sp3 you can also integrate some hotfixes or even microsoft programs,
