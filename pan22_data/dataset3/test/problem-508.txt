I provide no guarantee that a full listen queue is actually your problem, but this is a good first thing to check.
Try setting num to something larger than the default, like 1024.
I just discovered that Linux TCP clients change their SYN packet after 3 tries, and remove the Window Scaling option.
To carry on what Ansis has stated, I've seen issues like this when the firewall doesn't support TCP Windows Scaling.
Ngnix allows the backlog argument to listen to be set in the configuration:
The client was behind a veth and running ethtool -K veth0 rx off tx off did the trick.
I guess the kernel developers figured that this is a common cause of connection failure in the Internet
It explains why these clients manage to connect after 11 seconds ( the window-less TCP SYN happens after 9 seconds in my brief test with default settings )
I had a similar problem, but in my case it was the TCP checksum that was wrongly computed.
This is the behavior of a listening TCP socket when its backlog is full.
What make/model firewall is between these two hosts?
