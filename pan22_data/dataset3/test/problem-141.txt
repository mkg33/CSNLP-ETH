If its not already in a public folder, move it there and keep it on the Exchange server.
Finally, PSTs have no place on a file server in the first place.
I ask only because storage is relatively cheap, and by keeping it on a properly backed-up Exchange server the data is in a much safer place...
This is often noticed if backup software attempts to back up an open PST file.
There's also a blog post from the Windows performance team on the topic here.
Why do you need to move it off the Exchange server?
I can't test this right now, but what if you placed the PST in a read-only folder?
This assumes they only need to read from it and not update anything.
So your users would be forced to exit and restart Outlook every time they are done with the PST file.
While it is possible to open a PST file from the File menu and then close if by right-clicking it in the folder list, Outlook does not release the lock until Outlook exits.
So unless everyone wants to close and then re-open Outlook every time they are done, that's not really going to work either.
As stated in KB297019, PSTs are designed to be accessed locally and accessing them over the network causes a significant amount of overhead, potentially slowing down your network, and definitely slowing down the end-user experience.
The suggestions for placing it in a read-only location are guaranteed to fail.
Alternatively, if only one can have it open at a time, would different users opening it and closing it technically work if they remembered to close it when they were done.
If its just information that needs to be referenced, you may want to look at exporting the mail items to RTF or some other document format and then leave those on a file server.
Your other idea, letting users open and close it as needed is going to result in your users hating you.
Fortunately or unfortunately the answer is no - Outlook does an exclusive lock on the PST - even if its marked as read-only.
PST files cannot be shared in the way you describe.
This should prevent outlook from creating the file lock which may allow more then one person to open it.
Outlook will report a lack of permissions if it is unable to acquire a read-write lock on the file.
The idea being to get some old stuff off of the Exchange server that a couple people would still need to view...
When Outlook locks the PST file, nothing else can open the file at all.
I am guessing the answer is no, but can multiple outlook users use the same PST file at the same time from a file server?
Outlook only releases the lock when the user closes Outlook.
They'll likely get weird errors but it might work.
