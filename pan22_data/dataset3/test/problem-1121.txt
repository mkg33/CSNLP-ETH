In this way, if core A goes down, core B is still physically connected to all servers and edge switches keeping data flowing without interruption.
Under the proposed design, if an edge switch has a problem, only devices connected to that switch will be affected.
I thought that if a switch in a stack has a problem, the other switches could still "work around" it.
A few different designs have been proposed, and one such design puts our core switches at the heart of our network in such a way that even if one goes down completely, the other can carry on.
The idea is that there are 2 core switches, and 6 edge switches (to connect all of our endpoints).
What is the probability of a switch backplane having an issue as compared to a standard ethernet port?
My assumption was that we were going to stack the 6 edge devices, at the very least, and run a few lines of fiber using those mini-gBIC adapters to the cores... but I'm being told that if we stack all 6 edge switches and there is a problem with the backplane then all 6 switches are going to go "down".
Can't we just stack those 6 edge switches, and run two fiber lines via some mini gbic modules on one of them and call it a day?
Does this proposal make sense and REALLY provide the redundancy it assumes?
All of our servers would connect to both the cores, and each of our 6 edge switches would connect to both the cores.
We are in the midst of planning a re-cabling of the building and installing new switches.
The proposed design trunks various RJ45 ports, citing the backplane as a single point of failure.
