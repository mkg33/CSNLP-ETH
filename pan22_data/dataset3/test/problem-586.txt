It's a large-scale storage solution with no single point of failure, and rather than backing the system as a whole up, has multiple copies of the data scattered around the cluster.
If someone can maliciously or accidentally trash all your backups, because they're all online and accessible via the network, your backups weren't really backups.
Thumbnails that could be easily recreated may only have 1 or 2 copies, but the original pictures might have more - according to the class of data that file belonged to.
RAID protects you from equipment failure, but not disaster.
Individual drives (or spindles) could fail, but the more important a file is, the more copies of it would exist around the cluster.
Something like MogileFS would be able to help in this instance.
I'd get external drives or setup a backup server with something like BackupPC and then rotate the disks and store at least one copy off-site.
Similar techniques are used by Google and Facebook to store their own files.
Say it with me, and repeat it to yourself again and again.
Whatever you do, having a backup kept offline is essential.
