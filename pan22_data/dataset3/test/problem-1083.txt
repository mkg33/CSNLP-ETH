And should I include the root certificate in the chain or not?
However, when I connect to the server using openssl s_client -connect mail.example.com:25 -starttls smtp I get the following output, which seems to indicate that something is wrong:
I bought a certicifate for my mail server and configured it in Postfix like so:
I have tried adding the AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt to the end of chain.crt which makes the error message change to verify error:num=19:self signed certificate in certificate chain.
I created chain.crt per Postfix instructions by concatenating my certificate and the two intermediate CA certs.
Also, when running openssl verify chain.crt I get the same error message:
(To be precise, my own cert first, then COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt and then COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt) According to the logs, most connections to my mail server are now encrypted so everything seems to work.
So my question is: Is there something wrong with my mailserver or am I just using the openssl command incorrectly?
Besides, the machine I'm connecting from already has this certificate installed so there should be no need for it.
