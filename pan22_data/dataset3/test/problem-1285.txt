But then again I don't update drivers on a regular basis so I'm usually pretty clear whether it's drivers or not.
Press Ctrl-Shift-Esc to start Windows Task Manager.
I realized that it only hung when the network card was active, such as browsing the web or itunes checking for new podcasts (which explains why I thought itunes was the culprit).
If you're running Windows Automatic Update, it's always possible that a new patch has done something and you're one of the unlucky ones to suffer deleterious effects.
You can have problems where you PC seems to hang, but it's nothing to do with CPU or hard drive blocking; I hate these problems, because they don't show up on Windows' radar.
These type of problems are usually hard to diagnose.
Recent applications you install that install device drivers are top candidates.
Falling back to a previous backup whether through System Restore or personal backup should also be tried to see if the problem disappears.
Switch to the Processes tab, and see what's using up a lot of CPU during the freezes.
Boot/Startup problems can usually be traced to a driver.
Firewalls and device drivers can do this sort of thing.
64-bit does have more compatibility problems than 32-bit, but I don't know if there's any way to verify this to be the cause other than going to 32-bit or checking forums for 64-bit problems in relation to hardware drivers.
Personal experiences with Safe Mode have been bad - I've never fixed problems with Safe Mode (just the once I screwed up the display config and Safe Mode saved me).
a simpler but less comprehensive option is to use Process Explorer:
These kind of problems tend to require a careful investigation and I must admit I have had problems where I gave up and just changed hardware/did re-installs.
If that isn't helpful, do the same for disk access.
I believe that my wireless network adapter's driver was out of date, possibly so much so that it wasn't compatible with windows 7.
it's not exactly easy, but xperf will give you the information you need if you can dig deep enough:
Have not had the problem again since I installed the latest driver.
If it doesn't then OMG, it's time to check the hardware...
These are often low-level operations messing around with Windows' internal conversations.

Meaning, it's most probably the cause of your troubles.
