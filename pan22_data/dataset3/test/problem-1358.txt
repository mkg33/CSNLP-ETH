I am working on a client platform which has RHEL 5.0 OS installed with kernel version 2.6.34.12 .
See if you can update some things as you should not be running RHEL 5.0 any more due to millions of critical patches to it!
But on remote signal reception, Its not even entering rc script which calls to change the runlevel.
The functionality is working fine when reboot command is issued from system.
Now I have no idea where can there be the issue, where should I see?
I tried to enter runlevel 0 manually bu applying telinit 0.
As this is RHEL you can run sos and raise that with RHEL support.
There is a chance that IPMI have some bugs or you are sending a wrong signal.
I thought this might be an IPMI related problem, as it is the one which gets the signal and do es the needful.
In /var/log/messages found that IPMI drivers are initializing properly.
The issue I am facing is that when this system gets a poweroff signal from remote server, it gets shutdown directly without entering into runlevel 0 .
