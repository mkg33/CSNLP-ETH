like on a Dell MegaRAID once, I told it to skip initializing, but it initialized anyway, destroying the data).
If you create a new VD now, your existing RAID configuration likely still stored on the disks will be wiped out.
If MHDD has not altered any data on your disks, all that might have happened is that your disks are in "Foreign" state now after the Matrix POST routines ran without any disks connected and might have deleted the array from its configuration altogether.
You should be able to use the "Scan Devices" option in the BIOS console to get the foreign VD listed, offering an option to import it.
Simply re-creating a new VD would require the order of the physical disks in your RAID5 set right - something you probably cannot guarantee.
if you have it running, and then a bad cable causes a disk to disconnect, and then reconnect again, it might decide it's now a foreign disk.
Both, WD and Seagate, offer a decent set of utilities to diagnose possible disk problems in a non-destructive way.
It is a general procedure that works with any hw or soft raid.
with mdadm, write "missing" instead of "/dev/sdx" for one disk).
For softraid, you might be able to skip the silly blank disk steps (eg.
You can do a dangerous recovery procedure to recover from this type of failure.
Why didn't you stick with the disk manufacturer's diagnostic suite?
And also as a hwraid hater, I can't resist saying that hwraid can be very annoying, and having it just decide that some disks are "foreign" is totally normal behavior in some badly handled failure cases.
One hard drive failed, but all data are accessible.
If it's wrong, it might be damaged now and harder to recover than before (like if metadata/superblock was written in a different place than before, this time over data), but in theory you can just retry again.
And on MegaRAID machines, I found it will always do this if you swap some disks, then boot, then swap them back.
After scan all hard drive with MHDD (disconnecting and connecting to another computer) the RAID show three hard drive as non member and one as RAID 5 failed array.
This is dangerous mostly if you make errors, or if your firmware is not flexible enough (eg.
Main problem is that before failure - array was in rebuilding state.
Apart from that, I do not know MHDD, but what I am seeing in my Google search results, does not look any good.
And if this data is important, be sure to have backups first.
An ancient DOS program implementing its own driver?
I tried with TestDisk but it can't read 1TB partition.
Unlike softraid, it seems to care about the order even for an existing array.
If someone can think of an equivalent that applies to hwraid, that would be very valuable.
At that point it should be working like before... assuming you got lucky and your old hw and firmware is equivalent, old setup was understood and recreated properly, etc..
- 1 TB - RAID 5 with 3 hard drive  (System D partition)
And it's easier to use a read only + rw overlay image file to make it possible to retry and fail repeatedly without damaging things.
I don't know why - I don't run these drive on other computer with other operating system - only MHDD.
