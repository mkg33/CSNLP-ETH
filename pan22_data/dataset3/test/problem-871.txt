They also need to use the computers graphics card (for Photoshop, modeling, etc) under Windows.
Does the choice of software (VMware or VirtualBox) effect the choice?
This is going to give you the best Guest OS graphics performance.
In my experience, if you need to utilize advanced hardware fully (especially graphics cards) you should do so with the host OS.
The other "server" virtualization solutions aren't going to do much for running Photoshop in the guest other than give you the ability to do it with the virtualized graphics drivers.
Agreed with everyone else, and also slightly puzzled about your "cluttered and slow" registry comment.
I'm somewhat worried about Windows getting a cluttered registry and slow, but on the otherhand, a Windows host would have direct access to hardware (Unless I'm just unaware of how to grant hardware access to a guest).
You would probably need to go with the Windows host.
I've little knowledge on these pieces of software myself, but a little research can go a long way.
"Cluttered and slow" registries died out with Windows 98, if they ever even existed in the first place.
However, if you want to have a little fun, you can PCIe passthrough a discrete video card with other virtualization software.
I'm looking to deploy several virtual machines for users.
Whatever are you or your users doing that could cause this?
My question is, will an Ubuntu host/Windows guest or a Windows host/Ubuntu guest be faster?
While some virtual machines have the ability to "pass through" pieces of hardware for use with the guest OS only, I've only seen it done with USB ports - not sure it's workable with the graphics card.
