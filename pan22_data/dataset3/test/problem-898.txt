Without knowing more about your setup, its not possible to advise exactly, however if it is mounted and part of your tree, copy the data from it into a temporary directory, then umount it and move the data from the temporary space to where it belongs (Luckily there is not much data there).
Then, you can extend sda2's partition into the newly "unallocated" space.
You probably also want to create a swap file or a swap partition.
Deleting the linux-swap partition is not a major, and can be done by simply turning off swap and deleting it (swapoff -a) - however /dev/sda5 may provide a bigger challenge.
/dev/sda4 is an extended partition with 2 partitions in it.
You also need to go to /etc/fstab and remove / update the mounts as appropriate.
You can only grow a partition if there is adjacent unallocated space immediately after the partition.
Once you have created the swap area, format it with mkswap /dev/sdX or mkswap /path/to/file.
You need to do a similar thing to move the contents of /dev/sda3 into /dev/sda2.
Once you have removed the contents of /dev/sda3 and sda5, and removed swap, you can delete these partitions, and recreate a larger partition for /dev/sda3.
Unfortunately this is not easy, and indeed I believe that earlier posts are wrong in 1 crucial way.
You need unallocated space after or before a partition to extend into.
Disable swap, delete the swap partition, then grow the Extended partition, then grow the sda3 partition and filesystem, then re-create swap.
The first thing you need to do is delete BOTH of these partitions.
To do this, you can simply move sda4, then sda3 further down the drive.
