IMAP really is the way to go, as it will 'sync' changes between the devices.
He gets his emails through Outlook and thanks to some obscure, long forgotten reason, HostPapa's mail server does not receive any email and forwards any received mail straight to the Outlook client.
My dad recently purchased a Nexus S smartphone running Android 2.3.3.
With POP, if he sends an email from the phone, for example, it will not show up as sent in Outlook, and vice versa.
If you are using POP3 to get your mail, Outlook is most likely removing the mail from the server after it downloads it.
He owns a construction company and wants to be in touch with his email on the go, which is precisely why he purchased the smartphone.
You will need to either tell Outlook to leave a copy on the server, or switch both over to IMAP, assuming the host supports it.
If you need any extra details, I shall be happy to provide them.
I tried to set his email account, which comes from HostPapa, on his phone, but it doesn't receive any email.
