Most SSH clients have a built in file-transfer ability.
ftp is regarded as an insecure protocol because it sends the password in clear text rather than in encrypted form like other protocols provide.
I mean, my computer does not belong to any network from which some other networked computer could listen on my traffic to steal my username & password, right ?
If you have no choice but use plain FTP then tbh I wouldn't worry too much about someone somehow sniffing your traffic (assuming you're using an encrypted connection to your router if you're using wireless), but I would make the password as strong as possible and make it unique so if it's compromised only your web host access is compromised.
If it's going over the internet (which it is) then if it's being transmitted in plain text (which for plain ftp it is) then it's insecure.
My question is: if I connect to my web host from my home computer (which consists of 1 computer and 1 router with direct connection to the internet); would this still be insecure ?
the network that exists between each hop between your pc and your ftp server allows for a possible sniffing point for someone (or gov't agency) to see your cleartext credentials without your knowledge.
If your server is remote, then your credentials are moving unencrypted through many other devices before reaching it, as they are going across the Internet, which is the ultimate (inter)network.
There are a couple of free hosts out there that provide SSH to their service.
The fact that your home computer isn't connected to a network (other than your router) doesn't make any difference.
Does your webhost provide any other means of connecting to it, for example, via SSH?
If it is your own host, consider setting up your own ssh server (Linux and Mac operating systems have an SSH server usually built right in or, use http://www.freesshd.com/ for Windows).
This might be a question to ask your host if you are concerned about security.
Yes, anything over the internet that doesn't have a layer of security (for example, you use a secure VPN) is not secure.
