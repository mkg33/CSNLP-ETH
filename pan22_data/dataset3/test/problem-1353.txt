 In the exclude file are some folders, including /root/backup/
(I use some vars for the options, but for clarity replaced by the strings.
As I mentioned, for simplicity I put that part on the commandline.
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] cL+++++++++ root/+"%Y%m%d").log/vmlinuz -> boot/vmlin
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] >f+++++++++ root/.bashrc
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] cd+++++++++ root/+"%Y%m%d").log/
I found some discussion about the exclude file, but maybe I misinterpred that, as it still tries to backup that folder.
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] >f+++++++++ lib/xtables/libxt_time.so
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] >f+++++++++ root/.profile
But in the command line I have the logfilename specified with a date format.
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] cL+++++++++ root/+"%Y%m%d").log/initrd.img.old -> boo
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] >f+++++++++ root/.bash_history
In this version I put the date on the commandline, but initially I used the CURDATE - no difference.
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] >f+++++++++ root/20170403
All is ok, until it reaches the folder where the logfile resides.
It goes wrong exactly after backing up the file /root/xx, and that is exactly the point where the logfile is created.
I do not use the date elsewhere, I only use it once in the script to set the variable.
I shared a folder on the synology to /mnt/NAS2 on my server
I have tried to do in the script as well, does not make any difference.)
Note: it is a test server, not on the net, just to test scripts before I use it on a live server:).
I expect that if I fix the logfilename, it will not happen.
For that reason I tried to exclude the backup folder, but that seems to be ignored.
I must do something obviously thing wrong... Hope I supplied enough info and did use the correct rules/indents, as it is first post on this forum.

I try to rsync to my synology where DSM 6.1 is installed.
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] cL+++++++++ root/+"%Y%m%d").log/initrd.img -> boot/in
So I guess it goes wrong because it tries to backup the logfile that it is writing to.
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] >f+++++++++ root/.selected_editor
BTW - using rsync with ssh to the synology seems a better option than backing up to a shared folder, but even after copying the key, using ssh-copy-id, the synology keeps asking for password, so that is another challange.
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] cL+++++++++ lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 -> /lib/x86_64
2017/04/03 20:51:09 [1669] >f+++++++++ lib/xtables/libxt_u32.so
It creates a folder witha that name and it looks like rsync is copying everything in that folder, including the strange foldername, over and over again.
