But I would like a practical explanation what could happen if I leave those two out.
For what it's worth, I don't use these parameters often... only on public facing systems where there are other compliance considerations.
Often also with noexec but I'm specifically interested in nodev and nosuid.
But the reasoning for more security-focused situations is as follows.
nosuid - Block the operation of suid, and sgid bits.
Let's say that I have configured tmpfs or ramfs(without these two mentioned options set) that is accessible(read+write) by a specific (non-root)user on the system.
Excluding the case of consuming all available system memory in case of ramfs
You don't have to follow this blindly as a hard rule.
And since I only see copy/paste instructions on the net regarding this, I ask here.
nodev - Don't interpret block special devices on the filesystem.
I see those two options constantly suggested on the web when someone describes how to mount a tmpfs or ramfs.
I basically hate just blindly repeating what somebody suggested, without real understanding.
