All of the environment variables are properly set (copied from installation guide)
Set any Oracle globalization variables required for your locale.
After the installation the environment needs to be configured in the following way.
As far as I understand Oracle ignores system language related variables but here they are anyway:
I now have updated PATH (including the bin directory for Instant Client) and this solved the problem.
This search path includes looking in the directory $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora.
I've installed Oracle XE 11.2 on Fedora 18 but have trouble starting SQLPlus.
Define the TNS_ADMIN environment variable to point the .ora files directory for OCI.
You need to export ORACLE_HOME to oracle home directory
Otherwise ODBC manager will be not able to load/find the driver.
Otherwise check to see if you can access the lib directory above.
Make sure Basic Instant Client is deployed before running the ODBC install script.
If ORACLE_HOME is not set, then looks in current directory for tnsnames.ora.
This is the only reason to set the ORACLE_HOME environment variable for Oracle Instant Client.
        For example, if Driver Manager is installed in /home/DriverManager directory
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH==/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/lib
Unzip the ODBC Instant Client package, then execute the odbc_update_ini.sh script with Driver Manager installed directory as a command line argument.
(For complete syntax, please run "odbc_update_ini.sh" without any command line argument.)
If TNS_ADMIN is not set, OCI will examine an operating system dependent set of directories to find tnsnames.ora.
I just deployed Instant Client in a directory and after updating LD_LIBRARY_PATH (including the lib directory of Instant Client) and ORACLE_HOME I was facing the same issue.
See the Oracle Database 11g Globalization Support Guide for more information.
Add the directory to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH system environment variable.
It will add the DSN entry in $HOME/.odbc.ini and /etc/odbcinst.ini with DSN name as OracleODBC-11g
If ORACLE_HOME is set when running Instant Client applications, it must be set to a directory where Instant Client exists (in this case C:\Oracle\instantclient_11_2).
This error usually occurs if you are executing sqlplus as a different user (other than the one which installed Oracle software), due to permission issues
And sometimes following Oracle documentation solves quite some hassle.
