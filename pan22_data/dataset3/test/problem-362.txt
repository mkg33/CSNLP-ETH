Having used both extensively with different clients, I can say that mozy offers a superior product overall, with far better CS and a lot more control over how it operates.
This runs an agent that continually backs up your data, and has a very easy restore-entire-server-to-bare-metal feature.
After the initial copy is complete, you can run svnsync regularly to copy all incremental changes over, so its fast.
Its easy to use it - create a repo on the backup server, initialise it, then sync it.
You need to have a hardware device in your workplace, which may be overkill for you, but you don't need to install any client software.
You don't need to be logged in, and you can sync from the backup server - to pull changes from the live repo, or from the subversion server - to push changes to the backup.
Google 'subversion hosting' for quite a few online hosts.
If you want to backup a subversion repository, there's only 1 thing you need - svnsync.
If it was free it'd be the perfect backup solution :)
(I run it hourly, but I'm just perverse like that).
If you have some budget for this, you might want to take a look at Axcient's service - in the interests of full disclosure, I know the guys there and think they have a really good approach.
You just need a server to backup to - any of the commercial subversion hosts will do for this, a backup repo is exactly the same as an other subversion repo, and to use it if the live server dies, just requires you to "svn relocate" to the backup repo url.
If the backup server is not present, the next time svnsync runs it will grab all the changes, so you don't have to worry at all.
There is Records Management & Archiving in the US, similar services to Iron Mountain, but cheaper.
Just to comment on the Carbonite part of your question - yes, it suffers from the same failing.
In fact, its so fast that most people place the command to run it in their post-commit and post-revprop-change hooks.
Symantec has an online storage offering available at http://www.spn.com that's designed with servers in mind.
So the backup server is always completely up to date.
