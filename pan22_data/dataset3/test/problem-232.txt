Anyhow, to execute your chosen solution: Configure the interfaces connected to the switch to be within one network, e.g.
Now your clients on this router must be in 192.168.200.0/24 also.
Now your clients can talk to your router and to other clients in 192.168.200.0/24 on layer 3.
From your last comment I take it you try to build a WLAN network.
Now the routers can talk to each other on layer 3.
With the right equipment (which you should have if you have 2000 users) this would still be only one network.
Please note that if you are thinking about providing services from one network for the others, your routers must provide DNAT (ie.
To get internet access configure the router with the WAN connection to be the default gateway of the other routers.
(This is not strictly necessary but I think it makes things easier to grasp.)
Maybe you would be best served, if you try to build this in a simulated environment with http://www.gns3.net/ or the https://www.netacad.com/web/about-us/cisco-packet-tracer
Repeat this step for all routers but choose different networks, e.g.
Set the router as the default gateway for your clients in the respective networks and the traffic from one network can route to the other networks and vice versa.
Configure the other interface (or interfaces) to be within another network, e.g.
