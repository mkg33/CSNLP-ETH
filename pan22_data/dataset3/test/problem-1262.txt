Knowing that I set the maxconn parameter in the server definition line of backend configuration in haproxy.cfg file to 1, but the server still gets queries because I see in our server's log messages like "query rejected, already processing" and also in the HAProxy log queries that return to the client with a 502 http status code.
I've read StackOverflow's questions where the maxconn is explained and how it works in the different sections that's why I'm asking this now, it shouldn't work like this.
Someone knows why the server instances get the queries when the maxconn parameter is set to one?
Take special note that during haproxy reload, there is a time frame in which two haproxy processes will use your resources, and each enforce connection limits on their own.
Make certain that there is no other process that has open connections to your service.
Therefor, it is quite possible that the new process and its clients contend for seats.
I'm using HAProxy in production to balance queries to a series of server instances that can only process 1 query at a time (by our own decision).
The finishing process will not terminate before all queues are drained.
