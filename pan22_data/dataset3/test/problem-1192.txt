Indeed, the whole purpose of using a game engine is to abstract the details away, so that you don't directly have to do any of that stuff.
So really, just use a good engine; don't bother yourself about the minor details.
Granted, it will still need to use DirectX to draw to the screen, but that would be more or less true for anything.
Allegro 4.x is probably the closest you're going to get to this.
It will also be custom code so if you hit any problems with it you won't be able to get help as easily.
In fact what you're talking about here is a software rasterizer, which is going to be orders of magnitude more complex than using a graphics API.
There's nothing inherently complex about using OpenGL or D3D to do 2D rendering.
Running without a graphics API is not necessarily simpler.
Second-part Answer: A simple 2D game is a fun way to learn.
This statement suggests that you equate software rendering to "simple".
You don't have to care about OpenGL or D3D code to use Allegro 5 or SFML; they handle all of that transparently.
