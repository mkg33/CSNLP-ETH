Every so often you run into a Portland address like 0205 SW Nebraska St.  A leading zero?
When the grid was set up, the N-S axis was defined by the Willamette river.
If I were you I'd give up hope of designing the ultimate system.
The solution was to add a leading zero, in effect a minus sign, with the numbers incrementing towards the East from the axis line.
While you're at it figure out how you're going to parse 1634 E N Fort Lane Ave.
It is useful to split up addresses into distinct fields, but you can never, EVER design for every possible pathological aberration of address formats and components the human brain can devise.
N-S streets are numbered incrementally East and West from this axis, and addresses on E-W streets are dictated by the N-S street number being the "hundred block" of the number (i.e.
If you do manage to parse an address, make sure you remember the order in which you found the various fields so you can reassemble it into something deliverable.
if your parser fails to handle an address, save it unparsed and flagged as such.
Throw in other countries and things get unmanageable very quickly for any approach that wants to parse every address.
You cannot cover all possibilities, and new ones will be created as humanity pushes into previously undeveloped land.
For the rest of the world, I'd probably try to abstract additional fields to cover 80-90% of what is likely to come up, and provide a set of uninterpreted fields that can handle everything else when necessary.
Every locality can have its quirks, and that's just in the US.
Everything to the East of the river was NE or SE, and West of the river NW or SW.  As the city grew south they ran into the inconvenient fact that the river meanders to the East, so projecting the axis South you have this problematic area that's on the "West" side of the river but East of the axis.
For US addresses, take a look at what the USPS has already done in address standardization, and remember to make the house_number column a varchar.
In Portland, OR, there are N-S and E-W axes that divide the city into NW, NE, SW and SE quadrants (as well as a N "quadrant", but I digress).
I spent 7 years developing software for a publishing company and one of the hardest problems we ever tackled was parsing street addresses in subscription lists.
a house on an E-W street between 11th and 12th avenues would have a number like 1123).
Now multiply that quirkiness by the number of different countries and areas with different historical customs for addresses... (Japan?
I was going to say that the most important field is going to be post code, but even that is not a given in many places.
This can be a fun and extremely frustrating endeavor but the key to sanity is to know when to quit trying and just store the input unparsed, or partially parsed with the original input as backup.
In Spain, the street number always comes after the street name and a comma, and many addresses contain a floor number ordinal, such as 1° or 3ª, along with abbreviations for "left" ("Izda" meaning left-hand-door after you get up the stairs), "right" ("Dcha") or other possibilities.
