What I'm asking here is what could the cause of this be?
I was convinced that the product is defective and I got it replaced immediately.
Think of the sound as when you put cold sausages on a barbecue (although the sizzling is not as extreme as this).
After the program loads the sizzling noise more or less stops, although it is audible if you put you ear next to the case in a quiet room.
When it is plugged in, it basically doesn't happen.
Please note it is NOT the hard drive nor is it the fan.
How should I troubleshoot it, and is it a problem at all?
When the battery is in power saving mode it doesn't happen very loudly, when it is in balanced mode it happens more, and when it is in performance mode it happens even when the laptop is completely idle.
Another piece of information is that this only happens when the laptop is on battery power.
I noticed that when I open a program, say google chrome, you can distinctly hear a sizzling noise coming from the somewhere on the motherboard.
Unfortunately the battery is sealed so I cannot take it out.
