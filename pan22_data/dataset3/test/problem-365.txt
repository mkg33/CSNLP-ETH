Think of it as lanes on a highway, the higher mbps (lanes) you have, the more data (cars) that can move on it at the same time without having to wait.
Regarding your question of maximum number of connections, this plays no role in it.
I know this may be a really noob question, but does 500mbps up & down mean I can successfully open 500 browser instances and allow 500 outgoing connections?
Also, data transfer over a network is measured in megaBITS, where data stored on disk is measured in megaBYTES.
If you want to know how many of a particular kind of connection you can make over that pipe, figure out how much bandwidth that one connection is using.
Mbps is the amount of bandwidth you can transfer data at over your ISP's network.
If having too many browser tabs open is slowing your computer down, it is more likely your computer is out of free memory (RAM).
This can seem confusing but all it means is that there are 8 bits in every byte.
Bandwidth is a measure of data per second, not of individual connections.
500/500mbps (megaBits per second) has a maximum transfer speed of approx 62.5 megaBytes in each direction.
You can have virtually unlimited connections, depending on what your workstation can handle.
Sending and receiving a ping request takes a minimal amount of bandwidth.
Mbps (lowercase 'b' = bits, uppercase 'B' = bytes).
Retrieving a complicated webpage with embedded ads and many graphics takes a lot more.
To make it more simple, I want to know the maximum outgoing connections I can get from a 500mbps connection.
It doesn't work the way you think it does because not every connection is equal in terms of data usage.
