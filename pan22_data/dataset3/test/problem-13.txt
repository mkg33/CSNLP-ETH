You're example would be re-written as such : ( /etc/apache2/macro.d/drupal.vhost.conf (
Use m4/sed/ruby/python to substitute variables in your files.
Alternatively, if most of your vhosts are following similar templates, you could use mod_macro.
Just don't reinvent the wheel again writing your own configuration management tool (who hasn't done this yet, btw?
For each virtuahost I have a conf file which looks like this:
I've recently set this up for an apache installation with 200+ similar vhosts and it's working like a charm.
Using the macro : ( /etc/apache2/sites-available/drupal.sites.conf )
How can I specify myDomain in a single place and re-use this string.
have a look at configuration management tools like Puppet or Chef.
These will allow you to define configuration file templates and rebuild them when you make any changes to the setting.
You then can define generic settings such as domain name and reuse it in your templates.
However, if you have amny such parameters that you want to set, then a template-based approach can do.
Downside is that you must have a process to regenerate the files when you change something but that can be automated.
These tools would then deploy new configuration and restart your web services.
You'll have to use some other process to generate the apache config files.
The idea being that I specify the domain one at the top of the file so to avoid any mistakes further down.
