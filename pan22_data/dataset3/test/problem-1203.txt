A few other notes on texture "atlases" as they're usually called, or sprite sheets.
Be nice to your graphics card, use a power of two, your texture cache will thank you.
You could round them to the next power of two (or any other size, but powers of two are always convenient) and collect all of the same power of two in a single sprite sheet.
The reasoning behind this is that any kind of filtering will blur one texture/sprite into the next.
If you really must use filtering, ensure that you leave a gutter area around each image to account for the filtering.
Most of the time they just inflate the texture to the nearest power of two in the driver underneath you.
It can be very useful though to pack often used textures near to each other to minimize cache thrashing and texture cache use!
The trick here is to extend the last pixel into the gutter area so that any filtering (or averaging) will average the same colour as the last colour in the actual texture.
Yes, all the graphics cards now support non power of two textures.
But in reality, a simple "left" until it wont fit, then "down" works surprisingly well, especially with regularly(ish) sized textures.
If you use a black (or other solid colour) as a gutter region, you will be in some very weird averaging.
