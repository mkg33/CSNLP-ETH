I've looked into unRAID and that seems to offer what I am looking for but I want to know what my other options are since I'm sure there are a few things that I'm missing.
I was wondering if any other NAS units provide the ability to mix and match drive size and still have one growing pool size.
Also are there custom solutions which give me what I'm looking for?
Unlike the drobo however it would be nice that if the device fails I could shove the drives in a replacement to get the data back.
That is a non-starter for me since it is a single point of failure, just moved from the drives to the Drobo, which should fail less often than drives but it is a piece of electronics so it will fail.
I've been looking at Drobo units lately, and the ability to just add in a drive of any size and have the useable size of the array grow seems really nice to me.
What doesn't seem nice to me is that if the Drobo unit itself dies you lose access to all of the data on the drives and have to send it back to Drobo to get the data off apparently.
