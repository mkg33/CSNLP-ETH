No real issues (SEO snakeoil/voodoo non withstanding)  since lots of places use TLDS associated with other countries, etc.
Such as .io -- (British Indian Ocean Territory), .tv  -- (Tuvalu), .to,  -- (tonga).
For the most part each one has about the same sort of requirements as existing .tlds.
Most spiders tend to look at use doctype/codepage to determine language anyways.
This is part of the ICANN's new gtld program (http://newgtlds.icann.org/)  that allows companies to register their own gTlD.
They need to meet a bunch of requirements, and have to provide services.
Not really Since the the  DNS hierarchy, needs to be traversed, regardless of the tld.
Depending upon which .tld you choose, there might be a bit of delay is the TLD doesn't have great DNS servers providing their mapping, but most of them are run by big players, with globally diverse infrastructure (quick tests show goo.gl, resolving faster than google.com here, but they are totally arbitrary and non scientific (Basically dig +trace).
