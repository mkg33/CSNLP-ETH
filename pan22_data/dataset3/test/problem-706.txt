I don't believe their is a workaround in your scenario.
They then didn't understand why emails weren't being delivered to them.
The mail servers were canonicalising the fred@website.com into fred@www.website.com.
I want to be able to send email to any subdomain I like and not have to configure A records and MX records for each subdomain.
I have NOT setup A records for all the subdomains (and really don't want to).
..or else create a wildcard CNAME record pointing to the root, if it already has the correct entries.
If you have no other resource records of any kind for the subdomains, then a wildcard record will work just fine.
You can either set just the wildcard MX record, as well as an A record if you need it..
CNAMEs are re-written to the A record they point at by compliant mailservers (canonicalised) as they are explicitly banned in the RFC (see section 5.2.2):
Ideally I could send an email to test@a.domain.com and test@z.domain.com and not have to configure anything other than my original domain.com.
I had an issue at work where a client had misconfigured their DNS to have www.website.com as the A record and website.com as a CNAME.
I have a domain (domain.com) and want to have multiple subdomains.
I think you're going to need to set up an A records for each sub-domain, with the same IP address of your main domain.
I have an MX record setup to point to domain.com and all email works fine for that domain.
You can switch this behaviour off but then you aren't complying with the RFC then.
This should work as you described automatically if you have correctly set up MX records for the top level domain.com (and it is an A record) and your subdomains are CNAMEs pointing to this A record.
This assumes that the subdomains don't need different A records from one another, or maybe no A records at all - is this the case?
