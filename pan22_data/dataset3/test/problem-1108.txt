In column F in F2 write Soham, in F4 the formula modified (change $E$2 to $F$2)
I am assuming that the names are in row 1, and the price in C, split in D, and names start in E
Put this formula in E2, and copy to the other cells.
The formula checks for the word All at the beginning, and then divides the result by the number after the All (so if someone else joins, or someone leaves, just alter the number)
In column E in E2 write Subhajit, in E4 the formula above
After all the modification you can drag each formula down in the same column
=IF($E$2=$B4,"",IF($D4="All 4",$C4/4,IF(COUNTIF($D4,"*"&$E$2&"*")=1,IF($D4="Soham Subhajit and Subhradeep",$C4/3,IF($D4="Soham and Maiti",$C4/2,IF($D4="Subhajit and Subhradeep",$C4/2,""))),"")))
In column G in G2 write Subhradeep, in G4 the formula modified (change $E$2 to $G$2)
Two if statements and a requirement of keeping the AND between names.
If it's not all, then it counts the number of spaces, and this gives it the number of people to divide between - As it uses the names above columns to check if they should be paying, it allows you to rename or add/remove columns and still have the formula work
In column H in H2 write Maiti, in H4 the formula modified (change $E$2 to $H$2)
whenever you write a new name, price and choose split between
