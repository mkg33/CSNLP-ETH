SQL Server & Windows Documentation Using Windows PowerShell written by Kendal Van Dyke
Generally it is a lot of work writing down what it is all for, but a good idea for the long term, such as when you or some other poor soul comes back to update your creation a couple of years later!
SQL Power Doc is a collection of Windows PowerShell scripts and modules that discover, document, and diagnose SQL Server instances and their underlying Windows OS & machine configurations.
Just expand the database you connected to on SQL Management Studio and right click on "database diagrams" in the object explorer and select "New Database Diagram" to generate an interactive diagram which will show all the relationships between the different tables.
You can even specify which tables you want to include in the diagrams, so that the image does not get unweildly if you are just trying to document it piece by piece.
I also believe it should be easy for devs and DBA's to add these notes because as Tangurena and Nick Chammas correctly pointed out - devs are very reluctant to keep the docs updated and hate duplicate work - which is fair enough especially for a person who was taught to optimize things during their entire professional life.
Then we use a software name is Enterprise Architect to document Tables with all Indexes , Foreign Keys And Columns with Type and Description.
Indeed, Extended Properties (MS_Description) is the way to go.
So unless it's really easy to update docs in one place close to source code - this isn't gonna work.
ERD Diagrams (Database Diagrams) were always the most useful ones for my team
For Documenting sql server, I highly recommend just recently released :
SQL Power Doc works with all versions of SQL Server from SQL Server 2000 through 2012, and all versions of Windows Server and consumer Windows Operating Systems from Windows 2000 and Windows XP through Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8.

Having these descriptions readily available as a part of the metadata could be utilized not only by docs generators but also (hopefully one day) by tools that provide "intellisense" for example the excellent Softtree's SQL Assistant http://www.softtreetech.com/isql.htm (last time I checked they didn't) or built in SQL Sever Management Studio's Intellisense (since sql2008)
But there is rule to write "Decription" in Properties of each table and column which we create.
Funny, I was wondering how other people are doing this as well..
I also recommend plenty of  /comments/ in the script which generates your database.
SQL Power Doc is also capable of documenting Windows Azure SQL Databases.
I used to create HTML documents earlier, but lately I prefer PDF
At some point I searched the web and didn't find a solution to this so I wrote LiveDoco (not free, sorry) in attempt to make it easy.
While developing my first big database project, I found that Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 10.0.1600.22  supports database diagrams which you can export to a word document or other documentation software where you can add as much documentation detail as you want.
I set the MS_description extended property for all objects and then document the whole database using ApexSQL Doc.
