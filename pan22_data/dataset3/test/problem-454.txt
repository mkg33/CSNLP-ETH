Large inserts can be done with partition switching.
It can help query performance by employing partition elimination.
What I need to know what I can get if I place partitions on same disk?
If you indexes are aligned, then you can do partition switching.
Index rebuilds can be done at the partition level instead of the whole table.
Index alignment needs to be looked into when partitioning.
Despite the fact that my partitions will be on the same disk, I still am currently working in implementing it just for the data purging story alone.
The actual switch allows me to remove over a million rows in less than a millisecond.
My company has a SAN and the System Admins will not even hear of allowing storage anywhere else.
This means large sections of big tables can be ignored when looking for values which means much less IO.
This can be useful if you are struggling to complete your backups in time.
For us that means that we can take older partitions and just switch them out to different table and then drop that table.
There are trade offs (some significant ones), but deleting data for large transaction systems is sometimes a very hard story.
Purging is a huge reason we are working on Partitioning.
I know that table partitioning is powerful mechanism of speeding data search when partitions is placed on different disks.
Maybe is stupid question, but I must ask to be clear with that.
