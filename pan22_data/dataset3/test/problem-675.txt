if you want to try to actually access everything from the machine you can try something like this: http://www.usb-ware.com/usb-2-vga-adapter.htm assuming the machine still boots, but you just don't have a screen.
Really old fashioned way to do it but you COULD install onto two PC's simulataneously (such as onto a VM as well) and use keyboard shortcuts to control the install on the PC you can't see - with the one you can as a guide for what to press and when.
remove the hard drive, put it in a hard drive enclosure - IcyDock is a good one and use the usb connection to access the files from another computer
Please note I'm not recommending this - an unattended install is a much better idea but this is another option if you get stuck!
Then use your VNC to complete the install and load drivers once you put the drive back.
Use Hard Drive activity as an indication of when it wants another prompt.
To be honest, I'm not really sure the point of formatting and doing a fresh install if you can't actually get at the system to begin with.
If you're determined though, I'd just recommend pulling the hard drive, putting it in another laptop (or a desktop using a USB enclosure or a 2.5" -> 3.5" adapter), and just reinstalling from another system.
It could be the Fn+VGA/LCD thing just isn't working right.
My other recommendation is that if you just want the hard drive then you can get a good USB external hard-drive extender from most online computer stores.
Please note I am not pushing this site to buy, I just wanted to show a USB to VGA display device.
If you gained control with VNC, did you try changing the display settings from within windows (right-click the desktop, go to properties...)?
