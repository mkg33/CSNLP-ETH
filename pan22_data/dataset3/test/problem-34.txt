However the current development environment in game dev is that both of these are simply "not complete yet", and alpha is generally just "less complete" than beta.
After the programers are satisfied they release the Beta version to non employs who are hackers and stress testers who try to break it.
It's basically just to denote "this version is not supposed to be completely satisfactory and may contain heavy bugs or may even be completely broken".
Alpha means the features haven't been locked down, it's an exploratory phase.
The end result is a final release to the public that has stood the test of time!
Pre-Alpha is the version before the Alpha version, Alpha is the version before the Beta version, Beta is the version before the Gamma version, Release Candidate is the version just before the release.
In traditional software engineering, Alpha releases will still be introducing new features, while Beta releases will see no new features, but rather polishing up the existing stuff.
Alpha version is the first working version and is for internal use (testing)  only!
What the different notions mean exactly differs from developer to developer.
Beta releases will still see new features, while sometimes I'll see alphas that simply try and flesh out existing stuff.
It's a win win for the manufacturer and the public!
Beta means the features have been locked down and are under development (no other features will be added).
That's the way it was intended to work but rarely does these days
And even a few things that stay in alpha or beta forever.
