"OSSEC is an Open Source Host-based Intrusion Detection System.
You might want to investigate incron or the inotify-tools (both linked from the wikipedia page.
Look at OSSEC, I use it to do file integrity checks on our servers, it's very complete and easy to configure.
In addition to AIDE and Tripwire (already mentioned), you might want to check out Samhain.
I don't see a reason why tripwire (which granted is actually for system binaries in it's basic use case) isn't suited for your use case.
You can use the client utilities by themselves, or use the server to create a repository for all of your diffs.
You could use it to get a list of files that are reported to you by a write_close event.
It can do filesystem-wide diffs and then unapply or reapply them.
While all three probably default to monitoring /etc and various binary directories, they can be configured to monitor pretty much anything.
On the other hand it sounds like tripwire is exactly what you are searching for, to my knowledge you can simply define which files to look at.
It can send mail notification, you can check alerts via command line or a web interface ...
It performs log analysis, file integrity checking, policy monitoring, rootkit detection, real-time alerting and active response."
