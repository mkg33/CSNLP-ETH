If you were able to set up a secure, stable network connection between the two computers, you might be able to use FreeFileSync with RealTimeSync as well.
But if both computers are frequently online at the same time, BitTorrent Sync could be your ticket.
(How long it takes depends on a number of variables.)
There are two side benefits to this approach, beyond keeping data on your two computers synced:
(Either that, or you'd have to also sync with other computers that are.
It's free for syncing a maximum of 10 top-level folders containing unlimited subfolders, or there's an annual subscription fee for syncing an unlimited number of top-level folders.
As it's not just new files, but also changes to current files/folders.
Once FreeFileSync has completed a first run on each computer and its initial databases are built up, its two-say sync should replicate file and folder deletions, moves, and renamings in addition to new and updated files and folders.
You can use FreeFileSync's RealTimeSync component to run your batch job automatically, in background, in real time.
I suppose you could also schedule your computers to shut down a week or so after your departure and just leave them running with the screen locked.)
But both computers would have to be up and running and connected to the Internet at the same time, at least part of the time.
Both are identical setups hardware wise, same drives layout, etc.
You might be best served by getting a 6TB or 8TB hard drive, and either (a) getting a nice, high-bandwidth-connection external-drive enclosure for it, or (b) getting a good storage/travel case for it and adding mobile drive racks to your two computers.
Each computer contains about 5TB of data, divided over various drives.
If your drive-letter assignments and data-folder structures are truly identical on both computers, you might even be able to use the exact same FreeFileSync batch job on both computers.
Every time I travel between countries, I take a very large portable HD, with the new files.
When the batch job is through running, it exits, and RealTimeSync resumes monitoring.
RealTimeSync monitors its associated FreeFileSync batch job's folder pairs and launches the batch job whenever it detects a change.
Mount the drive on your computers and use FreeFileSync to two-way sync data-file folders between the computers and the drive.
I don't know anything about this, but if your computers have dynamically assigned IP addresses, it sounds like a hassle.
I think that BitTorrent Sync could probably do what you're looking for.
Dropbox and other similar services would be perfect of course, but not for this huge amount of data.
Now I like keeping things pretty much identical on both computers.
Regular-sized data files can get copied and copy-verified in as little as 15-20 seconds after the file is saved.
Is there a way that when new files arrive or files change on PC1, that PC2 downloads those files from PC1.
I have 2 Windows 10 computers in different countries.
