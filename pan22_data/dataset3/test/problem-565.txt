I have attempted a full reinstall of SQL, but still it does not work, throwing the following error:
Inorder to access the linked server using another account (assuming that you have the server permissions set correctly) you will need to do the following:
If you can see the Standard User account that you want to setup to use the Access Database Engine, this means that it already has some privileges on this folder, if it is not in the ‘Group of user names:’ list, it needs to be added.
Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the following folder (follow the next steps carefully as you are now dealing with system files) ‘C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Local’.
If you need to add the Standard User to the permissions group do so using the ‘Add..’ button, making sure the account name is spelt correctly in the following ‘Select users or Groups’ dialog.
You will also have to make sure that you have run the following queries in Management Studio to correctly configure the Access Engine
You should now be able to run access queries as any user that you provide permissions for in this way.
One of the queries I usually run to establish whether or not the Linked Server is configured correctly is:
However, when I attempt to setup the Access Database Engine using the Developer Edition of SQL Server 2008 R2 under x86 Windows 7 it does not work!?
This process works for all configurations including SQL Express 2008 R2 both (x86 and x64) with the Access Database Engines (x86 and x64 respectively), but for Developer Edition on x86 Windows 7 it does not, why?
The machine information is (obtained from the command line running 'systeminfo'):
I have also installed the Access Database Engine on a x86 based machine running Windows 7 and SQL Server 2008 R2 Express Edition (x86) again without problems.
Either way, click the ‘Edit…’ button underneath the ‘Group of user names:’ list, this will launch the ‘Permissions for Temp’ dialog.
This directory contains a folder called ‘Temp’, right click on this and select ‘Properties’.
This is happening due to permissions on the 'Network Service' folder that SQL server uses for Linked Server setup.
I have set up the Access Database Engine for SQL Server 2008 R2 (Service Pack 1) on many machines running x64 Windows 7 without any problems running as 'Administrator' (and setting up SQL Server as 'sa').
To setup the Access Engine having successfully installed the 32-bit version, I go into management studio and run the following queries:
Once the Standard User is on the permissions list, select that user and in the ‘Permissions for Standard User’ selection-menu check the ‘Full Control’ box under the ‘Allow’ column.
Has anyone come across this who can offer me some advice as to how to solve this issue?
