I have installed all my Vista drivers on my laptop (which has Windows 7) and they work like a charm!
For your laptop model, the resolution needs to be set 1280x800.
Standard VGA Graphics Adapter is not the best adapter, and if you are trying update and it saying you have the best, it is saying you only have the best Standard VGA Graphics Adapter.
As Rich suggested, you'll need to install the graphics drivers.
Your machine (from looking online) has ATI XPress 1100.
Do you have Windows Vista drivers for your laptop?
Maybe check out http://support.asus.com/download/ and search for you model.
It doesn't look like they have drivers specific to Windows 7.
I just reinstalled Windows 7 on the same laptop and the screen resolution is fuzzy, it is usable but the characters are noticeably less clear than on the former installation.
Then I'd check your cleartype settings - some screens don't look that nice with cleartype enabled, especially at lower resolutions.
I had a look on Asus's website and they do not have support either so you may be out of luck
I had Windows 7 on my ASUS X51R laptop, and the screen resolution was fine.
I'd install the graphics cards drivers if you know what they are.
Here are the settings I have under screen resolution:
From ATI direct, I can only find the drivers for Vista - It looks like it has not yet been released for 7.
