[An extra added benefit is that since you're working with one mesh account, you can add a bunch of devices and replicate the folders between them.
What's your reason for disallowing cloud-based solutions?
This does automatic, incremental, delta-only, encrypted, off-site backups to Amazon S3 storage.
To go back to your Ghost why not make it simple for them?
He arrives the next morning with his computer waiting for him to login
It runs in Windows, OS X and Linux, and runs as a service so it even backups when the user is not logged in.
We have used the Desktop and Laptop Option (DLO) with Backup Exec.
Not sure why so many of these answers recommend cloud solutions when you specifically asked for something that doesn't have to be cloud or network based.
Another suggestion, (although it's a little risky/beta right now)
Bandwidth is only an issue on the initial 'full' backup.
The executive reboots at the end of the day, picks 2 and goes home
The cost is pay-what-you-use, and very cheap for what you get IMHO.
Option 2 & 3 boot to the second partition and run a bat script file to run ghost with a reboot computer when its done.
When they boot they get a duel boot with 3 options
The fact that it's cloud-based to a reliable party like Amazon is actually a plus for us.
I'm not sure why you mention "Not cloud based" as a requirement, because that seems like a perfectly reasonably option to me.
It works decently well and meets your requirements except file encryption.
You can even install it automatically and choose to lock down the settings so no-one disables their backups.
For file encryption, the cheap route would be to simply install TrueCrypt on their laptops and use a strong boot password.
It's got 5Gb of storage for free and I could see a setup of something like this:
We use it to do daily backups on about 150GB of data from several production servers, and several employees' desktops and I can say I'm very satisfied with the solution.
Again, it's beta but might be a good interim solution, etc.
Let's say you've got 3 or 4 execs, if they want, you can have "John Brown's" folder replicate to "Jane Smith's" desktop and vice-versa, or everyone's folder replicated to "Mister President and CEO's" desktop.]
I've had OK experiences with EMC Retrospect; it can be a bit of a pain to set up, but it's totally hands off form the client point of view once you get it working.
