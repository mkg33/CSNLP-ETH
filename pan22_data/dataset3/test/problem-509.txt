Make note of whether they are quick, short blips or elongated bleeps (think Morse code).
Future readers: this is why your motherboard came with that itty bitty plastic speaker with two wires and a tiny connector.
These beeps are the rudimentary feedback system implemented by your motherboard's Power-On Self-Test or POST.
It really is hard to tell without your actual motherboard make and model however here is a general guideline.
I am experiencing times when my PC just shuts down, then when I turn it on, I am greeted with 3 continuous beeps over and over.
Look up the model number of your motherboard and search for <mobo model> post beep codes.
First of all it is always good to hook up the little black speaker that comes with your motherboard as it solves so many problems that you can't see from the display.
I am experiencing a really annoying problem right now.
It is a quick diagnostic that your computer performs to make sure it has everything it needs to make it through the booting process.
If there are any errors, it will provide you audible feedback (the beeps) that can be used to look up the error in your motherboard's documentation.
