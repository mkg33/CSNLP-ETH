Here, the optional argument [chapter] says that numbering is to be performed per-chapter, so you get numbering like 1.1, 1.2 in the first chapter, 2.1 in the second chapter and so on.
Using it, you can define a theorem-like environment like this:
Now, problems in my context are logical sections of my documents, and so \section makes sense.
This solution is not very good since it doesn't use the automatic counters and though the assignments are short I might have longer ones later and need a table of contents.
Doing this gives you way more flexibility structuring the details of your individual assignments - for example you can enumerate as deeply as you need, but can only take sections to 3 levels.
I've encased the font change in {} so that it only affects this environment definition and not any others you might have.
You can change that by replacing the definition with something like
Prior to discovering the exam class, I used the hmcpset document class from the mathematics department at Harvey Mudd College.
Would some type of new command say \problem make more sense?
Also, the default typesetting puts the text in italics.
If you just want sequential numbering throughout the document, leave out that argument altogether.
and I'm not really satisfied with the LaTeX source I'm making.
It's not exactly what you want, but if you look up using counters and the newcommand and renewcommand definitions, you should be able to do exactly what you want, which wasn't totally clear to me.
I'm typing up some assignments with the basic structure
Of course, you would want to give it a more descriptive label than just prob:1.
For this kind of thing, I would probably use the theorem package.
I would suggest using enumerate to organize problems and use sections to group them.
