For this type of purpose it is absolutely useless.
The only time I've used the user-agent string was back i the late 90s when codign javascript - Netscape (now Firefox) and IE had very different supported DOMs, etc so sniffing which was in-use was "helpful".
Not so much an issue today since there is better common core functionality as well as various frameworks that do the client-check stuff for you (like angular, vue, etc).
I've also seen some "secure online exam" systems (Respondus Lockdown Browser, etc) and course management systems (WebCT, Angel, Canvas) try to use the user-agent string to confirm that the lock-down browser was in use to prevent copy/pasting, opening other windows, etc.
and getting right into the "secure no copy/paste" test.
but I've won quite a few bar bets at conferences with vendors of such products by changing the user-agent string in Firefox, etc.
Typically this was done with "if IE5 is in use, do .... otherwise do ...." - so your total random string wouldn't really break anything.
