I couldn't test it with an android device because I haven't this ethernet dongle but with my laptop it works without problems.
For more details look at Howto migrate from networking to systemd-networkd with dynamic failover.
It gets an ip address from 192.168.1.0/24 and I can ping 192.168.1.120.
I have tested this tiny setup with systemd-networkd using a fresh flashed Raspbian Buster Light.
Both of these devices work fine if plugged into a separate router individually, since the tablet then gets a DHCP IP and all is well (being unrooted, it cannot have a static one unfortunately).
For a certain project I have a very specific need to connect a Raspberry Pi with an unrooted android tablet through a UTP cable (with an adapter on the android side).
The option I was pursuing thus far was to set up a DHCP server on the Pi and have that set the IP on the tablet once it's connected.
I've followed like 5 Pi DHCP tutorials by now and none of them worked so I'm slowly starting to reconsider this idea.
Another thing would be a direct bridge connection for which I'm not entirely sure where to start.
Not so much when I try to connect them directly I cannot get the connection to work.
Perhaps DHCP cannot work without a cross-over cable?
