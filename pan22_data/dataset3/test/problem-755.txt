I'm currently testing Symfony2 with Nginx and PHP-FPM.
And surprisingly, if I fix that typo, then re-create the syntax error in the Acme/Demo bundle, then Symfony error handler appears as expected.
You could track the exact issue by checking the nginx logs.
502 is because there is some issue in connecting to the php-fpm process.
But if I make a syntax error in the file app_dev.php (so before the framework is fired), then Xdebug tells me about the fatal error.
And finally if a fix all typos (page works) then again re-create that same typo (again in Acme/Bundle), I get a bad gateway.
Why I do that, the server response is 502 bad gateway.
If you want to isolate the log, mention seperate error_log under the location of your php application, like
(if nginx is trying to connect to different port/ phpfpm/socket you could get answer from this)
Symfony2 comes with a Demo bundle, I wanted to test the new handling of fatal errors which comes with Symfony 2.2.0 by creating a syntax error in the Acme/Demo bundle.
