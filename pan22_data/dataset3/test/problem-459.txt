Who has used these keyboards and what was your experience?
Perhaps there is something else I haven't though of why such a keyboard would not be a good idea?
I also tend to eat by the computer, so there's plenty of... uhh... lifeforms down there.
The keys quite literally wobble back and forth on their downward stroke, so unless you enjoy battling little mounds of jelly, avoid.
If I can't write on it at a decent speed, the rest of the features don't matter.
There are probably no reviews because the things cost a few bucks and nobody loves them enough to express it on a review site.
I use the keyboard for gaming and programming, so it gets some pretty solid use.
So I'm slowly starting to look around for a new one.
I was once optimistic about them for the reasons you listed, but found them to be absolutely horrible in use.
I couldn't find any reviews on the net so I'm turning to you.
They can be easily cleaned, they're quiet, and can be rolled up when needed (plus no worries about spilled drinks).
Not that I'm a fast typer, but being a professional progammer does give a boost to the skill.
They come pretty cheap (my local computer shop has one for less than $20) and they seem to have some nice properties.
I think typing would be marginally faster than an on-screen keyboard.
You should go to a hardware outlet and give it a shot.
Every keyboard wears out with time, and mine has some age already.
