What seems to happen is that on my end (desktop computer connecting directly to the router), the DNS server is unable to be reached.
Either your router or your computer is dropping packets.
I have an ethernet cable directly connecting my modem to my computer, and around every hour or so, the internet connection cuts off not just for me, but for all devices in my network.
This can happen dynamically via UPnP, so you might try to disable UPnP in the router to check if that solves the issue.
As it takes some time for the response ports to reach this forwarded range, everything will work right after a reset, but then fail at some time.
Our WiFi network can still be detected by these devices, but they are unable to connect to it.
I recently built a new desktop computer, which works fine except for connecting it to our network.
Now, if you have, for example, the ports 3000-12999 (10.000 ports) forwarded to some machine on the LAN, the DNS answers arriving at these ports will reach the DNS resolver inside the router, but instead go to the machine in the LAN.
A fix would be that the router's DNS resolver/forwarder should not use forwarded ports to expect answers...but, apparently, this is not getting implemented.
I wonder if the DNS side of things is a red herring (i'm pretty sure it is).
This could be caused by a number of things - the most likely is P2P software which makes lots of connections with other systems - likewise it could be malware on one of the devices doing something similar.
Try opening Command Prompt and type ping -t 8.8.8.8 (I think you use -t, haven't used Windows in a long time).
So if one DNS request asks for the answer to arrive on port 2000, the next DNS request will ask for port 2001, the next after that on port 2002 and so on.
Next time it drops look at the output of that command.
I have the same problem myself, but it is not with windows.
I postulate that the issue is a limitation of the router - specifically its ability to do connection tracking.
Symmetrical NAT would also be an option, but only very few firewalls use Symmetrical NAT.
From the description, I posit that there are too many simulataneous connections, and the router looses track of them - probably preventing new connections before dropping old connections, which would explain why some things continue to work.
If that drops like 8.8.8.8, then your internet connection is fine.
Often, these "random" ports are not randomly chosen, but chosen in numerical order.
When the modem is turned off and on again, it works fine again for an hour until the same problem occurs.
It will appear that suddenly the DNS servers have all disappeared when the answers from the DNS servers begin to arrive in the forwarded port range.
It should either look like one of these three things:
This is the problem that Windows Problem Solver is giving me, and what I've been able to confirm for myself, as IP addresses can be reached but plain web addresses cannot be.
Whenever a DNS request is performed, the router expects the answer from the DNS server on a "random" port.
At a guess, your PC is running torrenting software (in which case the solution is to reduce the maximum number of simultaneous connections it supports) or it has malware [ in addition to Windows 10 ]
Request timed out or Destination host unreachable - now you know that the problem is with your connection, not with the server.
State table exhaustion (often caused by P2P activities, like when using BitTorrent) has already been mentioned.
Change 8.8.8.8 to your router's IP address, should be 192.168.2.254 or 192.168.2.1.
Anyhow, the issue described above might or might not be the source of the described problem.
In addition, it kicks every device using WiFi off the network.
Your internet connection or router might be having problems.
When my internet cuts off, it doesn't completely cut off.
32 bytes from 8.8.8.8 - this means that the problem is with the server you're connecting to.
If that stays up, bad news - you need a new network card.
It could be that an excessive number of ports is getting forwarded from the router to the PC.
Surprisingly, this bug is present in many routers.
