I wrote a little test program to exercise the function
Using all of these suggestions, here's how that might look:
At the possible expense of some speed, the swap can be done char at a time:
If the buffer is omitted, there is no way for its allocation to fail.
That sounds more like a for loop construct, so it may be helpful to write it that way to make the logic of the program a little more obvious.
Since most of the places that are using arr also already have a cast, you may as well add a single cast and eliminate arr entirely, using base directly instead.
We can highlight the early bailout by putting it at the top of the routine:
Within the current code, first right is set to a value, then checked as an exit condition in a while loop, then decremented.
The effect is the same as your original, but now it's more clear to a reader of the program that any of the conditions (such as base == NULL will cause the routine to simply return.
I see a number of things that may help you improve your code.
