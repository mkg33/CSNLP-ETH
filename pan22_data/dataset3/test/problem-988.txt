The probability that a random network protocol is sending a packet containing 16 times the MAC address of a computer is close to zero, but the chance of a false positive is much higher if there was only a single repetition.
I think that it is mainly a way to make sure that only a magic packet will actually wake up the computer.
As the packets are scanned for this sequence without looking at any protocol headers (e.g., IP addresses, port numbers), the packet needs to be easily identifiable and the number of false positives close to zero.
It's simple and the chance that someone sends this data accidentally is effectively zero.
Repeating the MAC address because there is already address matching logic on the chip.
You want simple because a very low-powered microcontroller in the NIC has to be able to permanently watch the raw ethernet network traffic and act if it sees this pattern and you don't want to turn on systems by accident because a stream of random network data is the command to turn the system on.
