It is probably best to try using "Windows Easy Transfer" as shown here.
The issue would come to the difference in hardware (CPU, RAM, HDD, Wireless, Bluetooth, keyboard, mouse, and others that I forgot to mention).
I have a HP laptop(32 bit machine), 160 GB HDD with windows 7(32 bit) and all programs, profiles etc ,set up to my liking.
It won't transfer your programs, but it will transfer the 'personal' stuff.
You can install 32-bit OS on a 64-bit capable hardware.
Your Windows 7 from the HP laptop have drivers for hardware specific for the HP laptop.
I would like to a move this HDD to a brand new Dell laptop(64 bit machine) with all OS, prorgams, settings intact so that all things remains same.
Yes, it is typically possible to do, but there are some important caveats.
If you simply move the HDD across, windows MAY boot up, but there are possibility that it won't boot up at all due to the difference in drivers between the 2 laptops.
Windows Easy Transfer will attempt to transfer User Accounts, Documents, Music, Email, Pictures and Videos.
