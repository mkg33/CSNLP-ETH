Like pulling the Plug Off means hard power off, docker kill means s direct way to kill my_container, which does not attempt to shut down the process gracefully first.
It is analogous to Pulling the Plug off Desktop and Shutting down the computer
in both cases the filesystem changes will be persisted (at the time of stop or kill) so if you docker start <container> then it will continue from there.
If so how would docker stop know how to correctly stop the running process.
What's the difference between docker stop and docker kill?
docker stop will try to stop it gracefully (will ask politely :P)
Is it that docker stop attempts to stop the process run inside the container in the correct way, while docker kill will send a kill signal?
docker kill will stop the main entrypoint process/program abruptly
Shutting down the computer means sending a signal to OS for shutting down all the processes where docker stop means sending SIGTERM signal to the running container to stop the processes gracefully.
