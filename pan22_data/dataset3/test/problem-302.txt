A quick search for 12V 2A power supply on Amazon (or any other suitable e-commerce site) should give you some decent choices.
To me, it looks like they threw the cable in just to "complete" their offering someway, without paying any attention to whether that piece was suitable for use with the screen or not.
I have been trying to build a Raspberry Pi laptop, and I found an issue where my screen required power at all times to run , so I decided to plug the screen in to the USB port in the Raspberry Pi.
It's true that your screen came with (citing the product page you linked)
Unfortunately, this meant that the screen was not receiving enough power from the Raspberry Pi to run.
You would need a separate 12 Volt power supply to the screen.
but that cable is useless for a 12-Volt device like your screen.
Unfortunately there is no place on a Raspberry Pi from where you can draw 12 Volts.
Hereâ€™s a link to where I bought the screen: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10-1-inch-Raspberry-Pi-Screen-1024X600-HD-Digital-LCD-Monitor-Display-HDMI-VGA-2-AV/32282336030.html?src=google&albslr=220934139&isdl=y&aff_short_key=UneMJZVf&source=%7Bifdyn:dyn%7D%7Bifpla:pla%7D%7Bifdbm:DBM&albch=DID%7D&src=google&albch=shopping&acnt=494-037-6276&isdl=y&albcp=913263744&albag=48828809226&slnk=&trgt=388120373908&plac=&crea=en32282336030&netw=g&device=t&mtctp=&aff_platform=google&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItJX_8aLa2wIV1CMrCh2HGwZbEAkYECABEgKkqvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds
I'm afraid the only way to make the screen work is using a separate 12V power supply capable of sustaining a 2A load.
