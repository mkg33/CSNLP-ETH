As stated, APC makes a great product and they should be able to accommodate 5kw and below.
Eaton is also another good product that can easily scale with lower end loads.
From there, we can essentially load balance between the 3 phases to even out the load.
Unless you're starting one at a time, you may need those 30A circuits.
One aspect we were calculating for in the wiring is the rare event that everything needs to be shutdown.
Maximum draw is presented when a server/equipment first starts up.
Changing out the outlets to downgrade from 30A to 20A is not ideal.
We installed L6-30 outlets across our datacenter, even for the racks with low density.
Also, if a power supply goes bad or is unplugged, the load is solely on one leg of your supply.
When those servers come back online, they'll all be pulling quite a bit more amperage.
Remember that you'll want to calculate maximum draw from a particular leg and/or PDU.
When you're looking for a battery backup unit, always calculate max load for each systems; then give some more.
