Now, my problem is, when there is an update to Apache and SSH, dpkg asks whether one should keep the original configuration or replace it with the generic, default one.
The setup is the following: stripped down Debian based server system, running, for example Apache and SSH servers, properly protected with very strict iptables rules and behind a HW firewall.
According to the debian handbook you can avoid the configuration file questions by adding the following line :
(The restart occurs even if Apache and SSH weren't upgraded, and the service downtime at that point is less than a second).
The idea behind this is: if there is an update to the software that is the only attack surface to the outer world, install it and restart that software.
There is a daily cron job that does the following:
To your /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/local file (create the local file before )
I understand that the question should one perform automated and unattended system upgrades is highly debatable, but let us assume that I for one, never had any issues with that concept so far.
Unfortunately this is a menu-based prompt and one cannot use simple pipe to yes to select the proper answer.
