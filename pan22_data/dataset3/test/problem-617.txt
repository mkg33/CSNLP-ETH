I just tried canyouseeme.org from here and it seems to work as expected: sees the ports I know are open, doesn't see ports I know are closed.
According to this, you need to forward a 5800 as well.
Been awhile since I messed with VNC but just a thought.
Doesn't VNC add the display number to the port you select?
I'm betting (could be wrong) that you probably actually need to forward 5901/5801.
I do not know exactly how to set up TightVNC, but I do know that you need to be using your public address and not a private IP address.
This could be due to your ISP, or any device in your connection path.
It could also be due to your VNC server not running, so make sure it's running before testing.
Lastly, you may want to double check that you have forwarded the correct protocol, I can't remember if it is TCP or UDP that is needed, but if you have one - try the other (or both!)
I would double check that you have forwarded the port as that is all you should need to do.
192.168.1.100 is a private IP Address that you will never be able to access from outside your network.
Your router does address translation that sees your 192.168.1.100 internally and when you send email or anything else on the net your router translates that IP into a public IP address that the "Cloud" understands.
If there is a problem, try changing the default port in case your ISP is blocking it.
If it's saying your ports are still closed, your ports are still closed.
