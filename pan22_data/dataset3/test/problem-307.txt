This is good as you have a large target audience, but the size already has attracted many many many (you are not the only one, no) game developers, this market is  largely saturated.
You won't make a penny this way, at best you will get a balance of 0.
You might want to consider other, smaller, markets, such as the PC Indie market.
But of course choosing a market with millions of users, against one with only thousands has the potential of bigger profit if it succeeds.
For the customers that means they don't have to pay for their games, they can play as many  games as they want and can try out any game at any given time, this means, in the end that if your game is good it will get at least some attention.
The bad thing is that it's much more work getting noticed.
First of all: those two markets are big, I mean really big, maybe, just maybe, too big for you.
What was more successful crush the castle or angry birds and why?
What you should do instead of trying to figure WHO you want to make a game for, make a great game.
You'll need a better plan than just making a game and selling it.
Most games won't even be recognized due to the sheer number of games there are.
I like self-hosting and facebook apps, for the simple reason that noone tells me what game to make, and how i intend to profit and so on.
A good game sells itself no matter if it's on app stores, facebook, kongregate or self-hosted.
I have little experience about this topic but by logic and knowledge I can give a few pointers that might be worth a few pennies.
The most important difference between Flash games and Android games is that Flash games are pretty much exclusively financed by ads while Android games are partially financed by ads, partially by selling the games themselves and partially by in-game purchases.
The downside is, you are bound to have a lot more people to play your game, because the average every player will just give you a penny or two as opposed to a dollar or two for android games.
Then you can sort out where and how it's best marketed.
The target audience may be a lot smaller, but you will be able to get ground much easier as your game isn't one of millions then but just one of hundreds.
