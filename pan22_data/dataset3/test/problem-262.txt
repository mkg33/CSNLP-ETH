In general if a computer powers itself straight off with no warning then you are looking at a fault, with a laptop it will be a motherboard fault (you have swap tested battery) that will need board level repairs / replacement.
I have an anti-virus programme which is up to date.
I mention this as you stated the unit is slower after it is restarted which would suggest CPU throttling to try and maintain a lower temp.
I tested this extensively, but the problems just never occur when the charger is plugged in, not even when playing a computer game, for example.
As a non-expert, the only thing I can think of is a hardware problem, some kind of faulty communication between the battery and the system.
Today, I worked for three hours on battery power, without recharging.
In fact, the problem (still with my old battery) existed before updating from Windows 8 to 10.
If any peripherals are connected they may be failing and shorting out the USB ports which can also cause this issue.
I'd rather not have my laptop tinkered with unnecessarily, so I'd like to hear your opinion before bringing my laptop to the manufacturer (and paying a high price, as the warranty has already expired).
I have not yet completely reset the computer and wiped the harddrive; I would like to keep this as a last resort, for obvious reasons.
It possibly could be an issue with the battery management/power converter, if the laptop tries to draw too much current from the battery (ie due to a fault) then the battery protection mechanism (part of battery normally) will kick in to prevent thermal runaway (fire and brimstone) in the battery by cutting the juice.
I have already reinstalled my operating system (Windows 10), but to no avail.
Even when the battery is removed and the charger is plugged in, no problems occur.
This problem only occurs when the charger is not connected to the laptop, thus, pretty much ruling out the possibility that there is a heating problem or something similar.
Since my battery was over two and a half years old and had been used a lot, I decided to buy a new one, thinking that I could use the extra capacity even if battery turned out not to be the culprit.
In these three hours, four shutdowns occured, spread more or less equally in time.
I've searched quite a few forums and questions on this website, but felt like none matched my exact problem.
By 'shut down' in this question I always mean: turns off immediately, without following the correct procedure for shutting down.
Just to clarify: the problem is not that the battery charge indicator is broken and the laptop shuts down because the battery is dead.
The shutdowns might have become slightly less frequent, but I haven't tested this so thoroughly.
This instant shutdown also seems to imply that the laptop takes a much longer time to boot the first time after, but I don't think permanent damage is caused after such a 'crash'.
Simply said, my laptop shuts down without any notice.
After such a shutdown, I can start my computer without connecting the charger and continue working.
I am not 100% convinced that it is not overheating, it is possible that you have different max CPU frequency set in the advanced power options, however I find it very unlikely you set the max frequency to be lower when on power than on battery but it is a possibility.
