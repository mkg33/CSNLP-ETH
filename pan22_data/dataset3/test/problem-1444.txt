The nature of the site is that we have around 2500 people a month who come to us for support with mental health and suicidal urges and if even a small portion of them are being blocked by something, that is a big concern to me that they won't get helped - and I have already had panic emails from some that they can't reach the site.
This morning suddenly some of my members (not even most, just a portion) are getting an error on the site.
Any ideas why some people are getting this error/what it is?
I co-own a charity forum that gives support to people in crisis (mental health, self harm, suicidal thoughts etc) Our webmaster left in a bit of a snit a month and a half ago and I have been struggling since.
And where I even start to find someone to help fix it.
I have checked the SSL certificate and all is supposedly good with that (though it is bought/owned by the errant webmaster and we need to buy a new one probably anyway).
And depending on the browser also getting a "403 Forbidden You don't have permission to access / on this server."
When those members access the site via a proxy, everything is good.
