I've tried to launch a safe session of Chrome with the "--safe-plugins" options without success, here is what happens when I do this from the terminal:
(Accessibility>Mouse & Trackpad>Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present)
A few hours ago Chrome closed on my MacBook Air with OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 and there's no way to recover it.
The problem is fixed as of December 20th, 2014 on OS X Yosemite.
I'm not sure when Apple released the newer version of OS X, but currently I can open Google Chrome using the normal method and move my mouse without it crashing.
If you are using Chorome Canary follow these steps.
In Automator select Run Shell Script, paste the command above and save as app to desktop
I've also tried to delete Chrome from the Apps folder and install it again, but no success either.
(found on Reddit) This fix is not the best solution, but it works.
Everytime I try to launch it quits with the message "Google Chrome has quit unexpectedly", giving me the option to send a report to Apple, Ignore, or restart Chrome.
It's a problem with the new trackpad driver in OSX 10.10.2.
When you follow the instructions you'll have to run the last terminal command every time you want to run Chrome.
You could use a external mouse en disable the use of the trackpad while a USB mouse is connected.
The prior patch listed above will cause the program to crash if you move your mouse when starting Chrome.
Option 2 of Pippyn's answer works so giving the full temporary fix (I can't just upvote the answer):
But you can also make a chrome launcher with the automator app and the terminal command.
