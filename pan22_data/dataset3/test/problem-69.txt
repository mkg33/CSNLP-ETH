His site is also full of examples not in the book.
I found that going through the tutorials and looking at the AS3 source code was enough for me to understand what was going on, so I'm sure you'll be able to pick it up in no time.
They walk you through the process of creating a side-scrolling space shooter from start to finish (they even provide all the assets!).
If you don't mind using a Flash-Game-Framework such as FlashPunk or Flixel, I suggest you have a look at the Flash Game Dojo.
Kongregate's "Shootorials" (shooting tutorials) are second to none!
While this question is a little old now http://gamedev.michaeljameswilliams.com/2008/09/17/avoider-game-tutorial-1/ seems to be exactly what you are after.
It's not a very extensive site, but a good place to start.
The tutorials were originally written for AS2, but they do provide a link to the AS3 source code here, and a mobile version written in AS3 here.
I will recommend the book "ActionScript 3.0 Game University" which has many step by step tutorials for all genre of games (puzzle, match-3, platform, maze, shooter).
One of the better books out there (though there aren't really many game development books for AS3).
