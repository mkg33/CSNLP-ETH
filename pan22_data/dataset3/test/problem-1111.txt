Then look for VPS hosting companies that use those upstream providers, and rent a server there.
Make sure that your root hints are up to date by checking them with IANA's copy here: http://www.internic.net/zones/named.root
If you don't mind one additional process (25 MB) on your computer, this is a good solution.
So, you can find such servers but it is not a good idea to use them, they have a higher chance of being poisoned than the others.
I'd recommend running your own DNS server on your LAN, using "root hints" to provide lookup functionality for Internet names.
Such nameservers are called "open DNS resolvers" and are widely regarded as a bad idea (see RFC 5358 to know why).
You don't mention what operating systems you're using, but getting a caching name server running under most Linux distros and Windows versions is pretty easy.
This is not exact answer to your question, but I have setup my own dns server (BIND) on laptop with no problems so far.
Configure it also as a caching server, and also set up firewall rules so that only your company IP addresses can use the nameserver, port 43.
If you can't solve the problem by running your own caching server in-house, then try some traceroutes out through your ISP to identify their upstream provider(s).
These are Level(3)'s public DNS resolvers and should not hijack any pages.
That'll also let you create and use names for your various on-LAN resources, as an added feature.
As mentioned by Evan Anderson, a local resolver is probably the best solution.
