Though I'm not sure to what degree they meet your global presence requirements.
With their sata "diskpac"s you can get 16TB in 3U with redundant controllers and battery backed cache.
Next in the row of really cheap is probably stuff like the Drobo Pro or other ISCSI enable "SOHO storage devices".
Chances are the code has matured a bit since -- that's in substance what the sun support engineers told us back then: you have to wait until the code gets better.
All of those options are cheaper than the classic storage providers - at least for the initial investment.
You can get an iSCSI interface for Netgear's ReadyNAS range.
If you're willing to drop FC for iSCSI Dell's MD3000i or Equalogic products are the cheapest "name brand" SAN.
And if you really wanna get your freak on, check out Coraid's AoE.
Would be nice if you could elaborate what your definition of highly available is thou
If you really want cheap I'd look into DRDB along with your favorit Linux distro and iscsi-target in combination with linux-ha.
All you need is time, depending on how expensive that is four you the next best thing that provides ISCSI along with RAID, but not highly available (I think they don't have DRDB or linux-ha option) is probably OpenFiler (Linux based) or FreeNAS (FreeBSD based)
Re running (Open)Solaris on an x4540 I had some experience last year in running it as a cheaper iSCSI target and it did not go according to plan: http://scaleordie.com/2008/07/06/attempts-at-using-a-sunfire-x4500-thumper-as-an-iscsi-san/
If you don't want special hardware, you can use a bog standard box, use Starwind as an iSCSI target and connect that way.
I think the Pro supports it natively but you can get a plugin for the lower end systems.
