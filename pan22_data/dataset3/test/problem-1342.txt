I would strongly recommend using a replicated cluster filesystem like AFS or Hadoop HDFS
BTW: a SAN need not be expensive - see this (but note that an iSCSI SAN can be built for approx the same price as an ATAoE SAN) and this
SAN usually means a very large infrastructure with FiberChannel (or FCOE) and is usually expensive in comparison to the SAN.
Currently i have looked at a NAS from synology: http://www.synology.dk/products/product.php?product_name=RS812&lang=dan
Both NAS and SAN give you a single point of failure (although high end SANs can be set up to reduce the likelihood of the entire SAN failing).
I need a setup where both webservers would be able to upload and download files from a common storage solution.
Using a shared filesystem has a really bad impact on performance.
My webservers should be able to, via a webinterface that i build in php/mysql, upload/download files from the shared storage solution.
A NAS should be enough, look for a link aggregation to have a large bandwidth between servers
