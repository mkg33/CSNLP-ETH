If you are trying to do anything with dynamic disk, see if you can first convert them back to basic disk under Windows (which may not be possible anyway) before using any partition utilities.
i believe both are stable and safe, i have never had any problems
ubuntu live cd has a partition editor that i often use.
If you find yourself stuck with a RAIDed dynamic disk, about all that you could trust is to back-up the disk to a file using NTBACKUP, onto another drive (like an external USB drive) and then you at least can restore if everything falls apart.
Even Server Magic (a version of the proprietary "read $$$" Partition Magic disk partition software made specifically for Windows Servers) does not really support volumes that are RAIDED or extensible by Dynamic Disk.
I've been using Acronis Disk Director but I've had a few data corruption issues which I think might be related to it (especially after reading comments on the Internet about it bricking other people's hard drives).
If you have to reboot to not be running off the target drive anyway, why do you care if it runs on Windows?
Also be aware that partition imaging/cloning software (like Ghost or PartImage) are similarly hobbled in dealing with dynamic disk.
If you are performing operations on Windows Dynamic Disks (you only get them with Windows server OS's) then be extremely careful.
they dont "run on" windows, but are windows compatable.
I'm only managing a few home machines here, so I don't need any features for managing large deployments.
I'm looking for a good disk partitioning/management software suite.
I've found it to be a VERY good all-in-one package for things of this sort:
Most partitioning & resizing software is OK with basic disks but useless with Dynamic.
