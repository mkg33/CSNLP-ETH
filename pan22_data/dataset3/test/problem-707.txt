When I lost the two drives last year, I added additional fans to enhance the cooling.
Someone mentioned that I might have an under-rated power supply.
Two days ago the final RE2 drive failed, but was a little less serious of a crash.
I lost one drive in 2009 and last year I had two drives fail close together.
This does not seem normal to loose five Enterprise-level drives with a year left to spare on their warranty.
It did not register on the system so I couldn't run any S.M.A.R.T.
In 2007, I built a 2.5TB server with 5 500GB WDC RE2 hard drives in a RAID5 configuration.
It's a 500W supply, but I am using the old-style molex for all but two of the SATA drives as it only came with two SATA power connectors.
Currently, the three responsive drives report their temperatures at 30°C which is well withing their 0-60°C operating range.
2 weeks ago, the fourth original RE2 drive failed with a serious hardware malfunction.
Or is it possible I might just have purchased 5 drives from a bad batch?
It had am unrecoverable sector read error and was unable to reallocate it, but otherwise was fully functional.
Since these are Western Digital's Enterprise-level drives, they come with a 5 year warranty, but I have been seeing these drives die much sooner than that.
All replacement drives have been WDC RE3 drives and have had no failures as of yet.
It sounded very sickly and was completely non-responsive.
Since I had to rebuild the server from backups, I decided to rebuild it with only 4 drives using RAID6 since we didn't need all that space.
Unfortunately, the new RE3 drives only have a SATA power connector so I will have to either get a splitter or a different power supply once I replace this next disk.
