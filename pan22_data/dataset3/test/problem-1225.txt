So I guess that means you can use FTP or SFTP, and why wouldn't this work from your local computer?
Wordpress has a plugin to backup the site to dropbox.
No need to open a separate transfer client just for file transfer.
With ExpanDrive, you can securely access any remote file server directly from Finder and Explorer, or even the terminal.
It's not free, you can try it for 7 days, and after that upgrade pricing is $19.95.
ExpanDrive extends the way all applications can access data.
If this option is not valid, then I'd suggest you read THIS PAGE on dropbox, where this question has been asked.
ExpanDrive enhances every single application on your computer by transparently connecting it to remote data.
I just thought of this, know it works in wordpress, but don't know how to get it working on your computer.
You can host it yourself or find free/cheap providers.
You might find some extension to Dropbox that would do that, but it would be so complex to the point where it won't even make sense to use Dropbox for it anymore.

I'm 99% sure this can't be done using plain Dropbox.
Open, edit, and save files to remote computers from within your favorite programsâ€”even when they are on a server half a world away.
You can use Expandrive for storing your files on a server that would sync your files to dropbox.
SFTP/FTP, WebDAV, S3, OpenStack Swift, Dropbox, Google Drive and more.
On the other hand OwnCloud (http://owncloud.org/) is perfect for this.
ExpanDrive acts just like a USB drive plugged into your computer.
You can mount your files with WebDav (native support on Gnome/KDE/Windows/Os X).
My answer to your question is based on a comment from this page as well.
According to the few answers, dropbox doesn't support this, but you can get this done via the Expandrive.
Apart from this answer, most of the posts are requesting the same feature for dropbox.
