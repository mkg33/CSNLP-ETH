If you're doing this cause you have custom software, you will end up needing to recompile whatever it is, especially since glibc versions have changed quite a bit.
The anaconda upgrade option is basically running the installer with the "upgradeany" option.
I don't think you can make it as far as past FC4, because that was kind of a troubled release, and got to the point where it was actually impossible to start with a fresh install and apply the latest updates — you had to have been following along with updates from earlier in the release.
I really have to challenge the assignment — what's the benefit of this supposed to be?
Its not an OS that's meant to be an LTS, and upgrading between versions on a good day is risky.
To help any future onlookers in a similar situation (upgrading a Fedora Core 1 vSphere VM without performing a clean install), here are the steps:
Pretty much any version you upgrade from FC1 will be obsolete, and chained upgrades sound like a horrible idea since any one upgrade breaking could mean starting afresh.
I actually had this exact assignment several months ago and remember coming across this very question.
I don't think this is gonna work, because especially in the early days, there were a lot of painful changes in fundamentals like glibc and rpm.
Smart money's on getting a new centos or fedora install up, working out what you need and rebuilding stuff.
And seriously, consider retirement planning, for the system, if not you.
You will need to use  fedup --upgrade fc2 ,fc3, ..etc,etc til 21 if you can't / won't install fresh....Grab a few movie marathons it will NOT be a quick engagement.
In the real world, faced with this issue, the correct response is definitely to document the configuration of the machine's important services and recreate with a fresh install.
If you have seperate partitions, or can do it make whatever does not need to be changed readonly.
If you don't have custom software, save yourself the pain and get a full install of fedora, work out what you need and just reinstall it.
If reinstalling isn't an option, and it is due to some unique custom software (and seriously, this is the only sane reason to), virtualise the old thing, stick it behind a VERY restrictive firewall (and in this situation, I would force everything through the host, and just forward absolutely essential ports).
Its a ll year old OS, 20 revisions behind the current release.
Without knowing the reasons for this, one can only guess on why one would go on this... frankly foolhardy quest.
This may or may not work - and certainly not in the case I linked.
I only had enough time to get my VM image up to Fedora 13, but the end result was surprisingly stable.
