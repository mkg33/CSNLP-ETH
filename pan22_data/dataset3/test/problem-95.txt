As far as I can see, you only want to send out mail, so a whole postfix/courier/mysql setup is overkill.
Here are my use cases I can think of off the top of my head:
If you use "Internet Site", you'll probably be good for now.
Linode has a tutorial that seems relatively easy to follow for getting the basics setup, but is this really the right direction to take?
As long as you make sure that you don't setup an open relay, you're fine (which postfix isn't by default).
I'm not usually a fan of outsourcing email but this is one area where it might fit - you have fairly small requirements and you're not an email admin.
I could use sitename@gmail.com for feedback-type emails, and possibly not bother with email confirmations for accounts (a la reddit) since I'd never be able to keep up with blacklisting "mailinator" type sites anyway.
and you can use its smtp server in your code and even get the replies and support questions in a comfty gmail interface :)
I "know" I need it, but I'm not sure how to administer it, or if there are other options.
I'm slowly learning how to administer a server by playing with "my pet linux" in a VM on my laptop, so I think I'll be reasonably ok there - at least until I a) fold the site for doing so poorly, b) can afford to have someone help me out when I need it.
I mean your summary at the bottom redefines the problem from "Is outsourcing right for you" to "Do I even need a 'pro' outsourced email setup with my own domain name or will gmail do".
If you run Ubuntu and do an apt-get install postfix, the installer will ask you what kind of setup you want.
Having written my use cases above, I suppose a case could be made for my not actually needing email at the start.
Setting up a basic postfix locally on the machine should be pretty simple.
I'm building a site and I'd like to use a VPS for a variety of reasons (Scalability, I'd like to run Sphinx for search, etc.).
I'm open to alternatives, such as free/cheap third party services or tools, but if you can suggest a good easy-to-setup/admin email server to run on my web server, with some tutorials I could follow to get it running, that would be appreciated.
