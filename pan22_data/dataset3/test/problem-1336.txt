so far I haven't found a way to tell sql server release any unused memory to windows.
Regarding your questions about "low memory notification" and "aggressive working set trimming", the SQL Server will try to trim back to the minimum amount of memory as defined.
As I said before unless you know how frequent server is going to need specific amount of memory no need to set anything higher than Default.
"In case of aggressive working set trimming by windows -- would it leave SQL server's memory usage to 48 GB setting a "floor" for SQL's memory usage?"
but my guess is it cannot force SQL server to reallocate acquired/committed memory.
I see setting min value only if we know that every day there is a load/activity going to happen that will require high memory so that when activity happens SQL SERVER does not have to request more memory every day.
SQL server will not go below min value if it has already acquired that.
i have seen the server becomes unresponsive due to the inappropriate MAX value for SQL server and then there is nothing left for server itself to operate.
Starting from SQL Server 2019 CTP3.1 you could set up MIN and MAX memory during setup and utilize the Recommended values:
As for recommendations for min memory, 50% should be a good base, but it depends on the server and what sort of load it has.
According to the documentation, SQL Server cannot release memory below the minimum.
so this is an indication that MIN value set was not appropriate.
"Are there any recommendation on min server memory?"
I concur that for most SQL Servers 50% is probably a good minimum memory setting.
"If windows sends low memory notification to SQL -- SQL server will trims all its pool and try to maintain memory usage up to 48 GB of memory ? "
