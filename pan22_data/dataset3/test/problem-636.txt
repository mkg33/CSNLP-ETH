Just make sure the connection and relay settings are set so that only servers on your network can connect and relay through it.
We use the IIS SMTP engine here to send millions of messages out at certain times of the year.
As with any decisions on which software to use, it depends on your needs.
I switched from windows own SMTP/POP3 services to hmailserver a few years ago, never looked back.
You don't need to run SMTP on your application server.
I assume you're talking about windows 2003 or earlier here, as 2008+ has no inbuilt mail services AFAIK - this is a decision that microsoft made, and it's very unlikely they'll change this policy, as it was introduced to push sysadmins into using exchange.
It's pretty bare-bones, and personally, I like it that way.
I've used hMailServer for that task previously, but I'm thinking of switching to IIS SMTP Virtual Server.
If the application is using SMTP to send the messages, you can connect directly to your relay server.
I need to setup a SMTP relay for some web applications that need to send email to its users.
It does not, however, have any sort of internal mailing list management, bounce processing, etc.
You can set the retry schedule for soft failures, but that's about it.
What are the pros and cons of using Microsoft's own SMTP server versus a third party one?
If all you want to do is send mail out for some web apps without any other frills, IIS SMTP should work great for you.
