Have you tried booting the VM with a Windows 2003 installation CD and attempting a repair of the installation it finds?
It could be that Windows does not like the change of system architecture, either because you have moved between host machines as well as moving between VMMs, because you have gone from single CPU to virtual SMP (or vice versa), or just because VMWare and Xen present the hardware differently.
I bet it's because the boot drive changed from Windows' point of view.
i think u should try this , hope this will solve problem http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?cmd=displayKC&externalId=1005208
I don't know about 2003 in this respect, but Windows 2000 and NT had different HALs (Hardware Abstraction Layers) for single processor and SMP systems and a few other circumstances and only installs the right one at install time so if you change the underlying hardware it might not cope.
It may well be the virtual disk controller; I've run up against that when virtualising Linux servers.
IIRC, Windows doesn't deal well with the boot drive changing out from underneath it.
There are ways to change the HAL post-install though I can't remember how off the top of my head.
