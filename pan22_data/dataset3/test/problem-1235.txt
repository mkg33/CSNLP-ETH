Can't remember if this was for Truecrypt specifically or not, but I believe so.
They then removed the RAM and read it from another system so the attack is theoretically possible.

If I remember right, ports like PCMCIA and one particular Mac port had direct DMA access so you could just plug a card in and it could suck the contents of RAM down with no interaction necessary.
Also, no it is my understanding that your key is somewhat randomized based on your password input, such that the same password will result in different keys.
As long as the volume is mounted, then the key is sitting in RAM.
More disturbing is the possibility of doing this through a DMA priviledged port.
it does store the cipher-key however which is just as bad if not worse, and yes there are several "password recovery" tools that will scrape ram, your pagefile, and your hiberfil.sys to find the key.
Not sure if more recent versions of Truecrypt tried to wipe the memory of the password or not.
There was a famous experiment where a university had someone log in and then shut down and then froze the memory of the computer.
