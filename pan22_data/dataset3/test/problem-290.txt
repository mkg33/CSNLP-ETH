I created a small autohotkey script if you want to automate shortcut.
Ctrl+Shift+M then ▼ then Enter then ► or ◄ until you reach the user you want.
In the upper right corner of the browser window right-click on the current profile name and then select the other profile, this i find much faster
Note: You may need to change the values of 175 and 10 depending upon your system resolution
Since this is now a built-in menu, it is possible (at least on OSX) to bind a custom keyboard shortcut to switch to a specific profile.
For example, I have a shortcut set up for "Personal" (Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+1) and "Work" (Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+2) - you just have to make sure your profiles aren't named exactly the same.
With the latest version of Chrome, there is now a Menu option "People" at the top, with items for each profile you maintain.
First we need to access Chrome profile switcher options; the default keyboard shortcut for this is “Ctrl + Shift + M.” Just press “Ctrl + Shift + M” on any active window in Chrome, and the profile switcher should drop down from the top-right corner.
