That tells me you're not a development house backed up with agents and lawyers and publishers, because if you were you would be talking to them instead.
I' looking to get rights to an game called Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for the Nintendo DS.
Instead you set your aspirations a little lower; consider making a clone or something.
Second complication is that you're very unlikely to get full rights.
First complication is that the owner of an IP is not necessarily the same as the developer, who in turn is not necessarily the same as the publisher.
Third complication is that, for a franchise like GTA, this is going to be outside of your price range.
Best case is you'll likewise get a license, likewise with terms and conditions, and of limited duration.
I am a Nintendo 3DS Developer trying to make a remastered version for the Nintendo 3DS.
Do I get the rights from Rockstar, Nintendo, or another party.
You find out who currently owns the IP and you make them an offer.
How would I go about getting the rights for the game.
So the real answer to your question is: you don't.
The probability is that the IP was licensed to multiple parties during the course of making the game, and all of these licenses will come with their own terms and conditions.
