In ths case when you explicitly add "Administrator" whis is a user, overrides the policy for "Administrators" which is a group and voila, you get your permissions.
Why isn't giving the GROUP permission giving the members of that group the access I would expect?
If I explicitly add the 'Administrator' with full permissions, for example, then that user can access/modify fine.
Because in a GPO ( wheter have AD or not, windows O.S.s have GPOs ;) ) top-level permissions always overrides lover levels.
Environment: No Active Directory and no Domain Controller.
When you dont add, group policy grants that permission but default user permission ( for admin e.g ) overrides and denies it...
However, the members of that group are not able to view/modify the folder.
And if there is no specific policy, the behaviour will be "Always Deny".
I have a directory with only ALLOW permissions set (no DENY permission)..and no inherited permissions.
This is what you need :) It always overrides defaults ;) ( and of course unless you explicitly add any user ;) as i mentioned above top-level policies ALWAYS overrides lover level policies ;) )
I have two groups(Administrators and CoOwners) set to Full control.
