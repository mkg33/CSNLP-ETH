I have a windows 10 account with administrative privileges.
I eventually need to download things that have a potential of having viruses on them, so to prevent them from reaching my account and files, I thought about creating another local restricted account so that if this account gets infected, I won't need to format the computer but just delete the account and its files.
I would recommend just doing this in a virtual machine.
Another potential problem would be shared resources - for example if you have a shared public fileserver it could still delete files.
How likely is that to work, what are the risks and how to address them?
It will work in many cases, but definitely not all.
Where malware takes advantage of an unpatched vulnerability it can bypass the user limits - and there are a number of known vulnerabilities - including (off the top of my head) the Wannacry - but there are plenty of others which don't require file sharing.
As @aMofo suggested, doing this kind of testing in a VM is a much safer idea.
You can use built in Hyper-V or something like VM Workstation Player for free.
