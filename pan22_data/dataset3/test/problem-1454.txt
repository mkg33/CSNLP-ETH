You can use it along with Process Explorer to see the behavior of the file.
It creates sandboxed user accounts in it's own virtual machine type setting, although it virtualizes your existing kernel without the need for serials and activations.
For file testing, I highly recommend you run it in a proper VM environment.
Alain Zidouemba at the Sourcefire VRT team posted an excellent blog entry about this last year with specific reference to VMware VM's but much of the advice applies to using other VM environments.
I have ~20 nodes, running a variety of operating systems and software environments (mainly for testing our software), and don't have any issues.
There are some good recommendations in the other answers here regarding specific products but you will also want to make sure that you are doing your best in terms of VM configuration to prevent any potential malware detecting the fact that it is running within a Virtual Machine as quite a lot of the more advanced attack code will behave differently if it detects that it is being sandboxed.
I go with Virtual PC, the new version for Windows 7 is great as long as you have hardware support.
My local test environment runs VMware Server 2.0 on a modest 8G Dell Optiplex workstation (about $500).
VMWare is arguably the best, but it's not free, and you do not want it.
VMware has the benefit of being widely adopted, with a variety of free and commercial products, which means that creating a machine image you can use on other systems is simple, and portable.
It doesn't feel as clunky as a full blown VM so I'd give it a try .
