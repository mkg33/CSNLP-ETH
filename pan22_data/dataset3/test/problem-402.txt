If this was only a few thousand inactive accounts it would be one story but unfortunately it is quite a few thousand (I haven't taken an exact number yet but it is over 20,000).
I was curious if anyone knew of a way to sort through this information in an automated fashion other than using Hyena to get reports and then going through them one by one.
I did a simliar task a few years back, though on a much smaller scale than you're facing.
I just started a contract to clean up an Active Directory system for a large company.
Essentially this company has far too many accounts that are not active but cannot be deleted just yet.
I want to perform a "Scream Test" for certain accounts and delete later.
From there, we were able to track down where account logins were coming from, and we were able to deal with them in a controlled fashion.
We probably let this run for a few weeks in order to generate metrics before we did anything further.
AD Audit is a fairly low-cost product and the excel reports are quite good so we were very happy with our decision to go with it.
The first thing we did was to implement ManageEngine's AD Audit product in order to get a handle on accounts.
I was told it would be quite the busy work but after reviewing the system and seeing how disorganized and messy it is, I realized that I will not be able to perform my duties to their fullest.
