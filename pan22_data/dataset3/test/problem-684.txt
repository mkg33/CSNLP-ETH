That way, you can build the front end using hard float libraries - the GUI is much faster using hard float.
Unless Spotify creates a HF supporting library, or the despotify library is mature enough to handle HF, there is no way for spotify to work on most Raspberry XBMC builds.
If these libraries are shared, this has implications for other applications too.

This error is unlikely to be related to soft/hard incompatibility issues.
If I were you, I would implement a statically-linked thin wrapper around libspotify with a client-server interface - a libspotify server if you will.
If you want Spotify to compile a hard float version of their library, go give kudos to the idea in their community page: http://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-Ideas/armhf-Spotify-library-for-DIY-projects/idi-p/140972
The entire application will have to be soft-float and you must build any library the application uses, including the C library.
So, you may choose to link said application statically - with the exception of libspotify itself.
It seems there is now a beta version of the spotify lib hard-float!
As far as I know, Raspbian, RaspBMC, XBian and OpenElec use hard float.
