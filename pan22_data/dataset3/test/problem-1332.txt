You can just start a new instance of WSL instance of the same thing (eg: Start > Ubuntu ) and it will open up a new terminal (separate window) which operates on the same linux file system.
To create a new tab type: ctrl-"a" "c", to switch between tabs type ctrl-"a" "n"
Something similar you can use is a common linux utility called screen.
This basically lets you have concurrent shells running.

It is simple although not another "Tab" but it should get your problem solved.

Take a look at this article and scroll down a bit to the demonstration video where he opens WSL tabs:
You can now run the command screen to start a screen emulation, these are like invisible tabs.
You should be able to use something like MobaXterm and open multiple linux subsystem tabs.
something like conemu or Multi-Tab putty or console (http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/)
ctrl-"a" "d" detaches you back to your primary shell.
I use vi to edit files while I browse using other terminal window.
Also, as an aside, there is this UserVoice issue that appears to have been approved but is not implemented yet:
Is there a way to get multi tab bash windows for the linux subsystem in win 10?
If not installed by default you can use sudo apt install screen once installed run sudo screen
