*having also the convenient automatic preview as well
(currently I'm using the default, coming with Chrome)
This is a Chrome extension and will only display your PDF directly from the website.
So of course I could directly save the PDF (no preview) but often I only want to save the PDF if it's worth it.
When I click a PDF in Chrome it automatically opens it in a new Tab for a preview, and this is great.
Or maybe there is another viewer / plugin that could do that*?
It looks like you want to just preview/open a PDF file but not necessarily download it, right?
Question: since the preview has the PDF in memory, is there a way to save directly the PDF into a file from that version in memory (an option in Chrome or the viewer)?
However, when, from this preview, I ask to save the PDF in a file, Chrome does a download again of that same PDF ... when the PDF is rather big and the WIFI reception is rather poor, that takes twice the time (once in preview, once for download).
I don't know if my answer solves your problem but I want to you to try it anyway.
