For anyone in Seattle please join us at the Seattle Games Co-op.
Generally speaking, once you start networking with other local indies, you'll find out about everything that's going on in your city, whether you want to or not.
And there's a large enough dev scene in the Cambridge/Boston area such that we even have a monthly meeting specifically for indies:
Portland, Oregon, USA:  http://pagdig.org  has a monthly get together
Without knowing which city you live in, it's tough to say what's available, but check out the IGDA's chapter list:

Though these events include students and non-indie industry members, your fellow indies will often be there in force.
We currently meet twice a month, once to present a topic of interest -- say Blender or Linear Algebra -- and once just to hang out and have a beer.
For example, here in Boston, we have the Boston Postmortem group which meets monthly:
We're always looking for fellow game developers to participate and we're planning a lot of great stuff for the future, so get involved now!
