I have had a few clients who weren't very keen on uploading their documents to my product because my product is hosted on the public cloud.
My company sells an app subscription, which is hosted as SAAS on Amazon Cloud.
Even a layman looking up google, would find so many whitepapers and blogs, for instance like this, which talk about how secure Amazon Services, Network and Infrastructure are.
When these doubts are raised by so called 'security experts' at big firms, I wonder if I am missing something.
Why is this general distrust seen with respect to cloud?
It's hard to get this kind of security even if you host anything on your own servers (unless you are a profitable million dollar company!
If you have physical security for your server, network security that protects you from DDos, Ipspoofing, and etc and finally, myriad of others like disk encryption, instance isolation, SSL and etc, why would anyone doubt pushing documents/data through a secure channel to an application hosted on Amazon?
