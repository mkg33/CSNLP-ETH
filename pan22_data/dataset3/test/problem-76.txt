Run whoami, groups and echo $PATH (individually of course).
Most interactive invocations of docker want to be run like docker run -it --rm repo/image:version ....
Think about each of those flags a bit, and especially the significance of the --rm flag, or your next question will be about where all your disk space is going.
When running docker, you use the -i parameter to get an interactive session.
My guess is that might be all you need to do in order to get your container to behave as expected, but it might also be that you need to copy in an appropriate profile or bashrc file.
You can also set a USER parameter in the Dockerfile, you can also mount volumes.
You probably should have an image you use for logging in rather than a container - there's likely no reason to leave the container lying around in between uses.
Are you ssh'ing into the same machine you or on or to a remote one?
If the binaries are not in the PATH variable it is clear why they are not being found.
You need to install the tools for them to be in the container, (if that is what you want).
You are asking two questions, one of them about the prompt (controlled by the $PS1 environment variable in bash) and the other about the path ($PATH environment variable).
ADD and COPY can work but you need to make sure you install Everything needed.
The two questions are related in that both are usually set by a startup script used by bash.
If you need specific tools and are build an image with a Dockerfile then one option is installing them into the image there.
