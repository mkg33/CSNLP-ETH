Have you tried just importing them into Excel, and then just applying highlighting/colours to the columns?
Since the input to your problem is essentially a stream of text chopped off at intervals (the line breaks) the processing of the data has to handle input in the same way, and very few programs do so now, because, as you say, this is data generated by an old mainframe program.
You have essentially 2 options:  either a) write a file-parser yourself in Java, C#, or C++ (shudder) to give a 'preview' of the data contained in the files.
If that won't cut it then as others say, you're probably looking at programming.
So you can definitely define your highlighting rules based on those requirements.
As with so many other things in the world of Technology, you can have any two of fast, cheap, and good.
I don't know what experience or interest you have in such a thing, nor anything about your background, so please forgive me if I'm making undue assumptions.
of computer programming classes to code a parser for you.
One additional thing that comes to mind is that you might be able to use Access to parse such a file and use some VBA to create record counts and compile statistics, but as far as overlaying highlights, that would be less easy.
I asked about what the intended use of such a utility would be and based on a couple keywords ("view and verify before they send") you basically want to do the following:
Here record header is "01" which is the first column.
Below is the sample flat file with 2 records of same type.
This way we can define "regions" for more records (say Record starts with "02") with different number and widths of columns which may present in the same flatfile but will get highlighted based on the record header.
It might even turn into an open source project on sourceforge.net to free data from the clutches of the mainframe!
The lowest cost and fastest option of those presented so far, which span the range of possibilities I'm aware of as a technology professional, would be to bite the bullet, learn some vim (use GVim for Windows) and use syntax highlighting filters there.
I had a similar requirement and I found the solution using one of the samples given in ":sytanx help" screens.
Or the boss' nephew, or your sister's nerdy boyfriend, etc.
Second would be to make a series of scripts in something like sed or awk.
Or b) hire a member or recent graduate (check a portfolio first!)
If I wasn't going to code a front-end for the file, I would probably use Notepad++ as it has a way to define your own language, complete with highlighting.
The right way to accomplish this, in my opinion, (especially because, as you say, many customers still have mainframes and still get data in formats like this) is to use a custom front-end to get the information about the data to your customer.
Excel might also be of use in importing, but all the lines have to be formatted the same way, so that's still not going to do what you want.
After header record there are 4 columns with fixed lenghts given below:
You could probably write a fairly simple Perl or VBScript that'll take that text file and output a syntax highlighted HTML file or similar using something like regexes to match the patterns that you're looking for?
If you know any COBOL developers, this would be a great 1-2 night project for one of them.
Start with there instructions for changing syntax highlighting and make your way from there.
