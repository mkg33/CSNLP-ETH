This is what I wanted: http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=159
So vim-airline is arguably the best solution so far.
To open a file in a new tab use :tabnew <filename>.
I really don't mind having one more lines as the statusline.
I recently solved this problem and like to share it here in case others might have the same need.
A plugin in called vim-airline does the job decently.
Ideally, they would be lined up across the top of the screen, almost like tabs, to save room.
I am still looking for ways to display the buffer list on the bottom of the screen.
Vim 7 does have tabs, you can use these instead of buffers.
I'd like to use a few lines somewhere in my vim window to show a list of all the files I have open, and what number they are (ie, which number I need to use to switch to them).
See more info at http://vim.cybermirror.org/runtime/doc/tabpage.txt.
And after reload your vim you are gonna see a list of buffer names appear on top of your screen where tab names would appear if you have multiple tabs.
Note it won't screw up with your tab as the buffer list starts from the left of the screen while the tab list starts from the right.
Just download and install the plugin and put let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1 into your configuration file.
I'm trying to prevent having to type :ls to get the number before I switch to a window.
