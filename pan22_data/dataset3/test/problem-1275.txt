Levels 1-4 are pretty safe as most data is preserved.
It worked and mysql started again and when I use "Show tables" it shows all tables of my database but when I run the
and add beow line in your mysql configuration file
I had problem starting innodb and read somewhere that deleting ib_logfile0,ib_logfile1 files works.
Setting the level to 5 or 6 gets a bit more risky as you could lose some data.
Basically the files ib_logfile0,ib_logfile1 contains the databse table structure and responsible for identifying the path for database connection.
Other way is backup your all databases and try to recover it with force recovery.
Good to know for next try - you should validate anything from the Internet with documentation of your software to avoid running destructive opperation and keep your data safe.
Therefore you have to recover table structure from .frm files with MySQL Utilities
Your database left with structure files (so it know about databases and tables) but your data are gone.
You will be able to find all the databases in /var/lib/mysql but all the tables using innoDB database engine are corrupted and will show the database connection error, because of removal of ib_logfile0,ib_logfile1.
MySQL has structure of DBs and data in separated files.

Under the mysqld section of the config file you can add innodb_force_recovery = 0 â€“ 6.
