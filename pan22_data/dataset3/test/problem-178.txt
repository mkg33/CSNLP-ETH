I may be incorrect, but I think that the only practical way to do this using stock Windows software is to open up a blank image of the proper dimension in Paint, then add on the images one-by-one (Paste > Paste from).
They have some advanced features like creating custom layout, photo editing and adding frames which may be useful.
If I remember correctly, there has not been an easy way to do this for several years.
Still using this software is very easy and straightforward.
But, there are many third party software which allow you to do more than that and there are many such software which are fully free of cost.
So, if you want to create a album page with custom/odd no.
Reference: The images associated with different software are collected from their official site.
This has some advanced tool and custom layouts which will be very much helpful for creating a nice presentation.
If you have no qualms about using third-party software, there are many free services available online which were built for this purpose, such as PhotoJoiner, BeFunky, and Online Image Editor.
But there are some limitations, like you can keep only 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 or 60 photos in a page with that method.
Select a printer, paper size and select a layout from the right hand side (I've selected 9x13(4) based on you wanting ~4/page):
If you are OK with those limitations, then you can go through that method as that is the easiest and cheapest method.
As someone has already answered about the Print option of Windows 10, that is pretty fine to do what you wanted.
(I want to print a bunch of pictures to show to an 80-year-old man and let him have to keep.
However, I believe that there is a rather small limitation placed upon the amount of images allowed on one page.
Microsoft tends to remove certain old features which were not particularly popular.
Also, with that method, when you create some layouts of photos in a page, you have to print them instantly, else you will not be able to save the state and you will have to start from beginning in later time.
One of them is ArcSoft Print Creations which can help you make gorgeous photo album books.
I can get the "Photos" app to create an "album" (a bit flaky, but adequate), but there is no way to then print it than I can figure.
I am looking for a simple (and, of course, cheap) way to create a printed "photo album" on Windows 10 Home.
Still I am suggesting you two of the cheapest (literally free of cost) and easiest software that you may try for your purpose.
Edit: As somebody mentioned above, there is, in fact, a way to do this using the Print option in the Windows context menu.
Stick all the pictures you want into a folder, select 4 of them, right click > print:
Without having way more information to go on, it sounds like standard picture printing in Windows is what you're after.
