If you want to install a copy to the GAC, change the last line to this:
Fire up PowerShell using an elevated prompt by right-clicking on it and selecting "Run As Administrator."

Installing the new DLL was simply gacutil -i "PathAndFilenameOfNewDLL"
I found gacutil.exe on the server and ran gacutil -u dllName.DLL
How do I go about removing a DLL without uninstalling the entire application?
I am trying to uninstall a DLL from the C:\Windows\Assembly "folder" on Windows Server 2008, but am getting a "permission denied" error.
An application vendor has sent me new DLL's, with no instructions on how to remove the old version or add these new ones.
Put gacutil /u in a cmd file and run by right clicking and selecting Run As Administrator.
Gacutil is a development tool and normally isn't present on production systems.
I know I'm late to the party, but here is another solution using Powershell if you do not have gacutil.exe present.
This didn't work before, but thankfully did on my last attempt.
This worked where everything else suggested failed.
