Have you checked each machine to see if they have changed any settings?
Not basing styles on ever-changing default styles will solve the problem long-term.
Chances are that there is a font substitution occurring.
Anyone willing to check to see what menu it's under?
If a style does not explicitly override the default style in some area, then any differences between one person's default style and another's will come through.
Resetting everyone's styles back to the default will solve the problem in the immediate.
Either the kerning will be wrong, or the font won't look just right.
Check the fonts on the system, and make sure that the document is using the right fonts.
MS Word will list the fonts that are being substituted, but I don't have my windows VM running right now...
Microsoft Office will NOT inform the user of a font substitution, it will attempt to simulate the font, and that often will work on screen, but when printed, it'll look wrong.
Is there still a normal.dot (normal.dotm) file that sets the defaults for a new document?
I remember a long time ago, each user would mess with local settings and save them in normal.dot.
Word Styles are usually based on default styles stored locally.
