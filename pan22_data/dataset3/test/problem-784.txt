For whatever is true (could be a scenario I haven't thought of) the mail reached the first server in September (or what the server thought was September).
From whois, the sending IP seems to be in an xDSL block, it's quite possible that the internal mail software was unable to get on-line and queued it.
If that's a complete set of headers, there was no internal mail server queueing it up (that normally results in a bounce after 5-7 days of "unable to deliver").
Queued up in the mail client, there's no well-defined "best practices" for how long to hold on to the email before giving up, but I'd expect the timestamps from multiple mails to be (roughly) the same, if they've been queued in the client.
The client tried and tried but didn't succeed until the admin restarted the server in September.
But the problem is on the client side (either user, software, network or the like).
Yes, it's possible, if it was held in an internal queue on the sending side.
It's the same source host (84.252.254.11) and same (rather big) delay between writing e-mail (assume Date header is correct) and first MTA time in route.
This indicates that the mail was written in August.
May be forged but possible and lets assume that this was really written in August.
Tells me, that it's some Exchange, which collected mail sent from client's Outlook (without SMTP, thus we can't see real endpoints), claim as successfully received to user, but - not sent to Net nor generate NDR for users for a long-long time
This line could have been forged, too, but who should forge it against him?
But the first received line indicates the first real mail server that got the mail.
Or something else that "broke" the first server to accept the mail(s).
Or as you found out there is a last scenario: The first server was down and couldn't accept the mail at all.
