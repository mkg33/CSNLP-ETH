Hardware support, service monitoring and emergency troubleshooting is usually done by hosting co. Pricey but comfortable.
Similar to dedicated hosting, but you buy the server, bring it to the datacenter and are responsible for the entire thing.
Only part of the server is reserved for you, but as far as you can tell it's entirely yours.
Cloud hosting: A modern, and still changing, variant of VPS hosting.
Colocation: You have full admin access to an entire server.
The hosting co. only provides power, airco and bandwidth.
Generally it's more of an infrastructure than a single server.
If your website needs more than basic performance you will probably suffer from the 'noisy neighbours' who share the resources.
I don't think there are official definitions for these terms, and there is some overlap, but here are the basics as I understand them:
Often used for creating a dynamically scaling infrastructure, or for running temporary test servers.
Shared hosting: You share a server with multiple customers.
You manage the entire server, including the operating system, security and backups, although you can usually start from a pre-installed image.
Has about the same profile, but can usually be paid and used by-the-hour.
Examples: Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud, Slicehost, etc.
The hosting co. takes care of the server, the operating system, various supported applications such as the LAMP stack, including upgrading and configuration.
Dedicated hosting: You have full admin access to an entire server.
The hosting co. optimizes the infrastructure, including network, storage, loadbalancing, firewall, webservers, etc., to provide high-throughput, low-latency service.
The server's hardware is usually leased or purchased from the hosting co. and hardware maintenance is done by them.
You have privileges only in your own user account and can't modify the server's config.
Has an API so you can programmatically create, start, delete servers.
Media hosting: Usually an extra service built on managed hosting, built for serving 'media', such as video streams for popular content.
You basically take care of your web app and its data.
VPS hosting: You have full administrator access to a slice of a server.
Can include specialized software such as Flash Media Server.
