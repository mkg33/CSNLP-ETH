Tools->Options->Backup has Backup files and directories by following symbolic links/junction points selected.
Any help on how to get BUE to make a proper backup would be greatly appreciated.
we got a backupexec 12.5 server and a "backupexec for windows servers linux agent" (sigh) running on one of our linux boxes.
These checkboxes read: "Preserve change time", "Follow local mount points", "Follow remote mount points", "Backup contents of soft-linked directories" and "Lock remote files", but apparently changing those options produce the same result.
Looking at the selection list, the symlink shows as a 1k file on BUE.
These same checkboxes are selected on the Job Setup->Job Properties->Edit Template->Advanced
Additionally, all the checkboxes are checkeced on Tools->Options->Linux, Unix, and Macintosh and on the Job Set->Job Properties->Edit Template->Linux, Unix, and Macintosh.
Ok, we are at a loss here trying to backup a linux box to a backupexec server...
When a backup runs, we get exceptions reported for our symbolic links.
