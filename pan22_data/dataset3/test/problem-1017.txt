In both cases you describe, Windows Installer tried to execute a custom action located in a DLL.
While the error message is on screen, go to your temp directory and see if the temp DLL file still exists.
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25 and
Those .tmp files: C:\Users\x\AppData\Local\Temp\MSI570C.tmp and C:\Users\x\AppData\Local\Temp\MSIA32E.tmp are really DLL files extracted from the MSI.
In my case, the DLL wasn't missing--the installer didn't have permissions to access the folder.

I'm guessing its a problem with Windows Installer.
Alexey Ivanov's response didn't quite help me, but it did, however, inspire me to investigate C:\Users\x\AppData\Local\Temp.

I have two most probable possible candidates: Visual C++ runtime is missing or .Net runtime is missing.
Searching on error 1723: This error can occur if you have an out-of-date version of Windows Installer
I tried what Dimadima suggested but I still had a little access issue.
Nevertheless, after going to Properties > Security on the C:\Users\x\AppData\Local\Temp folder and giving that Everyone the Full control permission, installers that previous had been failing now worked!
I dug up a tool for Win 7 / Vista called take ownership.
I got a couple of links for Windows Installer but neither of them has Windows 7 on the list of supported operating systems.
Then to find out which DLL of the required ones is missing, you can use depends.exe utility from Visual Studio.
Since Everyone already had Read and Write access, I suspect that Full control also added a necessary Execute permission.
The most important thing is to find out which DLL is missing.
I've tried restarting the service but to no effect.
What I wonder, now, is how this happened in the first place, and what the correct permissions on this directory are supposed to be.
It adds a contextual menu to right click and you can 'Take Ownership'.
If the temp file is already removed, the only way to get the DLL is to extract it from the package, from Binary table.
Anyway, like many things in Windows, this whole thing is a bit of a mystery to me.
I'm not able to install anything that ends with .msi.

I didn't try running the installer as an administrator--this didn't make sense to me considering I was already using an admin account and would have expected UAC to handle privileges elevation.
