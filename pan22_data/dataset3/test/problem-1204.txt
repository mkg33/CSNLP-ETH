I'm fine with removing this gateway as I don't want the internet going through the vpn which doesn't have internet access.
Best case, I would like to avoid adding the gateway during ifup vpn_vpn but still have automatic adding for all other interfaces.
I know that the gateway I am trying to remove is always 192.168.30.1 because that is a setting I have made for the VPN.
I think I may have finally come up with an answer.
My problem comes from the fact that in order for me to get the Pi to have internet access I end up having to remove the gateway that is automatically added whenever vpn_vpn goes up or down (ifup/ifdown).
I've been setting up a VPN server on my Raspberry Pi 3 (latest Noobs) which has worked wonderfully.
I haven't modified resolv.conf or dhclient.conf but I have them below because I have a feeling they may need editing or provide clues.
The command I use for removing this gateway is: sudo ip route del default via 192.168.30.1 .
How do I prevent this gateway from even being added when the interface comes up?
I'd still be happy to hear if anyone comes up with another solution that might work.
The VPN creates an extra interface called vpn_vpn and my normal internet is on wlan0 or sometimes eth0.
I'm fairly sure it has to do with dhclient somehow though I don't know much about dhclient.
I require this because I want to maintain the ability to have the pi work on different networks without hard coding for eth0 or wlan0 please.
