I am not sure why ESET thinks this is a good feature.
where you can manually download and install all third-party root certificates that are distributed via the Windows Root Certificate Program.
Yes even the good owes like Google, Yahoo, AOL... etc.
Your problem might be that your new computer is missing some root certification authority (CA) certificates.
With an old Notebook (Samsung N150 - win7 starter), I have successfully used the freeware version of Windows repair.
The solution was to turn off "SSL protocol filtering" completely.
See this article: Windows root certificate program members
No matter what web page I went to, the invalid certificate warned me of the web page.
There we about four or five programs that were installed on the same day.
This is interesting, since the same problem occured on 3 other computers since I sent that email.
I first rebooted in safe mode as told by the software and re-installed the windows version (Win7 32).
The solution may be as simple as looking on your control panel for the newest programs that were loaded most recently on the same day and deleting them.
About four days ago my browser started posting an invalid certificate on every web page.
Internet Explorer/Internet Options/Connections/Local Area Network (LAN) Settings  and uncheck the Proxy Server box.
Once of them was named Browser Safeguard and it was installed on the same day as the other four programs so I deleted it too then rebooted.
For example I had the same problem by ESET Smart Security on win7 and win8.1 systems.
I already sent and email to their support, but according to them the problem is with my system.
When you look at this issuer of the certificate it says DO_NOT_TRUST_FiddlerRoot.
