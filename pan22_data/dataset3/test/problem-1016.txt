As an alternative, you can use the following command (no need to add execute permission):
however when I access it I receive the following error in the logs "sh: /home/knock.sh: Permission denied"
If you're running in Enforcing mode, you can troubleshoot SELinux problems by disabling SELinux temporarily:
If you're running in Enforcing mode and this still doesn't work, check your audit logs at /var/log/audit/audit.log.
If you're running in Enforcing mode, which is the default, you'll need to change the context of that file, because Apache can only execute files with the httpd_script_exec_t label by default.
 I created a new user and added it in the apache httpd.conf file but is still not working .
If you are running the script as the appropriate user, you may need to add the execute permission +x to the file.
If the script runs, re-enable SELinux with setenforce 1 and start looking for where the problem is with your configuration versus the system's SELinux security policy.
Any advice how to set the permissions or how can I grant more access to the user to make it work would be highly appreciated .
