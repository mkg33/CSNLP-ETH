Cached credentials will ensure that as long as you have access to the server once a month or so while logging in, you don't have to be connected to the active directory to log in)
Ideally I'd like a short/insecure Windows login password which takes me to an account associated with my Microsoft account.
With Windows 8.1, Microsoft appears to be pushing users even harder towards signing in with a Microsoft account rather than a local user account.
If you are savvy enough to setup your own personal LDAP server and authenticate against that, you can use whatever password you want with the LDAP server and still have it linked to your Microsoft account.
Untick "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer."
I don't want to make my Microsoft account less secure just to log onto Windows more easily.
It's a shame (in my opinion) that Microsoft didn't add a 'Use a simple password' option too for exactly my scenario - but I assume that having two passwords would be too confusing.
My Microsoft account has a secure (long, hard to type/remember) password, which is fine when I'm logging in to a website because my password manager helps - but that's no good for logging into Windows.
