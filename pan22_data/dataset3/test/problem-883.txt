I did not see the timeout value on the Apache log you pasted.
You get 503 "Service Unavailable" because all the servers are considered dead by Apache, because they don't answer fast enough under load, because your timeout is too short.
Take a thread dump at the time issue occurs, you will know which thread is getting blocked and henceforth blocking other threads too.
Meanwhile all AJP ports get used and eventually Apache dies.
We had the same problem and changing the timeout on Apache httpd.conf file from 300 to 1200 fixed it.
But this issue has nothing to do with Apache settings.
Generally speaking, NEVER configure a timeout under 5 seconds anywhere.
It's way too short to process some requests (especially if you're doing load testing at 500 req/s).
The timeout will consider servers to be dead if they don't answer within 1 second.
Note that once a server goes down, the 2 servers left receive +50% requests and their response time will increase significantly, to the point they'll probably instantly timeout as well.
