Thanks, if I missed any information please let me know.
What if we connected a USB keyboard to a USB to RS232 converter, connected that
We bought the adapter, but it works the other way around.
It adapts legacy RS232 devices to modern USB ports.
 to the module and then connected it to the computer, would that work?
We really tried everything and haven't found any solution, but I really believe there MUST be an easier way to perhaps trick the computer into thinking we connected a keyboard to it's COM port even though it's USB keyboard, even something like a software emulator.
We have an old converter that has a PS2 keyboard input and converts it to RS232 which then connects to the computer.
We'd like to switch to more modern, ergonomic USB keyboards and unfortunately the company that makes these adapters no longer exists.
In my workplace we use an old software that accepts keyboard input, but only from a keyboard that's connected to a COM port.
Because these converters aren't cheap and we already blew a lot of money on this, I wanted to ask here if this solution will work or do you guys know any other solution that might work.
This product claims to convert any old RS232 peripherals to USB port and they also include drivers to trick the computer into thinking it's RS232.
