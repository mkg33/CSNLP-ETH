You will not be able to connect your Pegasus RAID to the Airport Extreme.
No chance to use iTunes with your media on your NAS on the go, latency is too high and bandwith too low.
If you want to offload data (moving iTunes to an NAS works, but requires some hacking - I guess this will be possible using iPhoto, too), think about how to backup this data to another disk (as this data will not change too often, maybe a regular copy started manually to a cheap external hard drive will be fine)!
iTunes isn't build for NAS access, it works quite fine using gigabit ethernet (fast ethernet and great wireless reception will be fine too, I guess), but not over the internet.
I never used an Airport Extreme as NAS, so I cannot tell for sure, but as far as I know Mobile Me (now iCloud) and "Back to my Mac" will replace DynDNS for you.
A RAID in the NAS extends availability, but will not help you with software/user errors - user errors are most common reason for data loss, also with advanced users/IT guys!
If you use it with another router, you will have to setup some port forwards (best would be to configure the Airport as "exposed host").
I do not recommend using DD-WRT without extended network knowledge - it offers a lot of possibilities, but this extends complexity a lot.
If you use another NAS, you will have to configure DynDNS and port forwards.
In the past, Apple has changed the way Time Machine talks to the Airport multiple times and each time something broke with the other manufacturer's products until they updated their software.
If you really want to use Time Machine Backups on your NAS, I would recommend an Airport Extreme.
You can access your files on your Airport Express from "the internet" if you use it as your router or configure some port forwardings properly.
If you want RAID, choose some system which (also) offers USB connection.
Put your hands on iCloud which promises much for this use case!
Like an Airport Extreme, but with integrated hard drive.
Maybe future Airport Devices offer Thunderbold, but until then you will need USB.
