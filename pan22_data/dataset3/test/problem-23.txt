On Linux with zsh (http://www.zsh.org/) you could achieve it in this way:
The Ubuntu package is xdg-utils, also probably installed already.
On many systems, you can use xdg-open myfile from the xdg-utils suite.
On Debian or Ubuntu, see myfile or edit myfile opens a file in the application that's associated to the file type through the mailcap mechanism.
And after it zsh will always execute my_app youfile.abc when you just enter youfile.abc.
For example, say I create a mime type associated to every file with the pattern *.abc.
This opens the file in the application that's associated to the file type through the Freedesktop mechanism.
I appreciate this behaviour in Windows, wondering if Linux/Gnome could do that too.
Lets say I associate this file type to application 'my_app'.
If I have file 'my_file.abc' in current folder, what I want is that when I enter only 'my_file.abc' at the prompt, it executes 'my_app' feeding it with 'my_file.abc' as first argument.
Using gnome terminal (Ubuntu 10.10), is there a way to execute the default application associated to a file type, only by typing its name, as it is possible with Windows ?
You could use the binfmt_misc facility for something similar, but you're probably better off just passing it to xdg-open.
I don't know of any unix shell that allows you to execute any file in this way.
The command is from the mime-support package, which I think is installed by default on both Debian and Ubuntu (and anyway it's in many packages' dependencies, so it's probably installed already).
