I always keep a few of them around for situations where I want to know for sure how things are going to act.
There are alternatives that can be considered, also.
And with that adapter I mentioned above they work fine with gaming headsets that have one plug for both.
While you would connect the ear pieces (usually green to an output port).
They work on PCs and Android Tablets with no extra software.
For those you will need a suitable jack on your sound card.
You are fortunate if you have separate jacks for each.
When you go into one or the other you are presented with whatever the computer thinks is connected so you can set a default, set levels, etc.
In Windows, if you right-click on the speaker icon you will find that there are both "Recording Devices" and "Playback devices" there.
If you have a gaming headset with just one plug for both you will need an adapter to split them apart.
As it was pointed out a microphone is an input device.
Most computers are smart enough to switch over to them when they are inserted then back to defaults when they are removed.
Another kind of headset would be the ones found on gaming consoles like the XBox and Playstation which usually only have a single cable and a 4-pole adapter.
For less than $10 you can get a universal USB sound adapter.
The green one is always for speakers or headphones.
I'm not entirely sure about the compatibility in regards to standard jacks.
To directly answer your question:  The difference is how the software works with them.
Hence you need to connect it to a input port (red microphone on most soundcards).
