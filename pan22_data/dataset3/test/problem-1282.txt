The t-tag announces the epoch time when the key has been created.

My question: do i interpret the information correct, or is something wrong in how gmail interprets the DKIM tags (t, x).
When looking at the source of the message, i see the following information related to the specified tags:
So this value should change (unless both messages were signed at the same second), even if the same key is used.
In the DKIM RFC 6376 I can not find the mention of any relation between the time of the key creation and either the t or x tag in the signature.
After having configured DKIM several months ago for a specific domain, i notice the following which i cannot explain.
The x-tag announces the epoch time when the key expires (assuming i have my information correct.
In this situation, where t is always equivalent to the current time, the signature would always be valid.
Today, sept 5th i sent 2 emails (test and test2) from that specific domain to my google account.
They are the creation/expiration time of the signature, not the key.
DKIM has been configured with the following relevant (for this question) tags:
In my assumption the t-tag should be the same in both messages: the epoch time or seconds since the epoch time the signature has been created.
In our configuration, the expiraiton time has been set to 1 year.
So regarding the tag values in gmail, the signature will always be valid for 1 year.
On the other hand, the difference between the current time and the expiration time (the x-tag) should vary.
