How you do it is described here: http://communities.vmware.com/thread/333786?start=0&tstart=30
You might this way find what the difference is and how to correctly convert the Windows version of the files to Linux.
However, I have looked at the files that are created and I have found no folder name anywhere.
On the summary page, check out the Advanced Options where you can select either to remove or keep your snapshots.
You can copy the directory from the VMWare host that contains the virtual server with snapshots and copy to the new server and then create a new virtual server and use the vmdk that you copied for the hard disk for the new virtual.
a snapshot of identical name on both systems and study the differences.
There is actually a really nice tool from VMware itself called VMware Converter.
Unfortunately, what your are asking cannot be done.
It can be downloaded here: http://www.vmware.com/at/products/datacenter-virtualization/converter/overview.html
My first thought was that the reason that the simple copy of the VM with snapshots is not enough, was that VMWare keeps somewhere a folder name.
In order to move a virtual machine to a new VMWare host, you must delete the snapshots, or commit them to the base image.
If you are in a secure infrastructure I would recommend to turn of SSL.
My idea is therefore to investigate the possible differences between the snapshot files
where it takes a long time to convert machines if SSL is enabled.
As for the host machine OSs being different, that does not matter.
in Windows and Linux : Take a simple VM without snapshots and copy to Linux, create
