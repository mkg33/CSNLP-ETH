I don't think it wise to think of sky drive as dropbox by Microsoft.
The only prob I have had is with the naming of files.
Could you try exiting SkyDrive (right-click the icon in your taskbar, then choose "Exit"), then starting up Process Monitor (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645), setting an include rule for SkyDrive, then starting up SkyDrive again?
Interesting, have you tried reinstalling the SkyDrive client?
Within a few minutes, each computer started syncing with each other.
I believe that when I created a network share for x:\cloud\skydrive folder, it stopped syncing with each other.
I jumped on Skydrive for the first time last week (July, 2012)
After a few days, I saw that each computer was syncing with skydrive.com, but stopped syncing with each computer.
I removed the network share but it still would not sync.
I use more than one OS and bring files into Windows.
I remotely connected to each computer, exited skydrive and verified on skydrive.com that the connection was lost for each computer.
If the file doesn't have the correct permissions, they won't sync, and it won't tell you why.
Other than that, I guess just try reinstalling it.
Whatever the prob is if you right click on the update center and open it (orange icon with an arrow in your task bar) then read the error messages you should be able to solve the conflicts manually (there is a drop down menu to resolve conflicts).
I've lost countless files like this, to both Dropbox and SkyDrive.
Then I double-checked that the skydrive folder was not shared and restarted skydrive on each computer.
This is not like dropbox it is a bit more careful as generally these are business documents.
I attempted to just close skydrive and start it up didn't work.
My fix is to start up task manager and kill the skydrive process and then start skydrive backup it backup again
Dropbox is for any old crap - skydrive is a hook to 365.
If you check the areas on the disk it's accessing/writing to, you should be able to see what file it's working on.
I've found that it's usually a file permissions thing.
