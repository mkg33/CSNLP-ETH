If I need to increase the number of video cards - what would be better - put 2 banks of video cards with 3 in bank using SLI, or 3 banks with 2 in the bank?
Foud nice project VirtualGL (http://www.virtualgl.org/).
Would linux recognize that and properly use all banks of video cards?
Server: Gentoo Linux on AMD Phoenom II x6 3.4Gz, 8GB RAM, 2x NVIDIA 9800 GTX in single session with display resulution 1024x768 on client.
c) any suggestions on good thin clients supporting 1920x1080 HDMI video and 1Gbps network
Is that a must to use managed switch for better network performance?
I understand that my questions can't be answered clearly (unless someone already managed to use this kind of stuff ;)) although any suggestions would be very helpful.
a) what would be better for network - 1Gbps Ethernet or Fiber (clients are distributed in max 20m around server)?
b) Should I increase number of video cards to put in SLI on server (going to use Gigabyte GA-890FXA-UD7 which has 6 PCIExpress slots [2 x4, 2 x8 and 2 x16]).
Going to increase network speed to 1Gbps (using either Ethernet or Fiber) and run 5-6 clients simultenously.
Tried to run 3D fames (EVE Online, Prototype) on server and display the output on thin client using 100Mbps network.
