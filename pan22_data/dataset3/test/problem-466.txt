Ethernet and similar standards operate on MAC addresses, yes.
Hosts on a LAN can get IP addressing from a DHCP server, be statically configured, or configure themselves with link-local IP addressing.
For hosts on the same LAN, a router serves no purpose.
Traffic delivered on a LAN is delivered by the layer-2 LAN addressing (MAC addresses for IEEE LAN protocols, e.g.
On ethernet, the source MAC address on a frame is the source host's MAC address, and the destination MAC address on a frame is the destination host's MAC address.
Only frames destined to the management interface of a switch (as a host on the LAN) would be addressed with a MAC address of the switch, otherwise, the hosts do not even know the switch exists.
Routers route packets between networks, not from a network back to the same network.
A router is what you require to connect your LAN with something else - another LAN, the Internet, ... With a router you also need to use a routable layer-3 protocol like IPv4 - nearly always there's an IP network anyway.
Repeater hubs just transport each frame everywhere (except back to the source), switches automatically learn the distribution of MAC destinations on the network and forward each frame accordingly.
Most often, there's also TCP/IP on top of the LAN network (physical layer and data link layer).
Frames are addressed with the source and destination host layer-2 addresses.
Using obsolete coax Ethernet (10BASE5 and 10BASE2) you don't even need a hub, just a common cable.
The source node sets the desired destination MAC in the frame and the network transports it from source to destination.
ethernet), but the network stack will still have addressing for the other layers in the stack, such as the layer-3 (IPv4, IPv6, etc.)
Again, a router plays no part in traffic sourced and destined for the same LAN.
With just two nodes you can even run a simple cable between them with any Ethernet variant (though some might argue that isn't a "LAN" yet).
