If my guess is correct then how can I avoid the cache of my files by Internet service providers?
I have a web server in which I used to keep files for my customers.
If my guess is wrong what might be the other reasons for this?
After 2-3 days the problem gets solved automatically, but I canâ€™t make my clients to wait 2-3 days.
I have cleared the browsing history, cache also reset the Internet explorer but the problem was still there.
So I think some Internet service providers are keeping the cache of web for the speed purpose.
Recently I have noticed a problem while reading that update.txt, I have replaced the txt with new one but when read that via browser it was still showing old txt.
So I changed the internet to another ISP then problem solved.
Even I deleted file from web server but still I am getting old file.
I have a txt file named update.txt and I used to refer that for update purpose.
I was getting complaint from some of my clients that they are not getting updates at right time.
