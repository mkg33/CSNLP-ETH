The problem I've encountered is I can't enter the BIOS nor the bootable USB containing the Ubuntu image.
Let me know if there are command I could run to illuminate the problem.
Because I can't enter BIOS this is also how I've tried to boot the live USB.
I recently replaced the motherboard of my PC, and thus, I'm having to do a fresh install of Ubuntu (my current OS, to be alongside Ubuntu, is Windows 10).
Strangely, I was able to enter the BIOS briefly after installing the new motherboard, but I no longer can.
I have two graphics cards and have tried plugging the monitor into both.
The motherboard is an Gigabyte X99-UD3P if that's of any help.
That said, both GPUs show up as fully functioning in device manager, and both worked when I was using the previously installed motherboard.
In addition to the standard means of entering BIOS, by pressing DEL, I have tried forcing the machine to restart into the BIOS.
Both show a black screen when trying to enter BIOS or the bootable USB, but for booting Windows, only one of the GPUs displays an image.
