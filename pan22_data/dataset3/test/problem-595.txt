This will require a ADSL Modem (can get a draytek too), have much more throughput, more vpn tunnels (All in one price - no additional licenses), robust firewall and DUAL WAN too.
Assuming there is anything of value on the network, you need a firewall.
It also doesn't charges for any VPN Licenses, just a one off purchase and you are good to go.
Apart from Wireless N, this is a Dual WAN router, supports ADSL/ADSL2, you can even get a cheap ADSL Modem and plug another ADSL line into the 2nd WAN port, or if you have a 2nd Cable Internet connection or a leased line terminating on Ethernet, that can directly go into the 2nd WAN Port of this router.
I'd be very tempted to use a seperate device for your wifi requirements.
Then natuarllly you betterk now what you are doing - that is higher end pro stuff.
1/ Use whatever ADSL model the DSL provider gives you, and keep it on bridge/pass through mode.
I understand the Cisco 887MW has support for 802.11n grade networking, but I think you'd be looking to pay considerably more.
a 2820VN supports VOIP too, but as that is not your requirements you can get a 2820N.
Then get an Mikrotik 750 o 450 or one of their G counterparts to do the routing for you.
The protection from ADSL routers are barely sufficient for a consumer home network .. not for a business.
Both of the above routers will work either in Failover or Load Balance Mode, in LoadBalance Mode the router automatically load balances outgoing traffic on both lines.
You can probably pick one up on ebay for a couple of hundred bucks no problem.
You can setup policies / firewall rules for specific traffic to go out via a specific wan port.
I've never seen an 802.11n class device actually able to sustain 300Mbit throughput.
They support ADSL and ADSL2+ (some even support Annex M), have builtin wifi (not n, but certainly a/b/g), and support up to 10 VPN tunnels.
Cost effective and feature rich...have never had any problems with DrayTeks - support is awesome.
