I had RDP set to run full screen which turned out that the resolution was too high to support 32 bit color, so it was dropping back down to 16 bit automatically and silently.
I've got the colour depth set at 32 bits and can confirm that 32 bit colour is working properly because I'm able to use Aero over the remote desktop connection which requires 32 bit colour.
The problem is images still look crap and have all sorts of colour banding as if they were still being sent as 16 bit images, even though the connection is supposedly 32 bits.
I also connected to a 2008 server box at 32 bits and confirmed from the server side that the connection was using 32 bit colour.
Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 use a version where changes to compression and the codec etc were made, I believe, and there were changes made to it that cause banding and similar to occur even when you use 32-bit color (in the interest of higher speed, I presume.)
As soon as I ran the remote desktop at a lower resolution, 32 bit color worked as expected.
I'm planning on using the connection for image processing and as such need the full colour depth in the images otherwise the environment is useless to me.
It is possible to change this; it will increase bandwidth and load and lower speed but it should alleviate the banding issue.
I'm using RDP to Remote Desktop from a Windows 7 machine to another Windows 7 machine, so it's RDP 7.
Setting a DWORD in registry at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\AllowDynamicColorFidelity with the value of 0 (in the client, not the server) will make the banding go away.
