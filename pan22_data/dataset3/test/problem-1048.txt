If there are 200 hosts total or less on a network and traffic doesn't need to be segmented for any reason, why add the complexity of VLANs and subnets?
If for instance we gave PDUs their own VLAN it doesn't mean we always have to give small groups of devices their own VLAN.
And this gets into the whole more vs less VLANs argument that will continue on for ever.
PCI) is a pretty good catalyst to segment off some portions of your network.
These days with everyone using at least 100 Mbps switches and more often 1 Gbps, the only performance related reason to segment your network is if you're suffering excess broadcast traffic (i.e.
If a group of devices doesn't need to have it's own VLAN and there are no advantages to doing so, then you might want to consider just leaving things as they are.
Splitting up networks that normally wouldn't need to be can make some things easier though.
If it's a single site, don't bother unless you've got more than several dozen systems, and even then it's probably unnecessary.
Security and quality mostly (as long as the network segment in question can support the nodes in question of course).
The main other reason is security, i.e DMZ for public facing servers, another subnet for finance, or a separate VLAN/subnet for VoIP systems.
Limiting scope for any compliance requirements you may have (i.e.
If you expect to scale up (you are building a network, not just 5 servers and that will we that) start routing as soon as possible.
Not a huge deal, but we don't need PDUs to be scanned.
So in short: when you scale up to where you think you need spanning tree, please consider routing instead.
I think the scope of the organization matters a lot.
Also it would be nice to DHCP the PDUs since they are a pain to configure, but since they are in the same VLAN as servers right now, that is not very feasible.
A separate network for printer traffic, voice/phone, isolated departments like IT Ops and of course server segments, internet-facing segments (one per internet-facing service is popular today, not just "one dmz will do") and so on.
But the larger the scope, the more it might make sense.
For instance, our PDUs that supply power to servers are in the same VLAN or subnet as the servers.
This means our vulnerability scanning system used on our server range also scans PDUs.
Way too many networks are unstable and hard to grow because they grew organically and have way too much layer 2 stuff.
But in general subnetting a small network will not gain you much in the way of performance.
While we don't need another VLAN for the PDUs, it can make some things easier.
Segmenting off your payment acceptance/processing and finance systems can save money.
