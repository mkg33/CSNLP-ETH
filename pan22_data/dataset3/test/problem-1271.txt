We have an OpenBSD router at each of our locations, currently running on generic "homebrew" PC hardware in a 4U server case.
I use it at home and I'm pushing it at work, its a really well put together alternative.
I'm currently thinking of moving the systems to some HP DL-series 1U machines (model yet to be determined).
There are several people using it in commercial / production situations that are active in the forum.
Due to reliability concerns and space considerations we're looking at upgrading them to some proper server-grade hardware with support etc.
These boxes serve as the routers, gateways, and firewalls at each site.
At this point we're quite familiar with OpenBSD and Pf, so hesitant at moving away from the system to something else such as dedicated Cisco hardware.
As said by sh-beta OpenBSD as a LOT of good features: pf is amazing, tcpdump, lot of good tools...
FreeBSD has pf and ipfw that you can use simultaneously and also has non-GIANT networking layer.
On OpenBSD everything is "a little bit complicated".
In particular, the configuration is fast and easy.
OpenBSD can't fully utilize modern SMP systems (i.e Core2Quad).
I have used OpenBSD 3.9 as a firewall and switched to a Juniper SSG5.
for ex: the bandwith management is -in my opinion- a lot easier to configure on the SSG.
The OpenBSD version I used was quite old; Maybe newer version are better on this point.
They even have a VM image for download to test it out with!
I'm curious to hear if other people use a setup like this in their business, or have migrated to or away from one.
pfsense Is a great FreeBSD based firewall, its very feature rich, easy to setup, and has an active community as well as support options.
We've been running software FreeBSD routers as ISP gateways for years, this saved us a lot of $$
