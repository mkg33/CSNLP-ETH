This screen will have an Advanced button that you should click.
The result is that no user account on your computer has the ability to do anything with the file or folder.
Delete whatever you want, since Windows won't be able to say "No."
To fix this, right click on the file (or it's containing folder to ensure you get everything), choose Properties from the context menu and then the Security tab in the dialog that opens.
99 isn't an error number â€” it's the name of a file or folder inside the folder you want to remove.
Boot your system using an NTFS-aware Linux distro, say an Ubuntu liveCD.
Once you find it, it's just complaining about a permissions error.
This is likely because certain things in users' profiles folders are set up to only have permissions for that user and no one else, and are set not to inherit permissions from their parent, or for some other reason all permissions on the file were lost.
Joel's answer is half right, you need to activate the security tab first, go to control panel > folders options and the second tab(i forgot its name) in the end of the list with options there is something about advanced folder management(again i don't know whats the name in english) once you do that you can then set permisions for your user in the security tab as mentioned before.
You should now be able to use this window to take ownership, which will assign new permissions entries to the item and finally allow you to delete it.
If this does not work, you could boot up with a linux live cd, mount the hard drive and delete the folders from within the linux live environment.
I would try running chkdsk first as Jeff suggested.
