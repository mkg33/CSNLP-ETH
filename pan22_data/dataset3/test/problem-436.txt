I tried (in vSphere Client) to Add Networking -> VMKernel -> Use vSwitch0 -> check vMotion and Fault Tolerance... and I get an error "There are insufficient licenses to complete this operation".
If this is a brand new installation of ESXi, you may need to go to the console of the VM and log in (it's an orange and black screen), and configure your management network from there, to make sure it's got an IP address etc.
If you really did install ESXi inside Workstation (again...
You need to make sure that VMWare Workstation has a bridged network connection for the NICs you have exposed to your virtualised ESXi instance.
), you need to set the network mode of the VM in Workstation to bridged.
ESXi will then effectively be on the same network as your computer, and you can either assign it a static IP address or it will pick one up from your DHCP server.
vMotion and FT are advanced, licensed-only features of ESXi.
I want to connect from my laptop to the ESXi Server.
On my PC I have installed ESXi (WMware Workstation) & vSphere Client.
I dont know how to connect or if this is the way to do it...
If you've only added one NIC to your ESXi installation, then it's just a matter of loading the vSphere Client on your laptop and connecting to the IP address of the ESXi instance.
