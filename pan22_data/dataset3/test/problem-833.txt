Also, a misconfiguration of the switch could lead to a security hole.
You should probably have a good look through their various specifications and choose the one that gives you the right feature set.
Now your firewall has exclusive access to all the tags and can enforce ACLs that prevent one subnet from accessing any other DMZ subnet.
Depending on your security needs, if you have a good modern switch you can make each dmz a vlan and just use one port, and then have the rules separating each dmz on the router.
You need a switch that also speaks 802.1q vlan tagging.
If I had to guess, I'd say to choose the 5520 or 5540 models..
You might be able to save some money by having the DMZ ports on a VLAN which is then distributed by a managed switch.
One of the Cisco 55xx series ASA hardware firewalls should be what you're after.
(It's difficult for me to do this, not knowing your exact set up currently).
Also choose one which will  give you room to expand in the future.
There are arguments against this though, there used to be ways to bypass vlans (vlan hopping), but I think there is nothing current.
Now, add all those tags to one interface on the firewall (thus creating a "VLAN trunk") and run that "trunk" to a switch that also has those VLAN tags associated with that port.
Now -- configure each of your DMZs and associate each DMZ with a different 802.1q tag, lets say the tags are 10, 20, 30, and 40.
You need a firewall that understands 802.1q vlan tagging.
Now, put several other interfaces untagged on each vlan and connect those untagged ports to the host computers.
Ideally it will have at least one gigabit interface.
If you want High Availability, you'll need 2 of these, that support Active/Standby configuration.
That way, you could  trunk multiple DMZs traffic over a single port, with a virtual interface (You could do this on your FreeBSD box too, might save you having to have a quad port server NIC.)
