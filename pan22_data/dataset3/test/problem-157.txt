Keep sending Google feedback that they screwed up.
Revisiting the sites still had them adding their search definition to Chrome.
It doesn't cover all heuristics employed by Chrome to determine when to add a custom (other) search.
As such, only Google can truly provide an option to enable/disable the automatic addition of search engines along with an option, when enabled, to prompt the user instead of automatically adding.
From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch and https://www.chromium.org/tab-to-search, I wonder if an extension that redefines the application/opensearchdescription+xml MIME type would nullify OpenSearch elements in a web page; however, maybe trying to change this MIME type's definition after the document (page) has already loaded (DOMContentLoaded) would be too late.
That shows the code for the "Don't Add Custom Search" extensions.
After a couple revisions, I re-reviewed his extension in Aug 2018.
Looks like we have OpenSearch.org to blame for autodiscovery of search descriptors.
I doubt Google is publishing any documentation on what decision tree that Chrome uses to decide when to add a site's search string to the list of "Other search engines".
Upon repeated revisits of sites that want to add their search definition, some still succeed - which means this extension fails.
Outsiders have to guess from observed behavior but that means getting the triggers wrong or not catching all of them.
From the Chromium article, this extension author is using method 2 with an event listener.

The "Don't Add Custom Search" extension is still incomplete.
