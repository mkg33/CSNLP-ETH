The green vector is compared with the blue one and the orange one.
I am trying to find an appropriate distance measure that reflects the differences of the vectors seen in the image below:
I was also thinking to "split" the vectors in the middle and treat them as bags of two subvectors (like in a multi-instance setting) but then I would not know how to combine the two resulting distances in one.
You could start with regression and go from there to more complex methods (simple sometimes is best).
The features are ordered but I am also interested in the case they were unordered.
Or since you mentioned "phase shift", time (and/or frequency) -- giving you a time series.
You mention that order is important, so that can added as a feature.
In both cases, you then can bring in all kinds of tools.
So the results are as expected (from a "bag of single feature distances").
Therefore the straight line would look "the same" as the blue and the orange line!
Most of the distance measures (like the Euclidean for example) would yield the same value despite the "phase shift".
Vectors contained in a sliding time window vs. population, is something you maybe can also consider, we did a solution like that once.
That would allow you to yield similarity metrics between single or multiple vectors.
From the explanation, it seems that the feature you are considering is distance.
