However, after restarting the Netlogon service all Active Directory related DNS entries were back.
The Microsoft DHCP server has an option to update DNS records when DHCP leases change.
I got the following message in the event log after I had to delete and recreate the DNS zone (emphasis mine):
As mentioned, ipconfig /registerdns will force registration, but your comment that it doesn't work "for a dropped and died computer" is confusing.
A DC's records are a lot more than what is registered with ipconfig /registerdns.
/dsderegdns will tell the DC to unregister it's records.
will "try" to register the A and PTR records of the machine you are running this command on in the DNS servers the NIC is associated with.
A DC registers numerous service location records (SRV records) such as records with names starting with _ldap and _kerberos.
I only had to recreate static machine entries manually.
You can delete them all from DNS and they will eventually all show back up.
If you change the IP manually or if it receives a new IP via DHCP this should be automatic.
nltest /dsregdns run from a DC will tell that DC to register it's records.
If the DC is dead, you can't run "nltest" so there does not seem to be a utility to clean the dead DC's records out of DNS...
This should happen automatically (for windows machines on your domain as long as 'register this connection's address in dns' is checked under dns tab).
I already tried the nltest.exe /dsregdns suggested in another answer here, but that didn't work for me.
If the machine is off the network or powered off then there is no way for it to register its address.
