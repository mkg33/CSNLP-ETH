It already happened 3 times and all I was able to do to solve the problem was reinstall it from scratch.
You may need to do a tail -F /var/log/xensource.log and restart toolstack xe-toolstack-restart, see the output for errors.
Other people said It could be /var/xapi/state.db that is corrupted, but I've already checked it too and its XML structure is just fine.
Searching around, I've found some people saying that it could be a partition that runned out of space, but that's not the case.
I'm currently testing XenServer 6.5 to be used on the production environment of my company.
No explicit error spotted in /var/log/xensource.log.
Every single time it happened, messages like those on http://pastebin.com/VkVxdMsU appears on /var/log/xensource.log when trying to start xapi.
However, whenever I test its behaviour when facing an unexpected shutdown (i.e.
: power outage), xapi service won't start anymore.
If no luck, you may have to consider reinstall using the install CD (it will keep stuff in local storage, just be careful).
Trying to bring it back manually produces the following output:
You can try to rename it and start toolstatck, it will generate a new state.db (but settings will be lost).
I'm about to give up XenServer cause it doesn't seem to be that reliable.
