There is no list of 1-to-1 package equivalencies between distros, because there is no 1-to-1 equivalence, and even if there was, it changes on a regular basis as packaging evolves.
The quick and reliable way I use is experience -- deep knowledge of the way Debian packages work is usually enough to tell me what the package name will be (with perhaps a quick apt-cache search to confirm my suspicion).
I think you're doing the whole conversion spectacularly inefficiently, though -- rather than playing whack-a-mole with a lengthy turnaround after each whack, you'd be better served reading through the entire recipe at once, looking at all the packages (and everything else, like file locations) and translating from CentOS to Ubuntu as you go.
There might be one or two things you'll have to fix up that you missed, but that'll be a lot quicker than finding every single thing that needs changing one at a time -- and you'll pick up things that Chef won't error out on at all (like the aforementioned file locations problem).
