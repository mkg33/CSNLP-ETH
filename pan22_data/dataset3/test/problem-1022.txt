The answer is to upgrade to a 64-bit version of Excel.
You need 64-bit MS Office so that it will be free to use RAM above 2GB.
So if you have 4GB of RAM, set it to 6144 / 6144MB min/max.
I think it's because the 6G PC has a lot of excel add-in on it consuming RAM as well.
It looks like you construct very large Excel sheets.
When I run excel/vba on the action "Calculate Sheet" (The current worksheet only), the program would pop the following error message:
The Non-working Computer can handle data within 100,000 rows of data
on neither I "refresh" a pivot table in (Excel or VBA)  or "Calculate Sheet" in (Excel or VBA)
One possibility would be to increase the size of the Windows page file.
In any case, it's possible to test: disable the extra RAM and see if the problem goes away.
So it doesn't matter if you have 16 or 32GB RAM even.
EDIT:I am thinking of removing the formulas, and move the logic into vba, and do it by caching the data maybe per 10,000 rows.
I also notice that on my development PC, it is using ~ 1.2G RAM, and the non-working PC, it is using 900M RAM prior to clicking the "Refresh"/"Calculate" Action.
Only then will your extra RAM of 6GB be actually useful to Excel.
My worksheet contains: (Inside a single worksheet, not workbook, there are formulas in another worksheet)
"Excel ran out of resources while attempting to calculate one or more formulas"
Any help is appreciated, please point me into the right direction or simply give some clue.
It can address a much larger memory range, and is also just generally much faster and the right tool for the job if you have a big spreadsheet.
32-bit applications can only use up to 2GB of RAM, unless they can be configured to use up to 3.2GB with a special "switch".
But this won't solve my problem if "refresh" pivot table would show the same error.
And the reading http://www.add-ins.com/support/out-of-memory-or-not-enough-resource-problem-with-microsoft-excel.htm suggest why 6G RAM PC is facing this issue rather than 2G RAM PC.
It was a known problem in 32 bit Windows (and an even bigger problem in 16 bit Windows).
One possible reason why it might run out of resources on a 6GB machine, and not a 2GB machine, is that Windows itself takes more resources to manage 6GB of memory than it does to manage 2GB of memory.
So Excel 32-bit is actually running out of memory after 2GB.
I set it to 1.5X physical RAM and set minimum and maximum pagefile size THE SAME.
Otherwise, it is stuck with having to figure out how to run with only 2GB of RAM, and most likely, will start using the pagefile on the hard drive.
So be careful trying to make formulas ready for data expansion, keep the ranges small :)
DO_CALCULATION(D1:D100000) will take significant amount of time and memory even if only cells D1:D10 have any value.
It is supposed to be solved on 64bit systems, but...
old queston but still valid for all the versions, I run into similar issues when the formulas I used had too big scope even though most of the fields were empty, ex:
