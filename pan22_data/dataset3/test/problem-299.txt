As usual, users, who have dynamic IPs, can send mail only with ISP's SMTP server.
We spot check the rejections periodically and, in the few years we've used, it have never found anything other than spam being rejected and received no complaints from users.
This forwarded mail would get us blacklisted even though we had no control over the sender and didn't want to limit where customers could forward their mail.
This is especially an issue with hosted domains where users setup their boxes to forward to a variety of external locations.
The second issue was the obvious one of users with infected computers sending spam without their knowledge.
Depending on the size of our userbase it may be worth the effort but if you're in the same position I am contacting hundreds of thousands of users is probably not feasible.
These restrictions were put into place in response to three problems we were having which were causing blacklisting and greylisting of our mail servers.
You could work around the shared IP space problem if you tied your access authentication system to your mail relays and only allowed relaying for IPs where customers are actively logged in.
Nowadays users can send mail without authorization inside the network, but  sending mail to internet requires authorization on the SMTP server.
But I see, that some providers permit sending mail to internet with their SMTP server without authorization.
These policies have had the side effect of allowing us to contact users and alert them to possible infections.
As others have mentioned - what is spam for one person may be legitimate mail for another.
In a corporate setting, I would also notify an administrator of any virus senders, and use this as a red-flag that that user's workstation needs attention.
What an ISP needs to do and should do is very different I think, from what other entities need to do and should do.
In other words, to address the situation where a user's computer has been compromised, and is sending mail without the user's consent - particularly when attempting to self-propogate by sending mail with virus-laden attachments.
The first issue as you mentioned was abuse of webmail services.
The purpose of this questions, is to understand pros and cons of filtering outgoing mail.
Personally I wouldn't allow any unauthenticated email to go through my server.
As for the authentication question it would be nice if we could simply request users use authentication, but its a reality that you most likely have users that were setup without it.
Unless your user-base is extermely homogeneous, I wouldn't filter outgoing mail for spam, but I WOULD filter outgoing mail for viruses.
The third reason involves users having mail forwarded through us to an external mailbox.
You mention dynamic IP space for customers, and if its IP space only available to your users where you keep records of who's authenticated to what IP, I'd say that the auth check on email relays are not worth the effort.
Thereby I can protect my network from been banned for spam.
To my knowledge there are no pre-build systems that do this though so you'd probably have to roll your own.
I work for a fairly large ISP and we have Spamassasin setup to filter mail on our outbound relays and policies in place to restrict the amount of mail users can send in a certain period of time.
If instead your users are using shared IP space from a 3rd party provider or you don't have the IP records, the auth check is worth it.
Secondly, authenticating to your server doesn't prevent the user from sending spam and is no guarantee that you won't end up on a block list.
The Spamassasin thresholds and policies we use for these relays are no where near as strict as they are on our inbound servers where we can still deliver the mail to the users spam folder, so they only catch only the worst of worst.
I think that the main purpose of filtering outgoing mail would be to limit virus propogation.
I would recommend that you perform some type of filtering on all email that transits your server, both incoming and outgoing.
