I currently rely on the facilities provided by my self built Windows Home Server to back up my PC, but in the past I used Acronis True Image
I use Rebit, it's the single closest thing to OS X's Time Machine that I've found.
I've used a number of other pieces of backup software in the past and all of them took too much effort to keep your files backed up.
You can install it on every computer in your house and have them all backup to the same location which can either be one of your computers, an external drive on one of your computers, a network location (SMB), etc.
On the downside, you don't have as much control as other software gives you.
You pay if you want to backup to their cloud servers.
Then I wrote a file archiving system that I can run from the command line which connects to the instance running on my AWS server and so I have a scheduled task that zips everything up and sends it off every night.
I bought the software version, not the software-and-drive version.
The information that's really important to me is mostly source code for projects I'm working on.
Do you want fine-grained control over how often the backup runs, what time, which files are excluded?
Do you want backup software that you install and then forget about?
I currently use it by having a small Linux box with 4TB of space, running headless with CrashPlan.
There is JungleDisk, Mozy and BackBlaze for windows which will backup to a remote location.
I have a home server with mirrored drives running source control so that makes an on site back up of sorts with triple hardware redundancy.
You plug in an external drive, tell it to use the drive, and then forget about it.
