If you need to fully erase tapes before backing up to them I strongly suggest getting better backup software than the minimalist Windows Backup.
While Windows Backup might get the job done, it's a long way from full featured and you'll find yourself hacking things into working the way you want.
Is there a specific way they need to be formatted or titled in for the drives to work properly?
Most new tape drives interpret "format" to mean "full erase", avoiding the problem.
Formatting a tape in a standard drive might destroy the tape.
Once all of the jobs on a certain tape expire, it knows it can re-use the tape.
This is unsupportable in the long term and will require a myriad of documentation to properly maintain.
I have also just recently bought brand new tapes for the job.
I have just recently graduated college and have received a job working at a web development company.
How do I go about formatting a new tape so that in future uses when it is inserted into the drive, the data will be erased and replaced with the newer backups?
Essentially, I will be using "Windows Backup Utility" to run the process.
The software knows what backup jobs are on each tape and knows when those jobs expire.
I currently have a Quantum DAT Tape Drive connected to the server that I wish to back up.
Any decent backup software will take care of this automatically.
I have been assigned the task of setting up a proper tape drive backup system.
Unfortunately I am not as experienced with tape backups and need some help.
Older drives/software may not and will commonly eat your tape.
