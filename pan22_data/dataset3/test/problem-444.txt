Go to your ISP's web site and find out what DNS servers (if any) they recommend.
It shows ALL processes, services and programs which starts with Windows
Try use this tool to detect.. the rest you could find on Conficker removal tools:
You could also try the Google DNS servers at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
Do this before and after you've cleaned the system.
I have a problem with a virus in windows 7, I don't know what kind of virus is infected my OS, I installed kasersky antivirus, and clear all detected viruses.
You should now be able to see all the anti-malware sites.
If you know main processes of your Windows, you can find and delete virus easily.

First try to browse this page first, see if you were infected:
Then open the local area network connection properties dialog, select "Internet Protcol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" and then select the "Properties" option.
Set this to the IP addresses specified by your ISP or change it to the "Obtain DNS server address automatically option".
After that I can't open any antivirus sites, can't ping any antivirus sites.
I tryed any antispyware/antimalware softwares, but null results.
But the best way is obviously to take the required measures in advance and load your system with good http://www.antivirus4u.co.za/>Antivirus Software.
It is happening due to that only and these infected programs does not allow you to register to any antivirus site.
They do this so that you can't easily get to the sites you need to clean the infection off your machine.

In the "General" tab of the next dialog there is an option to set the DNS Server.
Actually the main reason behind this is that the virus has infected your system to a greater extent.
I think Sysinternals' AutoRuns can help you to find , stop and delete that virus.
You'll probably find that the DNS server address has been changed to one controlled by the malware writers.
The best option to get rid of this is to run your system in safe mode and install an antivirus and then make the updates in the system and delete all the unwanted programs from the system.
