Apparently, this "shortened" cable then does not act like an antenna and pick up the radio stations.
It turned out that the TV/radio card's FM tuner didn't always turn off.
Sometimes it's French, which also makes little to no sense.
Googling for strange noises coming from speakers didn't really get me anywhere.
It was based on BT878 chip which was plugged into line-in port of the soundcard.
I had a similar problem once with a TV/radio card.
Get some of the various "ties" (used to keep your cables untangled) and tie up/bundle each of the cables.
It appears to be software, hardware or virus related, so I thought I'd try here, seeing as Ghostbusters is just a film, so I can't call them.
Once again, I'm perfectly sane and this really isn't a joke.
I was picking up some Mexican station and this worked for me.
I'd suspect it could be some sort of crazy virus, but I've been randomly killing processes whilst the poltergeist is active and it hasn't killed it, so I'm not sure about that.
Chances are that something is picking up a radio station through another channel somewhere and the speakers just amplify the signal.
There's what appears to be a radio stream coming out of my speakers, except I can only hear it when the volume knob is turned down to the min setting whilst the speakers are on, which makes no sense.
The speakers are Logitech 5.1s, I forget the model number, and I'm running XP 64bit.
Has anyone heard of a virus that can do this and affect the volume controls on the hardware in that way?
Perhaps other people have had this problem but have been too afraid of the reaction to ask anyone (please don't have me committed to an insane asylum).
I've no idea if there's a suitable Stack Exchange for poltergeists.
