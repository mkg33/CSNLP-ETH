Unfortunately I don't think that Cisco publish their how their FSM are working and you have to understand the log yourself or ask the TAC or SF ;)
You just need to see the FSM state as described after the error message (from bottom to top as you correctly tell).
So you got an error in the state machine of IKE AM.
(UDP port 500, ESP, HA, UDP port 4500, ... depending of your configuration).
It seems that you have something dropping packet between the 2 VPN Peer.
So this trigger an authentification problem (EV_PROB_AUTH_FAIL), so an error (EV_ERROR) and finally the FSM reach its end (AM_DONE).
You have to double check configuration at both end, and double check that all necessary port and protocole are open.
So this mean start you started to communicate with the remote peer but never get any answer.
You sent AM_SND_MSG2 (EV_SND_MSG), nothing was comming so you send it again (the NullEvent) and finally the FSM timeout by waiting AM_WAIT_MSG3 from the remote peer (EV_TIMEOUT).
You may also want to check the debug on the remote peer to see if AM_SND_MSG2 is received.
