I designed s3s3mirror to get going immediately, to use 100 concurrent threads (configurable), and to make modest use of CPU and memory.
Once that's done, you can then rsync from the mount point to your local disk.
Here's the link: https://github.com/cobbzilla/s3s3mirror
If you decide to give it a whirl please let me know what you think and if there's anything that can be improved.
You could try mounting the buckets with fuse using s3fs.
You can use the "s3cmd" utility with the "sync" option, although I stumbled on your question because I'm trying to figure out if this syncing mechanism is screwing up my duplicity backups.
I was having the same problem so I whipped up a little program specifically designed to mirror one S3 bucket to another; I call it s3s3mirror.
This way all of updates to original bucket will be automatically synchronized to S3 bucket in another region: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/crr.html
For online synchronization of buckets you can use cross-region replication.
Keep in mind that it requires versioning enabled for the bucket so if you do updates/deletes of objects in buckets much you'll want to enable lifecycle policy to delete old objects.
I did try the "s3cmd sync" approach first, but I had a bucket with hundreds of thousands of objects in it, and "s3cmd sync" just sat there, not doing anything but consuming more and more memory until my system died.
