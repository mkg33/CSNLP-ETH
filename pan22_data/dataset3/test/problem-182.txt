In which your web farm consists of the servers 55.32.10.7,55.32.10.8.
You are about to migrate to a new webfarm, and you want to make sure that both the internal hosts are updated, as well as the external hosts.
It might be possible to contact the provider, ask to speak with an engineer, and explain the situation to them.
If I have your scenario correct, then what you want to do is take a zone transfer of both foo.com and bar.com.
I'm a DNS noobie so please execuse me if I have the DNS terminolgy wrong.
Some of the these alias are managed by the internal IT department and others are managed by external ISPs.
As people have already answered this approach won't work.
So I am wondering if there is a way to do a lookup against DNS using either the main site name or the IP Address to get a list of all the sites that are aliased to that site?
Once you have these zone files, you'll want to use grep a few times to track down the appropriate hosts:
However, with a webserver like Apache you might be able to achieve your goals by parsing out the domain name of the http request in your logs and then piping it to uniq then sort.
Yes, you can do this if you have the co-operation of both your Internal IT Department, as well as the external ISP that is hosting your DNS.
I think that you are describing a scenario in which you have zone files that look like the following:
I'm in the middle of moving our public facing internet site over to a new farm with a new set of IP Addresses.
They might be able to help you by pulling their records or configs for you to look at.
My site has several alias setup that point main site name.
Alternativey, you can provide the DNS Administrators for these servers the queries that you are interested in, and they can run them for you without having to bother about providing a full zone transfer, which, for administrative and security purposes, may be a problematic request to service.
Though, you'll need them to configure their DNS server to allow a transfer to the client you are making these requests from.
