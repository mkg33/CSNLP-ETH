If your curious just how insecure a DVR can be, check out the following article.
It wouldn't take a semi-professional malicious actors more then a few minutes to exploit many DVR's and jump into your corporate network.
Final Note: I am a security professional, so if I sound paranoid, its unfortunate that Ive seen to much reality.
The Router currently prevents external connections from accessing the DVR.
IF you have traditional coax cams this is ok so long as you dont mind making your cameras available to everyone in the world.
You could also standup an openVPN server for little to no cost if thats of interest.

Is there any way I can bypass this managed router (at least temporarily) and connect the DVR directly to the outside world using another switch/router between the modem and managed router?
Connect the internal (LAN) port of the modem to the switch.
DVR's are not known for their robust security features, and are generally easily exploitable.
I am attempting to allow access to a Security System DVR from outside our network, via IP.
Cisco ASA's have this ability although it may require an additional license.
Then create the "hole" in your firewall for access to that subnet, that way someone can't jump into your corporate network from the DVR.
Have you every wished you could RDP into your computer to get the grocery list you saved on your desktop ;).
(you could either use another port on the Cisco for it, or use a VLAN if your infrastructure supports it).
To reiterate what joeqwerty said, yes this can be done as he described.
Create a separate subnet for the DVR and IP cameras, if applicable.
Setup a remote VPN to allow authenticated access to your internal network,  This could be used for more then just reviewing the cameras.
HOWEVER if that DVR is connected to IP cameras then I can't stress enough NEVER, EVER should what you asked be done.
Frankly punching a hole in the firewall to allow outside access in isn't much better, your still enabling the world to potentially have access to your internal network via a DVR.
We currently have a managed Cisco router connecting to the outside world via a cable modem provided by our ISP.
Connect the external (WAN) port of the router to the switch.
There are a few ways you could accomplish this and maintain a generally accepted best security practices posture.
The company managing the router is willing to put a hole in the firewall to allow access to the DVR but are unable to do so for at least a month.
If you setup an ACL for that "hole" in the firewall and only allow connections from specific IP's then its likely an acceptable risk.
Or you can place a 2nd router between the switch and DVR as you described.
If so, what would be the best method to go about this?
This is is the equivalent of leaving the the office unlocked at night with computers logged in.
