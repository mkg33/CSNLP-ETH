Get better software to base your code on, making sure you can write clean, portable code in it that doesn't alter the code of the product.
If you can't update it, can you limit who has access to it?
Assuming you find out that the problem is with pligg (seems likely, as you've said it's an old version, and I've never heard of it, so it's probably not got a lot of eyes looking for bugs in its code)...
Although if the point of entry was not your through the web application, they might not be that forthcoming (not a judgment on them in particular, just a cynic view of people in general).
Maybe move to a vps so you can use iptables to restrict access to certain IP address.
Upgrades should then be clean and compatible, barring any small and infrequent necessary changes that the product release notes explain.
My guess would be that if you're using some older software, then some script kiddie has run some tool to exploit.
I would start by filing a ticket with via Dreamhost portal and see what they can find out for you.
You may be able to contact Dreamhost to see if they can offer any insight, but I would guess they can't
Having to customise software so much that it's no longer upgradeable to new versions means that it's badly designed.
Most of them have comments, how they have been made possible, so you can:
Get away from pligg, since it seems to have failed you.
It is sometimes useful to check script-kiddy sites for exploits .
