Be sure to select only the ones you want to delete!
well I know what I'm doing and I know there may be duplicated key-id(s), but there seems no way to force to delete them, though the following doesn't work, too:
Export the keys you want to keep, delete the file and then recreate your ring.
Not answering the original question, but might be useful for someone else.
Use gpg --list-secret-keys --with-colons --fingerprint to generate the list of fingerprints in an easily parsable format.
It's accident generated a bulk of secret keys (without public key) in the GPG key ring,
The following command generates all secret key fingerprints.
and I have written a script to delete those keys, but GPG doesn't allow me to do that:
I combined the answers by Gilles and Dolanor into this one liner that is useful in case you want to delete a specific key:
Grab the lines of the form fpr:::::::::xxxx: that correspond to the keys you want to delete, and pass the fingerprints (the xxxx) to gpg --batch --delete-secret-keys.
