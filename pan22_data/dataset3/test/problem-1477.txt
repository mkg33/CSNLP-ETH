VMWare Workstation on Windows plus VMWare Fusion on OSX plus VMWare Workstation on Linux definitely adds up.
Simply put, it does what I need, it works fast and I find that Snapshots are a time saver (and a God-send!).
I have 2 VM's running 24x7 on my laptop, and even though I have a lot of programs open, my CPU averages around 3% on idle with it occasional touching 0%.
I have had good experiences with VMware Workstation, it does what I need when I need it.
I run it on Linux for my development purposes, but it runs equally as well on Windows.
When testing "Windows Virtual PC" on Windows 7 I discovered that it doesn't support 64 guests at all!
My choice is usually VMWare, but Virtual PC is free and, except for the USB issue, generally adequate and up to the task.
It is a little more work to setup and I personally have not spend much time comparing performance.
That being said, I know a lot of people prefer and use VirtualBox.
You could use VMWare Player, but then you lose snapshots.
When it comes down to it, I do not look at price if it is something I need work related - as long as it works and does what I need.
Note that VPC is not an option if you need x64 support.
One widely known problem with Virtual PC is that it often has troubles accessing the host USB ports.
I beleive that this also has some good snap-shotting stuff in it, however I cannot vouch for it as I only used it briefly on Linux.
I think VirtualBox should be on the list also since it has all of the main features folks have listed in other answers:
