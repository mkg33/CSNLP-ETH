I know VLC is about the best all-around media player, but the plugin is the cause of my iteration of chromium-browser hangs, which it never recovers from.
Click on the menu at the top right of the window and click on settings.
I have had this problem, but have found a solution:
Scroll down to advanced settings near the bottom of the page, turn off "use hardware acceleration".
First, remove Chrome or Chromium and restart your system.
My system used to freeze up with Chrome, Chromium and Opera.
You could also try terminating them one by one to see if you can find the problematic one.
Have you tried using some different browser for a few days to make sure that this is a Chrome problem?
Uninstall VLC's plugins for rendering any type of media.
I have filed this information in a more detailed Google Chrome bug.
Install either Chrome or Chromium and start it but do not try to resize it or move it in any way.
Have a look at the Chrome Task Manager to see if it's a particular tab, extension or plugin that is struggling.
