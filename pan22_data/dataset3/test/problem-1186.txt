This gives me time to rolling restart app with new db credentials.
I assume that there must be some time after client must re-authenticate.
A PostgreSQL instance will keep a client connection up and running until the connection either reaches a specified client timeout or the client (application) closes the connection.
I have an app running Ruby on Rails, standard nothing fancy at all.
A client connection is a one time authentication and if it was valid at the time of authentication will keep on being valid until closed.
Tried to find something on https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/runtime-config-connection.html but still don't know how it works in details.
A change of password has no effects on existing connections and will only affect new connections.
How long Postgres will keep those connection active?
Open connections still work, because was authenticated with old credentials.
Today when I was changing password in Postgresql I spot that app is still running with old credentials.
There is no mechanism that constantly checks if the connection is still "password valid".
