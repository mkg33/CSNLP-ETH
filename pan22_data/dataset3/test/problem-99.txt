If you're looking for a recommendation, I've been quite happy with Debian Squeeze + Xen and the cli tools for management.
Do I need to roll my own solution here, and just forego the advantages of having a hypervisor OS with remote administration tools?
Even with some janky workaround in place to allow some degree of administration from a Linux or OS X machine, every solution I have found requires Windows for at least one component or one step in the process.
Take a look at oVirt - web GUI that works in FF or Chrome, all of the nice enterprisey features
There is also a web-based configuration option, which can be used instead of the vSphere Client.
I'm looking into deploying a small (one or two host servers) non-production virtualization initiative for our company.
We need it to be high performance and host shared resources for a number of users.
From everything I'm reading, neither product currently supports any OS other than MS Windows for using their remote admin tools.
I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for Citrix or VMWare to get around to supporting other operating systems, so I'm pretty open to any alternatives.
This would be a major expense to introduce an unwanted element into our environment, and I would very much like to avoid it.
Neither option is feature-complete when compared to the Windows versions, but it may do everything that you need it to on a one/two host environment.
Even live migration of dumU's between dom0's works from the command line.
Our company has been running quite happily for over a decade without deploying any Windows machines, and this does not seem like a.
Or is there some way of managing these systems with third-party tools that I'm not yet aware of?
I don't want to set up a Windows VM or partition just for this purpose.
Where I'm hitting a snag is the administration side.
Or, maybe you can get away with a single Windows workstation/VM for advanced config.
With vSphere 5, there is a vCenter Virtual Appliance, so you can have the management of vCenter without a Windows server.
I'm moderately familiar with both VMWare ESXi and Citrix XenServer, and know that we would be happy with either.
It has both KVM and OpenVZ support and the management is entirely through webconsole.
