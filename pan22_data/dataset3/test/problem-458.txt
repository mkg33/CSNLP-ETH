HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Group Policy\State\Machine\Scripts\Startup\#\#, where # is numbers, it shows the real ErrorCode 0xfffd0000 (4294770688).
I ran get-help about_signing and it tells me i have to sign the script with a digital certificate from a CA or self-signed cert.
I ran get-executionpolicy and it's set to "Restricted".

This is an old topic but the answer most likely is there are SPACES in the filename and/or path of the PowerShell script in the Startup Properties of the GPO.
To fix simply put double quotes around the full path of the PowerShell Script Name that is not running in the Startup Properties of the GPO.
Now I have to figure out how to install WMF5.0 on each workstation without WSUS or suck it up and sign the stupid script.
A lot of work just to write a Windows 7 powershell logon script.
When I attempted to run the script from the \domain.local\netlogon folder, it gives me an error that the execution policy doesn't allow running remote scripts.
This is due to the script not being found - due to the space(s).
However, it runs without a problem on systems with a higher version of Powershell (Server 2012 R2, Windows 7 with PS5).
Late reply, but your problem is probably the default of 2012 to delay logon scripts.
The EventLog is no help it shows ErrorCode 0 ScriptElaspedTimeInSeconds 0.
If its a computer policy, authenticated users isn't what you want.
Now in GPResults the Last Run for the script shows it ran.
The registry, at the key above, shows ErrorCode 0x0, which is normal.

I think PowerShell scripts run remotely from a Windows share are considered part of the Internet, so you have a few options:
This solved and fixed solution is tested on Windows 7 Enterprise.
I did not need to change permissions but AUTHENTICATED USERS with Read permission was present which allows the Computer Object to Read the PowerShell script.
I ran set-executionpolicy remotesigned but that didn't help because it's not digitally signed.
