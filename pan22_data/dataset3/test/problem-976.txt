I don't think you can change an Active Directory domain user's accounts SID, as the SID is a system-only property, so the option to change a user's SID is not a viable one.
There's a good discussion on How to view an Active Directory / Windows domain user's access token?
I really don't think it will help, but if you want to try "migrating" the SIDs to an actual account you can try this software: http://www.forensit.com/domain-migration.html
But as a local admin you can change ownership of that folder (including subdirectories and files) and than access them.
One possibility might be to try and use a Windows Access Token Viewer to see what all groups a user belonged to, and based on that information, you could try and re-provision access.
I have used it to migrate local accounts TO domain accounts, but never to try what you are attempting...but it might allow you to reactivate that local SID that isn't associated with a user account.
That's what all the warning notices were about when you removed active directory.
Prior to 'editing rights' for the user folders as you talk about.
Your options are pretty much recover the AD domain controllers from backups made prior to removing AD or accepting that the users have gone and settling for recovering their data; Laurentiu's answer is correct in that regard, you just need to read it carefully.
Like RobM has said...you are probably out of luck.
you need to take ownership of the folders if you need to get to the data.
It seems like you may have to just pull your backups and perform an auth restore.
