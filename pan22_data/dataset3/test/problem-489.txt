Can I buy any other DDR2 memory modules, or are there any other gotchas out there I have to beware of?
I'll take a slightly different approach here and caution you to consider what applications you are running before you go to the trouble/expense of adding more RAM.
I recently upgraded by computer from WinXP to Win7 x64, and now I want to take advantage of the fact that I can use more memory.
FWIW, in the past I've purchased my RAM from newegg.
And as was already mentioned, the most important thing, aside from getting the specs right before you order, is to go with a supplier which warranties the memory it sells and whom you can trust to "be around".
According to Speccy, my current memory is 2x2GB DDR2, PC2-6400 (400Mhz), and I have another 2 empty slots.
My approach was to look over the offerings, find the ones that matched my system, and then wait to see how prices went.
Get the same or better specs if possible, but check your motherboard manual for spec or size limitations first.
Frankly, I think almost all of the time Windows 7 just doesn't use the extra RAM.
In my case with the apps I'm running (mostly watching video or web surfing) the 4GB I already had was sufficient.
I've had good luck with Crucial and not entirely bad luck with Corsair.
Depending on what you do on your system you might actually benefit more by spending the money on another component.
While adding more RAM is a usually a good way to improve your system's performance, I've noticed that unless you're frequently using applications which you know will benefit from having a large amount of RAM you may not see much benefit.
I found lots of different brands and specs of other memory modules online, but none identical to mine.
The cheapest memory is from online stores - but I'm a little nervous about buying something that isn't compatible with my computer.
A while back I increased the RAM on my Core 2 Duo based system from 4 GB (what you have) to 6 GB.
