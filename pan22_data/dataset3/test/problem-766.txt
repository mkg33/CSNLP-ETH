The fixes present in 5.1.67 cumulative from the beginning of 5.1.
The concept of "applying patches" is not meaningful in MySQL unless you are building from source, and even then, it's not really a question that has an answer, since they don't release "patches."
Upgrading should not be a problem within a release series (although you should always have backups, of course).
When you say "applying patches in MySQL 5.1.67," do you mean applying fixes found in 5.1.67 to a server of a previous version?
Within a release series (e.g., 5.1.x) the functionality of the server should not change after the series reaches General Availability, and the release notes will document any incompatible changes that are introduced.
I ask that, because, at the time of this writing, 5.1.67 is still a very recent release and I would contend that "so many bugs" is not a phrase that describes this release at all.
It also should not be a problem going from series to series either, as long as you follow the instructions and don't try to skip over a major release series.
It (5.1.67) is very stable and is, in fact, my current production release of choice for everything based on 5.1.
To have these fixes, you have to have 5.1.67 because changes made to 5.1.67 would often depend on other changes made to intermediate versions.
