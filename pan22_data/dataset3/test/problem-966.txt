I just want to create a predetermined list of songs, nothing fancy, thus I simply want to do this on Windows Media Player rather than on another overly-complicated music players.
I'm currently creating a playlist for a school play on Windows Media Player 12.
The songs are already on the list (on the Play Tab), I'm just dragging songs up and down to arrange, and playing it at the same time to hear its effect.
There are times that I need to search a particular song on the list but there is no search feature for the Now Playing list.
I also tried to save that playlist and search on it using the Search field, but it either search directly on the library (rather than the Now Playing list) or show the message:
It can at least consist of 200 short-length songs (1 minute at the least).
If I remember correctly, there is a search feature for it on the previous versions since there is an entry for Now Playing on the left library tree.
Is searching directly on Now Playing playlist possible or should I do it the long way?
