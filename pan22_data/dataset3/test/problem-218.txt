Based on your original question, and the code you posted, you're missing a shebang line which you'd need to run your PHP script this way.
Also - I would try using the full path to the php executable.
I'm not a fan of emailing cron output, partially because people always think it's ok to spam the output to 'root', and I'm the one who receives that email.
Also, if you only changing the directory so that the files are in the current directory, you can always modify the cron to be:
Of course replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path to your PHP install.
Add the folder containing the "includes" folder in your include path.
You only need this initial line to run it as a cron job, not if you're running it from the browser.
Usually it is '/usr/bin/php' but you can issue 'which php' to double check that for your system.
Check /var/log/cron and see if it is actually being run.
Your cronjobs may not be configured to send email, or email on the system may not be working.
Right now, these scripts may be sending their output to the bitbucket, and you won't know why they are failing.
If it is, try sudo -u   to see if it gives errors.
Since in most cases we're talking about 1-2 lines of output, I suggest you log the output of your cronjobs to syslog.
