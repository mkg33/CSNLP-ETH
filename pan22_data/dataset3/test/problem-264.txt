However, when I add appearance animations, the slide just displays all the screenshot images immediately, before any of the bullets appear.
In Powerpoint 2016 I am able to add the order of the picture:
On several slides, I have a screenshot image that I've positioned right after the bullet I want the image to be associated with.
I want to use "appearance" animations so I can step through the bullets with the space bar.
Scratch the part about "custom picture bullet"; I think I misunderstood what you were after.
You can't do that if all the text is in one text box; instead, add the text as a series of text boxes.
If I have it correctly, you have several lines of text that you want to have appear in an animated sequence and you want a screenshot image to appear at the same time the associated line of text appears.
For each text box, add the picture you want to have appear with it, group the picture and the text box, then animate the groups to appear one at a time.
It seems like PowerPoint treats the images as "floating", and not associated with the bullets.
Instead, use Insert | Text Box for the first one, format it to taste, then duplicate it to create the remaining text boxes.
You can't use one of the "click here" placeholder text boxes to do this, by the way.
One person in another forum suggested "try using a custom picture bullet for the text or using individual lines of text, each grouped with the screenshot image and each animated individually", but I don't understand these strategies.
