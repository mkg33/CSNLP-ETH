Not all mobo swaps, however, will cause this to happen, but it might.
There are two main issues when swapping everything around your harddrive:
It all depends on which motherboard you're using and which you're replacing it with.
The only problem I've faced when swapping hard drives between different computers (which is basically what you're doing; forcing the OS to run with completely different hardware) was looking for chipset drivers (or motherboard drivers).
This shouldn't be a problem if you're using a genuine Windows version.
Otherwise you should be able to just do a repair on the install and keep all the data, no guarantees though I have had fail and work... You might also want to make sure the power supply is adequate for the new processor and as Bloodphilia mentions the hard drive uses the same connector (IDE, SATA).
You can expect all kinds of errors if you just repaalce the motherboard.
I suggest replacing the processor as well if you replace the motherboard ;).
Also, windows may require reactivation after that.
Another thing that might happen is that Windows XP requires a re-activation after the swap.
These drivers are used by the OS to allow you to use the motherboard's built-in hardware, like the ethernet port, etc.
