When I send an email to a gmail account, using an ip which is not either of these- the email still reaches my inbox.
fail (google.com: domain of me@example.com does not designate 99.9.9.99 as permitted sender) client-ip=99.9.9.99
I have a domain whose SPF record looks like this: "v=spf1 mx ip4:6.7.8.9 -all".
While the behavior of the receiving end may not always be reliable, it's definitely worth having there in case the receiving end does respect SPF in some way.
The behavior on SPF mismatch is entirely up to the receiving end, and considering how frequently SPF is configured incorrectly (or out of date) a lot of providers won't reject based on a mismatch (even with -all instead of ~all).
It is common to see the spam score bumped because of a mismatch, and maybe even a match receiving a spam score decrease, but even these aren't always the case either.
To the original question: Gmail is DMARC compliant, and so if you want to enforce policy, you should publish a DMARC record with p=reject or p=quarantine and Gmail will then apply your policy when SPF and DKIM fail.
The record is valid, and to my understanding implies that allow mails only from:
When I look at the headers, it turns out that google did manage to read my SPF record as I intended it to be, and knew it should have failed, and yet it didn't
