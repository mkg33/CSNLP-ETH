You're currently using a lot of Activities, consider using Fragments instead!
Remember that enums can have constructors and methods in Java!
Take a look at Oracle's tutorial for an example on how enums can be used.
10,000,000f is not one float value, it's actually three floats.
A better name would be displayInputRequestToast or similar.
Use @Override on methods whenever possible, such as for onCreate in BaseUnitActivity.
You're throwing exceptions in an onClick method for a button.
Those aren't caught anywhere and is likely to cause your application to crash.
Here's some things I've found by skimming through your code a bit.
Speaking about onCreate in BaseUnitActivity, it is not needed at all since all it does is call the super method.
It looks like a whole bunch of magic numbers to me.
Do not throw exceptions there, show an Alert dialogs or Toast instead!
Android however, doesn't really support Java 8 code yet.
When you need a context in an activity, you can use this instead of getApplicationContext().
Consider adding a comment where you're initializing it to explain it better.
If it needs access elsewhere, it's a better practice to expose a public get method.
There is more things that can be said, but this should get you started:
I expect you want this to be accessible to subclasses, so you can use protected instead.
You're using it at other places, but you should use it everywhere possible (Except for Log.d stuff)
Your if-elseif-elseif-elseif-else sequence can be improved dramatically.
Then you can use a switch on the enum, or compare using ==.
