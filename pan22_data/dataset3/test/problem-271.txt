To toggle between windows in both Chrome and Safari, Cmd ` works if you don't have your windows in full screen mode.
Cmd + ` is the shortcut for juggling windows on Mac.
Did you make multiple copies of "Google Chrome.app" so you can launch multiple instances, and that's what you see in the dock?
Free little app for switch between windows previews of the same application
Mac apps generally only have one instance, even if they have many separate document windows open.
This should also work for nearly every other application for OS X.
If you have another localisation you could try cmd+"left-bottom-most" key.
It's possible that although you have many copies of Chrome in the dock, maybe you've only actually launched a single instance.
Or did you minimize some Chrome windows to the dock, and it's the minimized window icons that you see in the dock that you're thinking are separate instances of Chrome?
To use the keyboard to switch between windows of the same app, use Command+` (backtick, above the tab key, at least on my US-Qwerty keyboard layout).
I'm not sure what to make of your comment that "there are many others in the dock".
