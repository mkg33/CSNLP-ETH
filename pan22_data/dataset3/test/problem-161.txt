Some tweaking would be required to keep the DHCP domains isolated -- since this creates one broadcast domain.
And place each guest lan into an isolated, local-only VLAN.
when a packet with vlan-id goes into an IPSEC tunnel which is an interface actually to a router(it is a forwarding action for a router), typically a router will strip the vlan-id and put the rest of packet into tunnel.
Then let routing and VPN(s) (tunnel or not) handle everything.
This is why you cannot make it on most of the routers(not just Cisco) unless you clearly tell the Router not to do this stripping which is a functionality should be implemented.
(as could several other methods) Bridge "VLAN 10" (whatever interface that may be) and the tunnel interface, and it should work [tunnel and vlan remain layer-2 interfaces; the BVI handles layer-3.]
VRF and/or ACLs can isolate and restrict guest access.
That implies a layer-3 (IP) transport between sites.
If the packet's destination address belongs to the IP subnet on VLAN 10, then the router will forward the packet onto that VLAN.
Based on your diagram, 10.0/16 is the subnet on both sites.
A better solution would be to segment each site into it's own subnet.
For that to work, one would need a bridge between sites.
I am assuming that the IP subnet for VLAN 10 is different at each site.
