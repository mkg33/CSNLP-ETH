Keep in mind that the presentation file will grow by roughly the size of the embedded font file; this can sometimes make for large PPT/PPTX/PPSX/etc files.
The file itself is nothing special and won't contain any fonts that the PPTX doesn't.
You should be able to embed the fonts you're using.
It all depends on the font and the characteristics its author has given it.
If your potential future employer needs to edit it, the problem becomes very complicated, as you'd need to send the fonts to him (embed them or attach them) and have the fonts be automatically downloaded to his machine before he opens the powerpoint file.
I agree that this is somewhat risky and you should at least test this before sending the file to the prospective employer.
However, if you just want him to be able to view the powerpoint, I'd suggest saving it as a .pdf and sending it that way.
If the font is fully embeddable and you choose to embed it when you save, it'll be installed on computer of anyone else who opens the file, so it'll be editable.
A PPSX is essentially just a PPTX with a different extension; the extension determines how Windows launches the file when you doubleclick it and in the case of PPSX, your computer's file associations tell Windows to tell PPT to open the file in slide show view.
The fonts should be perfectly viewable to anyone to whom you pass this along in a PDF file.
Or if the font's partially embeddable, it'll be temporarily installed but only for viewing.
