Edge browser crashes only when visiting the url and chrome results in error 500.
Tried to reset the IE settings to default, cleared the group policy's on the workgroup workstation, without success.
The company has 40-50 Windows 7 x64 Enterprise stations with IE11, Chrome & Firefox which can't go to the url, it results in a error 500 message.
500 means it a server-side issue, Please check the error log on the server.
And have another workstation on Windows 10 Pro, this one is only able to visit the url in IE11.
Is there anything browser related what this problem can cause or is it server side?
The site they have to visit is writen in PHP and requires an SSL/https connection.
Tried with 2 internet connections, one with proxy and one without (directly).
The 500 error message will be coming from the server.
The HTTP error code 500 ("internal server error") is reserved for serverside errors and you'll need to check the servers (error) logs for the cause, possibly after increasing the verbosity/debug level to get sufficient detail.
You should look in the logs on the server to get more information about what the problem is.
This machine is able to visit the url without problems on the same network connection mentioned above, with IE11, Edge & Chrome.
Debugging from the client side alone  will be nigh impossible.
This certain link can be opened by many workstations except at one company.
Hope someone can explain if we have to search for a solution on the clients or server side script.
