That being said while only one user can be the "owner" of the database you can add as many users to the role db_owner as you would like.
I am trying to set up a set of SQL logins (one for each developer) on a server who can have access to a given set of databases, currently the setup is as follows:
Granting db_owner to a user (the database level principal) is a very high level of permissions and should only be granted to database administrators.
(I know that using sa would do the job, but the databases are actually hosted on a third parties server with other customer's databases, so we can't use that!)
Login 2: db_owner of database 5 (this is because this login is used by someone else who shouldn't have access to the other databases).
As far as I know you can't have multiple db_owner's of a database.
You can create a login using below acript and map it to user and then grant necessary privileges to user.
Granting privilege to SQL server user is complex topic and you must read this article and this for understanding it.
Is there a way to add a set of new logins that would have access to all the mentioned databases without changing the existing logins?
SQL Server, requires ALTER ANY LOGIN permission on the server or membership in the securityadmin fixed server role to create login.
Members of ddl_admin for example can make DDL changes (create/alter tables, create/alter SPs etc) to the database without being a member of the db_owner role.
You should probably consider only granting those permissions needed by the individuals.
