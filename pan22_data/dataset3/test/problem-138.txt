When I use ping to see if a host is up in shell scripts, I do something like this:
In my case, most of the time I want to see this is basically during server rebooting... this works pretty nice on Windows...
Basically, sends one ICMP that times out in a second with no output and uses the exit code to gate further action.
I build a simple script (expanding @entropo answer) to help me on that, which may help answering this question:
My solution below also calculate ECHO Request sequence number automatically:
The script above by bruno.braga works just fine, however personally I prefer a using alias in a shell profile (like .bashrc) so that it could be a daily use case.
ping -W 1 -c 1 $HOST 2>&1 > /dev/null || (echo -n "dead!
If desired, that would also be possible to calculate min/avg/max by shell script, mdev is far beyond the scope.
echo -e "date +'%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S' - host $host is \033[0;31mdown\033[0m" >> ./lostpackets.txt
How can I make the Linux ping to show the requests 'time out' instead of omitting the output?
I added a line to create a file with all of the failures.
Of course, the drawback is: no statistics in the end when CTRL-C is pressed.
Here is the output example when the host is unstable with a timeout:
