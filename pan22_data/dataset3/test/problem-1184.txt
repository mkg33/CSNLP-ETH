I am Upgrading to 8GB (2x4GB) memory, but after i installed the new ships, windows keeps rebooting.
CMOS default was unable to restore Windows 7 to working order.
NOTE: i have a triple boot machine (2 windows 7, none working, alongside ubuntu 14) and ubuntu was running perfectly well throughout the process.
Eventually I installed a 64bit version on top of one of the 32bit windows 7.
bootrec /fixmbr and bootrec /fixboot did not solve the problem.
If i return the old RAM everything goes back to normal.
Booting with one stick did not work (even changing slots and sticks).
That worked and the new 64bit OS is working, though the other 32bit version still does not work and will be removed.
I ran into this problem on a Windows 7 32 bit system ("and herein lies the rub", WS) after swapping RAM sticks (two pairs of identical 4GB sticks) because  os was only recognizing 4GB, not 8GB.
My Notebook comes with a 4GB RAM (2x2GB) (Sony Vaio vpcea46fm)
If your laptop is equipped with a core i3 380M, consider upgrading to a 64bit system.
