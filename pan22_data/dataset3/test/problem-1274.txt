First you are not verifying that realloc() properly allocated memory.
However, its possible that any of a number of things could have gone wrong.
This line throws away whatever the user passed in as the parameter
Since your InitStr() function is only providing an initial allocation, you can simplify it to:
If something else wrong, bad format string for example, this function will sit there exhausting your memory trying to fill out the string.
It should also be pretty obvious the strlen("") is, so why calculate it?
This line only ends up doing the same as ReturnStr[0] = '\0'
When using realloc() you should use two pointers so you can properly check for a successful allocation:
You assume that a negative return value means not enough memory was provided.
The whole function should be written as strdup("").
Here is another example of checking your allocation using your AddStr() function:
You can slightly improve the runtime efficiency of this function be reducing the number of times you need to find the terminating NULL character in your strings:
You can complete your last function without the while loop:
