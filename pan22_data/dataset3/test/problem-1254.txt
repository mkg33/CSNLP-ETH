The next step would be to get a formatString function, so you could simply write something like:
There are a couple of things I'd do to pretty up the code.
Just seeing if there is anyway to shorten these for statements?
It's a good idea to avoid long lines/sections of code which have a simple purpose, but have to be read carefully to understand what they do (complicated regular expressions are a good example).
String building in code is typically messy, especially without a native String.Format() or sprintf()  in Javascript.
First, you are looking up the same element with every loop iteration.
Extracting that functionality into a function avoids this, because the function signature is all someone would need to read to understand what it does.
Other than using a templating engine, like ICanHaz.js (which this use case alone doesn't really justify), you could also build a helper function for creating option tags.
I know it's common, but it is very inefficient and leads towards long lines.
I moved a couple of things into variables, with also split up those long lines and made the code far more readable, IMHO.
If you're building a lot of these drop-down options, it might makes things more readable:
