You dont need to do it from a flashdrive or without the OS being loaded.
The best way to do this is to install the Java management utility for the 3Ware card.
Once you get to a command prompt (C:>), go to the floppy drive (presumably A:), and run the flash program as the example showed (A:>flash.exe /f prom0008.img).
I own the 9650SE also and I have flashed it numerous times.
- a USB boot record/format utility such as HPUSBFW.EXE

When the disks are bare, you'll need to format one of them, install an OS and then install a JDK/JRE/JVM then finally use the thing.
The firmware upgrade is easy, just like how most wireless routers do it.

You dont need to do it with a bootable disk, and IMHO you shouldn't.

I have also read the KB article:http://www.3ware.com/KB/article.aspx?id=10058
After reading the instructions you posted, it seems fairly simple via floppy for method #4:
Download the boot disk maker and follow instructions on making that bootable floppy.
If you want to make a DOS boot floppy, all you need are three files: IO.SYS, COMMAND.COM and I think CONFIG.SYS (can't recall accurately) but the easiest way to make DOS boot floppy is to go to www.bootdisk.com.
In the Java utility there is a easy Firmware upgrade button in there.
I've downloaded the required files to flash the firmware on my RAID controller
On that same floppy, copy the flash.exe and the new ROM image (in the example's case prom0008.img).
When bootable USB drive is created please copy Firmware upgrade files to it.
However it is not particularly clear - I do not have an OS installed yet, so how can I flash the firmware on this with a floppy / usb key?
First step is creating bootable DOS USB drive as it described in the following article.
