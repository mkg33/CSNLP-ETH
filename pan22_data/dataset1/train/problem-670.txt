Do what I do.  Build PHP web pages with the common stuff.  And have each page do more than the basic.  Don't just show tables, but do show table status and lay it out in a readable table.  And maybe sum up the columns.  And show the Stored Routines.  The cost of a dozen queries to build such a page saves more keystrokes than you concept of aliases.  And it is fast enough to not be a problem if you rarely look at most of the stuff on the page.
The show databases page can have the names hyperlinked to your show table stuff page.  That turns a bunch of keystrokes into a single link.
If you are looking at a table, and you know which columns are "normalized", then automatically do the JOIN to turn ids into values.
For show create table, also do show indexes and look into innodb_table_stats.  Etc.  The Partition info is hidden away; grab it automatically.
For show slave status, have it connect to the Master, too.  And all the Slaves.  And format it so that you can see their states side by side.  Etc.
I am using some commands on mysql client numerous no of times. i want to work smartly with less usage of keyboard. Is there any way to create aliases for mostly used commands like 'show slave status\G','show databases;', 'show tables;' on mysql client just like aliases in bash. Thanks in advance.
