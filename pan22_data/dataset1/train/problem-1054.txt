I recently found a great tutorial of drawing Minecraft's graphics by drawing it in RT in Unity 4 but 5 is still compatible with the code. It's a basic tutorial and it can be made into a cube and the top has more- cubes on it but they're at different places like 3 down, 1 up you get the point basically a big cube but with smaller ones at the top. Here's the tutorial have fun (It does not include the sky but comes with pre-made sky assets) the title is misleading and it's quality with simplicity. Hope it helps http://in2gpu.com/2014/07/27/build-minecraft-unity-part-1/ and its all RNG. Although it's not OpenGL but it's the best I could find tutorial wise.
Think of it as a SimCity with treasure hunts and lost-in-the-jungle adventures of infinite potentialities. First-time players of Minecraft enter a blank “natural” landscape of trees. Discovering that the sun can shortly set and darkness is nigh, they need to gather wood and build a shelter or risk being destroyed by the monsters of the night. because the name of the sport suggests, players mine the surroundings for materials then craft things like pickaxes, fishing rods, even chocolate-chip cookies. (When Conan O’Brien reviewed Minecraft recently as a part of his series “Clueless Gamer,” he said: “Taking things out of the bottom then building things. … thus it’s like we’re in Wales within the nineteenth century and we’re urgently poor. What a fun game for youths.”) How to Draw Tutorials Once that task is perfect, different opportunities beckon: Mine for diamonds, tame cats, stock chests with found objects, produce glass windows by building kilns and gathering sand, create bows and arrows out of spiderwebs (but be careful—vanquish those spiders first!), lay out railroad-like roller coasters, style wonderlands for friends to go to. there's without stopping to the choices.
