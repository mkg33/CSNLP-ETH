I have a table with new and old long description columns and I want to compare them by removing space, punctuation marks, and special characters for differences. 
Here are the values. total number of rows is 644 but below is the first few records
I am first trying to see if I can query the columns with the values replaced and then use it in an update statement and have the column value stored in those columns and then compare. I start with the 'NEW_' column but the query is running for 20+ mins before I had to cancel it.
When I use Maxrecursion 1000, I get ",......has been exhausted before statement completion" so using infinite recursion and I don't know if that is the issue.
I dont know to use RegEX with SQLCLR so i havent gone that route. Are there more efficient ways doing it? Any way to fix my code?
Since you only have 644 rows, you could probably get away (performance-wise) with creating a user defined function.
Then, assuming your sample data (I purposely changed a value in the last row.)
