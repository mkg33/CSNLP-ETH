I will address each of your bullets. There is an easier way and a slightly harder way to do all of this. The easier way would be if the drone you had already had built in wireless capability. I am assuming that is not the case because you are asking about having a camera, hooking it up to a pi, and then hosting it from there to connect to. Either way, it's all possible. 
For further research, you can search for hosting rtsp streams with VLC or unicast rtp streaming.
Let's say that I live in a large villa where all of it is covered with a WiFi network. I have a small drone with a camera mounted on it, and I want to stream the video captured by the camera on the drone through the WiFi routers to my laptop, which is connected to the same WiFi network. I'll then process the video in Maltab.
Now to the networking part (I'm a beginner in this field):
1- Generally speaking, is this type of networking considered peer-to-peer networking? Please note that i want the data to pass through the WiFi routers, not get uploaded and downloaded online (My understanding that this thing is possible and that's how some applications like AirDroid work, not quite sure of that though)
2- If that exists, any hint on how to calculate the possible bandwidth of this type of connections?
3- Any ideas on how to implement that? for example, if i connect the camera to a raspberry pi and install some server software on it and assign it to an IP address. would connecting to that IP address be implicitly done through my router (given i do some certain needed settings)? If not, then how to do this?
Any keywords or articles that will help me do more search on this topic are very appreciated.
And you can see that i almost have no knowledge in this area. Any book or online course suggestions regarding this?
