Applying some group policies requires connectivity to a DC during startup: tasks run as startup scripts or software deployment may access the files on the SYSVOL only during system startup.
If the VPN connection is established after that, those clients may never run those tasks or update those software, and you'd have to change your deployment procedures accordingly.
Some VPN clients (Cisco did a few years ago at least) can be configured to allow a session to be started before Windows login.
My laptop connects to the company network just a few times a year via VPN and onsite maybe annually. And untill recently worked perfectly well - even routine password changes somehow worked without VPN being active. So it can be done, but I can't tell you exactly how, although I don't block any outgoing ports and my router shows it's keeping a huge number of NAT sessions open at times so something interesting is going on.
I freed it from corporate control of Windows update which might well be helping (maybe they've relaxed it too?) as I generally self-manage, although I still get other mandatory updates from the IT team.
