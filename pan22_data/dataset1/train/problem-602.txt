What I'd suggest is adding a small amount of white noise to the rendered output. In bright scenes this won't be visible, in dark scenes with ordinary gamma setting it's similar to what cameras or the human eye actually do in reality. But for someone who cranks up the gamma, this noise would be a strong nuisance. Not only won't dark objects become properly visible, the boost of the low-range noise will then also distract from bright objects; so it should sufficiently discourage people from doing that.
(Of course, very clever guys might still come up with sophisticated de-noising techniques, but those are at least not available in ordinary monitors)
Given the random brightness/contrast/gamma of the user's screens, not the mention the room lighting where the user sits, there's no reliable way to make something that will be "just visible enough" or "just invisible enough".  If you want something to be invisible, make it black.  If you want to make something ambiguously perceptable, you have to accept that some players will have a better opportunity to see it.
