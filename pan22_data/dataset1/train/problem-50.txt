Stock firmware on consumer routers is generally not as versatile as DD-WRT or Tomato.  You won't have many of the features available via DD-WRT or Tomato without buying a business-class "VPN" router.
Are you upgrading the router simply to upgrade your wireless to a higher standard such as n or ac?
Configure the new router where routing (if possible) is disabled, and DHCP.  Configure the new router's wireless with an SSID and other parameters as you need.  Then, disable the wireless on the box you have Tomato installed on.
Connect LAN port of new router to a LAN port on the Tomato box.
Essentially, you will put the wireless-access-point only device behind the Tomato box, and you may still be able to manage nodes connected to it.
I'm not sure if the Asus LAN ports are gigabit - if it's 10/100, you might not be able to fully utilize the bandwidth ac provides under optimum conditions, but it sounds like you mostly want to limit Internet bandwidth anyway.
I assume by Tomato you are referring to DD-WRT. It does everything you are mentioned I believe.
Since the post above says no recommending hardware I would suggest going to newegg or your favorite computer hardware shop and search the term "wireless router DD-WRT"
You should be presented with an array of devices where it is either supported or is pre-installed. 
At that point simply use common sense and reviews to narrow down the best device for you.
