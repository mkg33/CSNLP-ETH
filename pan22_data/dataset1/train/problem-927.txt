I haven't had this kind of sluggishness for years - I've a quad-core PC with 4Gb RAM running Windows7 and it's normally fine but sometimes just bogs right down... windows stop responding for a few seconds, hard drive chugging away, etc.
However I note my idle CPU never drops below about 90% when this is going on - I feared some malicious process.
Should I be worried something nasty is avoiding my AV software, or is there some other maintenance I can do? I note Eclipse and Chrome are the two apps which seem most slug-like in case it's relevant.
You have to check your Task Manager for running process that may be the only reason behind the sign so that you have to go in the Run and type msconfig and in that Start up tab and uncheck the process or program's which you don't want to start at Start up and restart your computer
you have to check the Google Chrome also  because it also need a lots of memory to run and some time it run in the background after closing the Chrome or just check the Chrome Task Manager so that you will come to know
