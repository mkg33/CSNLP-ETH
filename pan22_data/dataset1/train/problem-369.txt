Sometimes, when watching youtube or playing games or anything related to sound output, the sound output is switching from #2 to #1 and then back. During that time PC experiencing slowdowns, some freezing. It appears that the switching is happening on high peaks of sound.
The latest drivers are installed for both. The other way switching(from #1 to #2, if I set default to #1) never happens.
This screams of a driver issue, and I'd guess it's actually a problem with Creative's driver. That said, I've had miserable experiences with the onboard audio on the P5Q series, though never anything similar to this.
Do you have a compelling reason to use your onboard sound? With a dedicated sound card, I'd recommend you disable the onboard audio in your system BIOS (hit DEL while the system is POSTing - if memory serves, you can toggle the onboard devices from an ONBOARD DEVICES tab in BIOS).
With the onboard audio disabled, it should disappear from your Control Panel.
Now try playing the same audio sample again... I'd be interested to see if it fails in a new way (such as an ugly blue screen) or just works correctly.
If that doesn't help (or hitting a peak causes worse problems than before), I'd recommend looking for an older version of the Creative driver (maybe you have the CD that came with it?) and see if the problem persists.
