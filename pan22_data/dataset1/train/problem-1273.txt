color-theme.el is not being developed so you may want avoid that. 
Instead I suggest you to download Emacs 24.0.XX pretest version from that website. So you can simply call M-x customize-themes to change new inbuilt themes.
More over emacs 24 has its own package manager so you dont need to apt-get to install emacs packages. once you install Emacs 24, call M-x list-packages to see the available packages. 
I'm not familiar with the structure of emacs-goodies, but if you look up the document of load-path, you'll find that it's a list of directories, not files.  So I'm not sure if your second setq is helpful.  Try removing it.
And in general, if you want to install some Emacs extension, just download it and put it somewhere.  Then add that directory to your load-path.  Depending on the extension, you may need to require it or write some autoloads.  I believe Emacs 24 has package support built in, but I haven't tried it yet.
And finally as others have mentioned, Emacs 24 has built-in theme support.  It's better to use that instead of color-theme, if you are using v24 (who's not, right? :-)
