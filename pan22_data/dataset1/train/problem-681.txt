Most Linux distros are capable of running with a command line. If you want one that is purely a command line then you just need to deselect all the graphical tools when you install.
In some sense Linux is "all terminal", that is, the GUI runs atop the command line. If you remember the Windows 3.1-era, you'd boot your computer to DOS and then run Windows as a command, it's much the same with Linux today. The desktop that most distros run (KDE, GNOME) is just another program like, for example, Firefox.
You can get a terminal in a couple of easy ways. Most desktop environments (have a terminal):
Since a desktop environment is running "atop" the command line, you can also grab an already-running terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1, that is press Control, Alt and the F1 key at the same time. To get back to the graphical session, press Ctrl+Alt+F7.
To answer your question then, any type of linux will do, but since you haven't any interest in running a desktop environment, you can safely get any "server" type of distro, Ubuntu Server, for example.
