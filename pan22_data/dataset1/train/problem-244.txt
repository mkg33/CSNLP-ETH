May I ask you to help me understand the routing table I have after I initialize a vpn connection and if I understand correctly why I do not have Internet connection after that:
After I establish the vpn connection I have the following routing table:
And finally why the first row exists in this form, I want only specific IP addresses to be routed through the ppp0 interface not everything?
I am sorry if it seems stupid or I insult someones understanding or the topic with stupid question, I just can not understand it and can not find something in the net that can explain it easily.
PPP is a Virtual Interface, that comes up after the VPN connection is established. The remote END can configure what traffic should go through the VPN tunnel, in your case it is set to send 'all' traffic.
10.254.251.1 is assigned to your PPP interface, usually a Pool is created on the VPN server, that will assign a unique IP address to each client that connects to it. 
Usually the VPN server will control what traffic will go through the Tunnel. If you have access to VPN server, you can setup something like Split Tunnel and specify what Networks should go through the Tunnel, instead of 'all'.
