You CAN do that with VLOOKUP().  For more details see this help page.
But if you try to replace the Article that you look up, you'll get a circular reference error.
Suggest you create a new column on Sheet 1 - maybe "New Article".  Then enter this formula in the first row of that column:
and fill down.  This assumes the first article on Sheet 1 is in A2, and the old and new articles on Sheet 2 are in Columns A and B, starting in A2 and extending down to B50.  You should change those parameters as necessary.
This formula will list any new articles in the new column if it finds them, and list a blank if there isn't a new article to find.
Then you can copy any new article and paste it over the old article in column A (be sure to use Paste Special > Values to do this.)
Sheet 1 has a column "Article" with old article descriptions like "PO11AD00 facing tiles Island"
I need either to replace old article in Sheet 1 name with New Article from Sheet 2, or add new column to Sheet 1 with New Article next to Old Article
Is it possible to explore array on Sheet 1 for a content from Sheet 2 and if matches, copy content from another cell on a Sheet 2?
