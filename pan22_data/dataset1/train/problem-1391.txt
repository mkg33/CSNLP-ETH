I pulled a .zip file from https://www.deviantart.com/clairejones/art/Apophysis-Starter-Flames-V-67029474 and the file I was interested was the .flame file which contains parameters for several different Fractal Flames.
Having read the original Draves & Reckase paper some of this is obvious.  The coefs= probably contains the parameters of the affine transform.  The thing that really confuses me is how a single xform clause mentions two variants, e.g. linear and spherical.  It appears that the values on each attribute sum to 1 so they are probably weights/probabilities.  But why are there two xform clauses?  Are they alternating weighted transform sets?
There is some information about the XML file format used for .flame files. There are a number of forks of this program written in different languages, the original site is by definition the place to go for answers; unless you are using a fork - the original  seems to have been abandoned years ago.
Coefs is 6 floats which defines the coefficients for the affine part of the function, in row order (a d b e c f). Xform has an interpolation_type which is a string describing the method for interpolation of xform positions: options are "log", "linear", "old", etc. (a list of a few dozen options is here). There can be multiple xforms, each applies a transformation to the previous state.
The spherical transform is complex, there's a 19 page .docx tutorial with 9 pages of examples at: "Understanding Spherical Transforms: Apophysis Tut" by UniversalKinase (direct link to .ZIP file). Another tutorial is "Apo-Tuto Sphericals" by Fiery-Fire.
