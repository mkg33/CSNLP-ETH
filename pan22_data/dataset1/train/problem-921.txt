I am trying to set up Atom as my Haskell IDE. I have already installed Haskell, and all of the Haskell plugins I need in Atom. I ran cabal install ghc-mod, which failed to install/configure old-time, which requires Cygwin. So I downloaded Cygwin (64-bit). After thirty minutes of realizing that I had to reboot my computer to update the PATH variable (which shouldn't be the case) I was able to use sh from the command line, but not old-time complained that the C compiler wasn't able to create executables. Using the 32-bit version didn't help. I don't even know what to do any more. Is there any way I can get ghc-mod to work without old-time? If not, what do I need to do from here? Here is the error I get with cabal update && cabal install ghc-mod. I am using Windows 10 64-bit.
I was able to get around this error by doing the install through MINGY64, I'm using Windows 10 64bit as well. This is the preferred command-line installed during install of GitHub on Windows so I had it already setup. Right clicking the desktop shows "Git Bash Here".
However, there are install directions here: these are the MinTTY install directions. cabal update && cabal install ghc-mod should do the trick from here. Before this solution I had tried from Powershell as well as Cygwin64 and had no success. MinTTY worked like a charm.
