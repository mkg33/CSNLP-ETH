I've done this simple c++ assignment. The homework was "Design a Tree class that allows insertion of nodes and visit of the graph".
What do you think of the style/design I used? I chose to store in the STL container the pointers of sub trees. 
Thanks a lot for any tips about problems or bad practices!

Use using keyword to define your type instead of typedef
C++11 introduced type alias which can be used to define your own type and it's compatible with templates, so instead of:
Consider using range-based for loop instead of while loop with iterator
I think that it will result in simplier and more readable code, for example Visit function will look like this:
is unnecessary - multiset childern will be erased automatically.
Currently it's possible to add new child to existing Tree by calling function
which expects pointer to existing Tree object as argument. It means that Tree is not repsonsible for creation of children. By the other hand, in destructor the Clear function is called which deletes all the children, which means that Tree takes responsibility for deletion of children. This might lead to undefined behaviour. Consider the following code:
