For problem 2 and 3, there no such feature as of today.
I create a tracker station (country, town...) and a tracker contact (phone, localization, tuleap account). Stations have an artifact link with contact to affect people.
I create three groups : user, admin and operating staff to declare permission access for station field.
So I want to display on station report only artifact affected for the Tuleap account login with only field authorized (user/admin/opstaff) and alert people of change. 
Problem 1 : I can't update permission access to artifact for assigned people (I can only : permission to all artifact, submitted or affected to groupe). Why ? This option is really useful for me because of another child tracker (anomaly)
Problem 2 : I can't extract from the artifact link the Tuleap account affected.
Solution Problem 2 => Problem 3 : With openlist I can adding Tuleap account but that make redundancies (and I have to insert the same information twice) with the link and I can't make the field "Assigned" on Semantic option (this field is bind with project user).
Solution Problem 3 => Problem 4 : I don't want to create X groups to affect on X artifact and use the access permission affected to group.
Someone have already make something like that maybe more efficient ?
