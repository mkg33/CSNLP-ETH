libvirt connects to ESXi hosts using ssh and esxcli commands. This doesn't work both ways, e.g. a vSphere server cannot control libvirt based hosts. 
If you need such a feature, you shouldn't be demanding it from the folks who wrote libvirt, you should be demanding it from VMWare. The same goes for any other functionality in a vmware product you are using. 
libvirt exposes plenty of available API variants, but it's up to the front end to be able to use those. virt-manager, oVirt and Openstack Nova for example, do exactly that. VMWare fusion doesn't because vmware engineers did not program such functionality into it.
And if you want to implement such functionality yourself (though I doubt that's possible to hack on the proprietary vmware fusion front end), here's libvirt's API page: http://libvirt.org/html/libvirt-libvirt.html
I'm using KVM virtual machines managed through libvirtd server-side for most of my projects. On my desktop however, I'm using VMWare Fusion Professional which, just like its VMWare Workstation cousin, allows connecting to ESXi servers.
I would like to connect my VMWare Fusion desktop software to my libvirtd server and be able to manage / use my server-side KVM virtual machines through Fusion.
Is there any protocol translation layer I can deploy server-side so that my VMWare Fusion can transparently connect to my libvirtd server as if it was an ESXi server, and manage KVM virtual machines that way?
I will consider this question solved if you can point me to the documentation for the protocol used by ESXi and VMWare Fusion / Workstation to communicate, making it possible for me to implement the protocol translation layer myself.
