It really depends on your comfort level with SMTP MTA software.
The built-in Windows SMTP server would also do what you need. Create an instance on an off-premise server and create "remote domains" for each of the domain names you need to accept mail for. Then, configure those domains to smart-host to your primary MX.
The SMTP server in "modern" versions of Windows runs as an IIS 6 component, so you'll have to install the IIS 6 management tools. Most of the documentation that I'm finding is Windows 2003-centric, however the configuration should be the same even on newer versions of Windows.
You could also do something exceedingly inexpensive with various free / open-source MTAs if you're willing to put the time into configuring them. 
I am running an Exchange 2013 with about 10 domain names.
I currently use DynDNS' backup MX service - which covers a single domain per license.  I want to look into creating my own backup MX service in the cloud (Azure?) so that I can restart my Exchange server when needed without having to worry about having emails bounced (for all current and future domains).
