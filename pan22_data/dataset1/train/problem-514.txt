With the router you have, unless it allows you to mirror traffic to a port on it, wont let you do this. There are a few ways you could get the traffic:
One, you could setup a hub, not a switch, between the router and the internet and then plug a computer running a packet sniffer like Wireshark into another port on the hub.
Two, you could setup a computer as a gateway between the wireless router and the internet and have all traffic captured using a tool like Wireshark or tcpdump.
Three, setup a new wireless access point that is connected to a hub and have the internet router connected to that hub and a computer connected to that hub running a tool like Wireshark.
Or you could get a router that lets you mirror all traffic to a port on it and plug a computer into that port running a tool like Wireshark.
Sometimes with the right hardware you can capture wireless traffic with Wireshark, if you search the internet there are a few how-tos on how to do this.
You can also look at using something like a AirPcap
cheapest fix - use your cable router as a modem, then buy a router that supports mirroring to broadcast your wifi.  (*shut off wifi on the cable modem and hard wire the new router to it for internet - that way all wireless traffic gets captured.)  You can then pick any connected device as the target of your mirror - pick one with decent storage and remember it can only capture when connected to your new router.
Even older routers will support mirroring, and can be had on Ebay for under $20 - but buy a good one, you will want fast wifi at home!
