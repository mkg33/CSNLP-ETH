If the rest of your pfSense setup plays well with it, setting up your pfSense  so that squid can cache the updates really speeds things up, while limiting the WAN traffic. This may require more resources than many people seem to allocate to a pfSense install, and it spent quite a while being broken from 2.15 or so forward (I don't know if it's actually fixed for sure in the current release, it partly depends on what other things you are doing with pfSense, IIRC.)
Alternatively, set up a separate squid box, tuned to handle the rather portly things that are system updates, as opposed to the typical default tuning for smaller things that leaves updates out of the cache. 
On the third hand, setting up a local WSUS might be the most sensible approach for your location, if it's ONLY windows updates that are the issue. Otherwise all those hosts are going to move all that traffic eventually, while having that set up will limit your WAN traffic to pulling down one copy.
In our infrastructure we have no WSUS installed so when microsoft pushes new updates all our computers start excessive downloads, we use pfsense and as I am new to it, I need an advise how can I limit the download bandwidth from the certain hosts having only hostnames of the update servers from here
