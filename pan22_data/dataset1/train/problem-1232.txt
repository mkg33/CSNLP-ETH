During BOOT you are running of the rudimentary drivers built into the Firmware of the RAID card. Once Windows takes over (starts up) you are running off the Windows drivers and any management software you installed. - The problem is Windows based, not hardware.
If possible image all your drives (individually) before you do anything else.
You might try temporarily installing a non-RAID drive and setting it as the BOOT drive - then install an NT based OS (W2k, W2k3, XP, etc should do) to that temp drive and see if you can gain access to your array. If so, BACK UP EVERYTHING!..
I have a server running Windows 2003, it has a hardware RAID controller (4 disks in RAID5, health all OK)
The server will boot into standard mode or safe mode (from the array) but once windows is running, you cannot access the drive (Windows OS thinks the drive is RAW). 
When you attempt to open C drive, it says access denied. 
I need to know the direction I should diagnose. Does this sound like a RAID issue, partition issue, or a malware/virus compromising the system? It seems odd that Windows will start... if it were a RAID or partition issue Windows shouldn't start, correct?
