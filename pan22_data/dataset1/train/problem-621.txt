I was installing CentOS Linux distro in VMware Workstation 10 when I stuck across the issue as to use which Networking Option to get my work done. Though I don't know whether it is fit for this site, but I feel someone among you will surely respond positively.
Please consider the case that I want to achieve Message Passing in Host(Windows) and Guest(CentOS) or vice-versa using Java RMI. Hence, I think the networking is an important case(might be inappropriate assumption),though it involves the hostname only of the Server.
I guess the help text on the vmware dialog box is pretty self explanatory.
I don't know how your data card gets/assigns ip address,I guess you do not have any control over the number of ip address you get assigned.
Assuming you do not have any dhcp servers configured and you will only get a single IP from your data card.I would suggest going with the NAT.So what will happen when you configure NAT is your host machine (windows) will create same number virtual interface named something like vmnet* as the number interfaces in your guest(centos). you can then manually configure the interface address in guest and hosts to be in  the same network.This will act like a small development network,and when you go to internet from your guest system your local test network ip address will be translated to an external ip (Vmware does this under the hood for you).
One disadvantage of this mode is that you cannot reach your guest machine from a remote location say for eg if you need to ssh to your guest machine from your home unless you do some sort of port forwarding in your host machine.I do not know how to do that in a windows box.
