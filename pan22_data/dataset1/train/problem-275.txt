When you access the internal LB reside on Vnet2 from Vnet1, the LB doesn't change source ip address in the data package, it will just change destination ip address (LB ip address) into the specific ip address of VMs which reside on backend pool. That is the function of internal LB, so we should not deny the access to VMs in Vnet2 from clients in Vnet1.
That is the expected behavior, as i have explained above, we need to add another inbound rule in that NSG to allow the source ip address of clients in Vnet1, or allow source any. As for the port, you can add some specific ports in that rule.
I have two VNETS (VNET1 and VNET2). VNET1 allows many site2site and point to site connections. VNET2 contains an internal load balancer and a set of VMs for the back end pool of that load balancer. I have successfully setup VNET peering between VNET1 and VNET2 which allows on-premise clients in VNET1 to access the internal load balancer in VNET2 but it also allows them to access the VMs in VNET2 which I want to avoid.
I'm trying to limit on-premise clients connected to VNET1 so they can only see the internal load balancer on VNET2 (not the VMs in the backend pool). I've tried setting up an NSG on the subnet where the VMs reside by creating following rules  (note the the load balancer is on a different subnet within VNET2 with no NSG applied to it).
The above rules prevents VNET1 from seeing anything in VNET2 but also prevents sending to the load balancer for some reason. 
Anyone have any ideas on how this configuration could be implemented?
