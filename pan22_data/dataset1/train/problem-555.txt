What is happening is the sound from your speakers is being picked up by your mic and it is being put on this constant loop until it is loud and distorted enough to make weird sounds like this. It happened to me before just change the mic sensitivity, or use a external mic. If still a problem persists :aliens:
This sounds like a mix between Larsen effect (microphone picking up your own speaker) and a not working echo cancellation algorithm.
What you can do is check your sound mixer and disable the playback of the microphone (you don't need it to record something).
You may also check if your microphone and/or recording software has an echo cancelling option and disable it.
Also if you have a fancy sound  management software, be sure no "fun special effect" is activated.
Keep in mind that built in microphones aren't very good so you won't be able to get a clear HiFi recording anyways... (But you should be able to record human voice in a good enough quality and without alien sound fx :-) )
