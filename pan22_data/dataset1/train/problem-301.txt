In the course of managing several web servers you'll quickly become a master of installing LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP). I would simply backup you apache website configuration files ( not everything just the file(s) which defines your web server directory structure; in Ubuntu /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/* ).
Also, backup all of the website files you have. You'll also want to backup your databases. The proper way to do this depends on the DBMS you use. If you're using MySQL use mysqldump ( http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/09/backup-and-restore-mysql-database-using-mysqldump ) which is almost certainly going to already be on your old server.
Then on your new box do a basic lamp installation: http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_lamp_for_newbies
Once you have that running put your website files and the configuration files in place. You'll need to reconfigure your DB users as well.
This may sound like a lot of work at first but it really isn't. After you do this a few times you'll be able to finish all of this in about 15 minutes without issue.
You'll also need to update your DNS entries to point to the new server.
Also, if you use SSL on your sites then you'll want to backup the files you installed when you installed that.
What's the best way to backup a LAMP stack from SSH (if this is even possible)?
Is it possible to create an image file for a remote server somehow, and then use wget to download this? (I am thinking similar to how vagrant uses .box files).
