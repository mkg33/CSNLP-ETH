However PC1 saves the DHCP server information in it's network config. Then, when half-lease time has come, it requests a new address using unicast directly from the DHCP server. 
The source IP is the PC1 IP (no source nat). So the DHCP server sets the destination IP as the IP of PC1 - which gets dropped on the router.
What is the common solution to this problem? Source NAT configuration? What are some other ways to solve it?
I think there's something wrong in the router configuration because this should probably work.
When the client PC has no IP address at all, it broadcasts, and the router is able to unicast the request over to the DHCP server using its LAN interface, right?  So obviously the DHCP server is able to reply back to the router's LAN interface.  So why should it be any different for the PC to do the same thing when lease renewal time comes?  The router should NAT it through and the reply from the DHCP server should come back through the NAT.  If it doesn't, then I think you have something wrong on the router.  You should check that UDP is permitted back through the router.  And if the router has any kind of firewall on it, check that it is following UDP connections, to allow them to return back through the firewall.
