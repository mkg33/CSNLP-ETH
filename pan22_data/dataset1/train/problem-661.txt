Unfortunately I don't have any experience in ASP.Net, but I can offer a round-about method whereby you could track this. If you are running Squid in front of the server in question, it's quite easy to take a quick look through the Squid logs to identify requests made to an incorrect URI. I wouldn't recommended installing a Squid box just for this reason, but it will probably be the quickest way to identify incorrect URIs if you already have a Squid proxy in place. 
Install http://www.winpcap.org/windump/ on the server, and run it with the following flags:
windump -w "C:\Temp\tcpdump.log" dst host {old IP address} dst port 80
You can leave the running for a day or so, then look at the log. Using -w will write out the raw packets, so that you can see exactly what is being sent (and thus, hopefully, what is sending it).
Please note that I've only used tcpdump, the program that windump is based off of, so if there are differences between them, you may have to adjust the flags. But there are a lot of tcpdump tutorials out there, to guide you in the right direction.
