Perhaps the most straightforward approach would be to install DebugDiag 1.2, and enable the LeakTrack functionality.  
After launching DebugDiag, select the Processes tab, right-click the desired w3wp.exe process, and select "Monitor for leaks".  
You may use the Rules tab to create a trigger to collect the information:  
After the user dump files have been generated, you can then use the Advanced Analysis tab, and run the Memory Pressure Analyzer, which will inspect the dump files and generate a report.  
"The memory leak monitoring feature is designed to track memory allocations for a process.  This feature should be used when a process on the system continues to grow in memory until the system becomes unstable, or the process stops functioning correctly.  The debug tool will inject a DLL into the specified process and monitor memory allocations over time.  A dump is then generated, and the dump is analyzed to determine what allocations are not being freed and most likely causing the memory leak.  Allocations generally fall into 3 groups:  caching, short term allocations that will be freed later, and memory leaks.  All three allocation methods have very distinct allocation patterns when measured over time.  The leak tracking feature calculates a leak probability using a formula that is based on these allocation patterns as measured over a specific time period. "

I'm trying to trace a memory leakage on my Windows Server 2008. There are different schedule tasks run by the web app which I suspect the leakage is happening so I want to know at which particular time of the day when the mem usage hikes.
Is there a tool which I can use to track only that particular process?
