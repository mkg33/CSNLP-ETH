If you will have an OS user,and if you can use the crontab utility to schedule a job, you can try something like this:
This simple entry make a logical backup every half hour.
You need to set Oracle env variables (here in the .bash_profile) since cron passes only a minimal set of env variables to your jobs.

I am working with an Oracle Database and I have a user (called XY) with permissions R/W. I would like to to do automatic backups of the user schema XY. I don't own the server and I don't know if the provider does backup of my schema. Probably does,but I would like to do myself the automatic Backup. I use as Oracle Client the tool SQL Developer.
I know that I can do Extras-> Database Copy but it is not automatic.
Can I achieve this with this client? If so, how?If it is not possible, what alternative do I have?
