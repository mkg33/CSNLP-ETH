So, the happy ending to my story is that a couple weeks after setting up my reverse PTR record correctly (with help from Azure support), Yahoo started getting the message. It wasn't instantaneous, mind you; it started with a handful of subscribers reporting that their email service had resumed. But still, the bulk of mails were rejected. Then slowly, slowly, the percentage of successful deliveries increased, until after a transition period of about two days, the bounces stopped altogether.
In summary, the answer was to set up the reverse DNS record...and wait.
It is not unusual to find a number of freemail providers in your DMARC report.
For example, people receiving mail from you at their google address may choose to forward your mail to yahoo, leading yahoo to report those receipts back to you. The report actually includes a clue - saying SPF check passed for gmail.com. If the report did not include that information, you could still guess based on the whois information for the IP address - it is allocated to Google.
The "Nobody has complained" part makes me suspect that you have not setup a feedback loop with yahoo - they will only tell you about complaints after you sign your mail and explicitly opt in. You would know this if you had fully read the help pages referred to in the error message, so chances are Yahoo is deferring your message based on some other item in their "best practices" list. So this is your best bet at resolving the problem - verifying you have understood & implemented every single item on that list.
