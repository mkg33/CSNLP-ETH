I want to speak towards some style and general Python improvements (of which there are quite a few) that you can make.
Whenever you have to define a handful of variables that are all basically identical (or generated identically), you can simplify this with another structure. In your case, your sim_xx variables in monte can be all placed into a list:
With this change (and some iteration tricks), your whole function gets slimmed down to this:
You can implement this same idea later on in your code, e.g. when you are dealing with your CH_5min, BV_5min, etc. values.
In my code above, I have a nice loop that gives counts 5, 10, 15, 20, ..., 98, 99, 100. This would be useful in other sections of your code. So the best thing to do is pull it into a function (more specifically a generator):
This function will yield values incremented by a certain value until a specific threshold then increment values by a different value. It can be used like xrange and instead of doing this to create your indexes:
Also, you can use something like timeit to pinpoint what is most time consuming so you can focus on that.
I did not execute your code and verify my sugestions, So there may be sintax errors, please check my suggestions.
