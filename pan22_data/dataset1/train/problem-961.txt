Right now, it appears (based upon your question) that you are backing up to a single file, which is why it is so large. You need to be backing up to different files if you don't do this you run the risk of corruption within one of those backups leading to your data being unrecoverable.
I would highly recommend looking at different subplans in your manintenance plan each to handle writing the backups to different files, and have those files rolled daily.
From a longer term perspective it would be worth expending time looking into how backups/restores work from a TSQL perspective, and then implement either your own, or some other solution to take backups, and get away from maintenance plans.
Sql Server doesn't care 'where' your backups are ultimately stored.  Having said that, I can assure you that Sql Server 'knows' where the backups were 'created' (physical location) and stores that information in the MSDB database. Sql Server would try to use that information to generate a restore via SSMS GUI and the files wouldn't be there. Moving backup files around will also complicate an attempt to automate a restore plan by utilizing the information in the MSDB database tables because the files are in a different place than where they were originally created.  And, I think you definitely want an automated restore plan, especially with trying to restore a bunch of logs.  
In my opinion, the 'better' strategy is to allocate a separate disk drive or share with enough space to hold your intended backups.  I personally don't like maintenance plans for backups because they don't give you enough options.
