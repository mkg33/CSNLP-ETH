I think Windows already has these information, so you don't need an external application to do this task. What you need to do is switch Window explorer view to Detail mode. Example my computer window:
You can see your needed information in Date modified tab and Date created tab. When you click to these tab, Windows will sort files (folders) for you in ascending or descending order of date. So, you can get the newest or oldest files, folders as you need.
If you don't see these tabs in your computer, right click on this bar and select them
I'm using Windows 7. I'm looking for a graphical way to show the newest (most recently created or modified) file in a directory, including it's subfolders. I have a parent directory, with a couple thousand subdirectories within. I need to find the newest file within those subdirectories. I am willing to pay for an application that can display this information easily. I am trying to avoid applications that show me every file in each subdirectory, as there are several thousand.
