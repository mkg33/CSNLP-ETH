Would a high performance large capacity USB drive be an improvement?  It weighs less, woudldn't flap around (as it needs no additional support) and will be relatively more secure in the USB socket. At 128GB the price is comparable and I doubt you could make full use of the performance of the SSD anyway.
ext4 will report errors but a journalised file system should be better than a non-journalised one in this case.
Perhaps Btrfs would be more suitable as it implements Copy on Write (COW). 
Wow that sounds terrible. Ext4 is a journalling file system, but these do sound like issues with a non-journalled file system. We see this recently with people using exFAT on drives they switch between Windows and Mac machines and not being detached properly, some write operation still occurring, or like your scenarios.
It is surprising to hear that your power/connection can be so poor this would happen with any frequency. I have heard other people using external USB drives to run Ubuntu without trouble. To be clear, how often does it occur without any action from you, and how often is it from you disconnecting it purposely? 
extundelete is a good tool for the limited options that Ext4 provides for file recovery, however this isn't a case of deleted data but corruption. If you (hopefully not) are going to try to live with this kind of turmoil, I would definitely try a file system that has better recovery options so that you have a better last resort option. I'm not sure what that would be for Linux. Btrfs is a great idea though. It wouldn't be a good last resort recovery option, but maybe the copy on write could save you some headache in the first place.
Also, I wouldn't expect it's hanging from the USB cable, right? (as was the impression I got in the other answer). It's not moving I hope. I have to ask. Any other things I'm not understanding?
