Routing protocols do not care about such things. Routing protocols are used by routers to exchange routing information, but they do not route packets, which is done by the router using a routing table. Routing protocol are one way in which routing tables are populated.
A packet with a destination address on a router will will be routed to the control plane of the router. Packets are routed by the destination network address, and if the destination is the router itself, the packet will be sent to the router software.
The IP header has a protocol field that indicates the type of payload.
The payload can be a transport-layer protocol like TCP or UDP, or a protocol riding directly on top of IP like OSPF.
Protocols using TCP or UDP usually use a port number to identify their type (like UDP port 520 for RIP).
OLSR uses UDP as transport-layer protocol with default port 698 - check RFC 3626 Clause 3.1.
A router with routing protocol support needs to have a full IP stack (it's usually managed anyway). It listens to those UDP ports or IP protocols that it understands and processes incoming datagrams. Depending on the protocol and its options, the datagrams are addressed to the router's IP address and MAC, a dedicated multicast address or sometimes simply broadcast.
