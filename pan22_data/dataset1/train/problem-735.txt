I've used a software firewall like endian.com (community version works great) that runs great on a surplus computer with 2 nics.
In the interfaces tab of the configuration page, you can configure the secondary NIC to become active based on a rule-set applied to to the first.  
Example:   If NIC 1 can't contact www.yahoo.com then switch to NIC 2
You can also configure segment preference based on protocol type
Example:  Send all HTTP traffic over NIC 1, but email traffic goes over NIC 2
Liknsys LRT224 Dual Wan Router.  Would just need to ISP feeds
Cradlepoint ARC MBR1400 has Verizon Sim Chip Installed
TP-Link TL-MR3220 You would need to provide a Cell USB Modem
The bottom two will utilize a cell data plan for fail-over.  Might not be what you are wanting to use for backup.  
For your setup, I'd use something like the Linksys Dual Wan that will support fail-over.  If you can I'd get two Internet connections from different providers, one cable & one dsl.  If you only have two cable Wan feeds, and service is down in your area.  You are down on both ends.  
For updating your domain address, i'd look at a DDNS (Dynamic DNS) client that you would run on your application server that would update the name entry when a fail-over happened.  NO-IP.com is an example of a DDNS service
Only problem I can see, without knowing how long people are connected, would be what happens when someone is connected to your application and a fail-over happens.
I use the DUAL-WAN routers in small business that process credit cards, so have not had to deal with users being connected to a service/application you are running.  My clients just need to get out to the Internet to process a credit card.
Still, talk to your ISP they might have a solution.
