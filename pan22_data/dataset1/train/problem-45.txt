I'm currently trying to setup Nginx for a domain with production, testing and development stages. Each comes with it's own partial Nginx config file with rewrites.
The production and testing stages are set up as branches from a Git repository and automatic reloading of these configurations in Git's post-receive hook. This all works just fine.
The development stage I'd like to transmit using SFTP using Netbeans' "SFTP-on-save" as I don't need version control at this granularity and it's a bit more direct. However, here I have no such thing as git's post-receive hook to trigger Nginx to reload config upon upload.
In Apache, .htaccess files would just load dynamically. Is there anything similar in Nginx and/or how could I simulate this? Ideally a solution that reloads the config files only and immediately when changed.
As cjc said, inotify and service nginx reload are the commands you are looking for.
Check out this post from nixCraft which gives a great explanation on how to configure inotify.
