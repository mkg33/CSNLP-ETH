You should be using the Performance Monitor (type performance monitor into the start menu) for this task.
You can either define a dataset, or use the default Performance dataset.
When you are done, rightclick the dataset and select stop.
By default it will show graphs of all performance counters.  Uncheck all the ones you don't want.
Right click the performance counter, eg CPU Time %, and, set the scale and color of the line.
You can also set the graph to only show a certain time slice, eg the last two minutes of the dataset.
The graph will show Max/Min values, Averages, etc etc.
Task manager/process explorer are great for spot checking. If you want to get some real data, use a real data gathering tool.
As far as I know, you can't get more details on previously recorded events in the default Task Manager application.
However, Process Explorer includes the functionality you're looking for.
You can hover over the peaks in a graph and it will show you the process that used the most CPU time at that point.
