MySQL recalculates table statistics for certain operations that access INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables (SHOW COLUMNS is just a convenient alias for querying INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS).  Set innodb_stats_on_metadata to be false, which will prevent this recalculation from occurring when you ask for metadata from the table. 
In this particular case, I think the INFORMATION_SCHEMA is a red herring. From my own tests of SHOW COLUMNS performance, the innodb_stats_on_metadata variable doesn't seem to make any difference on either MyISAM or InnoDB tables.
This seems to have been removed from the manual as of MySQL 5.5, but still appears to apply in that version...
The field information returned with a query result set contains the same information as returned by SHOW COLUMNS, so a SELECT * FROM my_table LIMIT 0 should achieve the same thing without creating an on-disk temporary table per query.
A quick example to just grab the field names in PHP...
Retrieving field info in this way is a little more awkward to decode. You'll have to consult the description of the underlying MYSQL_FIELD structure to pull out the data types and flags, but it runs about 7 times faster on my system.
