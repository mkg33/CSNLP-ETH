Very often my files are deleted very slowly. Especially if I ask system delete large amount of files. For example I need to delete directory with size ~4Gb. Why I need to wait longer than one day?
Even thorougher I'm owner  256 Gb SSD disc. Yes, it is almost full, but it is SSD!
I cannot tell you if your SSD is healthy or not so I cannot judge if deleting a sack of tiny files must necessarily be that long.
However, it's a fact that copying and or even removing 4G of small files takes orders of magnitude longer that 4G containing just a couple of them.
During those actions the OS has to update/delete the meta data in addition to the blocks of the files. If indexing is allowed, even the index data must be touched. When you manipulate relatively big files, you don't recognize how long it takes to administer the content of the file system but when the difference is not big between the write time of the meta and the real data, big volume can make even a strong man cry.
It will not hurt to check the health of your disk, but once you are in business again, I recommend switching indexing off wherever it's not really required and creating a package (zip, rar, whatever) of the files and deleting them regularly if they don't have to be online permanently.
