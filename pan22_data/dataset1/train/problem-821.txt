I had a crashed opensuse 11.3 that's why I installed opensuse 12.1.. 
after I installed (via yast) and edited /etc/passwd
In a perfect world, you'd have a backup of your databases created with pg_dump. If you did, you could restore those database backups to your 9.1 version.  Otherwise, you could reinstall 8.4 somewhere else, copy in your original database files and make a backup of all your databases and users.  Then restore that backup to your 9.1
1.Install an instance of PostgreSQL 8.4, same version as you had on OpenSUSE 11.3.  This doesn't have to be on the same machine.  If it does, you could compile
a version from a .tar.gz. example: http://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/v8.4.8/postgresql-8.4.8.tar.gz
Decompress, configure, make and install to some other directory
2.Make sure your 9.1 isn't listening otherwise 8.4 will not be able to use the 5432 port. 
3.start up postgres. somedirectory/data is where you have your 8.4 data files.
/postgresql84_directory/bin/pg_ctl -D /somedirectory/data -l logfile stop
1.If your 9.1 version isn't working anymore, you will probably want to reinitalize your data directory.
3.Now restore the 8.4 dump file to your 9.1 instance
