After exhaustively searching around on the internet and here at superuser I couldn't find a definitive answer to this. I've heard how with some devices they work with less pci-e bandwidth even if they are rated higher. Without further delay, here is my dillema.
I'm looking for a Hardware RAID solution as I cannot afford downtime that would be incurred by simply backing up data, yes I will still be backing up data as I'm well aware RAID is not a backup, and require performance either in RAID 5 or 6 mode. 
I've been having a bit of a problem with performance of FakeRAID which as I've learned isn't much of a shocker. My dillema exists because my motherboard has two PCI-E x16 slots, except one runs at x4 mode so it's merely x16 in a mechanical sense.

I've been shopping around and determined the LSI MegaRAID SATA/SAS 9260-4i with BBU is my best solution, only it and any Hardware RAID cards worth mentioning are x8. 
I'm somewhat under the impression that the only requirement for x8 is because of the potentially high bandwidth that these cards can handle. As I'll only be using a maximum of 4 Hard Drives in RAID 5 or 6 mode, should the x4 electrical/x16 mechanical slot work?
I've done it with x8 physical/x8 electrical 3Ware cards which I have plugged into x16 physical/x4 electrical slots on motherboards.  They work just fine.  In my case, the 3Ware GUI also confirmed the card was only seeing 4 electrical lanes, as expected.
In a SOHO environment I doubt you would ever notice the difference.  In a server environment where you wanted to maximize throughput and I/O's, you probably would notice the difference.  I suppose you might also notice the difference if you were running solid state drives vs. mechanical drives or you were only seeking maximum throughput.
I have never tried plugging an x8 card into an open-ended slot with a lower physical count.
