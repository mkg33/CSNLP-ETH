As I understand your question, 94.23.94.161 is the IP address of some machine on your LAN that you want to route packets bound for 95.168.0.0/16 to. If that's correct, either of your two route statements will do the job. Just get rid of the aliased eth0:0 interface. That's for local IP addresses assigned to this machine.
I would like to manually set up routing to subnet 95.168.0.0/16 through IP which is an alias: 94.23.94.161. IP alias is set up like that: 
and everything worked just fine, until i got an email from my datacenter that IP address is sending wrong ARP packets:
Conversation with their support went to nothing and now i'm still trying to fix that. Another setup which worked (but still was sending these wrong ARP packets) was:
Next i tried configuring routing through iptables and SNAT. I enabled ip-forwarding and tried  different crazy stuff like:
None of these changed routing. Could anyone give me any sort of advice how to change route to this subnet without sending spare/wrong ARP packets?
