Explorer.exe crashes due to many reasons. Mostly due to contents and shell extensions.
For example , you open a folder with AVI's and explorer scans all the filenames, your AV suite scans all the file contents on the display and loads shell executeables that you have installed into the OS as a right mouse option. These are usually in the Current User which is not in the same user in Safe mode as that is the built-in Administrator name and not your name which is a member of the AdministratorS group.. note s at end. You are not the same user nor user options.
It is impossible to guess your situation without running a log of all the processes, startups and services with Shell extensions, Scheduled tasks etc. get OTL.exe from search engine ( the better Highjackthis App. ) and post me the results.
The second most common cause in my experience is corrupt $MFT or $MFTbackup sp?, assuming NTFS.  This can be viewed in the Event Log along with any disk errors.. Go look at System Log.  In any case  win+R> chdkdsk e: /f (yes on reboot) {y] and try again.
The 3rd most common reason is <4GB RAM on Win7 with excessive processes running including many services under svchost with 3rd party apps that are bloated... They don;t co-exist well. This can cause stack overflow> OMG < which is hard to prove without extensive research using procmon.exe and memory map program, but let's say it can be caused by malware, not Windows fault.. per se. 
There are many more reasons but the OTL.exe twin log files will likely tell what is the reason.
Here are a few reasons off the top of my head why I can think Explorer could crash...
I'd recommend running chkdsk with the /x /f /v flags on your drive and see what you get back.
