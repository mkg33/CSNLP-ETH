Your local Bittorrent peer knows what pieces it has, so it won't be asking for a single piece more than once.
As far as the application using all three connections ...
Your system's TCP/IP stack knows the subnet mask (typically statically assigned or given to it via DHCP) of any LAN it's connected to.  It can be connected to more than one, for example, your wired connection may be on one subnet and your WLAN may be on another.  
So if it wants to send something to a system on a subnet, it knows which NIC to send it out on.  This works for directly connected subnets only.
If NIC #1 on your system has IP is 192.168.2.5 and your subnet mask is 255.255.2.0, and you send something to 192.168.2.8, it knows (because of the subnet mask) to send it out of NIC #1.
Hosts available only through the Internet are by definition not on any subnet your system might be connected to.  So, what your system does is use the default gateway, if one is specified.  The default gateway would be the IP of your router or your ISP's upstream router.
If you have more than one default gateway, your system might:
I am really unsure of what Windows does, and you might want to read about this warning about disjoint networks which I believe only applies if it's connected to a private IP range like 192.168.X.X, 10.X.X.X.  
When you use a descentralized protocol like BitTorrent you are using a P2P protocol who doesnt use a server to get the data, so assuming that you are not allowed to made an default route cause your dont know the list of peers who can share that data with you from the beginning, and assuming you have 3 ADSL Conections running in your PC you haves 3 PPPoE Miniports running at once so for your Aplication you are only 1 host, 
regardless of how many active connections do you have.
Here are some deep explanation about routing for reference.
