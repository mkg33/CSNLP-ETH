MTBF is not relevant for measuring SSD drive endurance since SSD is not sensitive for the time itself like ordinary spinning HDD drive but for the number of re-writes for SSD cells. More relevant measure for SSD is Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD). For example some enterprise class SSD disks 3.2TB endurance would be 3 DWPD for 5 years.
Some times SSD vendor provide endurance in terms of (Total) Terabytes Written (TBW) or "Write Cycles" which can be easily translated to DWPD and vice versa knowing time and maximum throughput for the given SSD drive.
If the drive provide 80 MByte per second sustainable write throughput, then
WriteCycles = 3 * 365*5 = 5475 total write cycles for the given disk
What is important to notice we are calculating the worst case if you will provide 100% utilization throughput for the drive (which is very likely not possible).
The Mean Time Between Failures, or MTBF, for this SSD is listed as 1,500,000 hours.
That is a lot of hours. 1,500,000 hours is roughly 170 years. Since the invention of this particular SSD is post-Civil War, how do they know what the MTBF is?
How is the Mean Time Between Failures (MTFB) obtained for SSD/HDDs?
