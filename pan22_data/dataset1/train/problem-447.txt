Try using cat first to concatenate the files and then sort that. sort won't be confused about multiple files because it will see a single input stream coming from stdin.
The combination of options you're using for -t and -k seem like you're trying to do this outside of what sort usually does. Sort operates on fields with specific delimiters -- whitespace by default.
You'll probably want to use some combination of cut (to break out fields by byte), awk to splice them together, sort to sort the lines and then awk to recreate the lines in their original format.
I have a bunch of text logfiles in the following format:
I need to get 1 log file with all the logs from multiple logs files, sorted by timestamp. Note that the log files are really huge, around 3-4G each (and there are dozens of them)
Actually... it fails miserably. The output file data_sort.txt is just the concatenation of all files, not sorted at all :(
I would greatly appreciate if anyone could provide any help on this problem!
