I have found that it is possible to run multiple instances of Skype using the /secondary key.
The second instance, however, asks to enter or select credentials, while I want it just to pick the  username which have not been used by the first instance.
The only solution I have found and use is combining the /secondary key with the /username: key:
This requres pressing a button Sign me in in the second instance's welcome window. This fills in the passord automatically, however.
Some time ago, there were switches /username and /password when starting with a secondary Skype account.
Now, these switches are disabled, also see here: https://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-archive/Secondary-Skype-stopped-working/m-p/4221641/highlight/true#M307935
Unfortunately, Skype remembers the last used account name in the file %programdata%\Skype\shared.xml, so you cannot directly specify what account to logon when Skype starts (if starting with /secondary switch, Skype always asks you for your credentials). 
Also, it's not recommended to manipulate that file and auto-restore it every time you start skype because that XML file doesn't just contain your user name, it also contains a part of your Skype settings.
