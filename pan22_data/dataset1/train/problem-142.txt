Buy a server that you can close the front with a key and leave it in a closet somewhere or under your desk. 
You don't state if you fear someone that pick the entire server out, or just to protect the disk to stay there.
Most non-profit I seen just put the server in a closet, in a wardroom room or under the front secretary desk. 
It exist some cheap 12U/24U rack too, it's not only full 48U rack too. It could cost less a small no-name rack than to try to buy a door for your nook setup.
I work in a non-profit and we need to upgrade the physical security around our new servers and DC. We can't secure the entire room, and we can't afford to purchase a proper server rack. The workaround is that the equipment will be in a nook that has walls on three sides, and we will use some sort of locking security door. However, I am struggling to locate anything that would suffice as a locking security door. I am here to ask for resources and knowledge on the topic. If anyone here has knowledge of affordable, non-standard, physical security options.
