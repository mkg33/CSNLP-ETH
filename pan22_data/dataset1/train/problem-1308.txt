Shopping/recommendations are generally considered off-topic here, so I'll stick with technical differences and not discus value judgements.
M.2 is just a form factor: it can hold drives with either SATA or nVME interfaces. A new PCIe based card will almost certainly be nVME but may be a SATA interface and SATA drive soldered to a board.
The chief difference between SATA and NVMe drives is the interface speed which imposes the throughput bottleneck. As latency, which affects random access rates, is likely to be similar between the various SSD types you want NVMe (either surface mounted on a PCIe card or in an M.2 slot) for speed.
Of course compared to your current solution with a drive connected via USB, both should be significantly faster.
You can't fix a performance problem by throwing hardware at it.
Even if you can find a fast enough SSD to handle the several-day query today, what will happen tomorrow when the data is bigger and/or you need another JOIN.
In many cases, a "several-day query" can be turned into a "several-hour" query by reformulating the query and/or adding a 'composite' index.  Or even "re-thinking" the problem.
Let's discuss the query and see if it can be sped up for $0.00.
