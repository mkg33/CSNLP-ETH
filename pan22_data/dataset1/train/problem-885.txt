I would like to keep large amount of data in an Internet accessible place. Starting at, say, 80TB and increasing the storage gradually. 80TB, ->160TB after maybe a year, ->240 after one more year or so. Something like that.
The requirements are mostly store only, regular files. Almost no download, not too much upload, say, constant ~100Mbit upload 24/7 for start.
What would be the cheapest way to rent/buy such storage arrays. Backups are welcome, but are very optional, 100% availability is welcome, but optional. The aim is to get cheap storage and to have it somewhere where I can access it. Anything, even AWS like services are acceptable.
Is it just for you? Then I would suggest to setup a fileserver of your own as 80TB of online storage can get really pricy, seeing that 2TB of online storage costs ~$8/month. But if you set up a server with one (or more) SANs you'd be cheaper off on the long run. And its under your control.
Anyway if its for others too, you can configure it to be an FTP server as well, if needed.
