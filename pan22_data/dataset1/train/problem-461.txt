If you have a decent 100Mbps card or a gigabit Ethernet card then chances are the answer to this is "yes". As such it means that over Gigabit (and with a reasonable Gigabit switch that you will be able to get (approximately) 100megabytes per second from  the network and 100megabytes per second to the network at the same time.
Can the machine on the other side handle reading and writing this amount of data at the same time?
An SSD would be able to handle this happily, a RAID array might, but a single hard drive probably won't.
Can your computer decompress the data fast enough?
If your computer is slower than 100megabytes per second decompression (unlikely unless it is particularly old) then your computer will be the bottleneck and the above two items are not likely to be your problem.
Other people reading or writing to the network drive or accessing servers on the machine may cause it to slow down.
People doing similar things (large file copies) on the same network segments as you will cause your connection to be slower.
Short: Besides extracting the files to the same folder being a questionable practice due to the resultant messy file structure, in my experience this will be significantly slower especially given the file sizes involved.
Long:"or go eSata via eSata PCI Expansion card. Esata is obviously the best/fastest but besides that.... for my RAR extract/compress situation...." This would be my first choice given it is a feasible option cost-wise
