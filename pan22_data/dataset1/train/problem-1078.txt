Oh wow, we get asked this stuff EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK and it always comes down to this - use RAID 6 or 10, nothing else. Use 10 where you care about performance and use 6 when you don't care or can't afford it. There is no third option, either's good, just avoid everything else, especially 5 for dull math reasons ok.
RAID 5 should not be used if RAID 6 is available. This is because with large arrays of high capacity drives there is a non-negligible chance of at least one additional failure occurring during a rebuild after the first drive fails. If this happens with RAID 5, the whole array is lost.
RAID 6 is the better choice when capacity is more important than speed and reads are more frequent than writes. However, it would be a good idea to maintain a separate smaller RAID 10 volume for temporary files and ad-hoc work, preferably using a separate set of drives. This can be done either by installing more drives or by allocating a small chunk of each of the 8 existing drives to a RAID 1+0 volume and putting the remainder of each towards a RAID 6 volume. The 1+0 volume will be somewhat faster if it occupies the first partition on each of the 8 drives, as read and write speeds tend to be faster towards the edge of the disks.
