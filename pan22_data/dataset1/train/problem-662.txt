Docker containers use the same kernel as the host.  There are two pre-compiled kernels distributed with Raspbian, an ARMv6 one for the model 1's and Zeros, and an ARMv7 one for the multicore models.  The latter works on the 64-bit ARMv8 models as well,1 since they are backward compatible. 
You cannot run a 64-bit userspace on top of a 32-bit kernel.  While you could use a 64-bit kernel, this means compiling it yourself or finding a distro that has one. 
Unfortunately Mongo DB dropped support for 32-bit platforms last year.  Your best bet is to try a 64-bit distro; if you search around online you'll find blogs about this, eg.: https://andyfelong.com/2019/01/mongodb-3-2-64-bit-running-on-raspberry-pi-3-with-caveats/
I need to run MongoDB docker container on Raspberry Pi 4B. My Raspberry has preset (already installed) Raspbian on SD card, I didn't install OS by myself.
MongoDB docker image supports arm64v8. But when I try to run container, it claims that there is no image available for my armv7 32-bit machine.
Official Raspberry Pi 4B specification claims that it has ARMv8 processor so mongodb should install without any problems. It turns out it's not a problem with Mongo, as linux command lscpu also claims my machine is armv7l.
What would you recommend me to do now? Can I somehow configure raspbian so it claim it works on armv8?
