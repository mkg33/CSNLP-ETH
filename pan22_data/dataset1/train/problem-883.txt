As far as a service similar to pingdom, but applied to security, I will suggest Sucuri's free Network integrity monitor.
What it does? It monitors your web site (and domains) on real time and alert you if they are
ever defaced, blacklisted, hacked, etc. Link: http://sucuri.net
As the name implies, it monitors the integrity of your 'internet' presence.
The hacking of your site likely had very little to do with the underlying operating system, and more to do with the code running on your site. All it takes is a single SQL injection, and you're history.
Since you were blacklisted by Google, I'll assume someone managed to set up a malicious script on your server, in which case you might try something like mod_security, it's not a piece of cake to configure, but it's worth a try. It is, however, of paramount importance to ensure your code is free of these kinds of vulnerabilities.
On the other hand, if it was a vulnerability in your operating system, you may want to try switching distributions to something intended for web serving, like FreeBSD, CentOS or RHEL, assuming you aren't already using one. You may want to consider beefing up SELinux, or adding an Intrusion Detection/Prevention System of some kind aswell.
In many places, it is a legal requirement to notify your customers of security breaches if personal information was potentially compromised, you may want to look into that.
Some more details would be helpful in answering your question more to your specific situation.
