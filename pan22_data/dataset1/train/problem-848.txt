Check out PEP-8, the style guide for Python. The thing that quickly jumps out at me from your code is how many of your variables and functions are lotsofwordsstucktogetherwithoutanyspacing. Those are very difficult to read. The preferred Python syntax is snake_case. That is:
You don't have to predeclare variables, and you don't need to manually increment. Your main loop in one_strategy is:
This is wrong for several reasons: (1) you don't need the initial i = 1 (2) The ending i += 1 is meaningless (3) range() is the wrong construct (4) you reference i at the end of the loop when you really want num_games. Prefer the following:
The _ naming makes it clear that the variable isn't important - you're just doing something num_games times. Also, it doesn't matter if we iterate over 1..9 or 0..8, so pick the one that's easier to spell. 
Building on this, all we want is to count the number of wins, so let's make that explicit:
Moving all the logic you had in the loop into its own function. 
The logic for picking a door is a little hard to follow. Let's simplify it. We start with all of our doors:
We randomly pick one that's correct, and we randomly pick one for our choice:
Next, based on the strategy, we either stay or pick a different door:
For your second week of coding, this is good work!
I would recommend reading over Python's official style guide, PEP8.
I would also recommend reading some of our highest rated tagged python questions for inspiration into how to improve / things to make.
In a few instances you're missing space after commas:
You should be naming your variables in snake_case, which is what PEP8 also advises.
I suggest simplifying these by use of different methods:
This is an outdated and inefficient way of string concatenation:
Use "{string}".format(string=your_string) style concatenation.
At the moment, you have a bunch of random, relational functions that pass input around, parameters etc.
