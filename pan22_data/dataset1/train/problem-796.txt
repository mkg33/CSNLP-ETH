Noticed that there wasn't an answer for this question so I am going to provide something simple that will work at any FPS as you suggested:
You could do something simple involving what angle you want to move to, that being 90°, and the duration you want to complete that movement in.
Taking the your designated time, say it's 3 seconds, you can convert that to frames using the given delta with Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime() or the given delta in the render loop:
Note, the getDeltaTime() and delta variable are 1 / fps, so you need to get the inverse of the delta to get the fps.
Then you can take your designated rotation amount, 90°, and find the amount it needs to rotate every frame:
Then you would just need to apply the amount to the player every frame
I want to rotate my player to 90° for a specific duration. I know scene2d provides this, but I don't want to use it for my players. 
With how much to rotate every frame, so after x seconds the rotation is finished? The game can run on different FPS also.
