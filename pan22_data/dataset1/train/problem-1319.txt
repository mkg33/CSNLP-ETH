On your Hyper-V host, install Routing and Remote Access.
Then you can use RRAS to NAT from your public IP address inside to your virtual machines, using the IP addresses assigned to their virtual network adapters.
However, beware! Installing RRAS from a remote session often locks you out as you configure RRAS as your session becomes invalid under the new configuration. More on this in a minute.
As for the network switch configuration, generally yes, you would create a total separate, segregated network for your virtual machines and you would just poke ports into there via NAT. However I can't answer your question about whether or not adding the network will kick you out of the host.
Does your hosting provider give you Out Of Band access to the server? Rather than just remoting in, do they have a KVM over IP (such as HP's iLO or Dell's iDRAC or SuperMicro's really crap KVM-over-IPMI implementation) that they could give you access to? That way it won't matter if you bork your RDP connection as you have an out of band path to get back into the server.
You could always spin up a virtual firewall/router VM with two NICs, and route through to the VMs. PFSense plays nicely with hyper-v 2012r2+ and is incredibly easy to setup and manage.
