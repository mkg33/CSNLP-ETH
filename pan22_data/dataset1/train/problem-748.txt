Density of the disks - a hard drive has a much, much higher density then a DVD.
Different media properties - a DVD is not designed for speed, nor does it use magnetic flux. Similarly it is not really a read-write medium (although it can sometimes be used a bit like one)
Error correction - DVDs have a lot of redundancy to handle things like scratches.
It's worth noting that very old Hard drives had much greater tolerances, and you could remove the platters without a cleanroom. As densities increased, tolerances decreased, and those days are more-or-less at an end. (It's still possible to do sometomes, but has a high failure rate)
A hard drive may fail if a single piece of the smallest dust, or even fingerprint particle is present on the disk, so it is well secured in metal cases.
A CD, or DVD (or any other optical disk) is stored casually in plastic cases and may even stack together with other CDs, indicating that it is very dust-proof. We only need to wipe it with wet paoer tissues and then let it dry before we can put it into a DVD reader to get its content.
