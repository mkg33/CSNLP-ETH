Recently I've noticed that windows search indexer is using about 15% cpu
I don't think it's been like this before, only in the last week or so
Recently I've found that it's been taking up about 800MB of memory - consistently!
Although these might be clues, I don't understand why it should be going consistently!
Any help on these issues will be greatly appreciated.
It could be that you have a corrupt Windows Index. You can rebuild it by the following steps:
To rebuild the Windows Search index, head back to Control Panel > Indexing Options. Click the Advanced button and make sure you’re on the Index Settings tab of the Advanced Options window.
Under the Troubleshooting section of the Advanced Options window, find and click the Rebuild button. Windows will warn you, just as we did above, that the index rebuilding process may take a long time, and that you may not have full search functionality until it’s complete. Click OK to accept the warning and start the re-indexing process.

I'm also pretty sure that you don't need your Windows Indexer turned on if you are using Everythings index to search your files. In this case, you should turn it off.
