Your browser and Flash are different. Firefox is the browsing software (browser) and Flash is a plugin (additional software) that is used by Firefox. Firefox may be up to date, but Adobe Flash out of date at the same time.
As the comments above suggest, goto https://get.adobe.com/ or use Firefox's internal plugin updating function.
I visited a site (http://gaana.com) for the first time today. I chose an album and started the playlist. I listened to about 2 songs and then suddenly the audio player stopped abruptly.
I tried clicking the Play/Pause button but that didn't seem to do anything. Finally, I did a page refresh and got the following message:
So what could possibly have happened in 10 minutes? I checked for a Firefox update but the browser is up to date:
I'm using an office PC so could it possible that the IT Dept found out about the streaming and somehow disabled Flash in my browser? Is that even possible? 
What are my options in that case? Any way I could bypass this Flash check?
PS: I get the same error message in Google Chrome too and that browser is up to date too.
