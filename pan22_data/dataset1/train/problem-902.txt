Here is a detailed article that gets to the heart of the matter - it doesn;t matter how powerful and detailed your access control and security systems are... if its too complicated to set them correctly, you will end up with security holes. In this case its complexity of the systems - the larger the 'surface', the more chance there is of a security bug.
I used to see this with our domain groups - its too easy to give someone access to a secured resource if they are in the wrong group if you have too many groups. The register describes this better.
I'm reading MIT 6.893 lectures on which it says protection in Unix is a mess, no underlying principle, and it also points out that Windows has better alternatives, which can pass privileges from one process to another over IPC.
In my opinion, although it seems that Windows users are more subject to viruses and vulnerabilities, I believe it is mainly due to most Windows users are less experienced computer users and Windows platform attracts more attackers since it has more users.
I'd like to know are there any more detailed articles or paper comparing security mechanisms and designs in Windows and Linux?
