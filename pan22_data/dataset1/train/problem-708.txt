The router sees the aliased IP by way of the subnet.  The gateway is only relevant for traffic to addresses that are not within the subnet range.
You might be confused with the router showing a list of DHCP-registered addresses.  Your address, configured statically, will not be in that list.  It might be in a "connected devices" list, but not DHCP.
On my Win7 host machine, I have two VMs which I test network/server stuff.
On one machine I created an IP alias using the following commands from http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialNetworking.html#NETWORKALIASING (edit to fit my network):
I can navigate to the address in my browser and up pops the web GUI from that machine. Excellent! I checked the router to see if the IP address was registered as a static IP or whatever to the same hostname. This where I caught a snag. The aliased address isn't on the list.
So on my other machine I manually entered a static IP to test if it was just that static IPs don't show up -- In theory they should right? To get to the Internet, you have to pass the gateway which logs clients. Well that shows up on the list.
My question is: how does the router see the aliased IP? Can I port forward to that alias? Google only shows me how to create an alias, not really how the aliasing works.
The router sees the aliased IP as any other. Since the IP is set manually, without DHCP, you just have to know it's there; its not until that IP traverses the gateway to the outside Internet that the router adds it to the "Active Clients" list. You would have to port forward to this address and connect from the outside for it to show.
