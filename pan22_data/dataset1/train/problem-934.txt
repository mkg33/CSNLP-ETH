You can just download the source files and compile it.  Its a very straightforward compile and takes just a couple minutes.  From the site (http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html#installing):
Extract everything from the distribution tarball (haven't you already?) and go to the sphinx subdirectory. (We are using version 2.0.1-beta here for the sake of example only; be sure to change this to a specific version you're using.)
There's a number of options to configure. The complete listing may be obtained by using --help switch. The most important ones are:
--prefix, which specifies where to install Sphinx; such as --prefix=/usr/local/sphinx (all of the examples use this prefix)
--with-mysql, which specifies where to look for MySQL include and library files, if auto-detection fails;
--with-pgsql, which specifies where to look for PostgreSQL include and library files.
Install the binaries in the directory of your choice: (defaults to /usr/local/bin/ on *nix systems, but is overridden with configure --prefix)
When I do "sudo apt-get install sphinxsearch", I get version 0.9.  I want the latest stable version (which is 2.4, I believe)
