I have a WHM/cpanel server with about 200 sites on it. Most sites have a dedicated ip (about 100 of them) The other sites are on a shared ip.
The dedicated sites can be accseed by the ip address eg, http://123.123.123.123.  
Is there a way to set up a mass redirect so that every site on a dedicated ip gets it's ip address redirected to the domain. E.g just make the default behavior of the web server to redirect an IP to the corresponding domain.
I know you can do this for each site via .htaccess or apache config file, but I want to avoid having to modify 100 sites, and have to do it again every time i create a new account.
Someone can correct me when I am wrong here, but I do not believe an easy solution/button exists for such a thing. 
As you mentioned, .htaccess is a solution. Another solution would be to edit the virutalhost entires in your Apache log as such:
Of course you can automate this using bash, perl or any other scripting language you would like. For new accounts that contain a dedicated IP address, you can always use cPanel/WHM API for this sort of thing: post/pre ww account creation
