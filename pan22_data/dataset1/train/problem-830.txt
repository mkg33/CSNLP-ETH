Found a solution to the "processing change" issue
I had the continuous processing changes issue on my Windows 7 Ultimate X64 computer with OneDrive and OneDrive for Business and I found a solution that worked for me. I discovered that turning off UAC would correct the problem, but I wanted to leave UAC enabled, so I went to Programs, righted clicked on the OneDrive and left clicked on Properties. Then opened compatibility and selected Server 2008 SP2 and clicked apply and OneDrive started syncing without any issues. You cannot run OneDrive for Business in compatibility mode, but to my surprise, after changing OneDrive to compatibility mode, the issues were corrected in OneDrive for Business. If you are not aware of the difference OneDrive is the personal cloud storage linked and outlook.com account and OneDrive for Business is cloud storage linked to an Office365 account. 
Had the same issue, on both my personal OneDrive and work OneDrive account. Changing the ownership of my OneDrive folder to my Microsoft account fixed immediately the issue I had with my personal one. I had to unlink the work OneDrive account and re-setup. That fixed the work OneDrive account.
