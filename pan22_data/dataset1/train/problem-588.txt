Does there exist a commandline tool for Linux which allows me to extract all /Subtype /Image raster image objects from a PDF, allows me to process them using another 3rd party tool and then is able to reinsert them into the original PDF?
The Debian package poppler-utils brings the tool pdfimages which allows me to extract all images from a PDF but I can't easily re-insert them into the PDF after I changed them.
I wrote simple parsers for PDF before so my current take on this problem would be to
But maybe a tool which allows all this and is not limited to the capabilties of a simple parser written by me already exists?
If you say such a tool does not exist, then it is also okay to tell me a library which allows to extract and later replace images.
It seems this is not (yet) possible to do in the commandline but I found an easy way to script it in python using the pdfrw python module like this:
You can potentially implement whatever you want in the process_images function and even complicated things like calling external programs to modify the current image can easily be done. In this example we just use PIL to reencode jpeg images with a quality of 45.
Or you can extract image, modify them with anything you want (imagemagick?)
 then replace them in your document with inkscape.
