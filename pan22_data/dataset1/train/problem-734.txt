I've got three displays connected via DVI on two different ATI cards on Arch Linux using the xf86-video-ati driver.
All three are currently serving output, but one of my displays (the one on the second card) falls back to a grey screen and a black "x" cursor after logging in to GDM.
Worth noting is that the display functions on the GDM login screen, rendering the background of the login screen (but not the login box, as the other two displays do).
How can get a working desktop with all three displays?
I'm using GDM and Gnome3, with the following xorg.conf:
I tried to do dualhead on my machine using a single ATI graphics card. I noticed that the virtual screen size was too small to accomodate both monitors.
In the end I only had to increase its size to be able to set both monitors right within Gnome3's screen management application.
I also tried adding all screens as separate ones in Xorg.conf, but ended up being unable to drag windows across screen borders etc. so I didn't persue that method any further.
