what is the best way to draw in LibreOffice that is ready for exporting to MS Word?, answered by the poster himself :
Your is a common problem with Word and I have the impression that Microsoft didn't like so much the idea to enhance the compatibility with Openoffice. I would like to suggest the use of Latex, BTW it is not always possible.
Since you noticed that you can produce the desired effect exporting as PDF, I decide to report here an interesting blog page for MacOS that can used to get hints to import a vectorial PDF inside Microsoft Word: the procedure is not fast but it avoids to fix the draw on a grid (as you do converting to PNG).
Once that you have your PDF (or eps) file you can convert in EMF by command line too.
You can search a program to manage images that works fine with vectorial format under your operative system. Maybe you want to give a look to  inkscape or intaglio for OS.
At the end you may prefer to fix the grid if the image as PNG file, maybe with the same resolution of the printer you're going to use (even 600 dpi or more if this is the case) and to save your time.
