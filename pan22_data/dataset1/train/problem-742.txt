When shopping for a new desktop computer, I'd like to get one that allows me to use two monitors.  Is that something that most current-generation video cards can do (in late 2012), or do I need to search for a specific graphics card, or specific attributes for a card?
I've Googled the question but most answers talk about how to figure out if a computer that you already have can support dual monitors (generally, by plugging two monitors and seeing if they both work).  Is there some key terminology that I'm missing in my searches?
Two monitors is simple for modern computers to accomplish. If you want more than two you will need to make sure you get a graphics card strong enough to support it, as well as the proper connectors.
For two monitors though, Just make sure that it includes the necessary ports. Most bargain PCs only provide one Video out port. If this is the case you will need to purchase either an internal graphics card with the needed ports, or buy a USB->Video converter (cheaper, but not as nice of a picture.)
For laptops, look into docking stations. These almost always provide at least two video ports for the purpose of multiple monitors.
