Outlook evidently has a setting somewhere that controls whether an email attachment of a given file type can be directly opened, or whether the user must go through the "You should only open attachments from a trustworthy source" dialog.  One of the options in this dialog is "Always ask before opening this type of file".  
To un-check the "always ask" setting, you have to close outlook, re-open as an administrator, then attempt to open every file type that you want to change this setting for, then unset the "always ask"... then close outlook and re-open as a normal user.  I'm trying to find a way to automate this process, but I can't seem to figure out where this setting is stored.  I would assume it's buried somewhere in the registry, but then again outlook also has a habit of storing plenty of stuff (cough autocomplete list cough) in random database files.
Does anyone know where/how outlook stores the "safety state" of attachment file types?  
Technically speaking this prompt happens in Outlook after the: "Enable Protected View for Outlook Attachments" under Trust Center (from Excel or Word) is unchecked. Keep in mind that Outlook Trust Center doesn't show this option to disable/enable protected view settings, you will have to go to the Office Suite program in question. If you enable this setting you won't get the prompt back, however the protected view settings alert when you open Excel/Word will now appear. I end-up doing a fix provided on MS forum by Roady: Right Click on Outlook shortcut and running it as an Administrator and then did a Ctrl + Shift while opening the attachment, this will allow you to uncheck the box for "Always ask before opening this type of file".
