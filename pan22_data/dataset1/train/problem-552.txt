There is a theoretical maximum of sessions you can have established to a single web server from a single client. It is possible that you have reached this limit.
What identifies a TCP connection are a combination of
What remains is the source port, which have a maximum amount of 65535 ports. Not all of these are used for outgoing connections. Depending on your client operating system, this number is restricted to a shorter range (i.e. 65535-1024).
To see if you have exhausted the amount of possible sessions, do the following on the server:
You will have to investigate the clients limits to amount of source ports to determine the maximum.
If I get the error message right it displays the status of SSL_connect. In this case reason 5 would mean SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL (see ssl/ssl.h in OpenSSL) and one would get more details about the error by "look at error stack/return value/errno". Unfortunatly httperf does not provide more detailed information so one just can guess: It might be that it got ECONNRESET or EPIPE because nginx closed the connection. Maybe you find more information in the error log from nginx itself.
