I've come to this issue myself and done some research. 
 1. Video paused for some time and when resumed the video gets reloaded and starts from the moment you left it. (Usually happens on youtube)
 2. Lost connection - sometimes it might happen that you lose your internet connection, and the video gets "reloaded" at the moment it was interrupted. 
 3. Browser changes regarding HTML5 implementation. - I think this could your case. As I've had the same problem the latest months and not before. Some video players do not support HTML5 video, and browsers are tending to update their core to play HTML5 by default, which in my opinion it's not still perfected.
 4. Change in your public IP - Several time ago, my ISP was doing some changes in the public IP (how the ip was set to different users), and google and many other sites showed messages like connection not secure or something similar. 
 1. Have you tried to connect to another network? And if so does the same happen?
 2. Does this happen in another machine or only in this one?
 3. Are you running any firewall, antivirus or different DNS?
since I started my computer yesterday, I experience the following problems:
This is my work computer, running Windows 7 64 bit Enterprise SP1 and it has the latest Windows updates.
Problem solved by installing the Realtek HD audio driver. For some reason, only the default Microsoft audio driver was installed on this PC. Cheers.
