If you don't want to connect any internal peripherals and your Adaptec HBA can provide termination (all Adaptec cards I have seen in the past 20 years could do that), then you may disconnect the internal cable. To check the termination provided by your Adaptec card, you should enter the card's BIOS menu at boot, and look for the termination setting. It is most probably in 'Automatic' mode, which is the preferred setting. Either that or 'Enabled' should provide termination. If it is 'Disabled' then you should change it. If you cannot find the termination setting there at all, that may be a problem.
I have SCSI adapter Adaptec ASC-29320ALP U320 (rev 10):

For years I have been using with internal LTO-2 tape drive with a properly terminated cable. Recently this device got damaged and I bought a new LTO-3 external tape drive which comes with a terminator attached to it and an LVD cable.
The plan is to remove the old internal LTO-2 device from the computer box and to use only the new external LTO-3 drive. As far as I understand from the manual to use an external device I need to connect it with the LVD cable and terminate it (as it is the one and only, i.e. last one). This part is clear.
However I am not an expert on SCSI and I am looking for answers to the following question:
In short - can I completely get rid of the internal cable or will that cause some problem (data loss or other) because the internal port will not be connected to anything?
