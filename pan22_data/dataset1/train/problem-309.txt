Did that with the help found at that post using Microsoft's troubleshooter from here. Other answer here didn't help.
Sorry to necro this thread, but it's the only one I've found discussing this specific issue - and I'd like to leave a trail of breadcrumbs in case anyone else experiences it in the future. 
I had this same issue, also on a pc, also trying to get driver support for a mac keyboard. I couldn't use the Command Prompt suggestion b/c apparently there was no .msi file (I also used 7-zip to look into the .exe for an .msi to no avail) - I assume it was a botched install because this isn't a mac. I couldn't use the default Windows add/uninstall programs tool, nor the one linked in other support articles (Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall tool). I tried reinstalling bootcamp hoping to use an uninstall/repair option, but couldn't because .. this isn't a mac - it said the install wasn't compatible with my machine. I have no idea how I managed to get a partial install in the first place, but I assume that's partly why there was no .msi file. I couldn't remove the program because it was running, I couldn't shut it down, and I didn't have any of the standard uninstall options available. 
What worked for me was simple, in the end: I opened task manager (ctrl+alt+del) and went to the start up tab. I disabled bootcamp from start up. Which then meant that after restarting my machine, I could go into C:\Program Files\ and delete the boot camp folder (which I couldn't do previously because it was launching at startup). No more boot camp.
