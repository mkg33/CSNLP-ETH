These aren't cumulative measures, they're only related to the current or last wait event.
v$session_wait_class on the other hand sums up the times a session has been in different wait classes.
So it's understandable that the times indicated in [g]v$session_wait_class are larger than the ones you're looking at in [g]v$session.
The opposite could be true too though, depending on when a wait is accounted in the wait class view. If it's accounted once the wait event is over and not dynamically (I think that's what happens), the current wait could be larger than the sum of previous waits.
I'm trying to track the different wait time classes for current Oracle sessions but I must be misunderstanding something.  When I compare the sum(time_waited)/1000 for a given session in gv$session_wait_class its often greater than the value of seconds_in_wait from gv$session and sometimes even greater than its last_call_et which I thought would be the total time...
What am I missing here?  Why aren't they the same?  I'm comparing numbers with this query:
