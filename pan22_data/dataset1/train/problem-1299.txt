They might not have truncated your password in the database, it might be a pre submit check on the length of the string before it gets checked.
However, if you were able to get in by typing the first 31 (or 30) characters then it would have to have been stored in clear text.
If it is a large U.S. bank, I can almost guarantee that it is "securely" stored as there are laws and regs for banks... However that doesn't really mean much.
The easiest way to know if a site is store a password in clear text or not is their password recover/reset. If a site can send your password back to you, it is being store either in clear text or is not using a 1 way hash. If they make you reset your password or reset it with a temp password, it is more than likely using a hash.
As said above, it is VERY possible the text box truncated the string to 30 chars, or the hash algorithm truncated it BEFORE it was hashed. Sometimes developer do stupid things like make password fields only 30chars because who would ever have a password longer than that? =P
SIDE NOTE: If you feel your bank is unsecured or untrustworthy than switch to a bank that you feel comfortable with. I suggest this because you will probably not ever find out the answer to this.
