DNS propagation can be instantaneous but is hampered by caching servers. The maximum caching time is limited by a record's time-to-live value (TTL). The default TTL is 86400 seconds, taking 24 hours to time out. Some servers cache even longer than that or are cascaded, so it might take longer.
If you're planning to update a record you should lower its TTL a few days in advance to maybe 300 (5 minutes), so the old value times out quicker. Don't forget to raise it again with/after the change.
Let's think about the DNS system and how much traffic it sees in a given day, hour, minute.. second even.   This system is ubiquitous and global.  This is a server-client system where you query an authoritative server for his information.  Now, what would happen if every single IP packet sent to a DNS host had to be resolved in real-time.  The authoritative servers would be flooded with so many requests in a give second that they would cease to operate.
Instead, every DNS entry carries with it a TTL value, or time-to-live.  This value indicates how long the DNS cached entry should be trusted.  Once we no longer trust the entry (TTL runs out), we re-query the server to see if anything has changed.
To answer your question, how fast can we converge DNS?  While you can technically specify TTL values at very very short intervals, there are many other circumstances involved that will still slow propagation down.  Here is a link to a book excerpt that discusses the fact that DNS TTLs less than 30 minutes are ineffective and wasteful.

TLDR: 30 minutes is about the smallest realistic value for DNS propagation.
