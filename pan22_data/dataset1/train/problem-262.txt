While you are correct regarding the rDNS for the appserver, as well as regarding the forward zone - you might also wish to consider creating a PTR for the webserver, even though it doesn't send any mail. But won't really hurt anything if you don't do it.
Also, if the only hostname served by the webserver is www, you might want to simply create the A record for www instead of as a wildcard.
Furthermore, if there is any possibility of users attempting to visit your bare domain, you should create an A record for your bare domain as well. You can always have your webserver create an HTTP redirect to www in that situation.
I'm a little confused about the setup of a PTR record for reverse dns lookup.
We are hosted at Rackspace and we have a front end webserver and behind that an appserver. Users don't access the Appserver directly, they go through the webserver.
The appserver sends out all the email with from address suck as no-reply@domain.com
So, how do I set up the PTR / reverse dns configuration? I was thinking that it should be as follows:
