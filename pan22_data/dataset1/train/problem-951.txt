I'm designing a game reminiscent of Elite or Escape Velocity, those old space trading games, where you play a traveling merchant in space.
I'd like to have the game's economy at least resemble a real one. What resources are available that I could look at to get an understanding of the algorithms I'll need to perform the simulation?
One big hurdle is that I'm pretty horrible at math; so a simplistic explanation would be ideal.
I figure an interstellar economy wouldn't be all that different from a global one; certain things can only be manufactured in certain places (due to resources and technology levels), shipping things takes time and money, people in different places need different things... just instead of cities, they'd be planets.
A Google search of "economics simulation algorithm" and similar terms turns up little of use, and nothing I've got the background to understand.
Anyone know of any useful resources I could look into?
You can create a "flow of merchants" system which edits the routes' popularity based on the length of the journey and the income and adjusts the prices according to the amount of goods transported there. In other words, simulate other merchants(not individually, but via "popular routes") that influence the economics as much as you do.
