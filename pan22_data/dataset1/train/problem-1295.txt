I'm not aware of any way to address the particular issue you are describing, but the following may help, depending on how you utilize Quick Look (QL):
Open QL and manually resize the window; the dimensions of the window will remain the same as you browse through the file system using the arrow keys or mouse. Any images, videos, documents, etc will be scaled to fit within the boundaries of the window, but note that the QL window must remain open during this process.
QL is effectively useless for low resolution content, particularly on the rMBP. It would be beneficial to scale content below some specific resolution. You can provide feedback to Apple here.
In Lion and Snow Leopard hitting the space bar in finder on any image would display that image at its exact dimensions or as close as it could get without bleeding past my display margins. Now in Mountain Lion hitting the space bar in Finder on an image only displays a relatively large thumbnail of that image. I have to click the 'full screen' icon in order to see it as any bigger. 
Anybody know how to get Quick Look to reveal the full size of the image by just hitting the space bar like it used to?
