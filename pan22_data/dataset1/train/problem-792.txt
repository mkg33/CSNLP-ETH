First, it sounds like you might be overloading your supply power circuit. (I assume you are using a wall outlet.) If that is the case, you need to address the root cause of the power supply fluctuations. 
Second, what is the quality of the power adapter you are using for the RPi? Is it rated at 2 amps or more? Also, what else do you have plugged into the RPi that is drawing current? 
Third, instead of changing the pins around, I would add a larger pull up resistor to reduce the current drawn by the button.
Finally, depending on the length of the transient power fluctuations induced by the external load, you could try modifying the if statement to require a period of time for the button signal to be low. The theory is that a human pressing the button will hold the signal low longer than the signal generated by the external load. This solution ignores the safety issue of resolving the source of the transient power fluctuations. 
I'm working on making a Doorbell powered by a raspberry pi,
I connected the existing wires from the button to the raspberry pi at GPIO pin 18 and the Ground Pin. I'm using the following while true loop to detect the button press.
This is working great, except whenever I put a load on the power circuit where the raspberry pi power adapter is plugged in, it will for some reason trigger the script.
Would it be better to connect one of the wires to the 3.3v and the other to a GPIO pin, and then check if it's high, instead of pulling it to ground?
