If you will be mucking with hardware or customized kernels, then a hosted solution will not work for you.
If you are just mucking with a LAMP stack and not doing anything lower level, go with a hosted solution.  You can do everything remotely from home using SSH and X windows.  The only advantage a VM image will have at home is that you can snapshot the image and do rollbacks.  I would do hosting and spend your time working on the LAMP stack rather than fighting with Comcast to get a static IP once you are ready for other people to play with your site.
I am in the process of learning as much as I can about LAMP. I was wondering if I should set a web server on my home network, or use a service like Rackspace (cloud space)? I need to have root access, to be able to access it remotely via SSH/FTP/HTTP, and to be able to install things like subversion, etc.
I currently have Comcast so I have plenty of bandwidth, but I am not sure if this would violate the TOS, and/or compromise the security of my home network. Pricing for these cloud hosts, seems reasonable ($11 per month plus about $0.10 per GB of bandwidth), but I am not sure if I will have to control I am looking for.
