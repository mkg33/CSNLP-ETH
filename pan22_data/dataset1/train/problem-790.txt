If you don't see any changes, you are looking at the wrong place.
I'm using GPPs to deliver some registry values and grabbed these using the Registry Wizard tool. This has created a collection with folder structure underneath. I want to use Item-level targeting to apply these so assigned this at the top collection level. The impression I get from research is that the idea of this is that this setting should propagate down to all values, however, don't get applied.
If I set this on a single registry value below this level it does get applied so clearly there's something blocking this.
There's too many values to set this manually on each so really could do with getting this working.
To give a little background, I'm trying to set SCHANNEL Ciphers, Hashes, KeyExchangeAlgorithms and Protocols to IISCrypto Best practices. I noticed there's a GPO setting under "Local Policies>Security Options>System cryptography: Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing" which sounds like it should set what I'm trying to set here but doesn't appear to change these registry values either so abandoned this method.
Bah, it was down to the registry collection wizard not populating the Hive value in the preference as part of the process. Weird thing is that this value was already selected when viewing each value's properties so it new what it should be. Re-selecting this and applying set this properly.
