After downloading the FortiClient (v5.6) application for MacOS Sierra (10.12.6) and running the FortiClientUpdateInstaller.dmg, the installer ran, but ended in a timeout with the message: 
The application dmg file was obtained from: http://www.forticlient.com/downloads
How do I install it? Is there an offline/full-installer version?
I found the way around this was to run the FortiClientUpdateInstaller in the Downloads folder, then copy the FortiClientUpdate.app into the Applications folder.
Once it was copied there, I right-clicked and selected "Show Package Contents".
Inside, I navigated to /Contents/MacOS and double clicked the FortiClientUpdate file (108KB). As it ran and connected successfully to the server to download, a terminal window opened and showed the diagnostics.
After it was properly downloaded, I was able to install as per normal.

My suspicion was that the FortiClientUpdateInstaller app was not correctly honouring the proxy settings.
I tried doing what Paul suggested and running with shell environment variables for the proxy set:
Then running the app in that shell but it still failed:
Next, I connected via my phone hotspot to bypass the proxy and the application ran and downloaded the app fine.
Conclusion: The application does not honour the proxy setting on the system.
