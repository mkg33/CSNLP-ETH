We have a ASA 5510 with four networks: inside, outside, dmz, WLAN.
All addresses inside have nat to outside and dmz and WLAN.
There exists one static policy from inside to outside for our imap-server.
From WLAN we cannot reach this server. From dmz neither. This is our problem.
I tried to solve this by establishing a second static policy from inside to WLAN,
this works, but there is a DNS-problem. This has to have another name, because the
IP is a different one as that of the global outside. And I don't want to use split-horizon or other techniques.
I think I miss a directive or misunderstand something here. 
Regardless of whether or not you are NAT-ing an internal host to a less-secure interface, you still need to allow access from the less secure interface to the internal one.
Given the way PIXOS works, if you have no ACLs, by default all access from the more secure interface to the less secure interface is allowed.
This does not apply to traffic from the less secure interface to any more secure interface, however.
Other than that, there is no issue (split-horizon or otherwise) with assinging the same NAT-ed IP on separate interfaces; the assumption being that traffic on these different interfaces will never be exposed to each other anyway (if not, you're bridging your firewall...)
In the DMZ example, you need an ACL to allow access from the DMZ to the NAT-ed IMAP server's IP:
NOTE that access lists always need to match the NATed address, as they are applied before NAT.
