You might be required to sign a BAA with your cloud provider (Azure.) Ask your compliance representative(s).
Azure VMs, and Azure SQL, and SQL Server instances running within Azure VMs, are all in scope and supported here.
Bitlocker is sufficient for encryption of data at rest. It uses AES encryption in a way that satisfies HIPAA requirements (as well as the requirements of other similar organizations) for encryption of data at rest.
Furthermore, SQL Server will not store unencrypted, sensitive data on the OS drive unless you configure SQL to do so... like for instance configuring TempDB to live on the OS drive or something.
Encryption of cells/fields/columns within individual databases isn't strictly required assuming you have already satisfied requirements for encryption of data at rest in other ways, e.g. TDE or Bitlocker.
How you choose to manage the Bitlocker encryption key may come up, since it will not live inside a TPM chip or on a removable USB drive since you don't have access to the physical machine. (Consider having a sysadmin manually enter a password to unlock the data drive every time the server reboots.) This is sort of the main draw to services such as CloudLink, as they manage that sacred encryption key for you.
Answering your comment:  If you install SQL Server on D: and Windows runs on C:, SQL data will live in: the MDF and LDF files (on D:), in TempDB (on D:), and in Memory.  It's possible in a severe low memory state for the data to get swapped to the page file, which may live on C:.  Locking pages in memory may help.  SQL 2014 should support this.
