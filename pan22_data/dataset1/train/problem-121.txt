For a few days now, my computer uses a constant 30-35% CPU time, even if I don't use any program, and the mouse pointer shows a spinning circle next to the arrow.
I checked the Task Manager and Process Explorer. They both show 80-85% idle time but the usage is constant at 35%. How can I find out what is eating the CPU if PE and TM shows nothing?
If you check this screenshot, you can see that nothing is using more than 5%, yet my computer is on fire.
I also had the same problem, constantly 30-35% CPU usage even if I wasn´t connected to the internet! I followed all advices I could get, but nothing changed.
So, I decided to run CCleaner (free program). And when you run CCleaner you must turn your internet browser off, otherwise CCleaner asks if you allow CCleaner to turn it off.
Since I know this, I do not have any browser open while running CCleaner. However, CCleaner asked me anyway If it should turn off Firefox! I was puzzled, because Firefox wasn´t open... But I clicked "yes", and CCleaner tried to close Firefox to no avail, CCleaner asked again, "This application is difficult to close. Dou you want to force it to close"?. I never had this question before, but again I clicked "yes".
And, bang... the CPU was down to 0-1% !!! So, in my case Firefox obviously ran some programs or had browsers open that wasn´t shown on the screen! Very, very strange...
