This can probably be resolved by ensuring that you run the command from an elevated command prompt. Right click on the Cmd icon wherever it is you're running it, and make sure you launch it as 'Run as Administrator'. The fact that turning off UAC makes it work, strongly suggests this is what your problem is.
It's one of the security/safety features of the 2008 line that even Administrator has to take positive action to use an elevated command prompt.
With UAC enabled elevation is always required however the built in Administrator account (the single account with SID  S-1-5-21-xxxxxxx-500) and members of the "Domain Admins" group ( SID: S-1-5-21-domain-512) get automatically elevated, without the need for a human to respond to a prompt interactively. Accounts that are "merely" members of the local Administrators group will not (normally) auto-elevate, leading to the problem that you see.
This default behaviour can be modified by GPO to include other accounts\groups - the details of how to do that are in this technet article
