The switches don't care which domains holds DNS (A) records are that point to their management IP addresses.
If SSH is actually used for communication between the switches(?) you usually need to do an initial certificate exchange to establish trust. This is entirely unrelated to DNS.
How the switches communicate is up to the protocol that's used between them. E.g. M/RSTP doesn't use IP at all but BPDUs directly over Ethernet. Where IP is used it's with discovered or configured IP addresses. There's very little use for DNS in a switch.
It's possible that the switch uses information like the configured domain and host names as seeds to generate the public-private key pair for the certificate (although this isn't really smart) but apart from that, those names simply don't matter.
I read that , ssh key is generated as a combination of hostname and domain-name 
But doubt is , why isn't the network getting affected when I change domain name 
I changed the aggregate level switch's domain name , so now access layer switches and aggregation switch are in two different domain right ? How are they still communicating ?
