Two servers cannot give you as much HA as three.  And the three need to be geographically spread across 3 data centers.  That way, if a datacenter fails (and they do), the other two have a quorum and can continue running.
If you have already implemented your application using InnoDB, then the simplest is to go with 02: InnoDB Cluster.  Yes, it can have one active and multiple passive nodes.  I don't think there are $$ licenses for 01 and 02.
Another option is (again, no $$ license) is to have 3+ servers using InnoDB, plus Galera's clustering solution.  (Or MariaDB, which has Galera builtin.)
One is Active Server --> Master and second is Passive Server --> Slave.
And as we know we have 3-4 MySQL HR,DR Solutions / Clustering options.For example
My First Question is i want to deploy One Active & One Passive MySQL Server so which Cluster Option / HA,DR Option will be fit for above mentioned scenario ?
My Second Question is suppose i have deploy One Active & One Passive MySQL Server in any above mentioned Cluster Option / HA,DR Option. So what about licensing ? I have to buy license of MySQL Servers/ Cluster ?
