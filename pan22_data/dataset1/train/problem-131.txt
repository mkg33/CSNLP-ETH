There is a free Delete Fields utility that does exactly what you want. Just install it with Outlook Add-In support and you can run it using right-click context menu on selected messages or for the selected Outlook folder(s) or event for the entire mailbox.
This will delete reminders without clearing flag status.
DISCLAIMER: I recommend this tools because I'm one of the developers, so feel free to ask any further questions.
I have thousands of messages in the inbox for which reminders are set (or maybe it is called Alert in English version). 
Is there a way to remove reminders (alerts) from a group of selected (but not all) messages, without discarding the flags?
and this is how I want it: reminder disabled, but flag still set:
Research I did: There is no Quick Step to remove the reminder, and flag dialog cannot be shown for a group of selected messages. Flags can be cleared for selected messages with a Quick Step, but I do not want to clear the flags completely, only to disable the reminder. I could probably write an AHK script, but I feel it is too fragile and might mess things up if something goes out of sync.
