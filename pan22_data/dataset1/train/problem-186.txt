You can not copy file into network share bigger than available space in drive C: if offline files are enabled in Sync Center. Click Start - Type "Sync Center", and check if your share is marked as offline.
This is not limited to servers, this can happen on any Windows version including Windows 7 and Windows 8.
Offline files can be easy enabled by accident (shortcut Alt + F, A -- used by "File save as"), by navigating with Windows Explorer to any shared file, and clicking "Always available offline" from context menu or file menu.
I just lost 1h searching for solution to this problem.
I have some Windows Server 2003 and 2008 boxes that have files I need to copy that are in the range of 20 GB to 80 GB ranges.  The 20 GB files transfer without a problem from one server to another using UNC path.  The 80 GB files do not.  I get a message telling me that is out of space.  I am transferring from the D drive on one server to the D drive on the other which has a few hundred GB left.  However, the C drive on both servers only has 60 GB left.  Is this the limiting factor?  If so, why?  This happens with drag and drop, copy and paste, and robocopy.
