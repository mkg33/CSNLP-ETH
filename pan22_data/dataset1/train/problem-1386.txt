I have a Asus P8Z68-V board with onboard sound (Realtek HD). The driver obviously is installed, at least that's what the device manager says at the node Sound, video and game controllers. I have the entry High Definition Audio Device and since I have a 2nd gen Core i5, there is also an HDMI port with integrated audio, which is listed as Intel(R) Display Audio`. Both devices are working properly, at least that's what the property dialog says about both.
After the first message that the Audio Service is not running, I set the Windows Audio service's start mode to automatic and also started it.
Now the icon in the tray still is red and says No Audio Output Device is installed. But I definetly can tell that there IS an audio device installed. What can I do to make my Windows Server 2008 R2 recognize the audio devices?
Have you tried updating/re-installing the Realtek Drivers?  
Since there are no 'official' Windows 2008 R2 drivers for that Desktop board, then aim to use the Windows 7 driver(s) and hope they work. :)
You have a couple options to try to get the latest driver:
