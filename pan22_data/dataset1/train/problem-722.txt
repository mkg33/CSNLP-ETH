I would like to answer this because I had a similar problem, but I have no scripts running. I am an otherwise regular user. 
The accepted answer did heavily guide and inspire this answer. 
I would attempt to indent one line of text, and whole swathes of text would go with it. I created an example below:
Thankfully I was able to discover the interface show below, which contains the "Show/Hide Paragraph" option.
Once enabled, I was able to immediately see the cause of my problem, and could infer my solution from the accepted answer: Replace new lines with paragraphs. 
Modern solutions cause modern problems - Due to other chat programs (work and home) I have become used to adding new lines via Shift + Enter instead of paragraph marks using only Enter. The error occured due to (understandable) user error since Word/Outlook are one of the few programs left that I use that don't send on Enter. 
Ctrl + Enter does send in Outlook. I discovered this when I wanted to cut-paste, then press enter multiple times. Ctrl+V , Enter easily became Ctrl+V, Ctrl+Enter when I did not release the Ctrl key fast enough. 
I have AutoHotKey installed and am running a script to prevent Outlook's line breaks when sending an email out. Thanks to @root, I realized it only after enabling the Paragraph symbol and then noticing the shift+enter functionality when entering a new line.
I'm able to use bullet points normally if I suspend the script. However, my emails appearing as normal in a recipient's mailbox (without the line breaks) is more important than using bullet points. As a result, I've left the script enabled, but at least I know what the root cause is!
