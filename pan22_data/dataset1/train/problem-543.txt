Apply is the same thing as OK, but it keeps the window open. Ok just closes it after applying the settings.
I bet there are a lot of people who have not yet consciously noted some of the details there are around that button. It's not just that 'OK' also applies the settings and immediately closes the dialog (whereas 'Apply' keeps it open).
Who has ever noticed that there are two different ways to arrive at (seemingly) one and the same dialog 'Advanced (printjob) settings' when you go to the printers and faxes folder and look at any 'printer's properties'?
Both paths will bring up da dialog that looks exactly the same (apart from the window title line), and both dialogs will have an 'Advanced...' button that bring up another window each (which look the same up to the last pixel, even with the window title).
(I'm sorry I needed to translate from German to English -- I currently don't have access to a native English language Windows system, so my translation may not be perfect. Well, check yourself on your own system....)
You can even bring up both windows/dialogs at the same time (they are not modal).
Now try it on your own system(s) to see what I mean.
So why are there these two different ways to do one and the same job?!?
Yes, confusing, un-intuitive and hard to remember even after you've been told. But that's the way Microsoft implemented it...
