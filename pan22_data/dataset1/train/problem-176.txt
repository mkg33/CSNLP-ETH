CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) means that you no longer pay attention to the network classes, and it can be used with network masks or the mask length (CIDR notation, which is what I think you mean).
Using CIDR notation simply makes it easier to read a prefix, and it can help prevent typos that can happen when typing out a network mask.
The original IP addressing specification actually allowed you to use non-consecutive network masks, so you had to spell out the mask. CIDR will not work with non-consecutive network masks, so simply using the mask length makes things easier to read and write.
IPv6 only uses CIDR and CIDR notation because it was developed after CIDR. The tricks with wildcard masks in IPv4 no longer are available with IPv6. It can be argued that those were just tricks, and if you depended on them, then you were not doing things correctly in the first place. I have run into people that were using the trick of odd and even addressing meaning something, and they were using that with IPv4 wildcard masks and wanted to do that with IPv6, but they were out of luck with that.
CIDR is equivalent to net mask and can be used interchangeably.
Unless you start talking about policy based routing. In that regard, it is different. 
Say you make a rule for all traffic destined for the 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 network. All traffic destined for the .1 - .255 will be affected and rules applied.
If you make it a CIDR based rule 10.10.10.0/16 the rule only applies for that specific network. If the subnet is further subnetted to a /24 for example, and traffic is destined for 10.10.10.0/24 this will not match the CIDR rule and not be affected. But the same traffic with a route to the 10.10.10.0/16 the route rules will apply.
