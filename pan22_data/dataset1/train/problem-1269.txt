I was recently setting up a new 1.5MB DSL connection at home. After connecting my computers (wirelessly) to my DSL modem I fired off a broadband speed tester to see if both were delivering the expected throughput. My WinXP box was delivering about 0.7MB while my WinVista box was delivered about 1.2MB. Clearly I had an issue localized to the WinXP box so I tweaked its network settings with TCP Optimizer. That made its speed comparable to my other machine, both at about 1.2MB.
Reflecting upon this I asked myself: how do I really know what my speed is? I decided to test further, applying 3 different speed testers using 2 different browsers on each of 2 machines and, for good measure, I repeated each test twice, yielding 24 data points (well, OK, 48 since there was upstream and downstream). The raw data appears below.
Note that the data is sorted by provider then by speed (in Kbps) as the most useful order to see trends--they are not shown in the order of trials performed.
Also note that I shutdown all other foreground apps and windows but did not meticulously check service activity so that could possibly account for some of the glitches.
I have some estimate of my connection speed (1270 Kpbs downstream, 600 Kpbs upstream). The downstream estimate is much more reliable based on standard deviations given above. My question is how does one get truer or more accurate estimates of connection speed? (Note I ask for truer rather than true--I am a pragmatist:-) Or to put it another way, how does one judge which numbers to believe?
(2 machines x 2 browsers x 3 services x 2 trials x 2 directions)
I would trust the speedtest.net results over the other ones. I've heard from the designer of the speedtest.net site that most other speed testers use faulty and inconsistent methods. He is of course a biased source, but the consistency of the speedtest.net results would also lead me to trust it more than your other sources.
