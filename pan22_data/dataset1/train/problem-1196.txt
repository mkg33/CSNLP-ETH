When I'm in Visual Studio, and I try to deploy I got some error messages:
(obviously, I did make sure that I don't have any firewall).
If I go on http://192.168.0.25:8080 which is my Raspbery Pi, I get the win 10 dashboard.
In this dashboard, if I try to click on Debug->Start Visual Studio Remote Debugger -> Start, it says: 
I just created a blank dummy project, so I don't think it's coming from the content of the project.
They solved the issue by setting the authentification mode to "Universal", but I don't have this option, in fact when I initially selected the device, I only had Windows or None. And if I got to the settings now, I've only a checkbox:
I'm not sure what I did wrong, what I don't have this option, any idea?
I had this same problem when trying to debug an application against the Insider Preview, build 10.0.14295.0.  
To solve this error I connected to the a Rasberry Pi RTM version of Windows IoT using windows explorer, and found the dev tools located at the following folder.  I was then able to copy this folder to the Insider Preview Build of Windows 10 IoT, and remote debugging and deploy worked.
