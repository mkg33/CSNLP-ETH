It looks like a bug in the way the -lname predicate is tested, and it's much weirder than just not recursing. From my testing, it seems to only work on files at the same directory depth as the current working directory (i.e. is you were in ~/Documents and ran find .. -lname '/Volumes*', it would find links in ~/Documents and ~/Desktop, etc but NOT any links in ~).  But there is (at least according to my testing) a workaround: it seems to work if the starting directory is an absolute path, so using find "$PWD" -lname '/Volumes*' instead of find . -lname '/Volumes*' seems to avoid the problem.  Here's a test sequence to illustrate this:
In my ~ dir, I have some symlinks that point to "/Volumes/Macintosh HD 2/..." and I want to find them all recursively. A look at the man page for 'find' says the '-lname' argument will search the symbolic link contents. It appears to work, but not recursively:
What's going on? How can I make this work recursively? -- The 'find' program is supposed to always work recursively.
I checked perms, they look ok, but as you can see I used "sudo" just to be sure... no dice.
