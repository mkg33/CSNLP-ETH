It's possible that mounting a disk read/write could leave traces.  On the Mac, you can use mount(8) or diskutil(8) to mount a disk read-only.  But off the top of my head, I don't know how to get the Mac to not automount any new disk you attach.  So the problem is getting the Mac to not automount it, so that you can then mount it read-only by hand.
Are you going to do this often (or are you rich)? There are hardware utilities that allow you to connect hard drives with write blockers between them, preventing absolutely any write operations on the HDD itself (at least those that might be initiated by your computer - the firmware of the HDD will still probably update internal values such as power on count and other SMART parameters). They are quite expensive for one-time use.
You don't need to be a professional to see these values - if you're paranoid and looking for it, you would notice.
Apart from that something like clonezilla is a nice free HDD cloning tool that should make things simple and safe. IF you want to pay, try Acronis TrueImage or Symantec GHOST.
