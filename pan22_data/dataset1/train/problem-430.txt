By the way, tweaking Beacon Intervals and DTIM Intervals are likely to do more harm than good overall.  Most clients expect Beacon Intervals to be about 100 TU's (802.11 Time Units; 1024 microseconds; sometimes called kÂµsec (kilo microseconds) or Kiusec (Kibi microseconds)), and DTIM intervals between 0-3 beacons.  I've seen some poorly-written Wi-Fi clients freak out if you change either of those too much (like make either of them more than one second long).
Not really a direct answer, but I'd think that having a good wifi signal (read: access point near the host station, not many wifi networks in the area, not many wifi hosts in the network) would give much greater performance improvements than any tweak.
Also, as far as I know, while there are some really minor tweaks you could do, they are sensitive to the accesspoint/hostcard pair (results could be different with other cards) to the network status (overlapping networks, clients in the network, etc).
All in all, you will probably gain some 1-3% improvements spending lots of time carefully tuning those parameters, with an even smaller influence on the user experience - I'd say it's probably the best way to spend time and you could get better results somewhere else (like checking for other nearby networks and make sure channels don't overlap, or stuff like that).
