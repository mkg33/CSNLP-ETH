Although it seems like a hardware problem to me (from here, without seeing it ;) ), you'll still want to discern if it's hardware or software that's causing the problem.
If you want to eliminate software, reinstall your OS (or install a fresh test copy on a different drive). 
If you want to eliminate hardware, then you'll need spare parts to start swapping in and out.
If you have an alternate card(integrated graphics card, IGD) in your system then first goto your bios and restore all settings (default bios settings) and then boot from that card (i.e. go into your BIOS ,as I don't know your bios I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly, and then go to video options that lets you to determine which card you want to use during Boot process). If this works (which I hope should work and as you also said that "The default Windows video driver is also working without problems" as these drivers work on an integrated card) then it should not be a problem of your graphics driver. First try to update your BIOS (it's for if this is your first BIOS update) and always boot from IGD into your windows. Then first change your preferred screen to the other screen (Screen using your AMD graphics card) and then try to change your screen to another input (I assume that your monitor accepts multi-inputs). You should always do this and if you want to boot from AMD graphics card you can change it anytime, but since it crashes most of the time, I recommend you to use this method for some days(1 week or so) and then change your default Graphics card during boot.
