There's no need for AutoHotKey or random tray tools â€“ the Boot Camp driver meant for dual-booting on a Mac actually works just fine on PC hardware using Apple peripherals, too!
Just grab the latest version of the Boot Camp Support Software (5.1.5722 at the time of writing), and extract it somewhere. If the only thing you care about is the keyboard driver, copy out the BootCamp.msi and AppleKeyboardInstaller64.exe files to a separate directory. Then, from an administrator shell, just run
The installer may throw some errors (presumably because the other drivers it wants to install aren't there), but the keyboard driver will end up installed. Just reboot and use the media keys to your heart's content!
The application by UXSoft.cz seems promising but as of writing the download is down unfortunately. This fork does have an executable binary: https://github.com/gered/AppleWirelessKeyboard (also seems like an even more unmaintained repo tho)
Also works perfectly for my wired Apple keyboard (model A1243)
