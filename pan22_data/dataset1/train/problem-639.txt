I've not got one of these (I've just looked at THIS emulator) but f you want your router to do Bandwidth control/QoS to fix this problem
Try something like logging in to the router, going to Advanced -> Bandwidth Control and enable.  Set the total upstream and downstream bandwidth and save.  Then you need to configure controlling rules.
The controlling rules will require some tweeking, but you want to add rules limiting the outgoing traffic from your computer (ie by its IP address) to something less then the actual thoughput you are getting on your connection - 80% of the result of a speedtest upload should be fine.    You will also need to ensure the IP address of your device(s) are static - which you can do under Advanced->LAN Settings -> Address Reservation.
Since you are using a TP-Link router you migth want to check out their FAQ section about bandwidth control:
In particular, I would focus on the minimum bandwidth feature.
"From the rules, the max Bandwidth can ensure that  PC1 and PC2 can take up all bandwidth when itâ€™s alone to access the Internet and the min Bandwidth can ensure that they have the necessary bandwidth when more than one PC work at the same time."
You may want to reserve IP addresses if you are using DHCP to make things easier to configure single clients.
I think the best way to go is that, however if you don't wish to do so and / or your specific router model do not have the necessary features there are alternatives.
