I want to be able to achieve spell effects that cause a fragmenting/discoloring effect on the sprite. The first couple seconds of this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNCFh7mkvuc shows what I mean. When the enemy gets hit by an electric attack, the effect I'd like to achieve activates (in yellow).
I'll have to use shaders to do this (if I don't, other, practical ways to do it would be extremely helpful). I have no idea where to start with a shader like this (beyond the obvious - using time and base color as parameters), and was curious if someone had something similar I could use as a base, or had a good idea where to start. I know the basic of glsl, but was hoping to spare myself some pain if someone has something like this already or could provide a starting point.
Just to clarify, I'm looking to apply this against a 2D texture in OpenGL using glsl shaders
I've created something like it in 3d. Youtube movie is at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j442OTfSmM . The trick behind this is to apply a selected color from a gradient to your object, moving through the gradient based on location and time. In other words, if the effect starts from the top, you use the color from the end of the effect at the top and the start of the effect at the bottom to make it appear as if it's going down. You also add a little bit of perlin noise based on the local x/y/z coordinate to get a slightly more perturbed effect - makes it look less synthetic. All three effects are in fact the very same effect routine, just different locations, speeds, gradients and so on.
I can post the code online tonight (in 8 hours or so) if it would help you. It does look a lot better on 3d models as they have depth information, making the effect look like it's not a flat moving image :-).
