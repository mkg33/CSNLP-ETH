Right now it looks like you've got some problems with your linux partition.  I suggest unmounting /dev/sda5 and running e2fsck on it (or the appropriate fsck for the partition, if it isn't ext2/ext3) to make sure it is okay.
I'd also recommend running smartctl to verify that the disk is healthy, and possibly some simple tests to verify the integrity of the drive (Input/output error is not normal and not good / healthy)
