"Seeing" the network is a function of several components, but is largely facilitated by NetBIOS broadcasts. Broadcast traffic is typically blocked by a router. You can do one of two things:

We have an existing (old) network (10.0.0.0/24) and we're trying to add another (new) subnet (20.0.0.0/24) using a Cisco 2901 router. I added the appropriate routes and tested everything out. We're good. I can ping across to the old subnet, can get to the Internet, etc.
On the new subnet we have a Cisco 2504 WLC with a few access points. The WLC hands out DHCP. I can connect to that network and get online.
On the old subnet we have a server running Windows Server 2008 R2. Windows Firewall is turned off both on this server and on all clients. Due to some organizational constraints we have to be able to browse to \Server1 from our new subnet but we cannot.
In other words, a client on the old network can see the server under "Networking" in Windows. a client on the new network cannot, but if you manually browse to \10.x.x.x (The server's IP) I can access everything as expected. So, the question is this...
In this scenario, how can I get a network of Windows 7 Pro machines on multiple subnets to see this all as one network from a Windows perspective? Note there is no domain controller, no ADDS, etc. This Server is the only one on our network and just acts as a file share of sorts.
