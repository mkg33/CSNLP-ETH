We found a work around (since this a temp connection...why not).  Lowering the MTU to 1200 on the workstation and server NIC's eliminated this issue completely and sped up speeds by about double (went from 1-3 Mbps to 5-7 Mbps).  
Glad you got a working solution to this. Based on what you have described, this sounds like a Path MTU Discovery Black Hole issue.
Essentially, you may well have a router on your route to the internet which has an MTU lower than the standard 1500 Bytes (1500 likely being used by your clients and the webservers they are talking to). Normally, this isn't an issue because when a router receives a packet that is too big to send out its next-hop interface it will drop the packet and send an ICMP Fragmentation Needed packet back to the sender. This ICMP packet includes the correct MTU so the sender can send all future packets at the correct size.
Problems arise if the Fragmentation Required packets are getting dropped - perhaps a router in the forwarding path has an overly aggressive Access Control policy. This results in the sender sending large packets which are dropped but then no feedback is being sent back - the sender will just keep trying to retransmit the packets.
If you look at this on the client side, you aren't seeing any traffic from the sender so you start sending Keep Alive probes.
Just as you described, you will often find that the TCP handshake and the initial GET request goes through OK because those packets are typically small. It isn't until the sender has to start sending full sized packets that the issue becomes apparent.
If this the issue you are experiencing, you should strongly advise whoever is responsible for the routers in the forwarding path to NOT drop ICMP Fragmentation Required packets - doing so can and will break things.
