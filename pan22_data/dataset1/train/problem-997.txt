I believe you might indeed have "overcleaned" your registry. Registry isn't something you should play with too much unless you really know what you're doing.
I think you should keep yourself mentally ready for an eventual need to format your computer and reinstall Windows. Registry issues are serious issues, especially if you're not sure what you did (the programs did the cleaning, and you probably don't know all they did precisely), and even more especially if you're not a pro.
I can't guarantee you'll be able to fix the issue, or that something dramatic won't happen when trying to fix it. Probably not - according to me, either you'll fix it, either you won't but won't have any effect - but maybe.
So this might be considered overly prudent, but I think you should backup your essential files before continuing. Just in case. Because playing with the registry is sort of like playing with fire.
"regardless of your skill level, you can inadvertently make a change to the registry that will destroy Windows", says the page I linked.
I have tried several apps trying to clean up my registry hoping  that that would straighten out my driver issues and none of them helped. I was also hoping that would help me diagnose my lack of info in device manager. I am fearing virus, or malware I'm thinking my registry is corrupt.
