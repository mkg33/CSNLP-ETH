Courtesy the Exchange 2010 "Remove a Mailbox" page on technet:
This issue was eventually discovered to be due to an improper installation of Exchange 2010. There was a phantom database and a phantom exchange server with residual registry entries that were preventing the proper functionality of the Exchange server.
Long story short, I had to individually remove and recreate each of the virtual directories as well as thoroughly searching through the ADDS infrastructure for stale server and database records.
At this point, I have successfully migrated all users over to the new 2010 Exchange server, configured the CAS role and made the necessary changes to our firewall for mail routing to the new server. 
So far, everything is working smoothly. At this point, I am powering down the Legacy exchange server and waiting a few days to ensure that the Exchange system works without the 2003 Server before I permanently decommission the server and remove it's records. 
Thanks to you for providing support, HopelessN00B and my apologies for the slow responses.
