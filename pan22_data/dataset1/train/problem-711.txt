If you are writing a program... you should be able to write a very simple parallel port buffer reader and even integrate it into your program for debugging issues!  Depending on the language there are different ways to access a parallel port, you should be able to google using  to access a parallel port.
I am writing a program that will eventually be used on a computer with a physical parallel port and will need to set certain pins high or low in order to signal to an external device. However, the development laptop I am using does not have any physical parallel ports and is too low powered to run a virtual machine.  Is there any option available that will create a virtual parallel port within Windows XP?  Ideally it would include a debug mode that would allow me to see what values have been pushed out on the parallel port.
Nobody knew the answer.  Frustrating.  I decided that the answer was to just find a computer that had the port, strip a parallel port cable and go at it with a multimeter.
