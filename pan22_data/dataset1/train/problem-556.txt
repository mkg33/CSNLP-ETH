Summary of the comments on the post and of the results of the tests conducted
The FastCopy utility distinguishes itself by doing reads and writes in parallel
and by not using the Windows cache for moving data.
The conclusion is therefore that the slowness experienced in copying files
when using the standard Windows mechanisms is due to :
The problem of slow file copy has been around Windows since a very long time
The above results might also explain why Linux is reportedly more
I noticed that file transfers on the same machine between a fast nvme m.2 ssd (general read speed 3.2GB/s and writes 2.7 GB/s) and a ram disk top out at around 1.4-1.5 GB/s. Why is that the case? I run Windows 10 Pro Workstation as OS and turned off any firewalls, virus scanners or other overhead. The drives individually benchmark both above 2.5 GB/s for reads and writes. Why is a windows file transfer of a single large file capped at around 1.5 GB/s? I am purely assessing sequential read and write performance. Is there a cap in Windows 10 when it comes to file transfers?
