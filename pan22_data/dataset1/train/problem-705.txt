Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning which is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning is a particular approach for AI but not the only one. Symbolic Logic, Bayersian Statistics are a few examples of AI approaches which do not use any kind of machine learning algorithms.
Let's take the total Turing test as an example. A computer is often said to be intelligent if it can pass the total Turing test.
A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer. The total Turing Test also includes a video signal so that the interrogator can test the subject's perceptual abilities, as well as the opportunity for the interrogator to pass physical objects "through the hatch."
To pass the total Turing Test, the computer would need to possess the
As you may already see, Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that concerns with the ability of an intelligent agent to learn.
