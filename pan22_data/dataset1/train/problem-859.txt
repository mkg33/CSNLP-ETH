This may seem quite obscure and perhaps quite niche but bear with me. 
What we'd like to do is to remove the SPOF so have multiple servers running this redirect. Setting the root domain to a CNAME in order to use an ELB is against the RFC I believe and I don't believe our DNS host will allow us to do this anyway. 
What should we do to remove this SPOF given these limitations? Admittedly it's low impact if it does disappear for any reason but the business wants to mitigate this risk. 
There is better approach to deal with apex domain rather then hosting 'redirector' instance on EC2.
You could host static website on Amazon S3, that could be configured to redirect your requests to particular domain. If you are using Route53 - there is an 'alias' record type to help you achieve that. Other DNS providers have similar ones.

S3 is fault tolerant service, so you would definitely remove your SPOF for fairly low cost.
