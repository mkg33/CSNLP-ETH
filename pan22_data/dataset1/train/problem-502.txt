I have a 32GB .tar.gz archive and I'd like to know the size of the files if I unpack this compressed archive. I'd like to avoid unpacking the archive first and than use e.g. du.
Is it also possible to find out the size of the contained files without unpacking the compressed archive (on a Linux and/or MacOSX system)?
For another archive I know, that it also contains .tar.gz files. Is it also possible to calculate the size of the unpacked archives that are contained within an archive? (for example by setting a level to which the "unpacking" should be simulated?)
First, you should know that the .tar.gz suffix means it's a compressed tar file. tar is just a means of packing multiple files and directories into one file. It does not have any compression by default. This is where gzip comes in. It's a tool for compressing a single file. Hence the aforementioned suffix means it's a compressed bundle of files and/or directories.
If you want to see the compression rates for each file in a zipped tar bundle, see the answer by Mark Adler.
If you are only interested in the whole zipped file (or bundle), the correct way of determining the unpacked size is:
The compressed and uncompressed numbers show bytes. Ergo my syslog.1 file would be about 32 MB uncompressed.
