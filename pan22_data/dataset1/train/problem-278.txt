One thing that I want to say though, is that RAID is NOT back-up.  Regardless of whether or not you have RAID 1, 5, 6 - you should never consider RAID as a backup solution.  What hapens if a trojan corrupts all your files?  RAID would mirror the corruption, and you'll be in trouble.  Always have a proper backup, which is an offline copy of your data.
My SSD with Windows 7 recently crashed, so I'm going to purchase a new SSD and install Windows 7 to replace it. I'll also have to reinstall all the drivers for my hardware (motherboard, graphics card, etc.). This time around, I was thinking of purchasing two SSDs and setting them up in RAID 1 mode. I had heard about RAID from some classes I took in college, the main idea being that if one drive crashes, the other can still function, and I won't lose data. Then, I can just replace the broken drive with a new one and the computer will pick up where I left off after copying all the files over to the new drive. This way, I won't have to reinstall the operating system or drivers if one of my SSDs crashes.
When I was researching more about RAID, I came across another technology called AHCI. I found several sites comparing the two but I'm still not clear what AHCI is.
