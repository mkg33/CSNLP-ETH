I have an application that needs to authenticate (log in as) a particular user.  The vendor says they need to hard-code the full DN of the user to make this occur.
It's been a while since I looked at LDAP, but remember a way that a user can either be searched for, referenced, or authenticated with a "shortened" LDAP query, but forget the syntax.
What LDAP syntax will allow a user to refer to an CN (aka "user") without hard coding the full OU path?
Reason: If an admin reorganizes the AD OU structure, some applications will fail to authenticate causing an unexp
It sounds like you're specifically referring to configuring the Bind DN, which the app will use to authenticate to LDAP?
If that's the case, then you're exactly right; you don't need to hardcode the user DN.  A UPN is also valid (username@upnsuffix, where upnsuffix is usually your domain's FQDN).
Whether this can be sent, and whether other LDAP paths like the search base or user/group identifications are stuck to specific paths, are completely up to the implementing software, so you milage will vary.
