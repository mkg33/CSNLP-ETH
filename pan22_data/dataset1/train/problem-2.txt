"This behavior can occur if Windows has detected that the BIOS in the computer is not fully compliant with Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI).
To work around this behavior, manually install the Standard PC hardware abstraction layer (HAL):
When Setup starts again, press F7 (not F6) when you see the "Press F6 if you need to install a third-party SCSI or RAID driver" screen.
Windows automatically disables the installation of the ACPI HAL and installs the Standard PC HAL. "
When I try to install Windows XP (don't ask...) on a new-ish laptop (Lenovo Y410p), its text-mode portion installs correctly, but then when I try to boot it afterwards so that it can continue with the graphical portion, it gives me the STOP error 0x000000A5, telling me that the system is not ACPI-compliant.
This seems strange, because in the firmware settings, the option to switch between Discrete and UMA-only graphics explicitly says I need to select UMA for Windows XP, which I am doing, and which makes me think it is indeed possible to install Windows XP on this machine. But I can't figure out how.
Is there any way to either fix or bypass the ACPI check?
