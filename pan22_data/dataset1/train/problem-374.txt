The first thing I'd try is running a LiveCD environment and just attempt to ungzip everything, hoping that would return the system to a bootable state. Note: I'd be concerned about potential data corruption if the original gzip process was interrupted.
Otherwise I'd try to migrate the DB to a new system as others have suggested but as you've encountered there may be labor intensive dependency and configuration issues that will need to be resolved individually.
This will depend on whether the filesystems are repaired enough for you to be able to mount those partitions from a LiveCD. Don't bother trying to boot the system yet. First, mount the partitions and unzip all the .gz files. This will give you working copies of init and system binaries. Then you can use grub to repair the boot sector. Then boot to single user mode and fsck the filesystem again. If that works, you'll have a running system. You'll also have a bunch of unzipped files (like man pages) that really should be zipped, but it's better than having an unbootable system.
If you can't mount the partitions from a LiveCD, then you are unfortunately out of luck. Nothing will recover your system at that point.
