The problem of covering $n$ points in the Euclidean plane by $k$ unit balls is a special case of your problem that is already known to be NP-complete. It is also hard to approximate the optimal covering radius better than a factor of about 1.84. See

For the case of disks in the plane, there is a recent PTAS:
There is also a fixed parameter tractable algorithm for this problem for spaces with bounded VC dimension - see ref in the paper. 
For general metric spaces, it is easy to reduce the problem to set cover instance, where there is a cover with k sets covering m points, iff there are k balls covering m points. To see that, just take the set system, and build a bipartite graph, with ground elements on one side, and sets on the other side. Connect every set, to every element it covers. All edges have weight 1, and all missing edges, are assigned their shortest path distance. Clearly, in this graph, there is a coverage by k balls (of radius 1) of m points iff there are k sets covering m elements in the original set system. since 1-1/e approximation to partial set cover is the best one can hope for (I am too lazy to find the ref - but that should be well known), it follows that it is not possible in general to do better.
