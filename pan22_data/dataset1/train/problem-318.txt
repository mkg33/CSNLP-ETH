Have you tried unchecking the "Read-only" checkbox in Right click -> Properties? 
If yes then, to solve the problem immediately, maybe try using a third-party application like dBpoweramp. I use it extensively for various tasks. It integrates with Windows and has another tab in the Properties menu for the audio file where you can add/remove meta and also the edit the title. 
dBpoweramp is a paid app but it can be used as a free trial. I recommend you should use the trial to fix this problem and then see why Windows isn't changing the title. 
There has been a similar question asked, but the answer does not work for my situation.  I have a .avi video which has the title of Video_DVD.  This is not the correct title of the video and does not correctly display the file name in inventory search.  I am using Windows 8.1 and have a number of video players, but none of them provide for ignoring or deleting the title.  There are 12 videos in this series, but only 2 of them have the title Video_DVD.  The remainder have no title listed and thus inventory with the file name.  This makes determining in which sequence the videos should be played difficult to impossible
