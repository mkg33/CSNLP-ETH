Being an open resolver isn't a bad thing automatically, though nobody particularly cares so long as your server is rate limited to prevent abuse in a DNS Amplification attack. In any case, if you're restricting this, you use the allow-recursion {} directive in the options clause of the configuration file. Within that block, just add your internal IPs, don't forget the loopback IP for the server running BIND. The default setting is to allow recursion from everyone. 
To restrict what IPs can send updates via nsupdate you can use the allow-update directive. By default the server allows updates from any IP, and each zone allows updates from none. You can change this within the global options clause or within each zone individually. This option can also take ACLs, and Keys to allow/deny updates (it's generally a good idea to allow updates by Key only).
I know that we can add any kind of DNS records in BIND DNS server using nsupdate. Can we whitelist or blacklist any ip in realtime using nsupdate. We whitelist only certain IPs to prevent our DNS server from being used as open resolver.
