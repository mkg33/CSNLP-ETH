Take a look at this cool project : CEPH Project. It enables a fully distributed storage pool with good performances as well.
If you want anyway to keep with old-style solutions, DRBD is a block-to-block synchronization between servers, RAID1-style. But it is resource-consumptive.
This is called a failover cluster. There are multiple ways to achieve this. Some work on filesystem level, like GlusterFS or ZFS replication. Some work on hardware level, like driving HDD trays with multiple head units. Usually you want to do both to achieve both geographic and hardware redundancy. 
A head unit is basically the file server, the HDD trays are just dumb units full of HDDs, connected to the head. The head unit does all of the work. Usually you can pair these head units together, so that if one fails, the other takes over transparently. Even some entry level NAS support failover.
Aside from that you probably do want to sync with a different geographic location. This is usually done on the FS level, but could be problematic based on usage an network connectivity.
