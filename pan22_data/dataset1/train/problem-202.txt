i looked into different solutions and i can already tell you that application manifests or appcompat flags won't work (yes thats no real answer but i still wanted to share this ;))
what might be close to what you are looking for is the so called integrity level,
it can be set within the filesystem (ACL) and has an effect on the token the process is holding
this article explains how you make an exe always run at "low integrity level"
another aproach would be a third party tool, like a real-time process monitor a virus scanner or application firewall would use, but i don't know of any that can be configured that way.
One thing that is being missed here is that Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer CANNOT have their permissions elevated (unless you do a registry hack).  I don't know about Firefox, Chrome, etc. but if you try to run Internet Explorer as admin, it will happily accept your credentials but will not actually elevate permissions.  This is a security feature of Windows Vista and up.  And besides that, the only way UAC is not in effect (unless you turned it off) is if you are logged in to the built-in administrator account.  Just because something was installed with elevated permissions it doesn't mean the installer can give that program elevated permissions.  Permissions are determined by the account the program was run under.  The only way a program can be run with elevated permissions without you knowing it is if, for example a program starts with Windows from a registry setting, etc.  If that happens it can be fixed by editing the registry.
