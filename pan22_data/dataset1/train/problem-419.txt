I am running VirtualBox with Win7 guest VM on a Mac OSX 10.9.x host.  I can access the Internet from a browser on the guest vm (used same proxy as host's in browser's proxy settings).  I can also ping the host's IP address from the command line on the guest.
I have a web server running from the host, but no matter what address type I use in the guest's browser URL, I always get a Gateway Timeout (504 error). I've tried the following:
I've tried the following instructions at this link but still continue to get the same gateway timeout error.
Of course, it depends on how you set-up the website on the host but you can try the following. In the Windows VM settings enable 1 network adapter and set it to NAT. Try to connect to the host by using this IP: http://10.0.2.2 
If you have set-up virtual hosts on your Host machine then in the VM edit C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts and add a line similar to this: 
Note: because Windows doesn't allow you to make edits to the hosts file by default you might need to make a copy of the hosts file to the VM desktop first. Make your edits there and copy the hosts file back overwriting the original file.
