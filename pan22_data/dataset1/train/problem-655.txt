This considerations Philipp brought up, while absolutely correct, already assume what kind of game you are talking about. As alluded to in the comment about Last of Us, different games are going for a very different feel, and ammo limits play into that. If the player feels very constrained by ammo limits, the game will feel more tense and claustrophobic. On the other hand, looser ammo limits make the player feel powerful and encourage more frantic gameplay.
The higher the damage output per second of a weapon, the more should you limit its ammo. Otherwise you give the player a too powerful tool to solve situations too quickly.
Let's say you have a huge boss monster. You invested plenty of time and resources into giving it lots of cool animations. To make sure that the player sees everything, you want the fight to take at least 60 seconds.
When you give the player enough maximum ammo to use the BFG for a full 10 seconds, the fight will only last 10 seconds which would be too fast.
So you give the player enogh ammo to use the BFG for 4 seconds, which brings the boss down to 600 hit ponts. The player now needs an additional 60 seconds to kill it with their pistol, unless you allow them to scavenge for more BFG ammo during the fight.
