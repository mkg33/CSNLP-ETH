I have several web sites where I have to log in using different client certificates. In Edge (and Internet Explorer) on Windows 10 I'm presented with this dialog:
most often, the certificate shown is not the one I need to use, so I can click on More choices, now it shows all available certificates:
and I can pick the correct one, but I would like to avoid the extra click.
I changed the Friendly Name of the certificates but it doesn't make a difference in the display order.
Does anybody know how to change the order in which the certificates are displayed in the dialog?
@_SuoiruC__ The certificates are presented in Expiration date order.  Run certmgr.msc; in the Personal certificates repository, right click on one you want to bring up to top and select the All tasks -> Advanced Operations and select the "Renew This Certificate with the Same Key" function and the "renewed" certificate will come to the top.
I did find on my next usage of the certificate that I had to provide my authentication information again for the site I went to, so don't do this if you don't remember the authentication information!
The ideal solution, of course, is to have Windows present the list of certificates like it did previously; or, at least, give us a setting to skip the "more choices" click and list all possible.
