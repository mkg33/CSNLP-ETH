An address that has been allocated by IANA or a RIR to a network for use on the public internet.
Most mobile networks don't give out public IPv4 addresses to their users. Instead they run NAT at the ISP level.
IP geolocation is not an exact science. It usually gets the country right but anything beyond that is highly dubious.
This is a public address but it's an IPv6 one, many sites still haven't caught up with ipv6.
This is a link-local address, packets to/from this address are non-routable. The normal convention with IPv4 is only to use link local addresses when there is no other address assigned to an interface. I'm not sure why your phone has picked this up, maybe a secondary network interface (wifi?) or something.
This is a private IP address, it is routable within your provider's network but not on the Internet in general. There will be a network address translator at your provider which will share a pool of public IP addresses between customers.
Android's location services do not rely on IP geolocation. They use a combination of data sources including GPS (if enabled), cell tower IDs and wifi access points in the vicinity. 
An IP address is considered public if it can be used on the Internet. Public IP addresses have different IP number ranges than private IP addresses. Public IP addresses are used by Internet servers including those for Web sites and DNS servers, broadband routers and other network gateways, or any computer connected directly to the Internet. Each public address belongs to a range or block of addresses. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) controls ownership of these IP ranges and assigns each block to organizations such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who in turn allocate individual IP addresses to customers.
