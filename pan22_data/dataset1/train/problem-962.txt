The schema https: is, obviously, interpreted by the browser.
The domain name www.website.com is resolved to an IP address using DNS. Your ISP will see the DNS request for this domain, and the response.
The path /data/abc.html is sent in the HTTP request. If you use HTTPS, it will be encrypted along with the rest of the HTTP request and response.
The query string ?this=that, if present in the URL, is sent in the HTTP request – together with the path. So it's also encrypted.
The fragment #there, if present, is not sent anywhere – it's interpreted by the browser (sometimes by JavaScript on the returned page).
I'm not sure if this is comment or answer worthy, but I'd like to share one addendum.
The answers here show what should happen. The question is can the url be read.The answer to that is yes, though it is relatively unlikely.
An attacker (third-party) can absolutely intercept your https traffic and read all of your requests under specific cases. To learn more, I'd invited you to read MITM as well as SSLStrip. I can go into this more if necessary for understanding.
You should not expect your ISP to be doing this both because it is a waste of their bandwidth but also because they have more to lose if you were to find out and sue. However the more precise answer to your question Can this be done? is yes, though it is unlikely anyone will care enough to see what you're googling or wiki-ing.
