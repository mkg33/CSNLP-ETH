 I would hazard a guess that the Apple keyboard was made in the last 3-4 years... and you provided model number for the logi which we know is also BTLE.
When Bluetooth devices sync up they share "ATTribute profiles". These are basically just "codes" to say what functionality they are compatible with. The device in "pairing mode" announces it's profiles:
In this case perhaps the phone doesn't know stereo sound (it doesnt have A2DP profile) so it just adds the device as a headset. "secure pairing" (using a PIN) is optional here.
Keyboards are a LOT more basic - where they only have a generic profile which is on all the receivers, and HID which (for keyboards) needs a PIN to connect securely EVERY time.
 I suspect this is where it is breaking down, due to the other keyboards being more advanced:
It sounds to me like a bad bluetooth driver which isn't rare in the Windows 8.1 environment. Try the following?
Click on the plus signs (+) next to the following folders.
Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
Right Click on the key in the Left Pane - Export it so you can reverse in case of a mistake. Save as Remove-Filters.reg (any name is ok with .reg as extension).
In the Right Pane look for any of these = UpperFilters - LowerFilters - UpperFilters.bak - LowerFilters.bak
