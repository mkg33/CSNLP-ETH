Your current monitors might be 'wrong' and your previous monitors were calibrated against a different colour temperature.  
I had the very same issue in the past with my first colour calibrated, IPS display, and once I got to used to it everything else seems too blue.
"as someone who stares at a sea of code all day" - as opposed to photos and images. The 'classic' colour temperature is 50K and many photographers and image professionals prefer that. Most computer monitors seem to be at 65K, which is bluer and there's a lot of folks who claim its more fatiguing, or downright claim its bad for you.
You might want to adjust your colour caliberation to a different temperature - on lesser monitors this would be called 'cool' or roughly about 65K if that's an option.  
I'd add though, many folks who make the switch feel this way at first. After a few weeks, you might decide that normal monitors are too blue. My recommendation is to play with colour temperature settings then give the default temperature settings a week or two for you to get used to it 
Different monitors/laptop screens differ in default color temperature and brightness. Without that, the most blueish, brightest display will probably look like "pure white". 
BTW the only "pure white" is a 100% diffuse perfect reflector material and its color will change depending on the light that falls on it. If you want your monitor white to exactly match this you must measure/control the ambient light (color and intensity) at the exact position of your monitor and then calibrate the monitor to that.
