Actually, you can achieve this without using BCC. This can be done with free Send Messages Personally add-in. To use it, you just add all required recipients (or distribution list) to the "To" field and then run the utility: it will create a separate personified message for each of the recipients. Please note that I recommend this add-in because I'm one of its developers.
If you enter the distributionlist in the TO field, people who receive it will see the distribution list as "to" but everyone can simply check the email addresses that are in the list and unvold the list when they open/view the message.
If you really want to hide the names (untracable) you will have to use BCC.
You can create a dummy record in your contacts saying "All users" with your own email address in it. You place this user in the TO field, and in the BCC you put everyone (or the distributionlist) so they're not viewable by the recipients.
BCC is the only way to prevent the people from receiving the emails to find out who else got it that are listed in the BCC.
