I was asked to proofread a dissertation for somebody using only Windows. I use Debian 7 and opened the PDF with okular and commented it heavily.
Everytime I opened the document and then closed it again, the comments were available and it, only at the end, turned out that the comments are not saved to the pdf-File, but rather some obscure and weird external xml lying around somehwere.
My friend for whom I reviewed his work does only have Windows. It's quite confusing reading about this stuff online because it's claimed that okular now supports this, but I couldn't get the installation done
Now, there has to be any way to convert those annotations quickly and without (!) retyping all of them to a format that a Windows-PDF-reader is able to read. I even tried KDE for Windows and exporting it to a document-archive, but on Windows it cannot read the file and crashes. Things like Okular2PDF.jar seem to work... kind of. They put really large comment-icons on the screen, all of which say "The quick brown fox...".
It's really annoying that such a basic feature is implemented in such a terrible and absolutely useless and unintuitive way. Is there any way to EASILY convert the file?
According to the documentation (https://docs.kde.org/stable4/en/kdegraphics/okular/annotations.html):
I have tried it and worked fine, using Okular 0.23.2 for commenting, and Sumatra PDF 3.0 (on Windows 8.1) for viewing.
