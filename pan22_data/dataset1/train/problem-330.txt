Based on the issues encountered, I'd be very suspicious of an IP address conflict. Restarting the networking would send a gratuitous ARP which would take over that IP again, which would clear things up.
I'd install arpwatch on another host in the same broadcast domain (same network) and see if any other machines are responding to ARP requests for the IP of your server. If so, find out which machine (possibly using MAC address tables from your switches to find out which port it's attached to) and set it to another static address or DHCP.
Maybe TCP connection pool gets full? Something is opening more and more connections, maybe trying netstat (try different options, for example -i to see interfaces) would given insight about connection open.
If actual connections (and iptables/routes/whatever:you_are_using configuration) are ok, problem could be for example in network interface configuration.
Is your ifconfig -a output sane? That output would tell if you have some network devices that shouldn’t be present, for example virtual devices, that is causing packets going haywire. 
This routing table you have pasted looks really strange. Does it work when it is like that, and does it change after connection stops working? If yes, something is causing routing table to change, maybe something iptables related.
Finally, CentOS specific thing: do you have NetworkManager in use? It is enabled by default in CentOS for some reason, even in virtual machines that doesn’t have X, making this connection doubling, routing changes and other things possible. I suggest switching it off unless you know you need it (like, have connections that goes on and off).
