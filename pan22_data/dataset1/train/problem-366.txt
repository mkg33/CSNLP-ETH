Can anyone shed light of anycast gateways. Typically Ive seen each pair of leafs within a fabric configured with MCLAG and a different IP used for the gw address across each pair of leafs. However, how does Anycast gateways work?
Ive been unable to find much on Google. Only that it is only achieved when using VXLAN/EVPN. However, I can see that ACI provides the ability to provide Anycast gateways without the use of VXLAN.
In short, my question is, how do Anycast Gateways work, and is it possible to configure them upon a fabric without the use of VXLAN/EVPN?
Anycast is when you terminate IP addresses in multiple locations in a network and make each location fully functional. Advertising these routes then takes care of each client using the shortest path = geographically nearest termination point.
What exact method is used behind the anycast scheme is up to the architect. It may be just a routing shortcut (to make sure you enter the provider's network at your nearest location) or the service may actually exist on multiple locations. Likewise, an anycast address may be destination translated at some point or it may actually be terminated on a server (as a secondary address usually).
