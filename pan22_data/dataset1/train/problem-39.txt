The encoder used as the default for an output format can depend on which configure options were used to compile your ffmpeg. So if your ffmpeg does not have --enable-libx264, then for MP4 the encoder mpeg4 (MPEG-4 Part 2 video) is used instead of libx264 (H.264 video). Most people use ffmpeg builds with support for the most popular libraries included, but it happens on occasion.
If you know what encoders are going to be chosen, or if you check and verify, then you can save a few keystrokes if you want. Refer to Stream mapping in the console output to see what encoders ffmpeg uses. Example:
In this case it is using libx264 for video (-c:v libx264), and the native AAC encoder for audio (-c:a aac).
You can view details on a specific muxer to see what codecs will be used by default:
Not necessarily. It is "safe" in that you will get a file that works. Ffmpeg will pick a preferred codec that works with that container. However using a different file extension MAY choose a different codec. Also the preferred codec could change in the future, or based on how Ffmpeg was compiled.
