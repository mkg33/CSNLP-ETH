The Relay module in your picture is what so called Relay shield specific designed for directly interfacing with micro controller such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino, the board already consists of the protection diode and switching transistor and active/disabled LED indicator. 
You can connect 5v, GND, and GPIO directly to VCC, GND, and IN at the shield. 
To test it out before you applying high voltage source to the Relay, connect an AAA battery (Positive) to the anode of LED, and the cathode of the LED to the NO of the Relay. The COM of the relay connect to the negative of the AAA battery. When you activate the GPIO through program, the COM and NO should formed a closed circuit between the LED and the AAA battery. The green LED on the Relay Shield should also turned on indicating that the GPIO pin is pulled to low.
Above is relay I'm using and everything works as expected using diagram below.
I will add 1n4148 diode on IN line for safety and will connect VCC to power supply before Pi.
I understand such a question can sound silly for electrical engineer, but I'm software engineer venturing in electrical world and need some guidance. Thank you.
