Why not just have them use SSL when communicating with the mail server (both for sending email via SMTP and retrieving email using POP or IMAP)?  It seems like this would probably meet your requirements.  Between the clients and the mail server all communication would be encrypted.  The mail server would forward email on to its destination over unencrypted SMTP connections, but from  your question it sounds like this would be okay.
I have a friend who is located in a part of the world that makes email encryption prudent for them. While I recommended OpenPGP, my friend thinks that it would have too high of a setup requirement for many of the people that would be sending them email. Also, they are unconcerned about the email being encrypted once it is out of the country.
So, what I was wondering is if there is a product or service available (I would prefer a reasonably priced service, but I can host it myself if need be) that would encrypt all their mail at the server using their OpenPGP public key, so everything is encrypted when they download the mail. Also, it would need to allow them to encrypt their outgoing mail, which would them be unencrypted at the email server, and continue on in plain text.
