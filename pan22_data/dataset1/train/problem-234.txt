I have a weird issue that kind of drives me nuts. When I open my Cygwin terminal, the icon in the task bar is broken on my left monitor. When I drag it to the monitor on my right it appears as normal. This is also annoying because if I pin Cygwin Terminal to my taskbar and click on it, the terminals do not stack under the Cygwin icon, but instead stack under the broken icon. 
I've already tried resetting the icon cache by deleting %userprofile%\AppData\Local\IconCache.db, then ending explorer.exe and restarting the process. 
I would simply uninstall and reinstall it but I have configured a lot of things for it, and I don't have enough faith in copying the files from C:\cygwin64 then pasting them back in and have everything magically work again. 
I encountered a similar problem on a newly installed 32-bit Windows-7 Ent machine. I had the Cygwin Terminal pinned to the task bar and got the broken icon whenever a terminal was invoked.  Subsequent terminals stacked under the broken icon.
I right-clicked the pinned icon, right-clicked "Cygwin Terminal", clicked Properties and changed the target from "C:\cygwin\bin\mintty.exe -i /Cygwin-Terminal.ico -" to "C:\cygwin\bin\mintty.exe -"
Now there is no broken icon and all terminals invoked stack under the pinned icon.
