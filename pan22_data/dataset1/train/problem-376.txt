I would like to know about the overall latency of the TCP congestion control for adapting to varying network conditions. Specifically, my questions are:
Sorry if some questions do not make much sense. Networking newbee here, just starting to learn about the details of TCP congestion control. I would appreciate any help or direction which can help me understand the topic better. Thanks!
TCP congestion control is far too elaborate to look into detail here. For a start, check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control.
Reaction to channel parameters can be as fast as RTT but may be slower, depending on several factors.
Generally, you have to select your transport protocol by your requirements. TCP offers good congestion control, flow control, and guarantees in-order delivery. You have to weigh these benefits against your other requirements.
TCP mechanisms preclude real-time, lowest latency transport - if that is your requirement you need to select another transport protocol, e.g. RTP or RTSP. In extreme, you can use fire-and-forget UDP transport and implement your requirements on top of that, in a sublayer beneath the actual application layer.
