Have you tried setting the service's recovery settings so it just restarts the service on a failure?  I can imagine a scenario where that might not work properly, but if Windows detects that the service has failed it can restart it automatically without needing a separate watchdog.  
In Windows 7 you can open the services list as follows:
Once the service list is active, find the line item of interest and open the properties for that service.  
For recovery options, you can then set all 3 of the drop downs for 1st, 2nd and Subsequent failures to "Restart the Service"
The PC at my workplace has chrome remote desktop installed and allow me to work at home remotely. Occasionally the program fails and requires me to manually restart the service to get it works again (Task Manager -> Services -> right click on service -> restart).
Apparently a lot of Autohotkey guidance on the internet is for restarting an exe program instead of a service. 
I would like to know if there is a way to make it into a script and allow Autohotkey to automatically kill the service and restart it 8am everyday?
