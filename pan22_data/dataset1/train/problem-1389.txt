I have the need to run a local DNS server for a local (non-routable) domain on my laptop, for development purposes. Simply editing /etc/hosts is not sufficient for my case, because I need certain VMs, which depend on actual DNS, to resolve the local domain.
Configuring bind to serve the local domain is easy. Configuring bind with forwarding addresses is also easy.
The problem lies in that once bind is configured, and resolvconf set to use 127.0.0.1 for name resolution, connections to wireless networks that depend on a web-based authentication breaks, since the local wireless network's DNS servers are no longer used.
Is there some way to dynamically set Bind's forwarding addresses when the network is brought up (perhaps via resolvconf, or some other similar service)?
Alternately, is there some way to use my local bind server only for my local domain name, and use those provided by DHCP for all other name resolution?
resolvconf program is capable to reconfigure bind to use per current connection DNS forwarders.
Sample resolvconf-update-bind script for bind8 is provided in debian resolvconf package
BUT it is not automatically installed in /etc/resolvconf/update.d/ directory.
