169.254.0.0/16 is used for IPv4 address autoconfiguration, and is specified as such by RFC 3927. See also the Wikipedia article on link-local IPv4 addresses.
Microsoft calls it "Automatic Private IP Addressing". It may also be called "auto-IP" or by its abbreviation APIPA.
Disabling APIPA will prevent Windows from locally assigning link-local IP addresses to network interfaces.
To disable APIPA, and thus prevent Windows from assigning a 169.254.0.0/16 IPv4 or fe80::/10 IPv6 address to network interfaces where no working IP configuration methods exist, you can refer to Microsoft KB article 244268. In short:
To restore the default, delete the IPAutoconfigurationEnabled value. To explicitly state the current default (that you want APIPA enabled), set the value to 1.
I recently changed my windows IP address to 172.16.115.X and the default gateway address is 172.16.112.1. So I got a warning that the gateway and my address are not in the same subnet, which is fine. I ignored the warning because that is the configuration in my lab.
But how do I not let/allow windows to use the default ip which is 169.X.X.X (something like that). How do I force windows to use the assigned IP?
