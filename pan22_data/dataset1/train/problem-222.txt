I've been running raid arrays of those exact drives, the 160GB intel G2's for almost a year now.  Its a cluster of 12 servers doing about 3500 queries per second right now, but thats with a lot of spare capacity, I've had it down at 6 servers and everything was fine.   If you do the research and the math it basically boils down to "don't use them for five years or longer", which for me I rounded down and plan to replace them in another year.   Considering the insane amount of hardware and developer time they saved I could replace them every quarter and it would still be worth it.
For anything serious you should go enterprise grade SSDs like FusionIO and the gear STEC sells . They have data on when to run maintenance (TRIM etc.) and provide support in case something goes wrong. I have even seen STEC SSDs beeing yanked by HBAs. My guess is that the real problem here is that most vendors expose SSDs not as flash but as a block device and the controller firmwares out there don't really know how to handle disks and their disk firmware interface. Only experience will tell. The usual thing about backups and RAID also applies to SSDs.
But since you are using MyISAM as a storage backend reliability and consistency might not be your primary concern so just buy them and see what happens.
