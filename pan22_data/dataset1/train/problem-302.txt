Jet is the database engine used by some Microsoft products, such as WINS and early versions of Access (I don't know what they use now). Jetpack is a utility to pack a Jet database, which involves removing all the empty space that has accumulated. This is desirable because Jet is an extremely crude flat-file database that doesn't remove deleted entries. They are simply marked as deleted but the disk space is still consumed. When the file is packed it's essentially just read and live entries are written out to a new file, skipping over those marked as deleted. This is how many databases operated 40 or more years ago.
Jetpacke.exe is typically used just to compress a WINS/DHCP Jet database (pack the jet database - jetpack :) ).  It can also be used to defrag the database, before and after compressions, but it won't clear out messy records or misconfigured DNS settings for you.
I would recommend taking a close looks at your DNS tables and setup and ensuring everything is solid and setup properly.  If everything checks out on your end, then I would try to gather as much information as you can on the external setup and add that info to your question here.
