Well, it appears that the problem was a Linode-specific one.  There is, in the configuration file for the VM, and the "kernel" setting for that was set at "Latest 2.6 Legacy (2.6.18.8-linode22".  I had to change that to "Latest 2.6 Paravirt(2.6.38-linode31)", and then ssh (and websites served from this server) all came back.  Whew!
I guess that the kernel that the linode was configured for was only for use in versions of Ubuntu older than 9.10.  Frankly I thought that the os upgrade process would take care of that, but then I don't really understand everything about how the VM configuration file and the VM os interact, so it's not surprising that I was able to get into trouble, I guess.
I think maybe the takeaway lesson is that if you let your server os get that far out of date, there are odd things required for the upgrade path that won't always be in the most current documentation, because my god who is still on a version that old.  Nonetheless I will have to take a deep breath and think a bit before trying to upgrade to the next newer os.
I guess for my next server fault question I will need to ask about server os upgrade strategies...
First make sure ssh is running, you can do this via
If it is not running, start it by using the same command but replacing the status with start.
If that doesn't work check your interface configuration to make sure you are connecting to the right IP.
Since you used dhcp to get an IP this might have changed. 
There is a chance your firewall might be blocking it, you can open port 22 (it should be opened by default) by:
Finally post the contents of /var/log/auth.log and /var/log/syslog while you are trying to connect.
