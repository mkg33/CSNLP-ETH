I have seen some posts regarding this but I am still a little hazy on the topic. 
I have a task to take our VPN solution which is split-tunnel and go full-tunnel with it. I am looking at my config and I see where I would make the tunnel full is under the Policy attributes. Right now it is set to "split-tunnel-policy tunnelspecified"
When I go into conf t (config) then group-policy-(Policy_Name) attributes so (config-group-policy)# and do a ? then navigate to split-tunnel-ploicy and do a ? I get these options:
  excludespecified  Exclude only networks specified by
  tunnelspecified   Tunnel only networks specified by split-tunnel-network-list
Could it really be that simple to change the policy to tunnelall? Or has people run into issues where that doesnt work as intended? 
Also, I did not implement the VPN solution that is in place now. So where it says tunnelspecified how do I see what the specifications are through CLI? 
The configuration also varies with IOS version as well.  There was a great change between versions 8.2 and 8.3.
Yes, you can switch it to tunnelall, but there are more issues to be resolved.
The first issue is that devices like printers on the client's local network will no longer be accessible while the VPN is active.
Using excludespecific would allow local networks to be accessed, if you know what they were.  You might use 192.168.0.0/20 to allow for home networks, but there is no guarantee that a users's network will be included.  It also depends on which IP subnets are in use behind the ASA.
The user of the client computer will still expect to access the Internet and will expect the ASA VPN device to provided NAT (or PAT) service to the Internet.
