On just the broadband bit, forgetting the general internet overheads and home network connection bits, the variability you will see in broadband speeds will be due to the actions of other customers of your broadband supplier.
You may have bought 8MB/s of ADSL connected network bandwidth, which you then find out has a max speed of 6MB/s because of your distance from the telephone exchange. However, at the exchange, perhaps 200 broadband connections are grouped together, over a 32MB/s link to your providers backbone.
If, 4 or 5 other broadband users are downloading large files at the same time, your bandwidth will be reduced. You have no control over this. Its most likely to happen in the evenings, but i can, and does happen at random times. This is called contention. Contention ratios of 50x or 100x are quite common.  50x is better.
With Cable modem access, contention happens on the local loop as well.
However, as a rough guide, have a look at a broadband speed tester, and that will give you as good an answer as any for your data transfer times.
When you say broadband, you are talking about a host of different technologies. Also, there are a lot of different ways a computer is connected to the Internet today. It may be WiMAX, 3G, WiFi, ADSL, Cable, Fibre and what nots. A wired link is usually faster and has less latency than a wireless link. You may actually wish to revisit some of your assumptions made for the estimation. 
If your users are connected via a home WiFI-ADSL router, a lot also depends on the speed of the router. If the router has a slow processor, it will have problems pushing maximum bandwidth and also higher latency as it takes longer to process the queues.
But for the purpose of your estimation, you seem to be trying to factor it in as a fixed overhead cost. This may be set as a variable K, which can be changed depending on the kinds of connection that you assume it to be.
