You have tried to allocate too much memory to InnoDB, leaving only 512MB for Linux kernel, other processes, filesystem cache, etc. That's probably not leaving enough memory for those other systems. You might even be trying to run applications on the same host, putting further pressure on the memory allocation.
You can reduce memory resource competition by allocating a smaller amount to innodb_buffer_pool_size. That's likely to be the largest single use of memory by MySQL. The default for this variable in MySQL 5.1.73 is 128MB, and this is more appropriate for your system with only 1GB of memory.
I recommend you upgrade your server with more memory. Consider the following survey of how much memory is most common for sites using MySQL. The most common answers are 16GB-64GB and 4GB-16GB.

Of course the size of the buffer pool depends on your database too. If your database is very small, there is little need for a large buffer pool. It's just commonly the case for databases to be larger than the available RAM.
I am facing frequent MySQL crash problem. Not sure how to fix the problem. Attaching the mysql error log. Suggest me a solution.
