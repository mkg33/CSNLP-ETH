I suggest if you want to cycle between all application windows including the minimized windows is to enable it through System pref - Mission Control - Application windows - select your preferred keyboard short cut (I am using Control + down arrow).
Also, to do the same with mouse is to assign certain corner through System pref -- Mission Control -- Hot corners - select your desired corner and assign it to application windows.
I find that sometimes when I am trying to cycle through open windows of an application with "command" + "backtick" it will only move through a few of them and then go back to the first. The other windows are not minimized or in different spaces. I find it happens most often with my LaTeX editor/previewing/console windows (I use TeXshop). And its not all the time, but I haven't noticed yet if some behavior as I am working that suddenly causes it. 
Just wondering if anyone else has had this sort of issue. Its not a huge problem, but it can get annoying sometimes when I need to switch back and forth a lot between the file I am writing in and the file I have to be active on to compile. Thanks!
