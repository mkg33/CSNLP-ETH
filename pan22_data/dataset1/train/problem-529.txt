There is no such thing as a minimum PSU requirement for a video card.  The only spec that counts is a certain amount of current (number of amps) that will be drawn from the +12V rail.  The required power supply depends on the total power used by the video card, CPU, chipset, drives, and other components.  And even there, the total rating of the PSU is pretty worthless, you need to check the current provided on each power rail.
Whether you have a 130W Bloomfield processor vs a 65W Deneb or Sandy Bridge is likely going to determine whether you need to upgrade the PSU.
If you went to all the effort of getting a brand-new Graphics card, why waste all the potential with a sub-par power supply?
I recently upgraded my Graphics card to one that required more power, but forgot to check the voltage of my PSU. I instantly started experiencing freeze-ups and BSODs whenever I tried to do anything significant (past web-browsing), which went away when i installed a higher-capacity PSU.
I wouldn't try it, it's not worth it if you can't utilise the card anyway. Go and get a new PSU
