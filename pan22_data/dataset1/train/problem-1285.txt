The most likely solution is that the I2C device does not support the SMBus read byte command.
i2cdetect uses a variety of probing methods and chooses the one most likely according to the device's address. The pigpio example script is much simpler.
My I2C device which is this (exact breakout board) isn't getting detected through PIGPIO Library. The sensor works very well with the example codes which uses SMBUS library. Upon doing a i2cdetect -y 1, my device is beint detected and I receive the following :
Initially, as I converted the SMBUS code to PIPGIO, I just got the i2c write failed errors and such and was very confused as no such errors were addressed anywhere on the net.
Now, I found this code by the library's creator to check if the device is detected through the PIGPIO Library. This is the code :
I used this and it just passes. To confirm my suspicion, I added a "print("Failed")" before the pass which returned this.
So that's the problem. I know my wiring and everything else is okay because I'm getting the intended output from the example code which uses SMBUS in the "Sparfun Hookup Guide" which I've thoroughly followed to set this up as well.
