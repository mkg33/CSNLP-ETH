I've tried using Chrome and it felt as if I'm missing my right arm, without the addons I got used to as well as bookmark and password sync (weave/XMarks).
Unfortunatly my Firefox has stopped working on my machine and I'm forced to use Chrome (IE is not an option). 
If I had a working FireFox I would not leave it at least not until Chrome gets better add-in support.
Chrome isn't so much a browser as it is a proof of concept project. They are pushing a radically different architecture and vastly improved scripting performance that they want all browsers to adopt. Google is convinced this will enable new generations of increasingly larger and more complex applications existing totally in the cloud. And anything that moves more activity to the web puts money in Google's pocket. That the browser will be the basis of the new Chrome OS should tell you where this is all headed.
Chrome itself is a typical Google app. If you enjoy their sparse functional style you will like Chrome. It is blazingly fast and stable. I use the developer's version which is a bit riskier than the beta or stable releases but not by much. However, if you need a lot of extras and add-ons in your browser you will probably be unhappy with Chrome at its present level of development.
