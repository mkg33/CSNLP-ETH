They want to make you aware that you are using a secure connection.
People have been trained for a while to look for "the lock icon" or something similar in desktop web browsers whenever e.g. entering credit card information when buying something, or visiting their bank's web site.
It appears from your question and comment that (aside from the "tutorial type" message you remember from older versions of IE â€” and really everything you did for the first time, e.g. submitting a form, was accompanied by a message like that) you notice this behavior primarily in mobile web browsers.
They have less display space to permanently display icons or EV certificate information that indicate a secure connection and therefore need to use other mechanisms, e.g. dialogs, to make you aware of this.
If the purpose of such a warning is to give the user a sense of security, it seems rather pointless, when you consider that nobody notices the error that doesn't appear.
In other words, if a site is NOT secure, the user may not realize it's not secure because no warning pops up. This warning tells you what you need to know, but not WHEN you need to know it.
