I appreciate the help from everyone, I have been working tirelessly on this and I learned a lot, so I wanted to share the code I wrote for this. I have included a few references commented in the code I used. also if you have any further suggestions I would love to hear them.
Create a dictionary of user identified cause Values to look out for, and create a dictionary of cause Values with a matching CE-Name. 
It will concatenate the Symp that have a matching CE name and identify the concatenated cell by highlighting it as long as the "user identified cause Values" are not present in the Matching CE Cause Dictionary
It will identify the extra (unnecessary Rows) Rows as N/A
It will then sort the data by Identified (Colored) Rows
I didn't quite have time to polish it and there are some shortcuts, but this should do something along the lines of what you are asking.
This code expects your table to be in the top left corner of the sheet that you are running the macro in. It will create two new sheets and dump the data in there.
