This is the reality of any data science project. Google actually measured it and published a paper "Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems" https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf
Result of the paper reflects my experience as well. Vast majority of time is spent in acquiring, cleaning and processing data. 
As another recent starter in Data Science, I can only add that I don't think you're experience is unique, my team of about 10 apparently hasn't done any DS in over a year (one small project that occupied 2 of the team). This is due to the promise of an effective pipeline the team's been working on, but still just isn't quite delivering the data. Apparently retention has been fairly poor in the past and there's continuous promise of a holy-grail MS Azure environment for future DS projects.
2) No you're correct, but it's an uphill battle to get access to the data you want (if it even exists).
3) I'm sure there's companies out there who are better than others. If you can't stand it at your current company, 2 years is a decent length of time, start looking for brighter things (be careful how you phrase your desire to leave your current job, something like "looking to work with a more dynamic team" would sound better than "my old company won't give me data").
