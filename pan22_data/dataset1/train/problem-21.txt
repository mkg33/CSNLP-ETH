There are to steps to converting cursor coordinates to world coordinates:
2) Perform something like a raycast to find to world coordinate.
First you will need to convert mouse coords to a direction. This is a simple illustration of how you could do this:

I also recommend taking a look at this tutorial: https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP&v=DLKN0jExRIM. You should be able to use the math classes with LWJGL 3, so you shouldn't have a problem.
This part is the hardest out of the two, if you don't already have some sort of physics engine up and running that supports raycasting. If you don't have one available, then it shouldn't be that difficult if you know what you are doing. 
Try searching online for tutorials. I really like video tutorials, so I recommend spending some time one YouTube. There are a lot of tutorials over there that are really good.
I'm trying to convert screen coordinate to world coordinate on mouse click event.
For LWJGL 3 there's not GLU utility class is available whereas LWJGL 2 has.
I'm using JOML math classes and wrote following code, but its returning wrong world coordinate, I'm doing something wrong and couldn't figure out.
On program init, I get viewProjMatrix and viewport:
I convert screen coordinate to world coordinate with following code:
