I am using Windows 8.1 and I have about 30 important Windows updates. It seems I can't have any of them get updated without failing and getting a "We couldn't complete the updates.. Undoing changes". Even when I choose to update just a single update, Windows tries to update a whole bunch of them. I am sure if this because of dependencies or what.  Also when I try to hide all of them, at some point they come back and Windows shows them again and the cycle repeats.
I also used a tool from Microsoft which supposedly fixes Windows update issues. It reports it fixed errors but every time I run it, it says it fixed errors. If it fixed the errors then why is it still saying it fixed errors after each run. It doesn't matter how many times I run it or if reboot. I feel it's not a reliable tool.
What's the process to troubleshoot the failed updates? I feel the updates are just piling up over time and I am stuck. I want either the updates to be hidden for good (unless I specifically show them again) or get installed correctly.
You get the error 0X8004402f which means "Error creating temporary file". I found this Blog post which says this can happen when TEMP folder is not configured correctly. So set the TEMP folder back to a local folder on C: instead of using a RAM disk.
