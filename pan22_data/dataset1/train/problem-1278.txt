I'd like to know if the problem is "can't find the host" (name resolution) or "can't reach the host" (routing / firewalling).  Have you monitored either the client or server from a network perspective?  MS SysInternals' Process Monitor is useful in situations like this.  If you do use it, remove one of the default filters that hides anything involving "System".  Without doing this, you won't see SMB/CIFS traffic.  You can also turn off registry and file system monitoring.  Plus tell it to drop filtered events (under the filter menu) - without this, the swap file get swamped with event data.
I have been scratching my head on this one for weeks, I have now decided to ask the question.
We have an SBS domain with 2 hypervisors, one runs 3 File Server, one run the SBS server itself. We also have a Cisco ASA 5510 firewall.
Remote users connect into the network using the VPN client, this works great for e-mail and SOME servers. For example we have a handful of different hardware server with static addresses clients can access through the VPN no problem. But when a remote user tries to access one of these 3 FS's it cannot find the host. When I try pinging the VM's it times out, although I can ping another VM that lives on the same hardware. I have compared all NIC/Virtual Switch settings nothing wrong!
So I have then decided it may be a firewall/policy issue, so for testing I have disabled all of the Windows firewalls on the servers, I have also done a RSoP to see what GPO's are applied to the machine, and nothing out of the ordinary.
So @ this point I am stuck, so I have tried to debug ICMP packets incoming to the Cisco firewall, the pings from the remote subnet hit the firewall but dont get through it.
Any ideas, I am maybe just not seeing the wood for the trees.....Could it be I need to configured some static routes (but other servers work without this)......do I need to configure RRAS for stable routing between two subnets?
