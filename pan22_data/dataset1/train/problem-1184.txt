I'm trying to reverse engineer an appliance based on RPI2, and I would like to get a root shell on the system.
After dumping the SD I noticed that there's no rootfs partition (it exists but it's empty), and a all the needed files are stored ramdisk inside the boot image.
My idea was to unpack, patch and repack the ramdisk, but it appears to be more difficult than expected: the cpio/gz archives, once repacked (even w/o modifications), have not the same size of the original ones and putting the pieces together results in an unbootable image.
I tried forcing kernel to use an external ramdisk (througth cmdline.txt and config.txt), but it ignores it and keeps using the embedded one.
If you are unable to get even an unmodified, but repacked initramfs file to boot, and considering there does not appear to be console output (if I understand your question), you may be dealing with a developer very determined not to let you in:  
Have you contacted the developer, and are you actually authorised to do what you're trying to do?
