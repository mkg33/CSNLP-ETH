Hey i am a bit confused about port forwarding and how is suppose to work. 
In the lab , i set up VPN access to the outside interface and that works find. 
Users contacting the outside interface of ASA with ip 10.177.5.40 are prompted to download cisco any connect etc. This is done when a user types the ip in the browser and automatically gets redirected to a https page. port 443
Now i want users from the outside to have access to my DMZ server services HTTP and FTP. Users by typing the http: //10.177.5.40 or ftp: //10.177.5.40 to get access to dmz services. Is it possible or i have to use another ip like 10.177.5.41 . 
After watching tutorials for some hours now i have to admit i am more confused that before :)
Clients can download the software vpn client only if they access the ip via https port 443, i.e. https://10.177.5.40, unless there is automatic redirection from http to https at the client.
Therefore ports 80 http and ftp on the same ip address are free for you to use, take a look at the section: Single Address for FTP, HTTP, and SMTP (Static NAT-with-Port-Translation) in Cisco ASA Firewall configuration guide.
