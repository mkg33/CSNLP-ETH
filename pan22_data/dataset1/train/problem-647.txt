I am attempting to run a remote control car via the raspberry pi. I setup a L239D chip circuit following this guide. http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/controlling-dc-motors-using-python-with-a-raspberry-pi--cms-20051 I then attempted to run the code, which resulted in a whole lot of nothing. I started checking the numerous pin voltages, etc. and I noticed that the GPIO 3 pin (using physical pin numbering) was high even without running any code. I rebooted the pi and checked the pin again and it was still high. I ran a code that basically set the pin to False and it turned the pin off but as soon as the code was done running it went high again. I have tried GPIO.cleanup() to no avail. My motor voltage is 7 volts, and my pi is just running from a 5v litium battery. I am really hoping that it is just a setting issue and I haven't permanently broken the pi. Any help would be appreciated!!
I had your exact same problem. I fixed it by using 1k resistors to ground as pull-downs because I didn't know about the internal pull-ups/pull-downs (although they are much cleaner, this is a quick and dirty fix that works well). The thing to avoid here is to make sure that the leads don't bump into each other, as then you connect the two GPIOs together.
