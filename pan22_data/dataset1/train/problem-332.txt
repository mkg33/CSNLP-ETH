Expanding on my comment on Dave M's answer, if you're dealing with traffic shaping here it may only be being applied at certain times of day, or when the pipe reaches a certain level of traffic for so long.
Another theory - your speedtest result might be being interfered with by an upstream transparent proxy. This theory assumes that the congestion would have to be beyond wherever this theoretical transparent proxy might be.
A nice and simple way to do it in my opinion that is free...
Now...do a baseline of both Qcheck (throughput tests and response times) and numion's stopwatch loading timer on the website during a normal time.  Do it 2 or 3 times to get accurate measurements for a baseline.
Then...when there is a "slowdown" reported run Qcheck and the timer site again and see what the differences are.
For troubleshooting the root cause, you'll need to start breaking up the segments (server to firewall, server to switch, switch to firewall, firewall to ISP, etc.) and running similar tests or checking for packet loss, etc. on those segments to try and narrow down where the culprit lies.
