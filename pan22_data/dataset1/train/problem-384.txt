I'm a bit confused as well. First you show commands suggesting the problem is copying stuff from your home directory to a USB drive, but then you start talking about your Windows laptop and scp. So what are you actually doing?
Wrt. to poor Linux desktop interactivity when writing heaviliy to a slow device, the recent 2.6.36 kernel contains a patch that is supposed to fix this particular issue.
As you seem to be using Ubuntu 10.04, you could try the new kernel from the kernel PPA and see if that fixes the issue for you.
I got quite lost after the cp/renice/ionice examples you provided. :) Was the USB drive connected to your desktop during those examples (so no network traffic between desktop and laptop was needed), or did you try that desktop + (laptop+usb) combo later? And when you say "rip CDs to Linux desktop", do you store those files on a local hard drive or that USB disk?
In many Linux distributions USB drives will get mounted with sync mount option by default. That means safer writes, but on the other hand with some drives that might mean very slow write performance and all kind of other funny side-effects. Mounting the drive with mount -o remount,async /your/usbdrive/mountpoint will probably speed up the write operations a lot.
Does the Linux desktop stall if you do your WinSCP stanza, but instead of USB drive try to copy to local drive in your laptop?
