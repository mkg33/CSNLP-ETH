What is the default value for the PATHEXT environment variable for different versions of Windows?  Or even better: How can you reliably determine the original default system value for PATHEXT on a system when it may have been modified by installed software, group policy, etc?
I'm interested in Windows 7, 8, and 10 at a minimum.  Unfortunately I don't have any fresh systems to check this on.
For general pedagogy: the environment variable PATHEXT defines what file extensions Windows considers as executable commands.  For example, my system has:
When you type a command into cmd.exe such as explorer Windows will search for files with these extensions (in this order) to determine whether to execute the application/file.  explorer will typically resolve to explorer.exe which is found in the PATH at c:\windows\explorer.exe.
With a little bit of work, you could do some validation using a batch script:
NOTE: The above example is for use in a batch file.  If you want to run directly on a CMD prompt, change %%A to just %A to see the results.
Then, you could compare or count the results.  If it does not match, send an alert, for example.
