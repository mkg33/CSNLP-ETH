Virtualhost configuration seems to be ok. The problem here is that your computer don't know who is blog.com and mysite.com.
You need to make the configuration that you did in hosts server's file, but in your own computer:
This make that the computer will check first in hosts file if it have some record for blog.com or mysite.com resolution, instead of looking it directly in the primary dns configured on it.
I have a local server at home running debian 8. I access this server with its ip address given from the router. Now I wanted to try to work with virtualhosts to make my server a bit better. I created two virtualhosts blog.com and mysite.com. But my problem is that they are both not working. Everytime I enter them in the browser nothing happens. I have already tried several solutions here on stack overflow or with google. Nothing helped.
First: I have set up two further directories besides the default one for the sites and changed the directory of the default.
Second: Then I created in every html folder a index.html file
Third: I created two further .conf files in the /etc/apache2/sites-available directory and changed the default.conf DocumentRoot
