I'm going to attempt to answer the question based on a small (but major) assumption and not commment first because it may get lost in the bickering going on in comments.
It appears as though Foredoomed may be on FreeBSD, and has installed from ports.  The question is lacking this useful information.  On FreeBSD, there is no init.d and ports installed using /usr/local which is a major clue based on what I've seen so far.  
Edit /etc/rc.conf as root and add php_fpm_enable=”YES” to it, then save and close.
When you're ready to run php-fpm again, you start it using the rc.d scripts.  As it's an installed program, it is not in /etc/rc.d, but in /usr/local/etc/rc.d:
Run the following: /usr/local/etc/rc.d/php-fpm start
The problem you have is with the command you called:
The start part of it is not part of it's switches/parameters, so php-fpm gives you the usage information so you can actually look for what you tried to do, to correct your command call.
Are you looking how to configure your webserver to use the PHP-FPM implementation instead of FASTCGI?
