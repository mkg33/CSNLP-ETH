I have created a script in order to backup my files over ssh. The authentication method used is an rsa key without password.
  rsync --dry-run -r -a -v -e "ssh -i /home/toto/.ssh/backup.id_rsa -v -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" --delete $1 toto@$IP:$DEST --log-file=$LOG_FILE > /home/toto/bin/cron_output.log 2>&1
When I try to launch this script, everything is fine, the backup is done, I do not need to add a password.
The problem comes when I try to use this script in cron:

A ssh command tries to use the xxxx.pub file for authentication when it exists. 
For example, if your backup.id_rsa.pub was not created from your private key backup.id_rsa properly for some reason, the publickey authentication would be failed with the following lines:
What will be happened if you rename or delete /home/toto/.ssh/backup.id_rsa.pub?
