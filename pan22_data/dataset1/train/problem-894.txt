The chances of condensation forming on your system are related to the 'dew point' - the relationship between air humidity & temperature.
You can look up the precise curve it forms on Wikipedia, or you can work on the simple rule of thumb that if your pipes are warmer than the ambient temperature & no condensation is forming on your case, then none will be forming on the pipes either.
I recently built my first custom water cooling loop (never done any water cooling before) with copper pipes, and have gathered a bunch of comments from know-it-alls, suggesting various doomsday scenarios for my computer. One of them is that since I chose metal pipes, I'll have issues with condensation forming inside the case. I'm not deep into physics or chemistry, but my hypothesis is:
My system has two radiators, one pulling air into the case, and another pushing air out. This means that the air temperature inside the case is slightly warmer as the majority of inlet air goes through a radiator. 
(* Not a reliable measurement, but within expectation)
What are your thoughts on this? Am I missing something? I do see some condensation inside the reservoir, but it's completely sealed.
