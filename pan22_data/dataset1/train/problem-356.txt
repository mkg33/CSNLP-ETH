When using quotes inside a formula you should double up on them:
I've looked all over stack exchange and have not seen exactly what I'm looking for. I have an extensive list of some items that need constant calibration at different dates and intervals, and what I'm trying to do is make a VBA/Macro so that I can update any one specific item's calibration date with out having to look at each individual entry or using =VLOOKUP(). so far I have nothing solid I can call a program yet, but what I had envisioned was in a cell write the item's ID#, in another cell the new calibration exp date and have a button next to them so that is searches for the ID#, moves one column to the right and replace the text on the cell with the new date. Simple enough to explain but given the fact that I just started learning about VBA four hours ago, it's proving to be a challenge. So far I've toyed with some code to no avail:
range("a1").Formula = "=CELL("address", INDEX(H:J, MATCH(L11,H:H, 0),2))"
ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "=INDEX(R[-5]C[-9], 3, 2, )"
I will provide more information or context if anyone needs it!
