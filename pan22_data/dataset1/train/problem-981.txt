I don't know anything about Mustache, so just a note about the code: $_SERVER['BASE_DIR'] . '/customcontents/'. $username . '.php' is duplicated, it could be extracted out to a local variable:
Reference: Chapter 6. Composing Methods, Introduce Explaining Variable in Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler:
And Clean Code by Robert C. Martin, G19: Use Explanatory Variables.
I'm writing an application that will be managed by my team, it uses Mustache.php as template engine.
I have a PHP file that makes an array of variables and functions that is passed to the Mustache parser to populate the template.
I even provide a system to override partials of my template to edit the aspect of the application for specific users.
Now I'd like to add a way to allow my team to add custom variables to the array passed to Mustache.php without have to hack the core of my application.
I thought about a little function that checks if a .php file with the name of the user exists and if so, include it after I've generated the array and before I pass it to mustache.
I'm not sure if this can be a nice solution or if you guys have some better idea.
