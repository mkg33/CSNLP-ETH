Our company just switched to a new email domain and wants to keep the old domain around for a year as they notify everyone about the change. The old email domain was on Exchange 2007 and the new email domain is on Google Apps. Everyone is 100% on Google Apps, and the Exchange server just forwards on emails.
I would like to replace the Exchange server (it's underpowered and a waste of resources just forwarding emails) with something lightweight, based around Postfix or another email server. It needs to do the following:
Is this possible with Postfix, and does anyone have documentation on how to do it? I know just enough Linux to be dangerous, so I want to be sure before I suggest this.
Postfix can do this easily (we did something like this in postfix about 7 years ago, so I no longer have access to the very simple filter that we wrote).
I would recommend using an autoresponder (see http://www.postfix.org/addon.html for a few examples) to generate the the autoreply so that you can avoid all of the pitfalls in an autoreply generator.
Then, a simple filter (see http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_PROXY_README.html for how one might implement a before-queue filter to change the destination) for the auto-forwarder.
