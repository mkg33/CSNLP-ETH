Since I started using an application behind a reverse proxy (Apache2's mod_jk), I've noticed some pages won't load (They would without the reverse proxy settings).
It was a subtle error which I had to inspect to find it out, thanks to Google Chrome: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET.
Simply, a JavaScript file would partially be loaded (~12KB loaded out of ~50KB).
I thought something was wrong with Apache2, mod_jk, AJP, or Jetty.
But then I engaged into an investigation where I would use different browsers along with different networks.
This error (ERR_CONNECTION_RESET) occurs only when I use networks with static IP.
I decreased security level in one router but in vain.
Are networks with static IP equipped with higher levels of security?
This is a stalemate because the reverse proxy is mainly destined to take advantage of static IP addresses of our selling points for an increased level of security.
Faced similar problem (Chrome: ERR_CONNECTION_RESET) when accessing rstudio server hosted in CENTOS and tried to access http://:8787 from Windows 10 desktop; After successful login into R-StudioServer, browser landed in blank page; Upon verification through (using F12 in chrome browser) its found that

After several trial and error attempts like upgrading R/Chrome browser/ disable cache; I finally found that site was blocked by antivirus program (Trend Micro Maximum security -> in my case); Later I added to trusted sites to proceed further
