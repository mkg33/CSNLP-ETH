If you can narrow down the IP addresses in 192.168.1.x that you want to reach through VPN, you can add host routes on your laptop to point 'into the tunnel'. This works as long the local gateway address is not conflicting with something you inside your VPN - e.g. if your local/Wifi gateway is 192.168.1.1, you won't be able to reach something with the same address inside your VPN.
Your mobile router should have worked, as long as you don't need to access anything else (incl. local DNS server) in the Wifi network. Next time you are using one, run netstat -nr and check what gateway and interface routes for 192.168.1.0 are pointing to.
You have not advised what type of VPN you are using.  If you are not using OpenVPN, the problem could be in network address translation.
You might be better off using a more obscure subnet - like 172.18.0.0/24 (This is in the range 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 which is a less well known block), or even bend the rules a little by using 100.64.0.0/24  (which is reserved for Carrier Grade NAT).
One issue you might be having with using 192.168.2.x  is that your providers might be using 192.168.0.0/16, which includes 192.168.2.x.   Its also possible (but unlikely) that your old device was seeing 192.168 as being RFC1918 space and not using network address translation.
A third possibility is that the hotspot is limiting traffic to web traffic or common ports (maybe in a bid to stop torrenting ?)  If this is the case you would need to run the OpenVPN server on port 443 [and, of-course, only open it up after you have logged into the WIFI if required ].
