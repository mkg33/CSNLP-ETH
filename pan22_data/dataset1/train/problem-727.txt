I am using windows server 2008.  I have a domain with one domain controller (this is a dev environment).  I edited the AD schema and created a custom attribute called TestAttribute2 (the LDAP name is testAttribute2) with a syntax of numerical string, single valued, with no minimum or maximum.  The attribute's OID was 1.3.6.1.4.1.39668.21769.1.1.1.  I also created another test attribute with a Microsoft-issued OID of 1.2.840.113556.1.8000.2554.37861.10620.51629.17372.38569.15288078.14709744.1.2.  The attribute is nonindexed, active, not replicated to the GC, not copied when duplicating, and not indexed for containerized searches.  I then added this attribute to the person class.
Whenever I try to set either of those custom attributes using the attribute editor function of the AD Users and Computers MMC, or ADSI Edit, MMC crashes, and the attribute remains unset.  However, other custom attributes with similar OIDs but with other syntaxes (CI string and Unicode string) can be set with no crash.  What am I doing wrong?
I've seen this before, typically it is a syntax problem. When AD goes to load that attribute. Also there is a way (can't remember exactly how right now) to repair this. 
Do you have two domain controllers? and are they replicating successfully? Dcdiag clean?
