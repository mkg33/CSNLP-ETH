You could use GPO to force the browsers to use a specific web proxy and then install a forward web proxy such as apache on a new server and put the functionality you need into the proxy itself.
Clever users may be able to work out ways to bypass the proxy e.g. by using browsers that dont look at GPO settings but you could always block outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic at your firewall for all servers except your forward web proxy
Unfortunately the "put the functionality you need" step is probably the big unknown and I'm not an expert in configuring Apache as a forward web proxy to know if what you want to do is possible
It will depend on what you mean by "redirect all their web traffic" and how to determine WHO to do this for as I presume you dont want to do it for everyone all the time!
We have a number of tasks users need to complete over the month (time sheets, reports, etc) and I am trying to think of the best way to force users to complete these tasks.
Currently, we send reminder emails. These are easily ignored. Accounts waste tons of time chasing people up. 
I was hoping to find a way via group policy to redirect all their web traffic to a specific page informing them they need to get on top of their tasks. (A bit BOFH, I know...)
Or some other method that the user cannot ignore to force them to complete these tasks (they take 5 mins in total).
