You might be able to use PPTP  if the NAT routers support the appropriate passthrough - there are walkthroughs on that topic for Ubuntu on the net. Or set up IPSEC/L2TP - which has NAT traversal "built in" and needs just UDP to work. Walkthroughs available as well.
Basically, IP connectivity is sufficient. You would need to enable routing and make sure you are not filtering your own traffic.
The "use remote gateway when connected to the VPN" setting is a default in Windows clients and needs to be disabled explicitly, if you don't want it.
If you can drop your second requirement, I'd really recommend OpenVPN - it is easier to debug and maintain and offers more connectivity options that you might need one day.
Consider the following problem, constraints, proposed solution, and questions. Feel free to propose alternatives. Thank you for your help!
I plan to setup a VPN server on Cloud Server to receive incoming VPN requests from both Laptop and Home Server. Since Home Server cannot be directly accessed, I am using Cloud Server as an intermediary connection point which Home Server and Laptop can "dial out" to. This should allow Laptop to encrypt outgoing traffic (ie. prevent WiFi snooping). This should also allow Laptop to access network resources on Home Server since they would be apart of the same network on Cloud Server.
If you have any other suggestions I'd love to hear. Thanks so much for your help.
