The famous answer of "it depends" applies here... Mostly, it'll depend on what user you ran the command as and if you ran the command exactly as you've written it above.
Check the very top of the output - I'm hoping you'll see something like:
Don't worry, you're all good.  It tried to find all files in . and all files in exec and all files in chmod... you get the idea.  It'll just list them (along with a few permission denied errors) and change nothing.
While setting up Magento (the e-commerce software) for local testing and development, I ran the following command:
This was an admittedly unexperienced modification to the instructions here: http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowladge-base/entry/install-privs-before
This was because the files weren't being served correctly when navigating to the site locally.
Luckily I did not run this with sudo, but the output of the command listed many directories and files from /, /sys, /lib, /home and /proc (at which time I CTRL-C'd out of it).
I have tried to check a few permissions in directories like /sys, but I have no idea what they should be or if they changed. I have so far copied the output from the command to a file and can supply it if needed. 
Basicly I just need to know of this command have caused any serious harm and if there is a way to restore the file permissions of those that I didn't want to change?
