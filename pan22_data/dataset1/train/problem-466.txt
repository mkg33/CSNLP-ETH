I use a Sony Reader PRS-5051. O'Reilly is my primary source of technical books, and they provide most of their new books as ebook bundles which include epub. As epub is a mark-up system specifically intended for reflowing to various screens, most of the books look  good on the Sony Reader. It is not great as a reference reader (it lacks a search function for example), but it works well for those technical books that are actually read front to back (such as the great Time Management for Systems Administrators). Since the ebook bundles come with PDFs as well, I do most of my reference of the books on my computer with the PDF files.  The Reader does a pretty impressive job with PDFs, but is limited by generally poor text reflowing and a limited resolution and screen size. 
I can't say I would recommend an ereader type device for technical books yet. Not enough of the publishers make their books available in acceptable formats (acceptable to me is both unencrypted PDF and epub).
If you are in the US I'd go for a Kindle DX. To me it is the best option, unfortunately I'm not located in the US so I can't get one.
