Silly question perhaps ... I'm told that PS2 technology dates back to the early 1990's or thereabouts. By and large, motherboard manufacturers still support PS2 technology/ports instead of providing an additional couple of USB ports for keyboard and mouse. Is there any distinct advantage that a PS2 port has over a serial/USB port?
Not that I have anything against manufacturers continuing to support PS2 (+: My Logitech First mouse dates back nearly a decade and has seen 3 computers already
I have had two occasions where USB died on my computer -- it quit working.  Fortunately, each of these computers had PS/2 ports.  I was able to scrounge up a PS/2 keyboard and mouse and easily fix the USB problem.
If PS/2 had not been available, I would have had to restore a backup in order to get up and running.
All computers should have PS/2 ports for just such emergencies.  Or, someone should make a PCI Express adapter with PS/2 ports (not USB to PS/2, but rather true PS/2), so that you can add it in if needed.  It may never be needed, but you will be glad you have it if USB dies on your computer.
All laptop docking stations I have ever seen have had PS/2 mouse and keyboard ports.
