I would say that any CPU in the past few years, inarticulately everyone on your list - with the possible exception for single core with HT are 64 bit CPU's that are capable of running Windows 7 x64 bit.
That being said, unless you have over 3.5GB's of memory, it isn't really worth using as the benefits are outweighed by other factors.
I would always advise looking at your motherboard manufacturers website and looking for updated drivers or going to the chipset  companies websites for even newer drivers such as Realtek, Via etc.
Almost any modern processor can run Windows 7. Most processors made in the last 4 years have been 64 bit. A notable exception to this would be the Atom processor that powers almost all netbooks; this is 32 bit at the moment. Intel has been making 64 bit processors (I am not referring to Itanium) since 2004 (source here). 
There are no real disadvantages to running a 64 bit OS; apps and games are not slower (a lot of them might even benefit from the fact the OS can address more than 4 GB of RAM) and drivers are usually not an issue for modern hardware. Any hardware that in certified to run in Windows 7 must provide both 32 and 64 bit drivers.
