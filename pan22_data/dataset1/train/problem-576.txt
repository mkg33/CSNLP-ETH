The following piece in vcl_recv will provide what you want by rewriting the URL that the backend will see:
However I donâ€™t understand what are those plugins and why they should be tolerated :)
I want to serve a wordpress NGINX backend everytime the user visits www.domain.tld/blog. I know I can use different backends with Varnish like this:
I know I could use a separate location ^~ /blog {} in NGINX, but this has the following disadvantage: If I use www.domain.tld/blog in the wordpress WP_HOME and WP_SITEURL variables some plugins do not work correctly. So I need to deliver wordpress without the trailing /blog at the end as a stand alone vhost.
The main thing is that the content on blog.domain.tld/some-post should be displayed as www.domain.tld/blog/some-post. But, blog.domain.tld blog should not be accessible publicly as this would mean duplicate content.
So, how could I make blog.domain.tld/some-post "resolve" to www.domain.tld/blog/some-post with Varnish and NGINX and simultaneously making blog.domain.tld not world accessible?
P.S.: It's not necessary for me to use blog.domain.tld - this is just an example, it could also be a 127.0.0.1:8008 vhost, doesn't matter.
