I was recently offered a position at an IT security company, and may possibly get started in June. I have experience in developing secure applications, configuring secure network infrastructures, setting up secure servers, and managing them. I also have experience with Windows Server 2008 R2. However, I don't yet have hardly any information about the company, what software they use, or even what programming languages/OS they use yet. Where is a good place to get started in IT security, in preparation for my new job in June? What should I know about IT security before getting started?
I recommend you contact their current IT department and inquire. Since you will likely be having to work with them soon, it will help to get started. Once you find out, I suggest installing their software privately at home, and getting to know it. Then when you arrive, it will be a breeze to get used to it. 
You may also want to research the exact topic. So let's say your in network protection - begin researching that and preparing to implement it in a business place.
