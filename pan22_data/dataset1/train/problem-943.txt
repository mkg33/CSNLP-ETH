Do you have access to the BIOS documentation?  For example, do you know if it OUGHT to do beep codes if there is power but some other core peripheral (Say RAM, Video, or somesuch) is missing.  
If it does do beep codes and you are not getting even that far and as said you have swapped power supplies and mother boards, something funny is up.
I imagine the key important piece of this device is the disk/disk array.  
Do be careful with the power switch.  There are still two kinds in existance.  Those that need to just short the switch for a moment, and be released, and the more traditional switch, which lets all power run through it.
Obviously be much more careful with the latter kind!  But with the former, a screwdriver is usually sufficient to short the jump over.  
You should be able to hit a "Radio Shack" style store to pick up one of each type of switch.  (If I recall Radio Shack the company in the US went out of business, but the company in Canada was sold, or something silly like that.  I don't know who else is around these days that would carry these kinds of things).
This question was answered/solved already, but I wanted to mention an odd thing that happened to us once: a server wouldn't turn on after a power failure.  
We'd push the power button but nothing would happen.  We had an identical spare available, so we tried the power supply, but that didn't work.  We put the hard drive from the dead box in the spare (and swapped power supplies back) and it was fine.
BUT, the original had a second NIC so we had to move that over as well and when we did, the new box wouldn't turn on.  By this point, we were doing all the tests with the covers off, so we could see that when we pushed the power switch, fan would twitch and the nic power light would come on, but that's it.  So we dug out a spare for the second nic and all was well.
