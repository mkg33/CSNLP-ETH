The good news is that it doesn't seem to be the domain itself that got taken, the admin contact seems still to be your client:
This is very good: You have no chance to forcibly get the domain back after it's been dropped and re-registered.
The site is sending a 301 Moved redirect to the Beijing escort site.
Seeing as the domain name still resolves to a Bluehost server 70.40.208.144, and assuming this is where your client runs his site, it doesn't look like the DNS settings have been hijacked: I would say the FTP or web hosting account has been hacked in some way and altered to send out the 301 redirect - either through a PHP script ("Header: Location...") or (that would be my gut feeling) through a setting in the hosting company's control panel.
The first step should be trying to log on to the FTP account and confirming whether that is the case. 
I have a client that has a site which appears to have been hacked or something. I have the responsibility of trying to fix the issue.
Where would i look to fix the issue, in the htaccess of something
