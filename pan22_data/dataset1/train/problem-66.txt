To my experience, separating "only the OS" is not an easy task with Windows.
As it is complicated enough, I think that EASEUS tries to copy the whole system partition and reconfigure the OS to start from the copy.
I would try to move as many data as possible from C to D, shrink C to max 232 GB and then let EASEUS do its job. Then you can remove the old and create a new C Partition.
Please be prepared that Windows always will call the partition it starts from drive C:, so the drive letters will change.
My laptop has HDD of 1 TB which I have partitioned into two drives Local disk C and D of 478 GB ( 179 GB free) and 353 GB (164 GB free ) respectively . Also about 100 GB is partitioned for Ubuntu (dual boot) . C contains the OS and program files which I use D for data storage. After installing new SSD I have got a New Volume (E:) of 232 GB . I installed EASEUS partition manager which has the option of migrating OS without reinstalling . But when I select E as target disk it shows size is small . I thought it would only migrate the OS which should not take more than 50 GB . Can someone explain me if it was trying to clone the whole HDD in the SDD ? I want to clean install the windows OS on the SSD without losing Ubuntu and any of my files on D drive . Can someone recommend me some video or link which can guide me ? I have found videos but I think my situation is different with dual boot .
