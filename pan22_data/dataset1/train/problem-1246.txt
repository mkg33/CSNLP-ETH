If there is nothing else on the drive one simply thing you could do is to download the boot.img.gz and then write it directly to the drive (not on the filesystem!).  The tool rawrite would permit you to do this.  This method will destroy anything that is already on that drive.
This will boot the mini installer directly into RAM, you then should be able to install the drive.  You will have to have a network device that is function with the default kernel, and if the install process fails you basically have to write the image to the drive again and start from scratch.
I have an old Pentium4 PC that I have rebuilt from spare parts and I am trying to install Debian on it so that I can use it as an homemade server.
Problem is, the motherboard (model P4S800-MX) won't boot from my USB 2.0 16GB drive formatted with FAT32 and prepared with unetbootin (from BIOS i set the boot device to USB ZIP first and then to USB FDD with no result, even after updating the BIOS to the latest version through floppy disk).
After losing a day, I thought if it would be possible to preload the Debian installer onto the hard disk from an another computer that has Windows on it or through an old Ubuntu LiveCD, but the guides I found only contemplate a drive that has already a bootloader on it or through partitioning.
All I want is to have the installer run and setup and download everything else from the internet like how the netinst image already does, is there a simple way to achieve that?
Burning the ISO to a CD-R is not an option, as I don't have an empty CD-R.
