Windows 7 supports both AHCI and IDE mode, but IDE mode will be slower, some features might not be available, and you might run into issues due to the wrong drivers being loaded.
Is there some specific reason you'll have to run Windows XP natively/without a VM?
I'd recommend you try some virtualization software, such as VirtualBox. This allows you to run most operating systems at almost full speed (depending on your actual hardware). Especially Windows guests profit off many features, such as full support for hardware accelerated 2D/3D.
It's not necessarily perfect for gaming, but you shouldn't run into any issues running any kind of other desktop software (and even games with lower hardware requirements).
In general, this provides you with quite a few interesting benefits:
I need to get a Compaq 620 laptop with Windows 7 to dual boot with Windows xp
I tried running the Windows XP setup CD, but soon after I get a BSOD error
This page says that I need to change the hard drive compatibility to IDE from AHCI
Will changing hard drive compatibility affect my current Windows 7 installation in any way?
I need Windows XP to run some software I cannot run otherwise, but I don't want to jeopardize my working Windows 7 installation in any way, so I want to confirm everything before I proceed with this
