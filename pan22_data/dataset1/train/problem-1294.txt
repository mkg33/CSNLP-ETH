Re 1: depends. On technology used, which you say nothing about. I use Adaptec raid controllers, and thy do that, without pulling the raid.
Re 2: depends how much you value your data. I copy all data to another server or two with large slow drives.
Re 3: Except investing oney into a decent raid controller and making sure you have the hardware layout in place for that? For example, what is expansion for you? I run a 24 slow server for that reason (to allow expansion),  rack units. Now i start filling up the last 8... the next server will be a 4 rack unit 72 bay machine allowing me to put in 72 discs. But then, this costs (just th case) around 3000 USD, so "cheap" and "expansion" are very relative terms, you know.
Yes, it is feasible to expand a RAID 5 by either adding more disks or by replacing existing disks with larger disks.  "The maximum number of drives in a RAID 5 redundancy group is theoretically unlimited."  [1].  Ask yourself first, however, whether your filesystem will support this operation.  Adding larger disks needs to be done across the entire RAID before you will be able to recognize the benefit.  
I would characterize a RAID reconstruction as inherently risky.  I do it all the time but I never do it without careful thought and a bit of nervousness.
Look at LVM.  Also, consider using an external JBOD (just a bunch of disks) instead of trying to cram all the drives into a standard chassis.  Disks are relatively cheap.  Go SATA.  You can get 3TB SATA drives for $150.  Buy the best RAID card you can afford.  I've had good luck with LSI and Adaptec.
