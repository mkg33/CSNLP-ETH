It is true that in ThB, you can only archive single email messages and not whole folders via the menu command. 
However, you can easily move whole folders to your ThB Archives by simply drag/dropping the whole folders to the "Archives" folder.
The solution I came up with, in case it benefits anyone else in the same situation, was ( similar to Lee's suggestion, thanks ) to drag the folder(s) in question into a newly created folder within "Local Folders" called "Archived mails" I think this copied over, rather than moved it ( I don't remember for sure but if it copies it you just have to delete the original once you're sure it's all moved).
This still leaves the messages within the profile though; so the solution to that comes from going to Tools>Account Settings>Local Folders and changing the "Local Directory" field there to somewhere outside your profile.
The mails are now accessible within Thunderbird but are not stored in your profile which means that if you're backing up your profile to Google Drive or something like I am it wont take up unnecessary space. Of course you now have to think about backing up the archived mails but that's not a big deal.
