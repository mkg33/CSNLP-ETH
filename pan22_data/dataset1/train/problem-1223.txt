I am having problems while loading/installing a kernel module. The kernel module builds successfully, but whenever I try to make module_install, the kernel seems to fail to load. It leaves the below error message :- 
I have read about this problem and realized that the kernel has now started loading only properly signed modules. I find that the kernel source directory /usr/src/<linux version>/certs in my system does not have the signing_key.pem private key file because of which I see this error.
What should I do ? Can I manually generate a signing_key.pem file and use it further ? What would be some good methods to do so ? Will generating a private key/certificate file using openssl.cnf help me in this regard ? Or should I avoid using signed modules at all and try loading the modules as it is without any verification ?
I am using Ubuntu 17.04 with kernel 4.10.0-20-generic.
In your linux kernel root folder that you're compiling go to the certs folder and run:
Refer to: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Signed_kernel_module_support
Option 2, is disable automated signing of modules in the config make menuconfig or make xconfig
