You can try using logrotate, a daemon which will manage logs (and other files) based on rules you create. Many text files compress very well, logs for instance frequently hit 95%+ compression because they have the same terms over and over. Much safer than deletion since you have not removed the data, only compressed it.
As said before USER data is very tricky to archive/manage (although you may be able to, depending on your file system & settings, use Last Accessed Date to auto-archive some stuff) but I recommend first MOVING the data you are considering getting rid of, then COMPRESSING it and only deleting after a long enough period to know no one was depending on it. You can also consider using cheap storage as a low tier archive target instead of deleting. Move the file there and use a soft symlink to point at the new location.
I manage some unix systems, and users on my system are creating a lot of junk and littering their work areas. I am running into filesystem full every day. There are many terabytes locked up and is just waste. 
There are cleanup processes that are cron'd running every day or so, but some types of files, like backup of a very large ear file, a database dump will not get identified by pattern matching. I am even considering to nuke their accounts, but it may involve collateral damage.
What are some tools/processes/techniques to create work environment I can introduce to help from not continuing wasting disk storage without having to nuke them.
