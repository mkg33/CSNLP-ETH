You could use mod_alias or mod_proxy and setup something like:
while http://mydev.net would still point to the usual docroot
or, if the service running on port 8200 is not apache, but some other service, that again, you want to access on the default port, you can use mod_proxy to reverse proxy the requests from port 80 to 8200
If you want the same domain to point to something different only from your machine (for example, you want to test the development codebase of your website, but on the real domain), the only real choice is to setup the second version of the site on a different IP address, and then use the local hosts file on the client machine, to misdirect the domain name of the second ip address.
The port that a client connects to is determined by the client, not the server - Apache has no ability to change this behavior in a client browser.  Port 80 is always the implied port for http://, and port 443 is always the implied port for https://.
You could 30x redirect the client to :8200, or reverse proxy connections from 80 to 8200.. but those approaches would probably be pointless, depending on what you're trying to accomplish.
