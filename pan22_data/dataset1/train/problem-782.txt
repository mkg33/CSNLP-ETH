The JSON response format is documented in raddb/mods-available/rest.  The link from the mailing list originally linked to an anchor which also displayed the same JSON response format, but those get stale.
I am working on an integration between FreeRADIUS 3.0.15 and an API server in NodeJS, which will handle accounting, authorization and authentication. This is all documented (for instance, this repo is a very valuable starting point) and relatively straightforward. 
However, I also want to use the Dynamic Clients module, and let my API server decide whether a client is allowed or not. I couldn't find any documentation on this, except for this thread on the FreeRADIUS mailing list, which contains a working example on how to let a remote API authorize a client:
This works, although there are a couple of issues:
In this respect, what I miss is the syntax for the REST expansion, I looked around but couldn't find anything (the only documentation page I found says there is no available expansion).
