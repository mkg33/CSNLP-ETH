So, what I am trying to do is that I have my RPi3 and PC connected to the same LAN, and by using SSH, I can connect to the RPi3. And important thing to note is that I can connect only one of the devices (PC or RPi3) with an ethernet, the other device has to be connected via WiFi. The actions I describe below have my pc connected to the LAN via ethernet and the RPi3 with WiFi (although I tried it even the other way around).
I have tried to connect the RPi3 via ethernet (canging the wlan0 in the dhcpcd.conf file) and use the wifi on my pc, but got the same problem. Any tutorial I have seen, video or question on this site, has not the same exact problem. At least from what I have found, they have some problems after connecting. But I can't even connect, at the first place
Is this because i am using WiFi or am I missing something else?
P.S. I will not list all the tutorials I have seen, but here a few of them (of which some of the are with older Rasbian versions, I know):
I don't know programming but I can follow instructions, so maybe this will help you. I run a data upload application on my RPi3B that required the Ethernet connection. I wanted to connect to the 'net on WiFi so I asked the developer how to do this.  Here are the steps he provided which subsequently provided the WiFi connection and also gave me SSH capability over my WiFi.  This may work or it may be useless to you:
Enter your router's name in ssid and your password in psk. (The quotes are required, e.g. ssid="mynetworkname")
