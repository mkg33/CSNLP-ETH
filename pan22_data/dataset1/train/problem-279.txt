Unfortunately, right now, "games that blind people can play" are pretty much just audio games. The problem is that a lot of modern games rely heavily on visuals, for feedback and as an interface. In addition, many games require fast reflexes, and a TTS or screen reader would slow the player down quite a lot.  Additionally, most games use a different output system than the built in operating system one, and screen readers are probably not built to handle that.
For now, designing a game that works well for a blind person and a sighted person would be tricky. There's probably a few games that are like this, but they most likely have very good sound design, as well as audio cues for different menu items.  I can't think of too many that fit this requirement.
Finally, there's likely some companies out there who design games specifically for accessibility, but the quality of those games might vary by a large amount, and the games are almost certainly more expensive than a typical game.
I'm blind and I would know if there is someone that consider important the accessibility, from a blind in particular, when develop a new game.
I don't speak about an audio game, I'm speaking about a video game that implements a TTS or a GUI compatible with screen readers!
