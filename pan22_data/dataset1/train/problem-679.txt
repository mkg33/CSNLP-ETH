You can also look into using vLite to build your own installation DVD. Although it is not offically listing Windows 7 it does support it if you use the above mentioned AIK for Windows 7.
The installers for both Windows 7 and Vista are fairly much the same as far as configuration is concerned.
Windows 7 should be released to MSDN next week so it will be time to rebuild my machines. I use my C drive purely as a system volume, D and E for transient data and my F drive for my user accounts and "permanent" data. It still annoys me that the windows set-up process doesn't make it easy to support this sort of configuration, however I know that if you have a USB key with the appropriate ini file you can configure things.
My problem here is that I've not found a good source on how to set the values of the ini file. I know that there is a utility for creating the files but even this too is poorly documented and not very intuitive. 
I simply want to enter my product key, set my culture and specify the location for the user profiles. The documentation on specifying the location is particularily poor. When I'm doing a clean install there is no concept of C, D, E or F drives so how do I identify which physical device I wish to use.
Any help or links to good resources would be appreciated.
