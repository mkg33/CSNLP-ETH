While I'm not familiar with a lot of the deep spec work surrounding Ruby, Enterbrain created the game making programs RPG Maker VX and RPG Maker XP that use game scripts based off Ruby: http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/
This was actually my first dive into the language. As most people said, you probably won't get the high performance of other languages, but if you're looking to start a 2D RPG (or other 2D game, really), it's probably one of the most sophisticated game editors out there to help. 
Don't expect to write highly-performant, professional, commercial, 3D games with Ruby, but Ruby is a great language to use when learning game development concepts.
Gosu is the most popular (and actively maintained) library for writing 2D games in Ruby. It has an underlying C++ library that it uses to improve performance and interact with the underlying display rendering libraries like OpenGL.
As far as performance goes, the "default" Ruby implementation (MRI) will work fine (I suggest the latest Ruby 2.0 for best performance) but there are alternative implementations that have native threads and alternative garbage collection algorithms such as Rubinius, JRuby, etc. If you're making use of threads, you may want to try Rubinius, otherwise MRI Ruby will work just fine.
