If you're using corporate network or you trust the issuer, you've to import given certificate into your keychain and make it trusted for your SSL connection. To make it work for all web addresses, it needs to be Root certificate authority.
In Chrome you can basically click on padlock icon, then Connection tab, so you can see the Certificate Information which should consist CRT link in your Root (top one) certificate.
Once you downloaded certificate file or by the following command:
open the file and in trusted settings make it Trust.
On OS X you can double-click on the file or drag and drop in your Keychain Access, so it'll appear in login/Certificates. Then double-click on the imported certificated and make it Always Trust for SSL (as shown below).
If you can't get the certificate of the corporate web proxy, add your own local proxy (e.g., Burp Suite proxy) between the browser and corporate proxy, and install the local proxy's certificate in your browser.  Configure your browser to use the local proxy (Options -> Advanced -> Network -> Connection Settings).  The browser then only sees certificates issued by your local proxy, which is trusted, and you see no errors in the browser.
