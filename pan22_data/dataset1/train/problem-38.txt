I'd like to start a long-running Ruby or Python script, and have the script watch a local directory for changes to files and new files. Periodically, the script will trigger a one-way rsync to a remote network location.
This must function on both Linux (Ubuntu 13.10+) and Windows (Windows 7+) environments. Importantly, I'd like to minimize the number of dependencies required, and I'd like to install the same thing on every system by simply dropping some files in a directory -- no installer. 
Is it possible to get the system I'm describing want without an installer? If so, how?
In the past, when I was doing this from windows platform to any other system that supports a sshd or sftp, I used WinSCP which has very well written sync features.  WinSCP can also be executed from the command line to watch a local directory and automatically push and/or pull files to a remote file system via SCP or SFTP protocols.
The WinSCP solution is very robust and highly configurable but its written for windows.
I have gotten WinSCP to install on my linux machine using 32 bit wine and it works reasonably well, although, I have not tried running the sync feature from CLI on linux yet. I am confident I will have the CLI working on linux shortly once I have the time to focus on that.
