I'm currently building a new powerpoint template for our small business. As part of this we want to save people time by having the right colours automatically be selected when they create graphics using SmartArt.
Changing to a different colour is really simple, an example is given here: http://pcunleashed.com/powerpoint/how-to-re-color-your-smartart-graphics-in-powerpoint/
My question is: Is it possible to change which of these colour schemes is used as a default when creating new graphics. My main accent colour is blue, so the standard graphic has filled blue shapes with white text. I would like the standard to be just a blue outline with a white background and black text. This is another of the available options, but not the current default.
This would save our guys a huge amount of time in creating diagrams.
Here is a much easier way to change the default color used with SmartArt graphics. I only tested this with PowerPoint 2010. You need to change the color palette. Not 100% sure this is what you're looking for, but it may help others.
Under the Design tab, select the Colors drop down. Select Create New Theme Colors and change the Accent 1 color to the color you want your default SmartArt color. 
Note, however, that this may impact things like the bullet colors on your slides. This can also be changed by going into the Slide Master, select the top level slide template, select the text window containing the slide bullets, under the Home menu, select the bullet drop down, then Bullets and Numbering and you will find the bullet color settings.
