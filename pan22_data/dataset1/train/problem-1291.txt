Okay, so the first thing is, there is no "sudoers group". (Well, not a default/dedicated one anyway, though it is actually common to configure %wheel or %staff as such a group.)
And if there were, you'd use usermod on OpenBSD (or gpasswd on Linux) – it's just a regular group modified using regular tools, there is nothing very sudo-ish about it.
The second thing is, sudoedit is not for modifying groups, it's for editing /etc/sudoers.
The manual pages tell you not to edit /etc/sudoers directly. But editing /etc/sudoers is exactly how you give sudo access to someone (whether a user or a %group).
The only difference is that sudoedit performs syntax checks on the edited file, so that you don't accidentally lock out all administrators because of a typo, and makes sure two people aren't editing the same sudoers file at the same time.. Regular vi /etc/sudoers wouldn't have such safeguards.
So the instructions remain the same. Run sudoedit – just sudoedit – and add your username or chosen group to the sudoers file.
The file /etc/sudoers describes which user may execute what using sudo.
But sudoedit is not the command to edit the /etc/sudoers. sudoedit is used to edit a file as another user.
If you are using OpenBSD-current, you might consider to use the new doas(1) instead of sudo - it is easier to configure.
