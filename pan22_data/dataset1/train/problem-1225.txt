I upgraded my browser (Firefox) to the latest version 37.0.1. Thereafter, OEM 11g is not accessible. Here are the errors:
The connection to bdporagrid.bdpinternational.com:7799 was interrupted while the page was loading.
The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified.
    Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem.
I did some research and tried many workaround but still unable to get it loaded. I have no problem with Chrome or IE loading the OEM11g webpage.
The URL is:https://xxxxx.yyyy.com:7799/em/console/targets
Not sure if anyone has a workaround or solution. I am sure ver 37.0.1 has changed the https behavior.
I would suggest changing security.tls.version.fallback-limit from =3 to =2. I would not go lower than 2 for this setting, if possible.
security.tls.version.fallback-limit=3 means require at least TLS 1.2
security.tls.version.fallback-limit=2 means require at least TLS 1.1
security.tls.version.fallback-limit=1 means require at least TLS 1.0
security.tls.version.fallback-limit=0 means require at least SSL 3.0
For each increment you reduce this setting, you are effectively allowing less and less secure connections.
Instead of dropping directly from TLS 1.2 to SSL 3.0, I would only set this value as low as you need to establish a connection to your site.
