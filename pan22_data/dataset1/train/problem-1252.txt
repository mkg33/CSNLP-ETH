Set up a separate block for the messages log in /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog (or whatever it's called on your install).  It should use the setting for the  specific log file match preferentially to a general one. 
No, as Zoredache mentioned, multiple HUPs shouldn't break anything unless you're really hammering rsyslog anyway. 
I need to rotate /var/log/messagees on a different schedule than the rest of the syslog logs.
By default syslog logs are rotated weekly based on the /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/syslog configuration files.
If you look at /etc/logrotate.d/syslog you will find that there is one logrotate configuration block for all of the logs.  If I want /var/log/messages to rotate on a different schedule I need to create a separate configuration block for it.  This would result in restarting syslogd twice (based on copying the existing config).
Is there a way to rotate /var/log/messages on a different schedule than the other syslog logs without having to send HUP to syslogd twice?  Or does this even matter?  What is the best practice here?
