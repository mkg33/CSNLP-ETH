I'm needing to be able to pull data from 6 individual Excel Workbooks that are all formatted the same, first line being the same header across all six and then the data starting row 2 going down being formatted the same across all 6.
We are basically using this for small mailings at work and as such employees paste addresses with names in a "post" Excel workbook, always on the first sheet always starting with the 2nd row.
I have a master "post" workbook, and at the moment I manually have to go into everyone else's and cut their labels and put them in the master one and then print.
How would I automate the cutting of post labels (basically data written left to right across a couple of columns) and pasting it into the master Excel sheet? (the data needs to be deleted from the 6 workbooks).
I have tried all help info I could find and searched a lot, but I just can't work this out.
I don't want the headers posted into the master file, the master file already has the same headers for sorting.
Thanks. (Office 2007 or 2013 instructions will be fine.)
Depends on how strict the rules/how competent your colleagues are the solutions vary from:
