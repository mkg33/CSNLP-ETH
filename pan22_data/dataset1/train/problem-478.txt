Since the problem has effect on other USB devices and occurs on all other ports, it looks like your Windows PC has developed a problem with USB VBUS power supply net, either a protection polyfuse has partially died, or some other circuit. 
What you need to test this hypothesis is to apply a 5 Ohm resistor load to any USB ports and measure the resulting voltage. If it goes below 5.0 or 4.9 V, then the common USB power went bad. If you have not enough skills to follow the power drop and determine which board element is at fault, your mainboard needs a replacement.
Long story short I am using an Xbox one controller on my windows 7, and it generally works very well, but today it says "Power Surge on Hub Port", and sometimes it makes my keyboard and mouse freeze up/ stop working. The computer makes the 'Device found' noise, and then constantly plays the Device Ejected noise.
I used 3 different USB cables, 5 different ports (3 USB 2.0, 2 USB 3.0), one of the 2.0 ports are behind the PC.
I have restarted my PC many times as well.How do I fix this?
