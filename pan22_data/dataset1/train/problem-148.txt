If there was an incomplete formatting of the drive, you may need to reformat using Windows disk management.
Start Button > Control Panel > System & Security > Administrative Tools > Computer Management > Storage > Disk Management
Identify your USB drive in the list of drives (if it does not display, be sure it fully plugged in, turned on,  etc.)
Click "Yes" (will wipe drive), then select file type (NTFS or FAT32), and click OK
No dialog will display, instead the status of the drive in the list will be "Formatting", once done it will change to "Healthy" or similar.
Now assign it a drive letter: right click, "Assign Drive Letter", choose preferred letter (not is use) and click ok.
I ran into this same exact problem.  The answers above were of no help, because they were not possible to perform.
What finally worked for me was the classic IT advice: Turn it off and back on.
Specifically, rebooting the computer with the USB drive plugged in (I'd previously been plugging it in after rebooting).  This worked on two separate USB drives that were encountering the same problem (one of them was already in this state upon arrival, the other got this way after a formatting operation was interrupted).  The computer I was using was running Windows 7 Enterprise 64-bit.  Hope this helps someone.
