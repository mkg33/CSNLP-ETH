If you take a look at the permissions on the application, you'll see that there is either an Access Control List issue, or that your user doesn't have permission to manipulate the file.
I have seen this behavior mostly with new versions of FireFox, where the updater isn't running...  
The resolution for this is just as Mark mentioned, trash the original, and then copy it to the target (applications) directory.
I don't have anything that this is occurring with right now, so I can't point to the permissions/acl issue, but that's what I tracked it down to in the past.  It happens with both Leopard & Snow Leopard.... But very rarely....
I use OS X with a non-admin account, thus when ever I install and upgrade apps i'm asked for the admin username and password. Just now i'm trying to upgrade Thunderbird to version 3.0. Following these steps:
I've had this error for a long time now, but before this Finder has always managed to overwrite the old app on the second time. This is not the end of the world as i can delete the old version and install the new one, but this has been one little annoyance for me for a long time (since 10.5.x), since something clearly is not working.
