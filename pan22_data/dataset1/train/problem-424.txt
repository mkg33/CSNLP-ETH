You can use ProcessExplorer to see what (if any) process has a handle on the file:
I have a program (an old version of Delphi) that needs to create a temporary file whenever it is opened. Problem is, it can create that file, but it cannot overwrite it, so whenever I try to open it I have to move the file somewhere else first.
The file is created in the temp folder (userfolder\AppData\Local\Temp). I can move it anywhere, I can rename it, but I can't delete it.
So I have created a separate folder where I can move the temp file. I get one copy everytime I want to open the program, so I have been renaming these copies. But there are just too many of them now and I'd like to get rid of them.
When I try to delete one, I get a message that goes:
The funny thing is that even if I reboot the system, when I go to the separate folder I've created to contain those files and try to delete one, I still get that message.
What else can I try? How can I keep the System process from opening these files so that I can get rid of them?
