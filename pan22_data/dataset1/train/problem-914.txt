The most likely cause would indeed be if they were somehow deleted in Thunderbird then they would also be deleted on the server. 
Do you have something like ccleaner or mailwasher installed?
You are using version 52? And what operating system?
Yesterday I set up Thunderbird: created a new IMAP profile, got messages from the server (no big deal, about 400 messages), archived some of them and moved to Junk some of them, leaving only 3 in Inbox.
Today, I open Thunderbird, press Get Messages, then a dialog asks me if I want to have folders compacted, I press Yes, then I press Get Messages again. I get no new messages, but all seems fine. A few seconds later, as I was actually reading one of the 3 messages in Inbox, most of messages are gone: all 3 in Inbox, all in Junk and most in Archives. In archives, remain a few, and, curiously, these seem to be the first messages I archived.
I checked the server (webmail), the situation is the same there. Synchronization is on.
I am afraid, as it seems, Thunderbird mistakenly deleted my mail.
I am clueless. What could have happened? What can I do to try to recover my messages that are gone? How can I do prevent this problem from happening again?
