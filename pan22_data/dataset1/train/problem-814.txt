The location only matches the URI path component. It does not match query strings.
You can check the value of the argument instead, for instance:
I am trying to achieve a redirection in nginx that should happen only if a specific argument and value pair is existing.
For example : https://www.mywebsite.com/search?abc=453?hjh=7484?foo=bar?joe=blah
should be proxied to an application only if hjh=7484 is present in the request_uri. This can be anywhere in the whole URL, that said its position is not fixed.
If the incoming request against search page doesn't have hjh=7484 the request should be redirected to https://www.mynewwebsite.com/
2019/01/21 15:48:47 [error] 113#113: *109 open() "/usr/share/nginx/html/search" failed (2: No such file or directory),
If I change the above regex and allow any requests to search page to be passed its working!
I am able to get this working by using the method posted here Can nginx location blocks match a URL query string?
Now the problem is any request with that argument, not only to search page will be processed. What would be the best way to make this restricted only to /search location ?
