Vim provides two user-defined insert completion mechanisms: User defined completion and Omni completion. You can read about them here:
I've never used these myself, but since you asked for where to start looking, that's it. You may also want to read this section,
for an explanation of Vim's various built-in insert-mode completion mechanisms, which may help you avoid writing your own. I didn't see a predefined mechanism for selecting from clipboard entries, however. You can insert from previous deletions with a little work by using :registers to view the available registers and then inserting the contents of the desired register with Ctrl-R followed by the register name.

Found out today that if you press Ctrl-Opt-Cmd-V in Textmate, it produces a cute little "chooser" dialogue in-place that allows you to page through your recent clipboard entries. It looks very similar to how CTRL-P and -N work in VIM, except it shows whole lines instead of simple word objects.
It seems like this would be doable in VIM â€” it already has a buffer full of entries (the YankRing buffer, for example), and it already has a chooser, but I can't think of where I'd look to start putting these two together. Any ideas?
(I know that YankRing already does this by opening a new window full of buffer content, but I wonder if there's a way to do it without all the window switching/closing/etc)
