I think that almost any way you could make the files unmovable would also make them not editable.
The only way I can think of to protect the files like you want is to have the files on a separate volume. When a file is moved off of a separate volume onto the root volume, like from an external drive or a server share to the Desktop, the default behavior is to copy the file. 
What if you hosted the files on a server instead of having everyone duplicate the files with Dropbox? You could still back the files up with Dropbox and there might be less chance of conflict. OS X Server is cheap.
The only way I know of, which isn't a bad way, is to make a disk image on your computer. It will act like it is an external disk. The only downsides is you have to set a size of the image, so the disk image will take up that much space on your real drive. Also you must mount the image any time you want to use it. 
Making a disk image is relatively simple. Open Disk Utility and on the top click "New Image". Name the image, name the disk, pick a size. Format as Mac OS Extended (journaled) with encryption to none. Partition as hard disk, at leave as read/write. Change the settings if you like.
Open the .dng and it will appear like a flash drive on your desktop. When you drag files to it, it will copy rather than move by default.
