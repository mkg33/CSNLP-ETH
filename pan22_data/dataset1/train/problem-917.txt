Yes, you can backup the data you have on those NTFS partitions, wipe them and then add the leftover space to the Windows system partition. This would give you a single bootable partition dedicated to Windows and your Windows data. Consider not adding all of the leftover space in case you want to give Linux some love.
Then install Linux and do whatever you want with the leftover free space/ext4 partitions. Linux will install Grub and you'll be good to go.
You can do this all on one disk by shuffling files utilizing the unallocated space.  Essentially, begin by clearing the first partition(s) for a clean windows install to a new partition you create in the unallocated space.  As a note, it is highly recommended you install windows before Linux if you have both on the same drive.  Feel free to do a search for reasons why.
Then, start extending the windows partition as needed and shuffle all of your windows files into the extended space.  Once you are done shuffling the files forward and setting up the windows partitions,  then you clear a space for your Linux install and do it all over again for your Linux files.
Granted, my answer assumes you can search and find a way to mess with partitions.  There are many free programs to use if you search for them.  But logistically, that is the way I would shuffle things around.  Backing up any data you can is definitely recommended.
And get a live Linux CD made up (I use knoppix) before you do any of it so if you mess things up boot wise, you have a OS and a GUI to fix things and search the internet for reference and download programs and utilities to help you along the way.  Good luck.
