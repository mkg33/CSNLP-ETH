I have 2 dc windows 2003: one is the master and it is called dc, the other is called fs and it is not synchronized with the master.
On the fs server I stopped the service netlogon because I have had problems with the user's logon. The ad db is too old.
On fs there are some events with the following ID: 13508 (replica file), 4000 (dns), [2089 (ntds replication, not enough reputation to post the link)
This directory partition has not been backed up since at least the following number of days.
It is recommended that you take a backup as often as possible to recover from accidental loss of data. However if you haven`t taken a backup since at least the "backup latency interval" number of days this message will be logged every day until a backup is taken. You can take a backup of any replica that holds this partition.
By default the "Backup latency interval" is set to half the "Tombstone Lifetime Interval". If you want to change the default "Backup latency interval" you could do so by adding the following registry key.
System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters\Backup Latency Threshold (days).
Are there some cmd to force a resync from dc to fs ?
and what's the problem ? why the replica is stopped ?
You can force AD replication between domain controllers applying following procedure from TechNet Force Replication Between Domain Controllers
Nevertheless I would like to ask you what do you mean when you say "... called fs and it is not synchronized with the master" If you have an Active Directory with 2 domain controllers both of them must be always synced, and if that's not the case you have a problem.
I encourge you to review this article in order to perform some troubleshooting and keep your DC's always as healthy as you can: Diagnosing and Troubleshooting Active Directory Problems
