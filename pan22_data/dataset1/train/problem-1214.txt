I had this guide for adding elements to be context menu by editing the registry, it was written for vista but I believe the same keys exist in windows 7 and 8.
It only references a direct exe though so this may not be what you are looking for.
As to a built in solution?  No. Windows 8 defender does not have any context menu options for specific scanning.
Remember though, you can still install any other virus scanner as well, and Windows Defender will take a backseat automatically.
Add Scan with Windows Defender in Window 8 Context Menu
Step 1: Open Windows 8 Run box, type in Regedit32.exe and press enter.  You will require administrative privileges to perform the action.
Step 2: In Windows Registry Editor navigate to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\folder\shell and create a new sub key in the left hand pane. Name the key WindowsDefender to create a new folder.
Step 3: Select WindowsDefender on the left sidebar and right-click anywhere on the right-hand side to create a new String. Type in %ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\EppManifest.dll in data field and name it Icon.
Step 4: Having done that, add another String, provide the data as Scan with Windows Defender and name it MUI.
Step 5: Now create a new sub key under WindowsDefender and modify the data of the default DWORD to “C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe” -scan -scantype 3 -SignatureUpdate -file %1.
Try out the newly added context menu option on a folder.Good Luck!!
