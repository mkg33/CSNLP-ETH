Virtually all storage devices are divided into sectors.  
A few manufacturers have custom storage for specialty storage needs, but most do not.  Most of these devices only have a few KB or a couple MB of storage meant for internal usage.
Even then the amount of work it takes to "make your own filesystem" is high enough that most just use someone else's file system.  If they want to block the user from messing with it they encrypt it.
The "sector" is simply a way to divide up an amount of storage so the people writing file systems and other infrastructure have a common base to work with.  Also the entirety of storage can't be loaded into ram all at once so it has to be sub-divided.
If sectors were allowed to be any size the people writing file systems would have to handle all possible values making there job that much harder.  The harder it is the more room for human error and the greater the chance something goes horribly wrong and you lose your data.
Also optimizing for performance would also be much harder as people who choose exceptionally low number like 2 bytes would always have terrible performance.
I have read that a hard disk is divided into regions called sectors (a sector can be for example 512 bytes in size).
And that a file system will arrange groups of sectors into blocks (a block can consist for example of 8 sectors) and when Linux writes a file to the hard disk, it actually writes to these blocks and not to the sectors.
Now my question is, are all storage devices (for example: USB drive, CD, DVD, etc.) divided into sectors, or is it just hard disks?
