I have just run it for you: https://zonemaster.net/test/f9b464c2a567d89b and results are not good!
In short, your nameservers (ns0.dcdns.net and others) do not reply as being authoritative on your domain name. You will first need to contact the individual or company behind ns0.dcdns.net and ask them to configure their nameservers properly for your domain name. Or change the nameservers you are using for your domain.
Until that is done, do not expect to have anything working correctly in your domain name.
More precisely: ns0and ns3seem not to reply correctly at all for your domain, ns1 and ns2do. Are you sure you need to use all four of them?
Also: ns0 ns1 and ns2 are resolving to the same IP, this is silly. And makes the above results strange. In fact when doing multiple times the same query, a given nameserver does not reply the same way (sometimes NXDOMAIN with useless upward referal, sometimes correct NS records). This is seriously broken!
(I suspect there are behind some kind of load balancer and we hit different servers, or their anycast had gone wrong...)
PS: use dig instead of nslookup, it is a better tool.
My network admins have created a DNS record for thedigitalteacher.com which should include an A record for the domain root pointing to 5.10.124.142, which is indeed the response I get if I use our internal name servers.
However, Google's name servers on 8.8.8.8 frequently (but not always) fail to resolve the name, leading to this kind of nonsense:
How can I figure out what's wrong with this domain?
