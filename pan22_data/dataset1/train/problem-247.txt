All SSL certificate do two things, authenticate that the holder of the certificate is who they claim to be, and encrypt the communications between client and server.
When you pay more the levels of authentication (i.e. the checks that the certificate authority makes when you go to them to purchase a cert for your website) increase as do the levels of warranty if the CA screws up.
The level of encryption will be no different with a $10 cert (or even a free self-signed one) and a $2000 cert.
MakerofThings is right, those are the primary differences (I work for VeriSign's EV SSL department). In addition to malware scanning, the VeriSign SSL package is also associated with other trust products, such as the VeriSign checkmark and what's called seal-in-search (where the VeriSign checkmark appears next to your products in shopping search engines like The Find). Verisign, Thawte, Geotrust and Rapidssl all have their specific value and market, but with VeriSign it's more of a "suite" of trust that you're acquiring.
