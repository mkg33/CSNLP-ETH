You said your problems started shortly after you upgraded to Windows 8.
Consider reinstalling OS or installing another copy of Win7 or Win8 to see if you have something wrong with OS itself.
Additionally, consider disconnecting any unnecessary hardware devices to eliminate possibility that they somehow conflict.
Every 3 to 15 days, my PC freezes. This typically happens when the computer is idle, I'm coming home from work, back from vacation, etc. It's never happened while using my computer.
And here is the story of how the problem developed and what I've done to diagnose:
My next plan of attack is setting "Turn off display" to Never and using a screen saver to see how that reacts on the next freeze. It makes me sad to waste power for up to 15 days though.
Has anyone out there seen a problem like this? Any ideas on what kind of malfunction would act this way? Ideas of other diagnostic steps to take?
This was eventually solved by replacing the motherboard. I should've known based on the problems with the integrated network card.
