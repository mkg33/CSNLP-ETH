So internally, we use an nginx proxy that fronts our production sites. This nginx proxy provisions LetsEncrypt certs automatically for our sites.
However, when we access our sites from our office, or anywhere when 2 or more computers access our sites, the 2nd computer will experience extremely slow response rates (> 30s for the port to open) for the HTTPS (443) sites.
HTTP (port 80) sites work fine without any performance degradation.
By slow, I mean if I do a telnet nubela.co 443 from the 2nd computer, it will take more than 30 seconds for the TCP connection to be accepted.
However, if I do telnet nubela.co 80, it returns immediately (with a 302 status code to HTTPS)
The Nth (where N >= 2) computer, refers to any computer that is active, while the 1st computer is also active. Computer 1 does not need to be actively browsing to our production sites for this issue to occur.
To replicate this, you can try accessing https://nubela.co on 1 computer, then using another computer (from the same network) to access that site. The first computer will load it fast, the 2nd one will experience performance issues.
I will like to add that this nginx deployment is deployed as a Docker instance via Ansible
@Nubela I'd tested on same network with 2 different system (Mac Books Pro) and your website is loading as fast as the first system.
Probably check your ISP or Local cache setup would help you to fix this issue.
