I have two separated local networks (two routers, each is connected to its ISP for the internet connection) and a server with two ethernet ports. The server is running a local website service which I would like both networks to be able to access.
Can I just simply plug both ethernet ports of the server to each router port? Which ethernet port will be used for the internet connection on the server itself? 
I can't add comments, but in addition to kasperd's response, you can also set your connections up in a failover or a bond them. The method of doing this will differ depending on OS. In the case of failover, you would ride your primary path to the internet and only use the failover if the primary is down (there are some other more advanced things you can do like scripts for latency checks to take down the primary path if it passes a threshold) or ride both concurrently in the case of a bonded channel which inherently has a failover as it continues to work when one link in the bond fails.
