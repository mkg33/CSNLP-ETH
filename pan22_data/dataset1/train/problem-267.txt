If I'm understanding your problem correctly then the problem is because your rows are not being used as records. This means that you cannot sort on them. If you want to fix this then you need to change your layout a little. Consider using this layout:
I really don't know how to explain this and I cannot post the picture I made because I'm new. But here goes.
What I'm trying to do is have a table in columns A and B which skips every other row when sorted. What happens at the moment is all of the data I entered in these two columns where I want the data to remain end up filling in all the rows that I intentionally left blank. 
Note that Columns C and D will not be a part of the sortable table, the data entered in column D is just for an example; I intend for it to remain blank and to be written by hand throughout the month. 
Now, I realize that merging cells (like A2 and A3 together, B2 and B3 together, A4 and A5, B4 and B5) is big no no when it comes to tables but I donâ€™t see how else I can achieve what I'm trying to do.
Also, I'm not sure if it matters, but I need the cells in Column A to maintain their data validation capability.
