The /usr/local/lib directory is a common place for installers to drop libraries.  For example, my Mac (which has never had brew installed) has the following files in /usr/local/lib.  I recognize some of these as being part of MacFuse, which is (was?) packaged as standard installer, not any fancy package management like brew.
So to answer your question, you could delete those libraries (or more safely, move them to a different directory) and see what (if anything) breaks.  However, I would recommend leaving well enough alone unless you enjoy hunting down mysterious failures.
I installed Homebrew in order to install a few packages on my Mac (especially for Git and an older PHP version for Yosemite) and I don't know Homebrew very well.
When I run brew doctor, I get the warning below. Though it doesn't seem to be harmful, I have the habit to not let such a warning in place. I found a few topics about such warnings but it seems that each case is different, as well as the solution.
Does someone know how to solve that? Delete, uninstall, ignore? I don't want to just ignore that and I don't really know what to do.
