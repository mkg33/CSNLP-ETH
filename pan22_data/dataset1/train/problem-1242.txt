The problem is, just because your Apache claims to accept requests for www.myownraspberrypi.com, it doesn't automatically mean other computers will send requests to it. (Imagine, what would happen if you configured your Apache for www.google.com?) You still need to make that domain name actually point to your π's IP address.
The client computer (your PC) uses one of three ways to translate www.myownraspberrypi.com into an IP address:
If you only want to access the web server from one PC or two, you can add the name in their hosts files by hand, like this:
Some routers do have an option to make a domain name available to the entire LAN, although often limited to hostname.home or such. Look for a section called "Local DNS". (Though it would be much better to use .home than .com for this purpose.) But I don't think D-Link routers have that feature.
i have a raspberry pi(IP: 192.168.1.135) connected to my PC(IP: 192.168.1.100) via LAN port.
i got raspberry to get connected to router, i bridged the lan and wlan port so (in windows7 -> network and sharing center -> change adapter settings)
i configured apache with domain name http://www.myownraspberrypi.com/ at default port 80
but if i call the domain name in my PC its responding with This webpage is not available dialogue
my another doubt is that, is there any stetting to be loaded with my dlink DSL-2730 router to map the ip address of raspberry pi with domain name(in router)?
