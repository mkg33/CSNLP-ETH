/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches serves no operational purpose. Don't try it, you would only hurt performance. The only practical use case is cold caches for benchmarks.
Cached is available to applications, but Linux calls it used. Obligatory:  https://www.linuxatemyram.com/ 
Why would you spend money and power on fast memory and not use it for a performance boost? 
Today I found my server only have few free memory. and I executed free -h, it shows there are 60G memory used by cache. So I execute command to release cache, the result like this: 
$ free -h; sudo sync; echo 3 > sudo /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; free -h
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          126G       114G        11G       5.6M       465M        60G
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          126G       114G        11G       5.6M       465M        60G
It seemes didm't release any cache at all, and this server doesn't have virtual machine on it. Why? What should I do to release cache except reboot server(My OS is Debian 8)?
