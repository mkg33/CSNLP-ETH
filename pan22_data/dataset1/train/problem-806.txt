Redirecting My Documents and configuring them for Offline Files makes sense but my opinion is that AppData is not a good candidate for redirection except for users that "roam" from one workstation to another (in combination with roaming profiles) and is definitely not a good candidate for Offline Files. My suggestion would be to disable Folder Redirection and Offline Files for AppData and see if that makes a difference.
Also, how much data comprises the My Documents folder for these laptop users? If we're talking hundreds of MB's, and depending on the state of the files either locally or on the network share, it could take a considerable amount of time to logon and logoff while the files are snychronized.
I have enabled Folder Redirection, and Offline files via group policy, and now laptops take an and to "applying computer settings" and then the logon itself takes an amazing amount of time.
These are the only policies affecting this user, and also this laptop as I'm testing the combination of policies
What I wish to accomplish, is to have users MyDocs, and AppData synced to server shares, but also available offline for when they are not connected. This seems so simple, yet has given me a headache for the past two weeks. Any hints and tips appreciated. I am prepared to be a guinea pig, so I can def setup and combinations you need, I have the hardware, and time to do it :) (as in spare laptop, creating new user, OU etc :) ) andy help appreciated.
