There are similar SW packages like aufs or UnionFS. aufs is, afaik, outdated. 
I have no experience with these software packages and it seems like a ugly thing to do. I would try to solve the Problem with a read cache added to the NFS Server. Just make it big enough and let it run for a while, from your description you should get decent hit rates. 
I have repository server with a lot of files and data, that being used by a few nodes. Lately, I came across the issue of high load on the repository due to high volume of reads from nodes.
What I wanted to do, is to have some recent data(sliding window), that being used most frequently, locally on the nodes, luckly I have some SSD space on nodes.
Only few jobs, that are running on nodes require old data from the repository itself.
Now the question is, is there any option to combine data from NFS share and locally stored under the same folder. Application that uses data doesn't quite have an option to go to different folders.
I want to mount it under same folder, /mnt for instance, that /mnt/2015/201512 will be on local SSD and /mnt/2015/201511 will be available from repository server
