For your first questions: Does Microsoft provide Windows 7 installation medium for download?
From Microsoft's website: How to replace Microsoft software or hardware, order service packs, and replace product manuals 
For your second question; it sounds like you're attempting to use the recorvery disks to reinstall Windows into a specific partiation on a hard drive. 
Usually those OEM restore partiations were setup with a sepecific type of partition mapping and will by default go back to those settings. Probably not what you want. If you can get a replacement windows disk, you can use the partiation tools located in the setup to create a new partition for your installation and target the setup there. You can also use a third party partition tool to do custom partitioning of your hard drive and then install your operating system there. Once you start partitioning out your drive you then have the ability to do dual booting  and seperating your data (documents, photos, etc) from the actual operating system.
You can't use an oem licence with retails DVDs, you can only download retail copies which won't work with your key, the only way is to buy another copy of windows or use the manufacturers dvd
