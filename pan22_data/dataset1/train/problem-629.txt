There have been several questions related to providing backups, but most of them were either too specific, intended for home usage or Windows-based.
Especially the last question has been troubling me. Compressing backups into tarballs works okay, but causes a serious performance issue when I suddenly need to restore a backup. On the other hand, when not compressing the backups and syncing them to another server, there is a serious risk of creating inconsistent user permissions.
What tools help you to make this as easy as possible and what is your preferred approach to the matter?
I have a cron job running on the servers that run rdiff-backup.
/etc/ gets backed up, /home/ and any other directory that will ensure me getting another one up and running asap when it goes down.
Everything is gathered in one central place and all of this goes to tape every night.
Tape gets collected the next morning and goes away (off site) for 2 weeks before it's put back in rotation.
For the very crucial things, I have a live spare running. As in: a second server that sits there and idles (and is my toy basicly) but has all the files/services of the first one. When the first one goes down, this one can take over in a flash, all that needs to be done is change a DNS record.
