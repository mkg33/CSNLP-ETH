The hosts file is not a part of the routing configuration, but of the name resolution configuration. This implies, that for the OS to make a connection to a given IP address (a.o.t. a given hostname) the contents of hosts is not considered.
This also rules out a browser extension, as the browsers delegate name resolution and routing to the OS.
So for your problem on redirecting traffic IP-based you should look into something that works on the IP level, while I don't know if the normal Windows Firewall can do it, there might be other products that can even on Windows.
I'd like to obtain the same behaviour as the hosts file does, but with RAW IP addresses. 
Example; redirecting all traffic to 193.58.72.165 to 127.0.0.1
I've tried playing with bot netsh in Windows and iptables in Linux but both did not work. Is it possible that those aren't meant for this kind of redirecting?
A browser extension for this issue would also be totally appropriate, but I've only found hosts file equivalent extensions for now
