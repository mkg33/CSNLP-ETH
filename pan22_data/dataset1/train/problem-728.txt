I wouldn't access the database directly if I was you. VMware might change the schema any time if they think it necessary. (That's why there's no documentation: You're not supposed to access the DB directly.) Try to get the information you need via PowerCLI, Ruby vSphere Console or something similar.
There are also libs to access the vSphere API like VI Java API or pyVmomi that you can use, but they are quite complex.
Attempting to figure out the storage capacity within a VBlock so I can further look into it's usage by host and vm.  
VBlock -- It's a pre-setup environment that allows for infrastructure virtualization at scale with parts from VMware, Cisco, and EMC
VMware saves data in the VIM_VCDB database which isn't entirely documented so if anyone has any guidance or ideally, is aware of which tables can produce the storage capacity of the vblock would be quite helpful.
The below link helped solve the issues I was having.
