You can use NTP software (or the built-in functionality depending on the OS) to update the time. If it supports custom servers, you can find plenty of them, including NIST's servers (they have their own atomic—caesium to be specific—clock and are the USA’s official time keeper). Even if the system clock isn’t perfect (and few are), you can simply configure your software to update the time more frequently (eg every hour or every 10 minutes, etc.)
To pick an update frequency, you can disable all update functions and software, wait a significant amount of time (eg 24 hours, 1 week, etc.), and then manually trigger an update and observe the difference to see how many seconds (or minutes‽) it was off by. You can use that to determine a good interval that allows you to keep the system time correct without making excessive, unnecessary calls out to the time server.
You need an external time source in order to know if your is time off or not compared the the source.
The more sources you have, the more safe you can be. Usually, NTP is enough to keep the system time correct. If, however, you have no access to a network or to an NTP server, you can attach a radio controlled clock to the system, or use GPS for time synchronisation.
