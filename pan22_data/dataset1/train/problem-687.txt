I had XP on the C:\ drive and installed Vista on D:. When I booted into Vista, it appeared it was on C:\, when I booted into XP, it also showed as C:. Vista functions differently from XP; when you start it, it shows it's on the C:\ drive. So all these letters don't really mean anything in the end.
Just try and install Windows 7 directly, without making all these changes. Just pop in the Windows 7 DVD, format the Vista partition from the installer and continue installing 7. When done, the Windows 7 bootloader will probably figure out what to do with XP.
Actually Windows XP is very picky about being located on the C: drive especially if you have a prior install and have programs all up and running it gets messy; best I would say is to get a third party Drive managing software and do some adjusting; I use Acronis software ie Disk director no plug intended I've had it for over a year and it works very well.
Most important thing however is Backup, Backup, Backup acronis could help you there also or any other software; then open your disk software you can select change drive E: to C: and so on I can only speak for Acronis as that's all I use it will ask for a restart do all the drives in one simple pre boot screen and vala!
