I have multiple screens with different correct DPI settings.  I can use xrandr --dpi X to change DPI for all screens, is it possible to set different DPI for each screen?  How do I make apps recalculate font sizes when they are moved to a different screen?  xrandr --dpi X only affects new windows, old windows still use the old DPI value.
I was able to solve this (with issues) using the details outlined in the following github discussion: https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/3606
External Monitor QHD (2560X1440), Internal/Laptop Monitor 3200x1800
External Monitor FHD (1920x1080), Internal/Laptop Monitor 3200x1800
These work, but there is a significant amount to tearing in the high resolution monitor (laptop) when I move windows, resize screens or scroll on a browser. This feels like a software rending solution (which has all these issues of tearing, and slow refreshes).
Its 2017, Linux/Gnome needs to address the multi-monitor, mixed scaling solution. Both Windows 10 and OS X have this resolved without having to resort to command line band-aid fixes that partially work (the tearing issue isn't acceptable for gaming)
