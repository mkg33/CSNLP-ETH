I actually had the same problem over the weekend. At the moment I am stuck with the Berkeley DB problem however installing the openssl-dev packages fixed the problem with SVN not compiling.
I'm having problems compiling SVN 1.6.3 from source on our Ubuntu 8.04 development server.  
I downloaded the 1.6.3 source files and dependencies and ran ./configure.  About 2 minutes into the process, it complains about:
So I try running ./configure --with-openssl, but then it complains that --with-openssl is not a recognized option.
I Googled the problem and found someone suggesting to do ./configure --without-ssl.  I tried that and it still complains about requiring OpenSSL.
The INSTALL file says that OpenSSL is optional, so I don't know what gives.  http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/INSTALL.  We don't need OpenSSL... we are using SVN via the svn://, not https://.
FYI:  I do not have root privileges on this server.  I'm "just" a developer.  The server admin says he'll run make install, but I have to do all of the prior steps.
