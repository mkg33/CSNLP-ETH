Copyright is about copying, not only distribution.  Courts have ruled that even loading a program into memory is copying and subject to limitations on copyright.  
IANAL but I think you would probably be OK, although it is a murky situation.  By requiring the other game to be present you are in essence creating a derivative work containing your code and the assets of the other game.  Could you create your own assets (single color textures, empty maps, whatever) and allow the user to select different assets when running the game?  If your game requires someone else's copyrighted assets to function at all then an argument could be made that it is a derivative work.
Copyright is only about distribution, not about use.
When you obtained copyrighted content, you are free to do whatever you want with it, as long as you don't give it away to others.
Also, when you obtain copyrighted content from somewhere, you aren't violating the copyright. The violation is committed by the person who distributes the content without permission.
