We're experiencing 100% CPU usage from the process Microsoft.Identity.Health.AadSync.MonitoringAgent.Startup on our Domain Controllers that have Azure AD Connect installed, since yesterday.
According to this discussion, an official from Microsoft says that the problem is due to an incompatibility with Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 .Net Framework - KB4054542 (Server 2012), KB4054566 (Server 2012 R2) and KB4054590 (Server 2016), but unfortunately for us, on our 2012 R2 servers, KB4054566 failed to install so can't be uninstalled.  And a related update KB4340006 that did successfully install, which is the one I think caused our problems, cannot be uninstalled either.
I know plenty of other people are experiencing this issue... what's the best action to take before Microsoft releases a new version of Azure AD Sync Monitor?
Having the same issue on a Server 2008 R2 box after the .NET 4.7.2 update this week. Have worked with Matty Browns suggestion of disabling the service until the issue is worked through by Microsoft (Updates or ADConnect Utility).
