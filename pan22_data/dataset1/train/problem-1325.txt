The first thing to do is to check Message Tracking in System Manager to see how that message got routed. Since you have the message, this should be easy. That should prove it at least got to his mailbox. 
What happened next will take a bit of digging. A search on the mailbox it self may turn it up, sometimes users do misplace things. If that doesn't turn it up, check the Recover Deleted Items on the box (assuming you have that) and see if it is lurking in there somewhere. 
If it STILL doesn't show up, I have had a few cases where my spam/virus filter snagged messages pretty late in the process. Check those logs. And finally, some desktop-AV does have Outlook hooks. You'll want to check those logs as well.
One of my end users says that they didn't receive an important email yesterday.
I have the copy of the email that he was supposed to receive yesterday that says it was sent but he said he didn't get it.
How can I check to see if an email was actually not delivered vs. being caught in a spam filter? We don't have an external spam filter (such as Barracuda) so it isn't sitting in anything like that waiting to be delivered.
