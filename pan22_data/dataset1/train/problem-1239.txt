Personally, when viewing TCP/IP ports in the Print Management MMC console or in the printer properties, seeing a port named "AccountingDepartment" or "HP_4050_TN" isn't helpful to me as a sysadmin.
What is important to me, when viewing the printers in the Print Management console or in the Printers control panel is the name, location, and comments (as well as the server name and share name in the Printer Management console).
I normally name the port to match the ip address for a TCP/IP printer, such as: 10.1.5.10. That way when I'm viewing the printer properties or the TCP/IP ports in the Print Management console, I know exactly what ip address has been assigned to each printer.
Just wondering if anyone can help me out with some best practice for setting up a new print server and all of the individual queues.
I have some questions regarding setting up the print queues, for example should I prefix the port names with IP_10.x.x.x etc? or just leave the port names 10.x.x.x 
Any feedback regarding best practice for print servers on windows server 2008 is appreciated.
