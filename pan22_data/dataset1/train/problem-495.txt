No, expired certificates have no role in AD authentication (by default). Especially certificates in Chrome, which has no Windows-auth hooks at all. 
What's much more likely is a service or scheduled task on your machine that's configured to impersonate you and never got the password change supplied. This service/task then runs every so often, attempts to authenticate, fails, and you get the lockouts. 
You can fairly quickly look up if you have such a service configured by opening Computer Management, navigating to the Services section, and sorting the list by Log On As; if you're on any of 'em, right-click properties and enter your new password. 
Around the end of February, the password was about to expire on my Active Directory account.
Since then, I can get locked out 3 to 10 times a day without me doing much of anything on my end. It can even happen when I lock the PC and step away to the restroom or while I am in the middle of writing code in Visual Studio.
Our network admin has been working with me to try and resolve this (he's tired of unlocking my account), and all of the bad password attempts originate from my PC.
So, I got to looking into certificates, and I noticed I have two (2), one of which has recently expired.
I started to delete the expired certificate, but Windows warned me that any data encrypted by me using that certificate would be non-accessible once the certificate was deleted.
How do I tell what data a certificate has deleted?
Could this expired certificate be causing my Active Directory account to get locked out?
