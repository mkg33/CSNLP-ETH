I learned how to compile nginx with mp4 module. I also added proper directive in my website conf.
I am trying to play a mp4 using JW player and flow player. But the video doesn't buffer and play like youtube and similar sites. It takes a long time to start play. It seems it downloads the whole video and then plays it.
I have tried changing the buffer limits but no luck.
I downloaded a youtube video and tried comparing it with my own video. The video from youtube starts playing immediate but my converted video doesn't. Maybe nginx only plays mp4 files in a specific codec and format ? 
Note that I am not making a tube site or anything similar. So please don't suggest to migrate from nginx.
Ok I found the cause of the problem. For anyone who is having the same problem. Actually the issue is not related to nginx, web player(JW player in my case) or the video codecs you are using. It's the video file itself.
This python script should help you to add Quicktime atom positioning for you video files. It allows rewind and seeking.
