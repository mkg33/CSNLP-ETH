The Rate My Computer page can be launched like this:  
You will still need manual interaction to start the  calculation.
As far as I know that just opens the application, you can't make it start automatically.  
WINSAT is a command-line utility makes the same calculations. What I'm not sure about (don't have a Win7 system to test here) is if it will update the rating as shown in the Windows GUI.
Please note that for both cases the user that runs this must be member of the Administrators group and in case of WINSAT the command-prompt (or your post-deployment applications if that calls it) must be run in "Run as Administrator" mode.
I am creating a re-deployable Windows 7 Embedded WIM image. In audit mode I have configured it to be as I want and run the sysprep process to generalise the image before capturing it. 
As part of the post deployment steps I have to ask the deployment engineer to run the 'Rate My Computer' tool manually from Control Panel -> Performance Information and Tools. 
Ideally, I would prefer that my post deployment application (c#) takes care of this post driver installation. 
Is there a way to invoke this process via command line / direct executable run ? I have been unable to find any reference to this outside of manually clicking to button.
