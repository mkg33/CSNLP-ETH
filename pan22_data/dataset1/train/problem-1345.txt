You are basically doing 3 things in both functions:
You could easily make 1) a part of 3) and create a function that activates a dot:
I ignored the fadeOut part since i is not known in $("#prev").click. Unless i is a global variables in which case you have a lot of rethinking ahead of you, no global variables please!!
You can do all your navigating with one function, just by changing what you pass to it:
(You could even get clever with this if you wanted and do this instead:)
At this point you could just throw your 'setInterval' on it and call it a day, but why not wrap it up a little? (Remember the 'autoplay' variable that showed up earlier?) This way you have more control over when/if the slideshow starts running.
These are basic optimizations, but ideally you should take this a little further and wrap it up in a more modular/portable container, to avoid possible conflicts with other page scripting. This could be as simple as wrapping the whole thing in a function:
But that's a very general explanation. I definitely recommend reading a bit about JS plugin/module patterns, and how to write them to keep your code neat and self-contained.
