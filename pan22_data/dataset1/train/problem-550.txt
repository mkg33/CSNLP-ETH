Your monitor will have a power management function. Try turning it off.
Look for references to DVI DMPM in the manual. If that solves the problem then you could just switch off the monitor when you are finished with the computer.
I only know this because some people at work changed the timeout on this function to different values on different monitors and i had them randomly turn off on me. Took a couple of days before i realized they were screwing with me. ;-)
It most likely is not any setting, but you can try restoring the monitor to default settings and see if that helps, its worth a shot as it is very simple to do.
Try replacing the monitor cable, there could be an issue with cable or one of the connectors that is causing intermittent issues. If that doesn't change anything, try swapping out the power cable (it is a long-shot, but I've seen defective power cables cause all sorts of odd issues in equipment).
If none of this works, then it would appear to be a hardware issue with the monitor, possibly some sort of short. I would suggest contacting the manufacturer to see if they have any diagnostic tests that you can run on their monitors or to see if it is a known issue with the equipment.
