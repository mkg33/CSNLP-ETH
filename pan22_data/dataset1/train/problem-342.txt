Looking at what you've done, I can't see anything wrong - though there are some significant gaps.
A growing proportion of the web is running on HTTPS only. And I would expect an application like Whatsapp to use SSL for all its traffic. While it is possible to relay the SSL traffic on the proxy server (using a simple port forwarder like socat) if you need the capability to monitor the data being exchanged then that's a much more complex proposition. Squid does have the capability to generate SSL certs on the fly and hence decrypt/re-encrypt traffic. But this requires the root CA you are using to be installed on the client devices - which will be rather difficult to do on mobile devices which have not been rooted.
I suppose you are trying to connect different users to the internet using this combination, right? Are your clients and your server in the same network?
I don't understand why you need to use OpenVPN server for this. Why don't you just setup Squid in your server, and get your clients to use it directly as their proxy server? If they got visibility and the port that you configure into Squid is not filtered by a firewall, it should work. You can even configure Squid to forward requests to a 2nd proxy if needed.
If you still want to user OpenVPN to encrypt your traffic from clients to the server, you still need to configure Squid proxy as your proxy server in your clients. Otherwise they will just connect directly using just the VPN connection.
