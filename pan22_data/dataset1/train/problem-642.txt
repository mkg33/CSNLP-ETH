You could use the Windows built-in task scheduler to run a SQL script using the command line tools that are provided with SQL Express - I believe that http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162773.aspx is included with all SQL 2005 and 2008 editions including Express.
I would recommend setting up a user specifically for this and running the script logged via Windows Integrated Authentication. If you do use user/pass based authentication make sure you properly secure the file containing the password, particularly if the machine is a shared one. As well as being more fine grained about what users can do what on your database the other advantage of running the task as a different Windows user is that you don't need to mess around ensuring no console windows open to get in your way if it runs while you are logged in (if you run it as yourself, you might find a console window pops up and claims focus when the task runs).
Use ExpressMain, its a very handy solution for SQL Server Express users.
