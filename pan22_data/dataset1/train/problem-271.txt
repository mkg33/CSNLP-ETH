I had been using two passive DisplayPort-to-DVI adapters and one plain DVI cable fine when I was running three monitors; two were the same size, and one was a larger size.  I was able to fix this problem by switching one of the adapters to be an active DisplayPort-to-DVI adapater.  
Now the V4800 runs three monitors with different resolutions successfully (1680x1050, 1920x1200, and 1280x1024).
Are all three monitors exactly the same on both computers? If not, you may be hitting a resolution limit.
The V4800 is an Evergreen-era GPU (actually one iteration later) so I'm a little surprised that it doesn't support up to three 1920x1080 displays... 
Single link DVI has "missing square pins" or "missing holes" (depending on whether you're looking at male or female connector).
Single Link has a lower maximum resolution (or lower refresh rate if higher resolution) because it can transmit less data with less pins. Dual Link can transmit the highest maximum resolution / refresh rate. Cable lengths also can affect resolution.
