PDF is probably not the right format to begin with...
Technically, "PDF text" is a collection of characters/word fragments/words with page number and coordinates. For example, there are no spaces, but only "room between word fragments which might be a space, or a column skip, or a table skip, or just kerning". The order of the text fragments may or may not be in reading order (...at the PDF creators discretion), because it doesn't matter for showing on screen or printing!
To mitigate that, some (but not all: all will depend on the creator) PDF files which will contain both the "text for display" and "text in reading order". Which hopefully is the same text as shown on screen (there is no guarantee!).
Any software which "extracts" text from PDF will have to do lots of interpretation. Have a look at this article for a start.
I have downloaded a substantial amount of Wikipedia as pdf files and arranged them into a personalized library for offline reading and thinking times, and I have made a search engine that accumulates tags much the same way this site does for a question.
Trouble is, the programming IDE I made this in can't import pdf files in a human readable format, I need to be able to convert all of my pdf files into csv or txt for my search app to work. 
Can anyone explain how the process of pdf to txt conversion works?
I was just reading this article that another person has expressed similar  frustrations.
