No, the fsync parameter in postgresql.conf only tells the database that it should write to disk, not how it should do it.  According to the documentation: 
Which in this case, since you have not changed the wal_sync_method it should choose open_datasync since that is available and the default for Windows platforms.
But seeing that the table is small, and the updates as well, I would guess that you are actually hitting the write-back cache in the hard-drive, which means that you are not writing directly to the disk and therefore the operations are not slowed down due to the writing.
You do not mention what kind of hard drive it is, so it is not possible to know if the cache is write-back, but it sounds like a possible scenario.
and ran a pgbench of the following simple update statement.
Given that it's serially executing transactions, this tps result seems to be too high for my system:
I haven't changed the default settings, so fsync and synchronous_commit options should be both on.
Doesn't this fsync result mean that maximum write tps cannot exceed 45 tps?
Another question: Shouldn't 7200 rpm disk be able to perform about 120 tps? Why is fsync so slow?
