I haven't done this in years, but I believe T568B to T568A is a crossover cable for 10/100BaseT connections and you will need to make a gigabyte crossover cable to go faster.

There is a lot of inaccurate and misleading information here. Even the accepted answer fails to understand exactly what happened at the punch-down block side of the cable.
I am posting a more accurate answer to help anyone else who may find themselves in a similar situation.
An Ethernet cable's Rj45 connector can easily be identified as following either the T-568A or T-568B wiring standard if the wires are in either of the following sequences:
The second half of this question seems to be where people got confused.
Here is an example of an answer that provided incorrect information by assuming that the left-to-right wire sequence represents pins 1-8, as it does in an RJ45 plug:
We can clearly see from this photo that connection #12 on the patch panel's punch-down block is wired according to the panel's wiring instructions for T-568B.
The orange and green pairs should be released from the punch-down block and connected according to the wiring instructions for T-568A, as seen in the top half of the above photo.
