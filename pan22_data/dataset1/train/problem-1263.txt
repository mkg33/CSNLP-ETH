I found CONFIG_BUILD_DOCSRC in two configuration files, but both are marked as autogenerated, do not edit. So I'm trying to pass CONFIG_BUILD_DOCSRC=n to genkernel. I've been through the genkernel(8) man pages but I did not see how to pass an arbitrary setting like CONFIG_BUILD_DOCSRC=n (it may be there and I could have missed it).

I'm going to post an answer, but I'm not sure if its correct because I'm not really qualified to build kernels...
The following can be added to /etc/genkernel.conf:
