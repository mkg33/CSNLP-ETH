What you're seeing is just the current contents of your ~/.bash_profile file. To confirm this, run more ~/.bash_profile, and you should see the same thing. The first 4 lines were added automatically when you installed Python 3.7 to make sure you'd be able to use the newly installed Python; the rest was added similarly by the Miniconda3 installer.
Solution: make a backup of the file in case anything goes wrong, then edit it again in vi and just move down to the bottom and add your new commands after what's already there. I'd leave a blank line in between (and between the Python and Miniconda parts as well), so it's visually easier to tell where the sections start and end.
I am running MacOS v.10.13.6, and in Terminal I was installing pipenv by following a tutorial. As part of the installation I went to edit bash_profile with vi editor in order to add 3 directories to PATH. 
This is my first time using vi and adding directories to PATH, so if it is just my ignorance then I apologize, but the result is a bunch of text that I didn't expect, and no searches I perform on any portion of the text have yielded any insight. 
This text is followed by what I expected to see: a lot of empty lines with tildas down the left side of the window which I recognize as the vi editor.
I close vi without writing, and if I repeat the command I get the same thing.
I have an intuition that this is displaying because I recently installed Miniconda which came with Python 3.7 AND I already had Python 3.7 installed from some months ago. So perhaps a duplicate installation of Python is triggering this?
Apologies if I'm leaving out something, it's my first question here, and on a topic that I'm just starting to learn. Any help is much appreciated.
