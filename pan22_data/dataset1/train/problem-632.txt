I have MacPorts installed on my iMac with a fair number of ports installed.
I'm interested in trying out Homebrew, though, as I've heard many good things about it, and because I've noticed that it contains more up-to-date versions of several of the tools that I use.
But can the two coexist on the same machine, or do I need to uninstall MacPorts entirely first?
Also, if the two can be installed at the same time, will they be completely independent of each other? One of the features of Homebrew is that is doesn't reinstall new versions of things which are already included in the system (e.g. python). Does this also extend to it not installing versions of things which are already maintained by MacPorts?
What happens if I then subsequently uninstall MacPorts?
This is relevant because according to the Homebrew Installation Page:
Therefore, and with little personal experience, I theorize that always using the -t flag for MacPort installs should prevent most problems of having MacPorts and Homebrew coexist on the same system. To address your last question: I don't see any reason why uninstalling MacPorts would cause any problems.
