You need to set a wildcard dns entry to be able to dynamically create subdomains on the fly (though what you're really doing is telling your DNS provider is to send EVERYTHING to your server, and weeding out with vhosts). This shouldn't need  a seperate dns provider.
1: Do I need to create a DNS on the server No. You can use the GoDaddy DNS servers(maybe -depending on what type of IP address you have)  see this
BUT - This is dependent on whether or not you have a static or dynamic IP address from your ISP. If you didn't specifically order a static IP, then there's a 99% chance yours is dynamic which means it will probably change every time your router or modem reboots. <- this will require a solution before this will work. 
Sorry if I'm telling you something you already know.
2: Why do you require 2 IP addresses? Unless there is something I'm not seeing, one IP address can serve many many virtual web sites.
So let me know if your IP is static or dynamic. If dynamic, what brand/model router are you using because come have built in support for dynamic IP addresses.
