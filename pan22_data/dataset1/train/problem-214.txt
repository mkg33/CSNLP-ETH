That depends on the OS. For Unix/Linux here are some suggestions how to stuff some string into the input buffer. Windows is of course different.
A completly different approach based on bash only is using something like this: Type these command into the bash prompt:
Now you can type Alt+x (the \ex part int the code) and current input line is replaced with execute me.
i am actually programming a script where i can store commands in a cheatsheet (e.g. "git add .", "git merge", "docker compose-up" ....) - all commands that i need in my daily work.
now i have a question: is it possible to copy a command into the command line without any additional installations?
my actual idea is to implement it like the shell history -> add a number before each command and then i want to call it like this
Where -c stands for command parameter (if have several parameters already implemented) and the 5 stands for the command in line 5.
TL;DR: is it possible to copy a line from a file to the command line and then execute it by clicking enter?
