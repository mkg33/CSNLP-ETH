A silent ESXi server, well there's a first time for everything I guess - are you sure this is for a professional/production system? I'd be really interested in what you're doing here.
Anyway it seems a bit odd to be a) using an SSD as your main datastore at all and b) worrying about storage performance when you'll be using a passively cooled CPU (presumably). Unless you know SSDs are the right solution for you and that your full end to end system will benefit from the extra performance these higher-end SSDs then I'd go for pretty much any of them but with an emphasis on choosing the one with the most over-commit memory.
The answer entirely depends on your workload and your requirements for reliability.
SSDs do "wear out" as they are written to. All of your picked drive models are MLC drives primarily targeted for the laptop market where writes do not happen very often for large amounts of data
If you do not expect extensive I/O with high contention from your guests, you might want to look into SLC-based drives instead - they will cost more and typically show lower performance, but will be more reliable as SLCs allow about 10x the number of write cycles compared to MLCs.
BTW: the datasheet numbers might seem impressive, but the drives often do not deliver on the promise. We've had Transcend SLC drives stating "up to 90 MB/s sequential write performance" in the datasheet but yielding actual 12-14 MB/s in the lab which was "within the expected range" according to Transcend tech support. So the basic rule here would be to test before deployment as you might get surprising results with your particular setups.
