Move all of .gnupg to your USB stick. The native GnuPG for Windows builds have a registry setting, but the most portable option (working with both native and Cygwin versions) is to set the GNUPGHOME environment variable.
If your Windows version has setx, run it from the Command Prompt:
Otherwise, open the "System" Control Panel item (sysdm.cpl), go to the "Advanced" tab, and add the environment variable there.
Log out & log in again to make sure all programs have picked up the change.
I use GPG through Cygwin on Windows. I don't want to store my key on my laptop as a convenient file for a casual tech-savvy thief to grab if they steal the machine, so I'd like to keep it on a USB that I can keep with my house keys (I'm aware that this isn't hyper-secure, and I'm sure the keys would be forensically-retrievable from the machine, but I don't really care about that).
How can I do this? I want GPG to look for my keyring elsewhere, not .gnupg. I don't think a command-line flag to GPG would do it, because I'm using programs that invoke GPG and can't forward the flags.
