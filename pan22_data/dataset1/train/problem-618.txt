If the controller supports the Common RAID Formats then you can move them between controllers without much worry.
Some Intel RAID controllers (and many other controllers) have their own proprietary implementation of RAID, this is not portable.
Actually, ALL enterprise level RAID products use proprietary formats, though the algorithms behind the RAID levels are more or less the same.
SNIA, the company behind Common RAID format has seen some interest form companies like DELL, but that is that. It's for now just another white paper standard.
Therefore, do not hope for any compatibility between brands, or even different models of the same brand.
If the motherboard or the controller fails, you will need to install another identical mainboard, or at least another mainboard with the same controller. Since the on-board RAID solutions are mostly software solutions (the chip does only simple controlling and RAID level setup, but no real hardware RAID since they lack XOR-hardware, to say the least), you might have a good chance to find the identical Intel controller on another mainboard.
So, all you then would do is, move the HDDs to the new mainboard and the array will be automatically recognized.
