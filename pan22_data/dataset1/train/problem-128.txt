Try resizing the VM, then you can change it back if desired. This will hopefully fix the issue. If not, then you may need to try to fix the issue by removing the virtual machine (hitting delete in the portal) and re-deploying it using the same VHD disk that you used. You will also need to re-attach any data disks you were using as well. This will appear like a hard "reboot" to the Virtual Machine. This re-creation of the VM can be accomplished by going through the create VM process in the portal, selecting gallery, and from there selecting "My Disks."
