I'm currently working on a Tomcat Cluster for Q&A, but unfortunatly, it seems that the auto deploy of a war across this cluster is not working at all.
I know the cluster is working perfectly because each server are receiving correctly the multicast communications and are aware of any missing host instantly.
The problem here is coming from the FarmWarDeployer function which seems to not working.
Indeed, when I upload a war, using the tomcat manager, or a simple SFTPd push, on the node1 of my cluster, the war is unpacked and used by the node1, but, it's not sent to my node 2.
well, my APPTest is correctly set with the  tag and the cluster is correctly receiving session if I manually push the application on the node2.
So, about me, the problem is coming from my FarmWarDeployer Settings which are:
About me there is nothing too strange for a testing cluster, but I'm definitly not a tomcat expert.
So, if something is wrong or missing, let me know ;-)
FarmWarDeployer can be configured at host level cluster only. Cluster settings move into the <Host>...</Host>. It work for me.
