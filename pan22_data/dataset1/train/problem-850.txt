This can happen if one of the folders Thunderbird uses is locked or owned by someone other than that who did the installation. Try starting Thunderbird by right-clicking on the Thunderbird icon and select Run as Administrator. Then go to Help | About Thunderbird and it should update correctly.
Another possibility is that some other program, e.g. Cortana indexing, is currently accessing the profile folder. Check the folder C:\Users\Bart\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles with a tool such as LockHunter to see what is causing the issue.
Then either use the tool to end the process to unlock the folder or perform a full reboot, not hybrid shutdown, to unlock it.
If none of these worked, then save your personal data in the profile, uninstall Thunderbird, perform a fresh installation and then restore your data. Before this drastic measure, back up all Thunderbird data in User\AppData.
On Windows 10 18.03 the Thunderbird update from V38.5.0 fails with the following message:
I did that (there was no 2nd copy), I looked in the Task Manager, I even rebooted. But I always have the same result.
