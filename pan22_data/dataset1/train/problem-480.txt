There are two ways I can think of depending on what you are trying to accomplish.
If you are just looking to store the files on a networked drive, you can disable "Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library" on the Advanced page of preferences.  Then when you add files to iTunes, it will play them from the networked drive rather than copying them to the local computer.  The downside of this is that, if you have multiple computers accessing these songs, you'll need to add new songs to each computer.
The other easy option is to keep a copy of iTunes running on the external server, then use the built-in library sharing to play songs across the network.  If you add a password to your library, the "5 connections per day" limit is disabled.  You won't have to add new songs except once on the server (and this is easier now with the new "Automatically Add to iTunes" folder).
Yes, it is possible.  But are we talking Windows or Macintosh?  By "Library hosted on an external server", do you mean that the itunes data directory is on a network volume?  Or do you mean on a NAS that will pretend to be a copy of itunes running?
