I need to set the serial port /dev/ttyS0 to 250k bit/sec in order to send commands to another device expecting 250k.
I am using Python and trying to set the speed with the command
This generates an error because the port speed is a non standard unix speed the nearest being 230400   ....which is not close enough.
Note this is not USB. The Rasberry Pi B has the ability to go to this speeds and I have confirmed to myself that it gets to the higher speed ranges with and oscilloscope.
Looks like I need to recompile the kernel. I can do that, but can someone help with which code needs to be modified to get a new non standard uart speed.
The clock speed of the serial port is 3000000Hz (3MHz).
We can UNDERclock this (as low as 1MHz), but we cannot OVERclock it (with any confidence).
So we will pick the Baud Rate one-above the speed you want and slow it down...
Quick maths sanity-check: 250,000 is a bit more than half of 460,800 ...and 1,627,604 is a bit more than half of 3,000,000 ...yep that looks right :)
So if we reduce the serial clock speed to 1627604 and then specify a serial port speed of 460800, the upshot will be a serial port that runs at 250000.
You can even do the maths backwards to double check things: 
249,999.97 is uncommonly accurate, you can get away with a lot more deviation than that! [citation required]
So we edit /boot/config.txt; Set the serial clock speed to 1627604; And the Baud Rate to 460800
