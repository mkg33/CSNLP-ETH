You may have a misunderstanding about the purpose of the board.
The Pi's with the 40 pin expansion header have 28 GPIO (the rest of the pins are power rails and ground).
The expansion board just offers (the vendor would argue) a more convenient way to connect to those expansion header pins.
It provides no more GPIO, nor does it let you route a GPIO to an alternate pin.  It just gives multiple connection points to an expansion header pin.
I've recently bought a Triple GPIO Expansion Board in order to connect multiple sensors to my Raspberry pi while the number of open GPIOs (like model 3 B) are limited. This board has 4 sets of 40 GPIO pins and each column labeled as JP1 to JP4. I was wondering how can I set a specific pin while all look same with even the same pin number? In another word, How can I specify the pin for example 11 on the second column (JP2)? There should be a way to distinguish between each array of the board when defining the GPIO pin numbers in our code! for example:
I want to have a control on each GPIO separately in order to turn it on/off
