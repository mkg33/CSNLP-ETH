The 128GB will not only be slower per-stick, it will also not be tri-channel configuration.  The faster RAM + tri-channel will probably make a noticeable difference.
That said, you have to size based on your VM load.  If you will not have enough free memory to run all VMs on 3 hosts (in case of a host failure), you should go with the 128GB.  Otherwise, go for the speed!
I agree with some of the previous posters. The biggest question you need to ask is if you are going to run low on RAM. Also using more than %80 of physical RAM for normal use is dicey. Of course peak usage is one thing, but while faster RAM is better if you're not going to have enough that is a big issue.
Also where is your bottleneck going to be? Are you using a SAN or DAS? If you max out your storage arrays IO then the faster RAM is not going to do you that much good, and the extra RAM will matter more. 
If you aren't going to max out your RAM and you're running an enterprise SAN (LSI, EMC etc) then the faster RAM would be a better bet.
