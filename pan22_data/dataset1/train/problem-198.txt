I'm using G SUITE to accept mail for my domain, so I've set my SPF record as recommended by Google to v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all. Now I want to send emails from my webservers and  I want to add them to my SPF record. Google suggests that I add the IP of my additional server to the SPF record like this:
However, I have multiple web servers and I'd prefer any of them to be able to send emails. Is the following valid?
without -all nobody cares, if you use +a and your record is example.com, the result of dig +short A example.com and dig +short AAAA example.com will be used.  In either case, this an extra dns lookup and not recommended for efficiency (especially with includes, 10 dns lookups max), unless your root domain is a cname, which it cannot be, it would benefit you to list all IP addresses for your A record in the SPF record, you're updating the same zone, not hard.
I say especially with includes as you have no control over what they do with that spf record, some less quality email hosts will exceed that dns lookup limit.
