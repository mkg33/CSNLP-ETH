Get 1 switch for each room and connect them together. You'd likely see more issues from having a dozen long cables strewn about everywhere. The latency added by multiple switches in series would be negligible (sub-millisecond).
me and my buddies play lan in an office afterhours and use their established infrastructure ...ie, no idea what kind of cables, routers, hubs, switches, firewals are behind the walls...
we play out of two or three rooms, where we plug an old 10/100 switch into the wall and distribute among the users in that room. The "server" is either someone's laptop or the office computer of the dude that works there.
either the "work comp" or "laptop" is generally decent specs with 10/100/1000 e-cards
we currently play COD4:MW and get pings of around 50-70, sometimes spike to even higher.
my suggestion to the guys was to get a new switch (or two) and run our own cable from the "work comp" into the rooms where we play (bout 50 feet)
do we get one big switch and have cables everywhere.. (25-30 feet from adjecent rooms)
or get two or three switches (one for each room) and simply daisy chain them together.
assuming that either all the switches are gigabit unamanaged, or if 10/100 then with a gigabit uplink port (but why bother?)
how much latency would we be losing by doing the daisy chain route? if any? Does it matter? 
we're not gonna be connecting to the internet or doing datatransfers, just straight up gaming.
