Can someone please help me with a HTTP caching question?
I thought that if I set the "Expires" and "Cache-Control:max-age" request headers, then a browser wouldn't make a GET request until after the max-age had passed?
My server is seeing lots of conditional GET requests, and it replies with a 304. However, I'd like to eliminate these conditional GETs if possible and have the browser only ask for a resource once it thinks it has expired.
Here's the details I get from the developer tools in Chrome:
I set the cache headers in a filter in my Java code. The code is running on Oracle's OC4J.
Also, I want to run this over HTTPS. Will using the same headers work for HTTPS too?
if you remove the Last-Modified and ETag header, you will totally eliminate If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match requests and their 304 Not Modified Responses, so a file will stay cached without checking for updates until the Expires header indicates new content is available.
