It sounds like you have some mappings overriding the default keystrokes.  If you use the :verbose command you can see what set a mapping (or option, or a number of other things). For example:
That should show you all mappings that start with d and what set the mapping.
This morning something, I suspect a function call, changed the mappings or actions for system commands like dd , e , j etc. dd moved horizontally, 'e' moved down a line and j and k moved horizontally rather than vertically as well.
I was editing a help file and had called a function to create begin and end folds, basically concatenating ===== BEGIN with register " and ====={{{ into register z and the end fold marker into register x . Used this many times in help files so not sure what went wrong closing and re-opening the file reverted to normal operation even using the function call again.
This happens at irregular intervals in other scenarios as well. I'm using Gvim 7.4 on Windows 7 Enterprise.
Is there a way to either see what changed the command or what say dd is mapped to currently? Also which of the *.vim files in the $VIMRUNTIME/ folders should I source to revert to normal mappings?
