First off, some basic advice in your situation to ensure replication is able to happen properly:
You use the repadmin command to check replication between Domain Controllers in an Active Directory domain.  From Technet:
If you find that there are problems with replication between your DCs, refer to the Technet article Troubleshooting Active Directory Replication Problems for help.  There's quite a but involved but hopefully with a simple setup like yours it won't be too hard to solve.
Problem was caused by the fact I created two domain controllers as stand alone ones so I think they were able to communicate on network level, but the all the replication stuff was not properly implemented.
To be precise - while installing the second DC during AD DS role installation, I should have chosen the option to "ADD SERVER TO EXISTING DOMAIN" (which allowed me to chose the replication "schema"(not sure if this is the correct word) instead of "CREATE NOT DOMAIN IN NEW FOREST".
The problem is entirely solved and I can now replicate the objects. 
I have followed this specific guide while setting up another box with Win Server 2012.

PS. Thanks for the answer I now know what can I use the repadmin tool, which propably will come handy soon.
