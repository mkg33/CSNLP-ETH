As per this article in CNN: Marriott fined $600,000 by FCC for blocking guests' Wi-Fi
How is it possible to do what's described in this article?  It's saying that they were able to block personal wifi hotspots while still allowing people to access only their wifi access points.  It also says they weren't "jamming" (I can't see how you could jam and also allow access to your own access points).  Another article covering the same story said you just couldn't even "see" your own wifi hotspots.
The FCC release says "The FCC Enforcement Bureau’s investigation revealed that Marriott employees had used containment features of a Wi-Fi monitoring system at the Gaylord Opryland to prevent individuals from connecting to the Internet via their own personal Wi-Fi networks".  It also seems to indicate they did it with packet injection to cause disconnections (is that possible when using encryption?  Or does that get done before the connection can go into encryption?)
I predict the press does not know how to write an article.  I believe Marriott blocked cell phone service that removed carrier data to the personal hotspot that forced people to use the Marriott’s WiFi network.
