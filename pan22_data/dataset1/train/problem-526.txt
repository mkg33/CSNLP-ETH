First, make sure "storage drive" is in /etc/fstab and mounted at a consistent place each time (I put mine at /storage ...).
Then open a console-only VT session (be sure you are NOT logged into a desktop GUI session) and move your ~/Downloads, etc to /storage/youruser.  You may need to fix permissions and/or ownership on the mount.  
Once the files are on /storage, and your user can access them (read, write, create, delete) then use a link to get them back under your /home/username directory.  To do this, go to your user's home directory (simply type cd and hit enter), and then make symlinks to each directory, for example 
Note that trailing . on the end of the last command - it means "put it here in my current directory".  
I am dual booting Ubunto 18.04 and Windows 10 on a 2 disk set up that looks like this:
I have my OS's on one drive and then a second drive for storage of my files. I already changed the default directories on the windows side so that downloads, music, documents etc. save to Hard Drive B. Now I am just trying to accomplish the same thing on the ubuntu side. So I navigated to the .config file in the home directory and edited user-dirs.dirs to accommodate my design. This is the change I made:
where "user" is my username, "Shared" is the name of hard drive B, and (Music, Desktop, etc) are the names of the respective folders on that drive. I basically just navigated to each folder and coppied the location. My issue is whenever I restart my pc for it to take affect, it changes to this:
instead of changing to the correct location, it defaults everything to home, so my desktop becomes the home directory. Where did I go wrong?
