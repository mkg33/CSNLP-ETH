To achieve a video stream between the Pi and your mobile phone will require a reasonable bandwidth for data.  As such, a good network connection will be required.  For Pi <--> phone connection, there are two choices ... WiFi and Bluetooth.  To the best of my knowledge, Bluetooth won't have the bandwidth that you need.  So let us focus on WiFi.  If your phone can be a WiFi hotspot, then you can enable that and configured your Pi to join your phone's WiFi hotspot environment.  At that point, the Pi and the phone will be part of a local area network and TCP/IP connections between the two will be possible.
If your phone can't be a hotspot or you wish to investigate an alternative, the Pi itself can be a hotspot using the "hostapd" technology.  At that point, your phone could join the WiFi network exposed by the Pi.  In both cases, the Pi and the phone will be able to form TCP/IP connections.  From there, the next challenge will be to find a suitable software package that would allow video streaming from the Pi to the phone.  It is possible the "motion" application running on the Pi might be able to do what you need.
I want to get access to raspberry pi through my mobile. I want to shoot video from raspberry pi camera and get live stream on my mobile through wifi. There is various methods available to get stream from web browser but i don't want that i want to connect peer-to-peer from Rpi and mobile..
