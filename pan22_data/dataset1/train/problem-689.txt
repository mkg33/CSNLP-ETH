It seems that the grid lines in Tiled are 64px, not 32. If you look at the top-left 'thing', it occupies 128px according to Gimp (and therefore takes up 4 grid spaces across, as expected). However, in Tiled it only uses up 2 grid spaces across. This leads me to believe that actually, the Tiled map editor uses a 64px by 64px grid, not a 32x32 one.
I have been working with Tiled and Cocos2d lately but am having problems understanding how Im suppose to be doing the maps.
Tiled is not an image editor, so I create my tileset in Gimp.  However it seems impossible for me to get grid lines that are the same as Tiled and so I dont know prior to importing the image (into Tiled) where the grid lines will be.
See the image below.  Both Tiled and Gimp's grid lines are set to 32px however the grid lines are nothing alike between the two programs
How can I get the grid lines to match so that I can draw stuff knowing how many tiles it will take.  Is there a better program for creating tileset or another way to do it?
