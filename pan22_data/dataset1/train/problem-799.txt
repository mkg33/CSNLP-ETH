The suggested ideas above are a good start for troubleshooting. In the meantime, you may be able to re-establish the connection without restarting if you type ipconfig -renew into the command prompt. That will renew your DHCP lease and perhaps restart the connection successfully.
Try ping your router ip address with "ping 192.168.2.1" command
If the ping packets go thru, your physical network connection is ok.  Check the DNS server address.  Compare that address with DNS find in other working computer.
If DNS is ok, check the route with "route -n" command, make sure the default gateway is correct and netmask is correct.
You can log all these info when the system is working and compare them to when it is not working.  From that, you can investigate more on what cause the failure.
You can see this issue if there is another system in the network with the same ip or mac address.   You should not see any same mac address problem unless you are in a environment with a lot testing boards or pre-production unconfigured systems.
