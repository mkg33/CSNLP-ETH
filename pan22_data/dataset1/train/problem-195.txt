I also recommend the diskless PXE boot, but as an alternative, you could easily backup one system and then just restore it to all 40 in this situation.  That would be faster than reinstalling 40 times.
I serve 40 fixed installed terminals (with touch screen, no mouse nor keyboard connected) in an environment. These 40 PC's all have a slimmed version of Ubuntu and Chromium installed, as their only purpose is to serve a web applicaton in fullscreen mode.
Now, here's the problem: a few days ago, we had a power failure, all terminals shut down. When I restarted them all again, not a single one's touchscreen worked, I have no clue why. However, reinstalling the system with a CloneZilla flash drive, that solved the issue. Which was a lot of work -- connecting keyboard & flash drive, change BIOS settings to boot from the flash drive, reinstall all 40 terminals.
How can this be done in a better way? My dream scenario would be to deply one change (let's say I'd like to have a small NodeJs server on every terminal as well, or configure SSH access). I looked into running a PXE servers, but that does apparently take A LOT of time (800 MB image x 40 takes quite some time to download).
Does anyone have a better solution on how this setup can be maintained in a better way?
