You say you are pinging the switch? Is the switch a managed switch with a dedicated IP address? 
Add an exception for the pings on the firewall (or disable) of the computer that cannot be pinged. Are the computers on the same subnet (check the IP addressing of both systems)? Are there any static routes that are preventing the traversing (from command line run "ROUTE PRINT")? 
Check the firewall settings.  Check to make sure that your laptop is obtaining an address from DHCP (a duplicate address would indicate the problem).
Run ipconfig /all to find out some of this information.
Lastly, grab zenmap (which is a GUI frontend to port scanning tool nmap) and port scan the device to see what's available to you.  Another good tool (other than telnet) I use to test connectivity to a specific TCP port is tcping, which basically tries to connect then disconnects on a specific port.
When programming, did you have to code within a described protocol or is the program/your program just a front end to telnet communication?  If so, please opt for SSH, as telnet will send commands in plain text, and this is always bad and never good.
