CloudFlare is not going to work properly with the nameservers set like that. CloudFlare has to be in positions 1 &2; the other nameservers have to be removed.
"e.g., I have OwnCloud on port 3387), I couldn't access it unless I switched back to GoDaddy name-server."
CloudFlare can only proxy certain web ports. Ports not on web traffic records should be on a subdomain we don't touch in your DNS settings.
I understand what you are trying to do, and I would strongly caution against it. Recursive servers will rotate between the different DNS servers for the zone, and their clients will only get the records that are known by the server they reached. Because of this, your customers will get different answers each time, and the results will be inconsistent. In essence, at any point in time, your customers will experience the equivalent of half your servers being unreachable at all. If you have your DNS served by two providers, you will either need to ensure that you manually keep the zones synchronized (this is error-prone, and you will cause an outage) or you will need to subordinate all the servers except one, put all your records in that one Master server, configure all the others as Slave servers, setup AXFR from the Master to all the Slaves, and setup notifications from the Master to all the Slaves.
I was the DNS hostmaster at a Fortune 200 Financial Services firm several years ago, and I have seen setups like you described, to try and prevent a single point failure, only to introduce horrific service-impacting outages that were hard to diagnose.
