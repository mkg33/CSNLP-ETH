I would argue it's a possibility. From personal experience, both Chrome and YouTube often seem to be extreme resource hogs.
While far from a perfect solution, you might want to look into playing YouTube videos through a media application instead, such as mpv with youtube-dl. For that particular combination, you would grab a copy of mpv and then place a compiled (.exe) copy of youtube-dl in the root folder of your mpv directory. You could then feed mpv YouTube URLs to play.
As small drawbacks, video playback would still depend on the power of your rig and you wouldn't have the same suite of controls for selecting videos. But it might help the crashing issue.
As side notes, youtube-dl downloads videos so they could technically be played locally with any media player under the right circumstances. Also, some other media players like VLC have support for streaming URLs such as YouTube, but YouTube uses a couple of different methods to deliver video, and  programs like VLC may not support those playback methods for particular video (so some URLs may work and others may not).
