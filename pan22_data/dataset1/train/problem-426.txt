I can't get to install the proprietary driver "fglrx" with ATI Radeon HD 5970 on Debian Squeeze.
After the installation with ATI Catalyst 12-8 and a reboot, from the stage of GDM, the screen is freezing with a lot of little squares appearing on X, mouse is locking and total freezing of the system. I have tried with old Catalyst versions and same problems.
I would like to install the proprietary fglrx driver because I need to use bi-GPU of this card with OpenCL. With the free radeon driver, I have no problem for X but I don't have GPU support.
I also try with "module-assistant" but the issue is the same.

With free radeon driver, "CLInfo" tool of ATI stream SDK makes only appear CPUs :
Has anyone already got this problem of freezing with the fglrx proprietary driver on Radeon HD 5970 ? Could it be an issue with my screen or with frequencies ?
The fglrx drivers are currently in no state to be called anything but beta drivers. The support is abysmal. However, reinstall them using these methods.
But before you do, make sure you purge the current drivers using:
sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev* xorg-driver-fglrx
This is the only course of action, everyone complains about glitchy graphics, unfortunately there is nothing to be done for the support is minimal from AMD's side.
