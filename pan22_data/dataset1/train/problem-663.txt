There are two possibilities:  Bad Hardware, or bad software - my vote would be a problem with the graphics card and/or driver.
To determine whether or not it's hardware, try booting off a linux live CD - it that can run for a while, including sleeping/restoring, then chances are it's software.  If it's hardware, then the live CD might exhibit the same problems - I say might, because I had one MB where everything was fine if I used the generic drivers, but as soon as I installed the nvidia drivers, the machine would lock up randomly, and I'm not sure that you can use a live CD with non-free drivers.
Assuming that it's a problem with the video card, the other option would be to try installing a different driver set.
One final thing to try would be installing utilities to monitor the various temperatures - on my machine, I can monitor CPU, GPU, and a few others - if something is causing a component to overheat, that could lead to failures and random lockups.
Judging by the history of the computer and that it is only so old, I would consider the warranty of the computer. Skimming the original post, I'm not sure if it is a notebook or desktop, but in these types of situations, returning it or even calling Acer technical support might be best. If you want to look further into it, I would check the logs that Windows produces: 
Start>type "eventvwr", then on the left hand side, open Windows Logs, and double-click on System or Application and have a look through there. 
I have seen Windows installations go bad from an image that OEMs use, particularly one the size of Acer. As well as checking logs, run a manufacturers harddisk drive tester such as Western Digital or Seagate (one of many) depending on your harddisk drive manufacturer. 
Also try running a RAM test available from http://www.memtest.org/ which you burn the ISO to a cd and boot from it.
I suggest running both overnight, particularly the Memtest, to let it do more than 100 passes to ensure the RAM isn't defective
