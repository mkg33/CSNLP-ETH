I have had a good experience with Bohemia Interactive's ArmA II. Very good support by both the creators and the community. Scripting is particularly well thought-out, with a built-in mission editor that live-reloads your scripts.
I found the vanilla game itself a bit off-putting, though. I feel this is an important aspect to consider when choosing a game to mod. It's easier to create a fun mod when starting with a fun game.
Modding is dead. Don't misinterpret that - modding was originally introduced as a way for people to experiment with virtual worlds without creating them entirely from scratch; many assets made for them, most common game code already in place.
We can now get most of that in free programs entirely built for that purpose, without bothering to having a $50 game surrounding it. Unity3D, Unreal Development Kit, and CryEngine 3 are all examples of open-to-use engines that come with some basic assets, a physics engine, and a number of useful developer tools that don't necessarily need you to program. So when I say "modding is dead", all I mean is that those hobbyists called modders can now just pick a free engine and call themselves "game developers".
Unity supports C# directly. UDK uses its own scripting language, UnrealScript, which I believe is similar to Java in some ways.
