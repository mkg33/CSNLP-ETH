CPU speed prioritization is fully dynamic, as for memory - that is a good question. I suggest the following: ESXi 5, the hypervisor, is free - for one host machine, up to 32GB RAM. A bunch of modules are disabled with the free license, but before activating the free license it installs as a full package in 60 day trial.

Give it a go on your test machine, I've got 3 GB RAM here on a dual core and it's enough to install a couple virtual appliances. Even better: I've got VMWare Workstation trial running, with a virtual machine, assigned 2 GB RAM and 2 cores to it, and installed ESXi 5 on it. You'll get to try out the installation, network configuration, management through the vSphere client and you can play with virtual machines within a virtual machine. What more could anyone possibly want! :)
I am in the planning stages of installing esxi 5 to host about 5 guest os's (identical CentOS 5 images). I want them to have separate data allocation (seperate virtual disks)  but I want them to be able to dynamically share resources (memory,cpu), with 1 VM having a higher priority over the other 4 VM.
I've been reading the documentation and it looks like this is possible to do. How are resources shared dynamically? Wouldn't the guest OS need to be rebooted in order for new ram/cpu to be added/removed from a particular VM? Logistically I'm not sure how the OS can play nice with this.
Also, how would I structure my resource pool(s) for this to work?
