I think you will need some sort of data recovery tool. I know StackOverflow purpose isn't about software advising, but i have to recommend R-Studio. Have used it a couple of times with good results. Sometimes you can even see the folder structure and retrieve those files.
It's possible the enclosure circuitry has failed, so I'd suggest taking it apart and extracting the HD/SSD.  You can try attaching it internally to a desktop computer temporarily to see if the drive is visible that way.
There's also the long-shot of replacing the controller board on the drive with an exact same model drive, since that could be what's bad.  Sometimes, though, the board is matched to the physical drive due to latency calibration.
If this fails, you're looking at taking it to a professional for recovery, and they may suggest sending it to a forensic recovery company.
I've been able to recover some hard drives, but it was few and far between.  I don't even remember the software I used or if it's still available.  Maybe someone else can answer with that info.
