Backup/Restore is the right process to use. You are getting the error because you are trying to restore over a DB that already exists.
As in any scenario, be sure that overwriting the DB is what you want to do. Three ways of doing this are:
Backup and restore are the simplest/safest ways to do this. There are a couple of things that you need to watch out for, or you'll get errors like the one you're seeing now.
The restore GUI tool in Management Studio supports both of these options.
To specify the name of the database you want to restore as, go to the "General" page, and enter the correct name in the "Database" field (under the "Destination" subhead).
To specify where you want the database files to be restored to, go to the "Files" page, and specify the new paths in the "Restore As" column.
If you're overwriting an existing database, you'll need to go to the "Options" tab and check the "Overwrite the existing database" option.
If this is a procedure you plan to repeat regularly, you can generate a script for the RESTORE command by clicking the "Script" button on the Restore Database window toolbar.
