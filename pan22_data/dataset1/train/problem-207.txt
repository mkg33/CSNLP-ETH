No, not from mere signal strength. There are many reasons this won't work.
The most obvious problem: That won't describe a unique location. For example, if the signal strength was the same at both receivers, that at best means that the source is equidistant from both devices. But that describes a line, not a point.
The second most obvious problem: Devices don't emit equally in all directions. So even if the signal strength is the same at both receivers, that doesn't actually even mean they're the same distance from the source.
I've been rolling this around in my head for a while, and I know there are a lot of variables that can effect this, but....
If I have two wifi receivers that I set in monitor mode, that will log packets (pings for all practical purposes), tx mac IDs, packet IDs, and the signal strength, should I be able to derive the direction of the transmitter?
Ok, so dumb this up a little and pretend it's a perfect test environment, no obstructions, and everything is on the same plain. Is there a formula to compare wifi signal strengths from control points and say, "This one had this strength, and this one had that strength, we're looking for a source bearing 45 Degrees from the line between our receivers"?
Like I said, I know there are a TON of potential obstructions that can effect signal strength, so assume a perfect testing environment. I'm also thinking that since I'm not looking at signal strength as a measure of distance, they break down, as long as it's line of sight, should break down at the same pace for each receiver so comparing the two strengths against each other might be more accurate than estimating distance. That's my thought atleast.
