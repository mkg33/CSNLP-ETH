What your effectively after is a mail relay, which you can do with most email servers. You setup the relay to accept mail without authentication, then configure it to forward on mail to a smarthost, in this case your real mail server, with the correct credentials.
By doing this however, your new relay, becomes an open relay, and is open to spam use if its open to the outside world, so you may have to lock it down to only accept email from certain IP's. If your doing this, then you may want to instead look at getting your real mail server to accept mail without authentication from certain IP's. You can do this with Exchange and I'm sure many other mail servers will do this.
Now if you don't have access to the mailserver then that's not an option, and the additional relay is probably needed.
Configure a lightweight mail server somewhere (preferably with its own local UPS if this is an important UPS that it's monitoring) that accepts mail only from the MGE (possibly via a direct ethernet cable) and then forwards it on to the real mail server.
