RAID1: You have to cut your total drive size in half
RAID5: You lose one drive's worth of space, and need at least 3 drives.  You will need to wait for the drive to rebuild if you replace a bad drive, and during a rebuild, if you lose a second drive, you will lose your data
You can also combine RAID configs to achieve different setups (RAID10, RAID50)
All being said, if you are looking for speed, but don't care about losing data, go RAID0, if you are looking to have a backup drive incase one goes down, go RAID1.  RAID5 is good if you want some speed, and to have a backup incase on drive goes.
One thing to remember: RAID is never a backup solution
Raid is NOT a backup solution.  It's a redundancy solution (or a performance enhancement solution if you're using it for striping).  A large number of disk failures are due to environmental factors (excessive heat, etc) so assuming you can use it instead of decent back ups is not a safe bet.  
If you have a RAID setup looking for a performance boost go with RAID 0 for striping.  If you're doing it for backups, drop RAID and find a good online backup service.
