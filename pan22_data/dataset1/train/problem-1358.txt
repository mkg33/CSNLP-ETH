I have a small Dell GX260 machine that I have been using for testing purposes. And very often during one of my experiments on the machine I mess it up so I have to re-install Windows XP on it.
So I thought of if I could get the machine into a virtual-pc environment I could mess it up as many time as I like and then just do "Discard Changes" and start over again. 
Any thoughts and ideas on how to move the Dell PC into Virtual PC ?
Microsoft provides a tool to prepare installation images for OEMs, called "sysprep". You can use this to migrate virtual machines to "real" machines and vice versa. 
Putting it very simply, the "magic" here is that the tool sets windows to re-detect all hardware on the next boot, so if you transfer the OS before the next boot windows will adjust itself to the new environment.
1) Run the sysprep tool on the machine you want to migrate, and select "reseal". The machine shuts down.
2) Boot the machine with a bootable image tool like ghost or clonezilla, and make an image of the "sealed" OS partition.
3) Boot the image tool on the machine you want to migrate the image on to, and restore the sealed image there. 
4) Boot the new machine normally, and wait while windows detects all the new hardware etc.
