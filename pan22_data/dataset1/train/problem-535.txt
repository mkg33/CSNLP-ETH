As a reference point, this is the work of the ASPRox bot SQL Injection attack. It seems to surface it self now and then because it gets pretty viral when compromised systems are found. You can Google around for "ASPRox bot" and get some additional cleansing methods and further prevention treatments. I just found this PDF file that has a nice overview on its tactics and links to some cleanup options.
The problem is that virus/injection model essentially took every single text field in ALL your database tables and put in a little snippet that calls out to the URL specified to attempt to infect any other web clients and attempt to make them zombies that visit your site.
So make sure to check all databases on that server in question, not just the one with the database involved to do a proper cleansing. 
It appears you're on the right path with the suggestions here, but having some "formal" references to the virus name might help with additional needs.
You also need to assume that this hacker now has a copy of all the data in your DB.  If that includes personal information then you should notify the people in question.
