I can't find the KHX1866C10D3/4G RAM on the supported RAM list for your ASUS M5A97 R2.0 motherboard. This may cause stability issues.
The AMD FX 8350 only runs at 4GHz, so lower the speed and look if the PC is stable again.
I am getting several bluescreens in windows that all seem to be memory related such as SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION and irql_not_less_or_equal.  I checked the minidump with bluescreenview and it appears that the common denominator between all of these crashes is ntoskrnl.exe (the last 10 crashes have all been caused by this).  here are the 2 latest dump files: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1aouW88E8jBUFd4cWJNOUM0YmM&usp=sharing
I am starting to suspect hardware fault though as I reinstalled windows to no effect and sometimes, instead of bluescreening, the computer simply shuts off, immediately and without warning.  
Turns out that one of the ram slots in my motherboard, when filled,causes this error.  Not sure why but for now I am just using 12gb of ram.  Thanks for all of your help!
