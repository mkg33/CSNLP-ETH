You probably want the -f command line option (meaning “stay in foreground”; see :help -f). You can usually incorporate it directly into your EDITOR value (or that of VISUAL, GIT_EDITOR, or Git’s core.editor, etc.):
This option is not specific to mvim; it should also work with gvim (i.e. any GUI vim).
A long time ago, before I switched to vims, I used an editor for OS X known as TextMate. (Anyone remember that? ;)
Its command-line binary, mate, allowed for a mate -w flag, which would block the command-line binary exiting until the file was saved, and closed. This allowed for using mate -w as the editor for git commit-messages and similar.
Trying to do similar with MacVim (or gVim) doesn't work out; as the mvim helper closes as soon as MacVim is launched (or as soon as the file is opened). This results in a “your message was empty,” or similar other error, from whichever program invoked the $EDITOR: as far as the program knows, the ‘editor’ (the mvim helper-binary) has exited, but the file it's provided to edit is still empty.
Is there some command, configuration setting, or hack that I could use to ensure the command-line mvim helper (or whatever alternative alias or script you come up with for me) doesn't exit until the opened files have been saved and closed in MacVim?
