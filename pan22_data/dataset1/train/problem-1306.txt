Immediately I'd ask if there's any specific style guide that allows
these vastly different names, otherwise I'd suggest following IDE hints
and/or a linter and rename the variables and methods to be more
Also, "stuff" is not a great name for anything ... what stuff are we
talking about?  In fact the first line of CreateStuff already shows
that there's a better name, tableName for the parameter, probably
createTable for the method.  yrmnth is especially bad too, three
vowels saved from yearMonth and in the process made the name
Seems like the spark session is created twice and the comment even says
so - I'd suggest passing the variable into the method, that's fairly
straightforward by either passing it as a parameter, or extending App
The SQL queries are created by concatenating strings and there's usually
columnCount is unused, selectColumns2 has 2 as the suffix, even
though there's no 1, that can just be selectColumns.
The loop for columnStack could be in its own method so it's a little
small section that could be tested on its own too, returning what is now
collist, formatColumnsList(columns: Seq[String]): String perhaps.
Again, if a query builder could do all this it would be a bit cleaner
The construction for yrmnth is pretty convoluted for what it does, I'd
That would require a recent Java for java.time.LocalDateTime and
java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter.  But even without there should be
better ways.  If everything fails the whole section should at least be
in its own method, e.g. formatDate(calendar Calendar): String.
The bottom part of unPivotDF uses a temporary table - is that the best
way to go, or could the data be inserted directly?
tablename doesn't need to be a var, it's never mutated, and it appears to be totally unneeded. Use the method's passed parameter directly.
column_stack is also unneeded. You can go directly from selectColumns2 to collist without an intermediate variable or dropRight() adjustments.
