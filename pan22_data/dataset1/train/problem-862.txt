I think calling those functions work and sleep is confusing. sleep doesn't actually "sleep" anything, it's asking for the number of hours slept. I would change the names to something like ask_sleep_time to make it clearer what the purpose is.
sleep will also cause conflicts if you happen to do from time import sleep in the future.
And I completely agree with @Graipher's ask_time function. That is what immediately jumped into my head when I saw your sleep and work functions. They have two big problems.
For the second point, why are the functions subtracting from time? This means that you have them doing two jobs.
In this particular case this isn't a huge deal, but it should be kept in mind. When you start writing larger, more complicated functions, you need to make sure you don't have single functions doing multiple, unrelated tasks when possible. Such functions make testing harder and code more difficult to understand.
I also disagree with the name time. 1. time is the name of a standard python module. You don't want to run into conflicts with it, or allow for confusion. I think it would make more sense to have a hours_in_day = 24 variable, then do something like:
