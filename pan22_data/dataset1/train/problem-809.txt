From my Windows 7 PC, I want to check to see who is “actively” logged on to another Windows 7 PC on my network, not who connected last.  How can this be done?
Throughout the day several people will remotely logon to a shared computer, generally logging off when they are through.  Note, these users have Admin rights on both, their PC and the one they remote into.  If I logon while someone else is actively logged on, I’m given the option to continue on and make myself the “active” user, thus placing the former active account into a disconnected state.  It would be nice to have the ability to see who is actively logged on before making this choice.
I have searched the web and found various solutions that let you know who made the last connection, which does not translate into them being the last, or currently "active" user.
On a side note, it seems weird in Windows 7 that the current, active user's ID is displayed 'after' I click 'Yes' to login over them.  When we were using Windows XP, one could see the ID of the current active user 'before' deciding to continue logging on.
Another option from the Windows 7 or higher command line:
You may be prompted for admin-level credentials if querying a remote machine.
This will see if explorer.exe is running on a machine, and "/v" provides the username.  If a machine is not logged in, no explorer.exe process will be running.  If someone is logged on, the explorer.exe process runs in the context of that user.
