Qtpfsgui is simple, free, open source and cross platform.
If you are looking for something simple on the Mac that even your mum can use, then I would say iPhoto is the way to go. Not only is it simple to use, but it is fully integrated into all the iLife applications. 
But I ask the question, what is the reason that you are using raw?
As a photographer myself, I only really ever use raw for select images or a photoshoot where I need the extra editing ability that raw gives.
Most of the time I shoot in jpeg as it saves space and white balancing time.
For someone that has little experience with editing or photography, I don't see much point to shooting in raw.
As for converting on the fly, I rarely have need to do this, but it is quite easy to export your photos in batches within iPhoto. 
I am using Aperture (though iPhoto is used for the fun 'happy snaps') as I like how the files are stored and the ease of back ups that the programs give. Plus they have the apple feel that I personally like.
