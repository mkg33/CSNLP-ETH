I whole-heartedly concur with what Jeremy said. Photo management software makes such tedious workflows so much easier it's ridiculous! My personal favourite has to be Downloader Pro.
I started off rolling my own batch-based solution (as you are contemplating), but as it slowly grew more complex and I switched languages more than once, I grew tired of reinventing the wheel. After a bit of looking around I found this and have been using it ever since. So what I'm saying is, scripting a basic solution is most definitely possible, but if you do this on a regular basis and want to save time, you know what to do. :)
You should be able to do this in any scripting language, with a little effort.
As for a program, there are lots of photo management programs, eg Lightroom. These give you much better options for managing your photos than simply folders of the date they were taken. Consider this: in a few months time, when you want to find photos again, and you want to get the photo you took of the Golden Gate Bridge on your visit to San Fransisco, are you going to remember that you took it on 20120514, or would it be easier to look for /Trips/SanFransisco ? Or search for a tag you have added, "bridge" or "goldengate"? If you do know the date taken, because the files still have the Date Created, you can still search or sort by Date Created, so that you can also find them that way. But if you organise the folders by date, that is the only option you have to find your pic...
