You can't update a snapshot. You have to update the existing AMI, and take a new snapshot, then register it which will give you a new AMI ID.
I assume your instances are behind an AutoScaler? If so, then you have to update your Launch configuration with your new AMI ID.
The easiest way of managing this I find is using Asgard from Netflix
If you are using CloudFormation then you can just update your template and CloudFormation will create the new Launch Configs for you and update the Auto Scaler.
If you just launch your instances manually, then use the new AMI ID when doing so.
I have an AMI that I use for my rails web servers. This AMI using an EBS Snapshot to launch with the basics all ready for production. 
I now need to update some configuration settings on web servers (nginx.conf). I can easily ssh into a box and update the settings but then future launched instances don't have the settings as they use an older snapshot.
How do I go about making it so that new ec2 instances launch with the new settings. I'm guessing I need to update the snapshot? How do I go about updating the snapshot which all the web server ec2 instances use?
