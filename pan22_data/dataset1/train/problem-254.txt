Somebody has already asked pretty much the same question at How can I determine if an application is not responding? (determining which processes are not responding is the hard part, killing them is quite easy). I've quoted a relevant answer here:
Thus, it's not exactly possible to determine which programs are not responding, at least not without heavily resorting on AppleScript/X11 logic.
If you're curious, this little snippet of AppleScript (made for Mavericks, probably won't work on anything else) was also posted on the linked thread and basically identifies all non-responding programs and then sends a KILL signal to them:
However, if you've identified an application that is acting up, you can kill all instances of it with sudo killall [AppName], e.g. sudo killall "Activity Monitor". You can identify the PID of individual apps with pgrep [AppName], e.g. pgrep "Google Chrome", and you can kill any of the resulting PIDs with kill [PID].
A little late to the party but I've written a terminal application that will do this for you. It bypasses the need for UI scripting the Activity Monitor and instead uses a spindump report to determine the unresponsive processes and auto-terminates them for you.
