i don't know how you can do it without any sort of functional computer, but i would download a version of Vista off the internet. 
You have a valid key (presumably the sticker stuck to your case), you just need the media. The trick would be to finding the version that matches your keys version (Vista RTM, OEM, SP1, etc).
At the very least it will be enough to let you get online and harass HP for replacement recovery DVDs - an unlicensed version of Windows will run for 2 weeks before shutting down.
But your trick is to get ahold of an operating system in the first place. You can't really download Ubuntu when you don't have a computer to get on the internet with.
First, test your Ram and Hard drive, rule out hardware problems
