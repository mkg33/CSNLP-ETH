I've been having this weird problem with my Apple TV when streaming audio. It will randomly stop working. Usually when that happens, it will duplicate itself in the device list on all devices we have here. It goes from "Apple TV" to "Apple TV" AND "Apple TV (2)". I can't figure out what happens that makes it go back to only one device.
I noticed that often it will stop working shortly after the iPhone or iPad goes into sleep mode, but sometimes I still have it on and the same error happens. 
Haven't found much info online about this. Tried a different router and am hitting the same problems. Do you have any idea what could it be?
Apple TV A1427 - AppleTV3,1 - iOS 7.0.2 (Ethernet, HDMI to TV, Optical from TV to Amp)
Did these problems coincide with the release of OS X 10.10? Yosemite has some known problems with Bonjour and discovery, due to replacing their entire DNS codebase with a new tool called discoveryd.

Their "fix" is only for the exceptionally brave/foolhardy.
