It isn't a bad decision, if you know why you did it, and understand what you have done.
Just by changing the third octet does not mean that each IP address is in a different subnet - the subnet for each individual host matters!  So if each of your IP videocameras had subnets of 255.255.255.0, they would all be on different subnets, and require routing (not necesarily separate routers) to talk to other subnets, including the "parent" one.  However, you could create a route to all of them using the 10.10.0.0/255.255.0.0 subnet, if that was appropriate.
Doing things in that way can be beneficial as it means the routing tables are smaller, using less memory on your routers.
However, it can also be confusing to inexperienced network admins - there seem to be plenty around that don't really understand subnets.
It might be wiser to create smaller subnets, as I doubt you'll ever actually be deploying the 65,534 possible hosts you could have on the 10.10.0.0/255.255.0.0 subnet.  Getting subnet design right before you start deploying anything is a good idea - once things are out there in large numbers it is a bigger task to fix mistakes!
Measure many times, cut once!  Read up on subnet design.
Generally subnets are created for the following reasons(singularly or combination):
A good rule of thumb (as long as it is not in violation of the above) that I use is:
Take the largest number of hosts I think the network will ever have and multiply it by 4.  Pick the /CIDR based on that number.  So if I had a network that was 15, I would use 60 as the number of hosts.  I would use a /26 for the network.  
I do not do this for obvious cases, such as point-to-point links, where each of the two interfaces require an IP address.
