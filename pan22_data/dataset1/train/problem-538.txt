There's a problem initializing the shared memory that is needed by the workers. 
Check whether the directory /etc/httpd/logs/ exists and is writable by the user that's running the tomcat instance. If it isn't, either change the permissions on the directory, or create a separate directory to keep the shm files in. (I'd recommend the latter, simply because it's not a good idea to keep important state in the same place as your logs, for several reasons.)
If the directory does exist and is writable, check whether you've got SELinux on and if so whether there are any permissions issues with it. You could always try to set it to permissive to see whether the problem disappears; if so, it's time to fix the permissions and turn it back on.

1) I am trying to monitor the mod_jk status page; but it is giving 404 error.
