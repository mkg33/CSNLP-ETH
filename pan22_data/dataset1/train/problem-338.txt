It could be that it is not getting an ip from your routers DHCP server for a lot of reasons, the most likely being that your router has been configured to use static IPS only. But because almost every commercial router has a built in DHCP server that is on by default. And the Pi will request a DHCP ip by default, I believe that the problem lies in the Pi, if possible you should connect it to a display and see if it boots up properly or if any errors are made visible, you may also look at the activity LEDs on the Pi, the red led should be solid and green and yellow should be either solid or blinking, if only the red led is on then your power source is not supplying the required 1.2 amps and if your Pi has the red led on and green led blinks but then stops after about 5 seconds and never comes back on again with no other LEDs coming on other than red. You have a corrupt as card which may be a hardware incompatibility or you may have incorrectly written the image to the card.
If you cant see it in the DHCP client list in your router then its not getting an ip, so you cant get it it. Either not booted for some reason, not starting the network device, or not on network at all. Gonna need to see it onscreen to know.
