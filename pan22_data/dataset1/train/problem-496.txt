The Runbook Audit History tracks the changes to each activity in a runbook. This includes the user that made the change, the date and time that the change occurred, the activity that was changed, and the current and previous values of any changed properties. The audit history is maintained as long as the runbook exists and cannot be cleared."
"In the Orchestrator Runbook Designer you can also see some auditing information. In the console there is an Audit History tab for each runbook. In the Audit History tab you can see all changes to a runbook, for example who change the name of an activity. Below there is figure that show an example of Audit History information. The information shown in the Audit History tab is a mix of data from two tables in the Orchestrator database, the OBJECT_AUDIT table and the CHECK_IN_HISTORY table."

I am only prompting for the user id for this Runbook. User ID (data type: String)
I need to determine the ID of the Runbook, in order to pull the SID in a later SQL query. Here is the SQL query that returns the Job ID.
Once you have this GUID, you need to strip it of the curly braces. I use the following powershell script to do this:
Once we have the GUID we can now look up the proper Runbook and grab the SID from another SQL table of the user who launched the Runbook:
This will now return the SID of the user account, something like this: S-1-5-21-1855722787-1516450073-351226437-1111
I run the following Powershell script to get the user's ID, email address, etc.
Now you can get all sorts of information from the user that executed the Runbook.
