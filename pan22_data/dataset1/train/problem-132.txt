If you don't have windows 8 installation media use Create Windows 8 media with valid product key only. You can use also Windows 8.1 media creation tool which is available without product key.
You have to create Windows 8/8.1 installation USB/DVD on another working computer.
Boot the created USB/DVD on your computer. If Windows is installed to a GPT disk you have to boot UEFI way - select firmware boot entry that has UEFI in its name - for example "UEFI USB device".
Once booted select Troubleshoot/Repair/Advanced options/Command prompt.
Check that c:\windows or d:\windows exist with command:
dir c:\windows (change drive letter to c,d,e until you find drive with \windows folder)
where N: is drive where you have found \Windows with "dir" command.
Please boot into a Live Operating System based on Linux and backup your files as soon as possible.
You may try using the Windows Installation media to perform recovery but from my experience, Windows won't boot even from the installation media (USB / DVD) as it tries to read your failing Hard drive.
Download Rufus and use it to make the live image of a Linux OS (personally Linux Mint) in a USB drive and boot into the OS.
