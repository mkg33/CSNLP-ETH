Search for GEOIP. you will have ip ranges by provider's countries (key point is here. it's providers country on paper.) Geographic division is actually meanless when we are talking about web. Anyone can have any IP address from anywhere. Also your geoip database must be updated regularly. More over your block list will be a long list. consider that rules will be applied every connection to your system.  
There is another way for this, if you are using linux try fail2ban. for other systems use a firewall distro which most of them has more than fai2ban and IDS / IPS
I don't want to cause any offence here, but whenever I take a look at the logs for my servers I can see I am constantly having IP addresses in China try to login to my machines, hoping to get access brute forcing passwords for administrator or admin or root etc. 
We're based in the UK, and our servers are also in a UK data centre. We have some IPs we use to access the machines for remote desktop, some for the remote KVM consoles on those machine, one for our main switch which is a Cisco SG200 and has a web control panel. Those admin IPs are only ever going to be legitimately accessed from the UK, but I can't always guarantee what IP address it would be from.
We have some virtual machines hosting websites - they run on different IPs in the same range, but those IPs need to be available globally.
Is there some way I can limit access to certain IPs on a geographic basis? Say for example that any IP that is located in the UK can access it, but other countries cannot? Is there something I can do on the Cisco SG200 to achieve this, or is there some other piece of affordable hardware that can sit in front of my switch that could do it?
