Because you have calculated your subnets wrong, and you are trying to use IPs from two different subnets.
Or to put it a different way, if you use a /23 bit mask your starting address for the range, must be the first address for that range.  192.168.1.1 is not a starting address for any network described by a 23 bit mask, because that is just how the math works out.
With a 23 bit mask the valid networks are the following.
In your interface configuration though you seem to have address 192.168.2.35, and gateway 192.168.1.1.  Given that mask your gateway and address are on completely separate subnets.  Of course your broadcast and network address settings are also incorrect.
If you use a 22 bit mask you will get a range that includes 192.168.1.x and 192.168.2.x.  Be warned that your broadcast, and network values are still wrong, they also need to be fixed.
I have a bunch of virtual machines (Ubuntu Server 14.04) hosted on a single real server (Ubuntu Server 14.04 with KVM). The number of virtual machines grow, and I'll soon have more than 254 of them.
