You need to be prepared for multiple levels and kinds of disasters, including a total malicious breach (hackers), and a total loss of all hardware (epic weather).  This will require that you do offload some data to sneaker-net distribution methods (Read that, external storage such as tapes / hard drives), some form of a write-once only solution, or an online backup service (expensive).
Disaster recovery is a different beast than simple replication.  You need to determine this before you decide anything: "How much data can I lose?"  Don't think in terms of Gigabytes, think in terms of TIME.  Can I lose 4 hours worth of data, can I lose a day's?  The method you choose will depend on your answer to that question.  We all want a solution that has zero loss, but that is generally not a feasible investment for the risk that is being mitigated.  You'll also need to keep copies of your monthly / annual backups for a good while, as you can also have disasters occur (users delete crap they need) that you are unaware of for an extremely long time.
Veeam and other backup products using snapshots go against VMware best practices to not do them that often.  It will bring the servers to its knees and almost unresponsive. Imagine 50 servers doing 15 minutes snapshots, 1200 snapshots in a day? Hard to manage, lot of storage.  A CDP technology like Zerto solves this for VMware and Hyper-V.
