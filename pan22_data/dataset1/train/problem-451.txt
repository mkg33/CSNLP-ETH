I'm using Microsoft's official Remote Desktop client for macOS to connect to a machine that runs Windows 10. On both my Mac and this Windows machine, I use a physically American QWERTY keyboard with the Canadian Multilingual Standard keyboard layout.
On Windows, the physical key `~ maps to a /. ⇧+/ does a \, and AltGr+/ does a |. This is a very important key for a developer, especially on Windows.
On macOS, this key maps to ù. You do a forward slash with Alt+é, a backslash with Alt+ù and a pipe with Alt+-.
My problem is that when connecting to the Windows machine, Windows recognizes the `~ key as a ù key instead of a /, but none of the key combinations that I use on macOS to produce slashes and pipes work. There seems to be no way, using this keyboard layout, to produce these characters from my Mac's keyboard.
Is there a way that I can make the keyboard work like it does on either macOS or Windows but not a strange hybrid of the two?
There are some nice fixes in the new RDC Mac beta - though not for all mappings, some of the remaps they have set up are really quite useful.  
[Personal opinion, I find it considerably better than the current release for many reasons.]
