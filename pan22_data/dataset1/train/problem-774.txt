but if  size*size>255 then you need to upgrade the indicesList to contain a short or int, otherwise they just won't fit.
I recall reading this: alternative method (there a few) for terrain assignment; I suggest you review and adopt this approach instead of your initial attempts. This approach differs from with your method in that the example uses an existing greyscale bitmap as the heightfield and reads the image-data to assign the elevation of the 'hills.'  
However, this difference is easily replaced with your method for sinusoidal calculation of the heightfield.  In the author's code, the block where the imagedata is retrieved and assigned into the terrain matrix looks like this:
You should replace the middle assignment expression terrain[x][z][1] = with your sine-map instead of the imagedata call so it looks like this:
terrain[x][z][1] = float(sin(myradians*(z*MAP_Z+x)))*MAP_SCALE; 
so that the sin() function operates correctly in radians.
After that change to the codeproject example, I think you will be able to render a hilly terrain. Then you can make adjustments to the single line to vary the magnitude and offset of the sine-wave.
