You can't, as far as I know. Modifying a running kernel takes something like Ksplice (which I'm pretty sure doesn't exist for Windows, or people wouldn't complain so much about rebooting for updates). You could, however, use something like SDelete to delete any sensitive files and then zero the free space.
However, if you just want to wipe the memory (and it's a standard x86 machine), you could put DBAN on a USB stick and run that.
EDIT: noticed you said no USB input - you will have to find some way to boot a different OS if you want to securely erase the entire system.
Since you mentioned this is a Windows 8 machine, you should be able to do this:
You will have to logon, however you will be booted from an in-memory recovery version of Windows.
You should then be able to select the windows volume and delete it.  Note -- there is no way of going back from this if you change your mind.
There may be a more non-destructive way to do this too... like perhaps resetting the PC to factory settings, which should be an option under the 'Update and Recovery' settings.
