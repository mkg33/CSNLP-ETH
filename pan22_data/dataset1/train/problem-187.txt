Yes, pressuring your ISP to not suck is the preferred option.  RIR allocation policies assume that the ISP is giving each customer a /48; there is absolutely zero reason for the ISP to not do that.
IPv6 is not a fan of smaller subnets, however the only thing that is supposed to break, that I'm aware of, is SLAAC.  You'll have problems with bugs and assumptions in some IPv6 stacks, which just blindly assume "/64 == subnet", but that's a bug, not a feature, and you can beat up on the vendor to fix it.  Whether it gets fixed before your ISP gives you a /48, on the other hand...
In IPv6, you are not supposed to subnet to anything smaller than a /64 (RFC 5375). Among other things, SLAAC does not work with smaller subnets, and apparently also some other features will break.
What are the workarounds for situations where ISPs will only give you a single /64 but you need multiple subnets internally? The common advice seems to be to just find another ISP who will hand out a /56 or /48. In some parts of the world, that may work, but in our area (USA), that's not feasible due to a lack of competition. Most of my clients are lucky if they have a single ISP serving their area. Many people here are still on dial-up.
My clients won't qualify for their own /48 from ARIN.
