I would like to use Windows File Audit to monitor access to a set of files on my system (i.e. event 4663).  I noticed that most of the events generated is noise from a few processes.  I would like a way to effectively blacklist these processes, e.g. don't log an event if the file access was from the local AV process.  Can't seem to find any documentation on configuring this and I'm starting to fear that it is not a supported use case.  
Right click on Custom Views -> Create Custom View.
As you want to filter on a specific value in the event data, we have to create an advanced query, so click on the "XML" tab and use a query like this one:
Note that we have a "Select" (to select everything with EventID 4663 in the Security log), and a "Suppress" to remove events matching the filter.
Now, your custom view will list events with ID 4663 if they don't match the Suppress filter.
