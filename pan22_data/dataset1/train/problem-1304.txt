If you go to Internet Options / Security Tab / Internet / Custom button, then scroll down to the Miscellaneous section, you will find several entries that control the JavaScript engine in IE8.
You might compare them on your computer with these on a computer on which this works.
If with this you don't find the problem, you can also do the same with
gpedit.msc / Local computer policy / Computer Configuration / Administrative Templates / Windows Components / Internet Explorer.
You can here right-click on "Internet Explorer" and Export all the settings to a text file, which will help in comparing them between the two computers.
You could try to verify the IE8 installation by using the Microsoft tool found in:
How to solve Internet Explorer 8 installation problems.
This article contains a Fix It button that does general troubleshooting for IE8.
Even if this immediately fixes your problem, you should still reboot and check again. If the problem has returned, then this is probably a GPO problem.
In addition, I found an interesting thread that may apply:
