Antennas are just passive chunks of metal. Your Superpass device is much more than an antenna. It's a USB Wi-Fi NIC, with either a built-in (on the same circuit board) or external (not on the same circuit board, but in the same enclosure) high power amplifier, and then an antenna.
Since you've seen inside this box and I haven't, you'll have to tell me whether or not the amplifier was part of the card that fell out, or if there's still a powered amplifier inside the enclosure, that the old Wi-Fi card fed into. 
If there's still an amp in there, you need to look up the specifications for that amp and feed it signals within its specified input levels so it can amplify them without clipping or distorting. If it was designed to take a 1mW input and amplify it to 1000mW, it probably can't handle a 6000mW input. 
But if all that's left in the box is a passive antenna ("just a chunk of metal"), you're not going to cause it any problems by going from 1W to 6W. 
Simply put, if your TX is set too high, the antenna will cause reflection noise for itself - Similar to screaming in a concrete room doesn't make it more easy to understand, as the listener will get a lot of echo as well.
It is recommended to experiment with various values to try to achieve the most signal to noise ratio.
Apart from that, make sure you have the gain set to whatever your antenna is made for, and ofcourse, that the wireless circuitry doesn't fry itself after too much juice being pushed out.
