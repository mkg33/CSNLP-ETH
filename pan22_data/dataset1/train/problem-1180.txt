You're sharing CPU power and RAM over multiple virtual machines. For VM's that are not running at their max, that's not a big deal
You gain the ability to redeploy your server somewhere else in a flash when the hardware breaks down.
You get more bang for your buck when buying server hardware because you're making it do more.
VMware ESXi is completely free and will do a great job. Plus if you want to upgrade later on, it's a very smooth process
The risks for VMware Server are too great!  Server is a hosted virtulization solution, and as such is at the whim of the guest OS.  Even being the VMware fanboy I am. I would rather see you go with a VMware competitor then rely on server.  VMware server is FANTASTIC, but like VMware workstation or virtual server 2005... if the host OS has issues All your VM's have issues.  With Hyper-V/Xen/ESXi all being free... use a real hypervisor!
looks like all your looking for is consolidation, and in the free space their is little difference.  Use the vendor your most comfortable with, but use a real hypervisor.  With bare metal virtulization (from any vendor) I would put the impact at nill.  If anything your app will perform better due to improved flexibility.
