I must point out, however, that DNS provides no mechanism to "redirect" per se any requests; a CNAME defines an alias for another DNS name, but an HTTP server is required to actually "redirect" the browser -- otherwise a user who visits whatever.example.com will see whatever.example.com in their browser address bar still, not example.com as a "redirect" per se would act. The web server also would see whatever.example.com in the request, which may cause issues if you are using virtual hosts.
That caveat out of the way, there's really only two cases where wildcard DNS records may cause issues:
In your case (based on what I've gleaned from your question) I would most likely use a wildcard record along with a web server that provides a 301 redirect to my "proper" address; some DNS providers make this convenient with a "web forwarder", just be aware that technically this is a web server not under your control that is responding to those requests with a 301 redirect. (The phrasing of that may sound scary, but if it's a trusted company it's nothing to worry about, and if it's not a trusted company you shouldn't have your DNS hosted with them at all in the first place!!)
I'm using wildcards for years now and have never had any problems with it. So far I found that a Windows mobile phone in 2003 was the only device that did not handle the wildcard correctly.
IMHO using wildcards is very common today and problems only arise rarely. From the security point of view you get a few additional attack vectors. You may for example refer to "someevilXSScode.yourdomain.com" and still reach the original site. Only a minor issue IMHO.
