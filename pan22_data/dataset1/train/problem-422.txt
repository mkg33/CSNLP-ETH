This was supposed to be an easy one but I ran into an issue here.
I set up the domain and a static IP on the server. The server is connected to a router/AP (which obviously functions as a switch) as well as the client, both are hardwired.
When I try to join the computer via This PC, I get prompted to enter the credentials and then I received the following error: "The following domain either does not exist or could not be contacted"
When I go to a different computer and try to log into the domain from the logon screen. 
I receive the following error: "The security database on the server does not have a computer account for this workstation trust relationship".
I haven't been able to join a single computer to the domain, what am I missing here?
Don't ask me to rejoin the computer to the domain because I haven't been able to join anything at all
ISP DNS is being query'd and not your DNS server regardless if you input your static IP in preferred DNS in TCP settings.I wrestled with this for a few days before being able to piece together various info on the net. I have built small networks before and this problem had me stumped. The only difference was this network was at home lab. Made sense that it did not work with my Uverse because the options are so limited on my modem. Not sure if you have to contact your ISP Host to make changes, but I just created a host only environment, cutting out the access to the internet and any need to query ISP DNS and the clients connect without a problem. This solved my issue but you may have the need to connect to the internet. If your ISP can not make adjustments, possibly bridge a VM router or use Windows DHCP server to pass traffic.
