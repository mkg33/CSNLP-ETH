You affectively ignore fact that you have a Reserved Instance, it just sits in the background and Amazon will automatically bill you at the lower rate where possible. If you run more instances than you have reserved, the additional will be charged at the higher (on demand) rate.
I'm writing an app and had been paying an hourly rate for my EC2 instance, as I've needed to test. I decided I should just pay for a reserved instance to save money in the long run, but now that I have one, I'm confused about how I'm supposed to manage it. In the "Instances" section of the EC2 management console, I can see the instances that I've launched in the past, and I can stop/start them as I see fit. However, it seems the only way to view my reserved instance is to use the "Reserved Instances" drop-down, but this only seems to let me view them, but nothing else...
So, my question is, how can I do the same thing with my reserved instance(s) that I've been doing with my hourly instance(s)? I basically just want to associate my elastic IP with my reserved instance and install my server image on it.
