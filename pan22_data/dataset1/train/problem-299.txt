Using SpriteBatch is likely going to be the best option.  Passing your batch as an argument to another class' method is generally not going to have any noticeable performance impact.  This is also a very easy way of going about the problem because you can just call batch.draw() on your textures inside the desired method.
Which approach should I use to render my different game parts?
I want to show a background, the main character, a bunch of enemies and an HUD. The playable area will be bigger than the screen so the camera has to move following the main character (top view).
For example, I have the code to generate the map (background) but I don't know how to render it if it's in another class (not the core entry point one).
I can think of calling a custom background.draw() method from my main.render() class and pass a batch to draw onto but probably there are better ways.
I've tried to use Stages (scene2D) aswell but I can't get my camera to move (are they mostly made for UI?).
I'd like to be pointed towards the best solution performance-wise since it's gonna be called every frame :P
