Are there any algorithms to find out which cells in a 2D grid lie inside/is part of a slice of a circle - a pie slice shaped region?
Essentially, as per image below, I need to list out all the green cell coordinates.
At the moment, I am ray casting (using DDA based line interpolation) from the starting red cell, and sweeping across the area in with (arbitrarily chosen) small fixed angle increments, casting multiple rays; but this does not guarantee all cells will be covered.
Your best bet is looking around for "Roguelike Vision Algorithms."  This result seems to have a goodly collection, discussing existing methods--including raycasting--and then suggesting the author's own method.  His algorithm contains more code than I am willing to copy-paste to this answer, but involves treating cells as walls with beveled edges and using some manner of raycasting:
Whether or not you are interested in "shadow casting" (that is, if a cell inside the cone is prevents areas behind it from being "visible") will likely play a large part in determining which method suits your needs.
