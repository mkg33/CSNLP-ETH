I am implementing a solution that requires client certificates.  I'm using IIS 7.5 and ASP.Net 4 WCF services.
I've set the SSL Settings to Require SSL and require client certificates.  Looks good so far.
Because I'm new to the use of client certificates I've been doing a bit of research, and came across a Microsoft support article that attempts to explain a bit about the client certificate validation process.  It states:
Apparently the client will send certificates that both sides trust. What I'm interested in is can I configure IIS or my WCF service to only accept certain client certificates, such as ones we generate from our own certificate authority specifically for the purpose of this WCF service.  
What is to stop someone using a client certificate from VeriSign or use from our certificate authority that were intended for some other purpose?
I believe this link provides the solution you are looking for.  And it appears to be quite detailed.  I am going to try it in the next couple of days and will get back my findings.
