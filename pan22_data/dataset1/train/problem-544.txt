The only suggestion I could give would be to try editing the boot options in boot.ini or using bcdedit.  You might be able to access the boot.ini file using the linux boot, or you can used bcdedit if you have a windows rescue disc.  You can make a windows rescue disc from a working windows machine, preferably the same version of windows that's on the machine that you're working on.  Though, I've never encountered the situation you're describing so I'm not positive you'll be able to fix the problem by changing boot settings/parameters.
Here's a guide on MS website for editing boot options and another for bcdedit.
The boot option for safe mode is "safeboot".  You may have to locate and remove that from the default boot option.
Context: I was trying to fix a computer that was crashing on login, I made it default to booting in safemode to see if it would log in there (it didn't), I got the files off the computer by installing Linux on another partition on the computer (Well, actually, on an external drive, because I was a little nervous about messing with Windows' default partitions), and then, after extracting the files, I made a mistake:
I ran a factory reset. I assumed that booting to safemode was a thing that was true of that windows installation, and not something larger than it. I was, as the computer has informed me more than once now, wrong.
Now, the computer is failing to boot whenever I try to boot the windows environment, pointing out that it can't very well install Windows in safemode.
Does anyone know how I can get this computer's windows (installer) installation of safemode? The linux installation is still fully operational, if that helps. The Windows installation doesn't boot - since it's only an installer that can't boot in safe mode.
