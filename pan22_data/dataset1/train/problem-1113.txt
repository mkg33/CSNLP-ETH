The same SSL certificate can be used to secure multiple services.  Whether or not this will work for you depends on how you use it and how your environment is configured.  For example, if you are running your own mail server at mydomain.com, you should be able to configure your mail software to use your certificate and have it function as expected, assuming that all of your users connect to mydomain.com for SMTP (or POP or IMAP) service.
If you use different hostnames for different services, you will need either a wildcard certificate or an individual certificate for each hostname.
You will either need a wildcard or SAN (UC) certificate. I bought a certificate from SSL.com and it added a www. in front of my domain for imap.domain.com so it worked for www.imap.domain.com. I talked to their support through chat and they told me if I want to secure imap.domain.com and www.domain.com, I would have to go with wildcard or if it's only 2 domains, the multi domain UC certificate was more economical.
