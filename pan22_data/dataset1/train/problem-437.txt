There are a few holes in the specification for which you have implemented code. E.g. the color outside the charts. The picture has white color but you used black. If you didn't ask clarification for those, that might have a negative effect on your evaluation.
On the other hand, the specification says that the view can have "maximum of two charts" meaning that it can also have zero or one charts. You did not account for those and introduced NullPointerExceptions.
You can always thank them for the opportunity and what specifically made them consider you to not have "strong application-level skills" (whatever that means)...
I like the code, what you can do more is to add interfaces. Lets say Chart can be an interface and RectangularChart implement it and used in your application. In main you will declare variable as Chart and instantiate with RectangularChart.
Also don't be afraid to try to other jobs, if you trust yourself then don't pay attentions to the answer(this can hide other things in back: they like other candidates, they don't like you because you are smart ...).
Think lie this: your story doesn't fit to their story, go on ;)
