At the server I installed openldap-server, at this computer open-ldap client has already  been installed. Version of openldap-client (2.4.16) was older then new openldap-server (2.4.21) and the version of client has updated too. OpenLDAP-client works with postfix on this server and after all updates postfix cann't start again. The error when postfix stop|start is:
At the category with libraries is libldap-2.4.so.7, but libldap-2.4.so.6 is removed from the server. When I want to deinstall curently version of openldap-client, system write 
Updating of ports doesn't help, and postfix writes error:
You upgraded your OpenLDAP client, which deleted the old version of the shared library.  Postfix was built and linked against that old version of the shared library, and since it no longer exists Postfix can't start.
Re-compile postfix (which will cause it to link against the new version of the library) and this problem will go away.
In the future you can avoid problems like this by using portupgrade (check out the -r flag, which will recursively re-build packages that depend on the one being upgraded).
