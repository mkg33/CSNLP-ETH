I'd like to use FireFox Beta to see some of the new features.  I'm OK with occassional stability issues but I'm concerned about security.  For example, if there's a vulnerability will Mozilla necessarily be as responsive to correct it in the beta cycle as they would with a stable release? 
Firefox's beta can for most purposes be considered a release candidate build - it's mostly frozen, and any security reviews for code are generally done before the merge to beta. It does contain newer features that haven't been as broadly tested as they would be by releasing the software, and it may also already contain security fixes that haven't shipped in a release yet. There's really not a perfect answer here, because the security "footprint" of the beta is different from the release in both positive and negative ways.
I'll go out on a limb though and say that the security for a Firefox beta is probably better than other products labeled as beta, and that's out of some familiarity with the Firefox development process. Betas are also going to be less likely to be targeted for exploits - - the odds are someone who finds an exploit during beta period will either report it, or if they have malicious intent, they will hold on to it until the bug ships in a released product so that they can exploit many more users at once.
