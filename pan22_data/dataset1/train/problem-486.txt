Yes. Depending on how the hosting was configured, the hosting company will want one of the two:
Note that the DNS records have a "TTL" â€“ time for which visitors can cache the record before checking for changes. For example, if the old (wrong) record had a TTL of 1 hour, and you just changed it, you'll have to wait up to 1 hour for the DNS changes to be fully active. Changing the nameservers for the entire domain, in particular, can take up to a day or two.
Certificates do not tell visitors where to find your website; they're only used to confirm (certify) that the visitor has connected to the correct one. You need to have the domain working before the certificate will have any relevance.
So, apparently the domain was purchased at a different time. The hosting and files are still good, as is the SSL. Went ahead a purchased the domain name again. This is on Godaddy. 
Do I need to connect the domain name and hosting together? If so how, it will not let me. I reissued a new SSL cert, but I still cannot access the website via the internet.
