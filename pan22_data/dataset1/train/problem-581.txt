When you define a IP address as a NameVirtualHost, the apache server is expecting the browser to pass the domain domain associated with that host to determine which document root to serve.
Your apache will serve the first document root when a user visits mydomain.com or www.mydomain.com and the second phpmyadmin root when visiting phpmyadmin.mydomain.com. All 3 of those records would point to the same IP address. For any traffic that hits the same IP address without a matching ServerName or ServerAlias, it will default to the first VirtualHost.
I have the next apache virtualhosts and NameVirtualHost settings:
When I try to reach: 10.100.106.89 I can get to the site that I need: /var/www/html/dev/novared_soporte/branches/v0.3/soporte 
but when I try to reach 10.100.106.89/phpmyadmin I actually get this error on error_log.txt (httpd logs):
[Thu Jun 28 12:12:59 2012] [error] [client 10.100.103.31] File does not exist: /var/www/html/dev/novared_soporte/branches/v0.3/soporte/phpmyadmin
I still cant get where is the mistake. By the way, 10.100.106.90 is working properly, at least for its DocumentRoot /var/www/html
