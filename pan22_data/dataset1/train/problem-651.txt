That temperature shouldn't be a problem. Just watch out for humidity. Especially when you remove it from the cold environment and put it in the warm one. Water vapor in the warm air will condensate on the pi. And water and electricity don't mix. Leaving it unplugged while it get up to temperature prevents any damage from happening.
All electronic components used in the Raspberry Pi will at least be specified for the common "commercial" temperature range (0째C to 85째C). (I don't know much about the manufacturer's supply chain, but it is virtually impossible to buy even average quality parts that are not specified to withstand that range.)  
Some components, e.g. electrolytic capacitors, will have a decreased life expectancy when they're constantly operated at temperatures near the (mostly upper) limits of their specification, but 15째C is temperate enough not to have any noticeable effects.
Note: This goes for the Raspberry Pi itself. Cheap power supplies might and any type of batteries will suffer from reduced efficiency at 15째C.
