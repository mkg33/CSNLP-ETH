When I worked for an organization with a flakey internet connection, I had a script which tested several "always up" servers for connectivity: first the LAN router/switch, then the local file server, then the T1 router, then the ISP's DNS, then Google.  I tested the latter two as numeric addresses and as domains, to check DNS problems vs ping per se.  If any of the pings failed too often, I got an idea of where the problem in connecting to the internet was most likely to exist.
For the numeric address for Google, I just used one I had gotten from nslookup previously - I never ran into a case where it was down.  I suppose 8.8.8.8 would be simpler.
Fairly often, when people called to say the "internet was down", it turned out that only DNS was down; we might call those different things, but from the viewpoint of my colleagues, the internet wasn't available in either case. 
I've been using 4.2.2.1 for more than over 10 years.. Before there was Googles' public DNS service. It seems to be a reliable DNS cache and ICMP responder.
