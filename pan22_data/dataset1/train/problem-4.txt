Is there a way to set up tests/analysis of your graphics card for faults?
My issue, is that when playing games (intensive pc usage), the screen and sound freezes. The only way to over come this is via hard reset. I have used speccy to monitor temperatures, and nothing seems to overheat. (monitoring in real time vs logs is difficult due to having to reset.)
The game also becomes laggy, not long before crashing. which is Extremely unusual. It may not be the newest graphics card (GTX 460) but I've never had issues playing Dota 2 in full graphics. When i restart, and run the game, it occurs in a quicker time period. Which is why i thought it might be heat related.. But speccy says otherwise. (70c max)
If I have to go and buy a new graphics card, I would prefer to be certain its the issue first.
This is one of those seat-of-the-pants diagnoses, so is rarely testable by a regular user [rather than a tech with the necessary equipment] except by swapping out suspect components.
The type of hang described is a classic symptom of overheat or under-power, with an actually dying card as a long third.
As overheat had already been tested, then under-power was the next best assumption.
OP appears to have fixed the issue by replacing the PSU - so the guess/test/replace method came good first try in this case.
