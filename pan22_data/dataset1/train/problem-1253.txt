All you need to do is TCP & UDP forward port 22 (SSH) to your Linux box's internal IP.
Then, you also need to tell your router to always give the same internal IP to your Linux box (via MAC address or netbios [=computer] name).
You can use TightVNC for remote-controlling X11 (you need to port-forward the VNC port (5900 and also 5500 and 5800).
And you can also use sshfs, if you only want to access your files.
On a sidenote: Make sure you only use 4096 bit RSA private/public key authentication on SSH. No passwords, or you will get brute-force hacked in no time with absolute certainty.
(my SSH logs shows about 4000+ distinct hack attempts in the last 6 months, which means 22 distinct attempts per day...)
