You can do this with ffmpeg.  Their Audio Channel Manipulation page has many examples, including this example to split audio channels into separate files:
It will do the same with any format it understands, which includes mp3.  The example splits one stereo file into two mono files, without any reencoding.  I assume all players will (by default) play the one channel to each speaker.  You can follow this example to make a stereo file with the same audio copied into both channels.  To get joint stereo you have to reencode, which (on mp3) is not lossless; that page does not have an example.
If you're doing this on Windows (and not using Cygwin), it looks like the best source is the Zeranoe FFmpeg builds
So I tried the ffmpeg method and I get the impression that it is reencoding. It takes quite a while to process, uses up a lot of cpu (both way more than MP3directcut); the resulting files show a different codec in Mediainfo's readout; and when comparing spectrograms from original and split files there are marked differences. Just to check I transcoded the original with the same encoding settings (lame 128kpbs cbr stereo mp3 -> lame 128 cbr stereo mp3) and the original was much closer to the transcode than to the split files from ffmpg.
I really don't think this method is lossless. You might as well use a program like Audacity.
