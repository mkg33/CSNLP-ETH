And this reply is really late, but I kind of found fixed my problem today.
I started toggling my language settings in language preferences in the control panel, then selection options for the Japanese language. I chose options from the input methods, and then advanced settings for Microsoft IME. In the autocorrect tab, there is a scroll space where you can specify whether to use half or full-width based on the character kind, and under alphabet, I switched it to always use half-width. Now when I use shift+caps lock, it's always half width. I don't know if there was a hot-key combination that switched that setting.
I had the same issue, and I am also sure I never changed the default settings of the IME.
Since the proposed solutions with AutoCorrect seem like a hack to me, I tried my chance by clicking the Reset button for the IME settings, and guess what...  it worked!
Here is where you can find the Reset button: Right-click on the language bar, click "Properties", select the Japanese IME in the list, then click "Properties", go to the "General" tab and click "Reset".
