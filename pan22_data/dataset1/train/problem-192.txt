Is it possible to handle a 404 differently from a page request than I do a 404 response from a service call?
I want to default to a 404 page if someone requests https://example.com/pagethatdoesnotexist.html. However, I want the 404's returned from https://otherexample.com/api/thing/1 to funnel into my client application so I can give the user a useful message.
I tried using customErrors in my web.config, but it was catching everything. Is this possible or can I only catch all or none with a default 404 page in the config?
The reason my solution wasn't working was my misunderstanding of custom errors vs http errors. What I was looking for 
This will catch any bad requests of pages and allow my application to handle 404's coming from api responses. 
On that page, you can put all the logic you need, for example, to handle your API logic, and even changing the responde code to send a 200 instead of a 404.
If something isn't handled by your custom logic, you should send the 404 response code with the following code: (example using PHP)
