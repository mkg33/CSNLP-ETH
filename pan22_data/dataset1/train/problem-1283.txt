Not sure if this is the purpose of your buttons, but I do know that certain battery technologies (namely the Nickel-metal varieties) sort of wear out the battery if you charged them before they were fully drained or only partially charge the battery.   In this circumstance, you might want to prevent your laptop from charging the battery until it is fully drained and you are able to leave it to charge long enough to charge it to full.
My Dell laptop has two little battery icons on its F2 and F3 keys, one with an electric bolt (F2), and one without (F3).
It appears that these little battery Fn-keys enable and disable battery charging.
I found this out inadvertently when I tried pressing them both and got no UI feedback...  then later I noticed my battery status icon was low, and the tooltip was reporting "Battery plugged in (not charging)".
So I pressed Fn-F2 (the one with the bolt) and the icon indicated it was charging once again.
This was totally trial-and-error, and there was little indication as to what I was supposed to do.  In fact, there are dozens of "Plugged in, not charging" results on Google, and I wonder how many are due to this simple mistake.
Are these standard buttons, or are they Dell proprietary?  Is there typically more UI feedback for the enabling/disabling of battery charging?
