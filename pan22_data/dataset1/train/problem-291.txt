First: Try to add some code to your question so we can know what may be wrong more easily.
From what I could see, just by laying it, I can answer your questions very vaguely (most you have already noticed by yourself):
It's because of the gravity. I noticed that if you release the 'up' key, the player falls slowly, as if it's being pulled by gravity, when you are on top of the stairs, you can still fall from there, then if you keep pushing 'up' it will momentarily leave the stairs, but then gravity pulls you back down and this becomes a cycle, giving the illusion of "small jumps".
Probably because the top most part of the ladder is not perfectly aligned with the ground
Probably because the down most part of the ladder is not perfectly aligned with the ground when the stair spawns, maybe the way you wrote your physics behaviour is affecting the placement.
I'm writing a platformer lode-runner-like game. I would like to ask experienced people to see what's wrong. Everything seems to be ok but I am absolutely confused about 3 bugs.
I know that I ask too many questions, but I am sure they are all related to physics error I made somewhere in my code.
