You can't use Disk Utility from your startup disk to repair the startup disk, which is why that option is grayed out.
The noises most likely indicate that this hard drive is about to die (mechanically) and Disk Utility or fsck is not going to help. You most likely have very little time (as in minutes or hours, not days or weeks) where the disk will mount so you should focus all your efforts on making sure you have a backup of all your data. In fact leaving the drive on and letting mdworker (the Spotlight process) chug away at the disk is only shortening it's life. You can add the entire hard drive to in the Spotlight privacy pane to stop that, which will disable content searching. 
I'd recommend moving any new files not on your backup into Dropbox or email them to yourself and assume that the drive will not survive 2 more weeks.
Have you tried using the disk utility? Apparently I can't post a comment here :(
If there is a repair option I would try that before anything else. Worst case you can reformat, if you do that of course you will lose your files, but you could at least continue using the computer.
