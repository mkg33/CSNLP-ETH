Speaking from the perspective of someone who has several times inherited "safe" versions I urge you to use the latest unless there is a real and unavoidable reason not to. While to some it might seem safer to use an old version on the basis that there should be no surprises, that's exactly what testing is for.
Quite simply, without a real reason to do otherwise, it makes no sense to install a version that is already 4 or 5 years old. Sure it might appear to make a little sense today but what about a few months from now, or a year or 2 down the track. Why create the extra work of upgrading later when there's no need to do so?
The General Case: use $LATEST_VERSION unless you have a specific need not to.
You almost certainly fall into the general case, even more so since you lack "legacy" anything to hold you back. 
It's true there could be unknown "issues" with 2012; but considering 2012 is mostly an incremental change to 2008R2, and the relatively extensive testing already done, I'm confident in considering it production ready (along with a large number of other users). You'll find a few talking-head websites that argue the days for waiting for SP1 before considering a Windows OS Production Ready are dead, and have been for sometime.
