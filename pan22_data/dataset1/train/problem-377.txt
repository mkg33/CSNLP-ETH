I am reconstructing (with a different machine) a network situation with a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine with IIS. For some years, I have run this using a Comcast Business connection. The previous server failed, and I'm replacing it. The router firmware (the way Comcast handles the connection to the Internet) seems to be correct (I specify the IP address of the server in the place for Port Forwarding--TCP, port 80).
But attempting to access the site via my publicly available site name (or its IP) yields "cannot display page." From within my home network, entering http://[that server's IP] gives the desired IIS result.
Can anyone suggest what might be going wrong here?
I would suggest first narrowing down your problem set. Accessing a server via its direct ip or localhost is not always the same as acessing it via a hostname.
1) Nslookup your external hostname. Is it pointing at the right IP?
2) Make a mapping in your hosts file that maps the intended hostname to the local server IP. Does the site work now? This is best attempted from another machine on the same network.
This will give you an idea of where your problem might lie instead of just assuming its a router issue.
if trial 1 is incorrect then you need to check with your dns provider and confirm all the settings are correct.
If trial 2 doesn't work then you have something wrong with the configuration of your binding or firewall setting on the server.
If if trial 1 and 2 both work its most likely some forwarding issue with the router. You can start checking if any traffic is forwarding through the router.
