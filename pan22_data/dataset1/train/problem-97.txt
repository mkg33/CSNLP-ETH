I don't have a powered standing desk - instead I have a fixed standing desk next to a regular desk. I currently have two monitors on the standing desk attached to the computer. I'd like to add another two monitors which would be on the sitting desk, then have a "switch" that swaps where the video is displayed between the monitors on the standing desk and those at the sitting desk.
Right now I just use the laptop's own screen when I'm not at the standing desk - but working with one monitor is torture after you've used two.
I know there are numerous solutions for using a single KVM with multiple computers - but what about multiple monitors with a single computer?
I bought two Tripp Lite VGA Monitor Y Splitter cables ($14 each), one Cable Matters Gold Plated Mini DisplayPort to VGA Male to Female Adapter ($20), and one Tripp Lite DVI Splitter Cable ($12).
I found that DVI doesn't do splitting very well, so I ended up with one set of monitors being out of the VGA port via one of the Tripp Lite splitters.
The other set I connected by attaching the Cable Matters Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter and then piggybacking onto that the other Tripp Lite VGA splitter.
This served well enough for a while, then my wife bought me a sit/stand desk and now I only need the two. :)
You can use a video splitter from a company like IOGear - http://www.iogear.com/video-splitter.htm
You might also be able to get away with a simple Y-cable, but due to the analog nature of VGA signals the quality of the output may decrease more than you find acceptable.
