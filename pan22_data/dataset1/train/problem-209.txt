I would let the for /R loop resolve the file pattern rather than the copy command:
rem // Prepare an empty result file to merge into:
for /R %%I in ("*.txt") do copy "merge.txt" + "%%~I" "merge.txt" /B
The for /R command roots to the current working directory when no explicit root directory is provided.
I have one folder that contains several subfolders and each of those contains 10k+ small txt files. Now I need to merge all files from each subfolder into one big txt file for further processing.
If I call a batch manually in each folder which only contains copy *.txt merge.txt /B everything works fine.
But it would be better and easier if I could just call one batch file from the main which would perform the same task for each subfolder. I tried for /r %%d in (.) do (copy *.txt merge.txt /B) but without success. The error message is that *.txt can't be found which leads me to believe I can't just use the wildcard but rather would need to specify the files. But those are randomly generated.
Can you maybe help me out here on how I can merge those files. Thanks
