It's a workaround but with Zan Image Printer (a driver to print to image files, price: 59.95$) you could add watermarks (text or bmp - visible) and redirect the result to a true printer.
Perhaps is there other drivers like this but more oriented to header & footer?
I know this question is older than that necklace-holding woman from James Cameron's "Titanic", but I thought I'd share something I just found myself for the benefit of one and all:
There seems to be a system-level print settings similar to the Internet/Proxy settings accessible via Control Panel (and/or Internet Explorer) -- 
In Internet Explorer, in the gear/settings dropdown, click "Print" -> "Page Setup". In the headers/footers sections below, there are three rows on each side with dropdowns -- each row equates to far-left, middle, and far-right spaces of the header and footer. If you select "Custom" from a dropdown, you're able to add custom text that will be added to all print jobs.
I discovered this only after searching for why everything I print has been having odd custom text injected into the headers/footers, even across printers, even printing to Adobe PDF. I discovered this "system-level" print settings, removed the rogue text (added by a rogue program), and now everything prints just dandy without the text.
Now, both my heart + print headers/footers will go on.
