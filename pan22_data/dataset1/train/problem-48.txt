What worked for me is rather long and very dependent on my specific configuration. 
1. I installed a version of Wndows 7. Any version is OK. Since my PC did not come with any backup nor software DVD, I just took the one from another PC I have.
Now with a version of Windows 7, the "Recovery" partition became accessible again. So I installed the "Dell Backup and Recovery Manager", but for reasons I do not understand, it could not restore my computer. So:
2. my computer being a Dell, I followed the instructions found in this link.
Again, for some strange reason that did not work either and the process repeatedly got stuck at 99%. But this process did copy all of the original software to a "C:\Dell" directory. 
3. I launched the Recovery Manager from Dell again and this time it simply worked.
I believe this worked in the end because the manager could find all of the "Factory" settings and software on the "C:\Dell" folder. Now I am back to square one with my original Factory configuration. 
Unfortunately, you can't access a recovery partition created in a previous version of Windows in a newer one to rollback. So your recovery partition is basically useless. 
However, you can try reinstalling Windows 7 Home (the same Windows version which came installed with your laptop). You can obtain the installation DVD from Dell or can visit any Dell Service Center and ask them to install it for you. As in Dell Laptops, product keys are hard coded in the motherboard, the new installation should read the key from your motherboard and automatically validate your copy.
If nothing works, then you might have to purchase a new Windows copy.
