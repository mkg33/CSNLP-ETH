I am using RHEL5 and yum is missing many packages,  such as apache, php, and all php libraries .  I have added the rpmforge repository,  but i am still missing these packages.  This is an i686 machine and there might not be many i686 packages available, I think that if i force an i386 i'll have serious problems. 
How do I make sure I have a large number of compatible packages on a RHEL5 system?  I didn't install this system,  is it normal for RHEL5 to have virtually no useful packages in yum?  How do RHEL5 administrators use yum without introducing conflicts with currently installed packages?  Should I ditch yum and use apt?
ehm, your RHEL5 machine is suscribed to RedHat Network ?
i presume that the people that installa RHEL in this machine, dont suscribe this one to RedHat Network to have access to the Repositories for install/update.
if you pay for this the suscription cost, go to the people that did the install service and demand that complete the install (the suscription part)
if you dont pay, you need to pay for suscription, or reinstall using a RHEL clone like CentOS
