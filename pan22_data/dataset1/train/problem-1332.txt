If I'm not mistaken the product key is highly specific to the the part number of the CD, which usually specific the release date, service pack, OS version, etc.  
Make sure that IT isn't giving you something that doesn't match the part number.
Last month, I needed to install Windows XP (Pro Version 2002 SP3) from a Reinstallation CD a co-worker gave me, and with a product key the IT team told me to use.
Everything installed successfully and I have been using the XP machine for the last 30 days without any problems; however it kept reminding me to activate Windows, and of course, I never did (laziness).
It now has me locked out of my machine and won't let me log in until I activate it. So I proceed to the Activation Screen which asks me:
I choose "Yes, let's activate Windows over the Internet now.", and click the Next button. It now asks me:
I choose "No, I don't want to register now; let's just activate Windows.", and click the Next button.
Notice how the title reads "Unauthorized product key", and how there are only 3 buttons:
Please note that the Retry button is disabled until I enter the full product key that IT gave me, then it enables. However, at no point in time do I see a Next button, indicating that the product key was valid/successful.
So instead, I just click the Retry button, and the screen refreshes, this time with a different title
Could something be wrong with the Windows XP reinstallation CD (do they "expire" after a certain amount of time, etc.)? Or is this the normal/typical workflow for what happens when you just have a bad product key? I ask because, after this happened I emailed IT and they supplied me whether several other product keys to try. But every time its the same result, same thing happening over again and again.
So I guess it's possible that IT has given me several bad keys, but it's more likely something else is going on here. Any thoughts or ways to troubleshoot? Thanks in advance!
