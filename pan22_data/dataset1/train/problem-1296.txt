Although shopping requests/recommendations are off-topic for SU, and I think finding a notebook with this specific functionality would be impossible (never seen or heard of one personally), here's a generic hack that could work with many notebooks:
Is there a laptop where you can turn off the backlight of the screen completely?
I have a Pixel Qi tablet where you can turn off the backlight and I use that function all the time. Really saves the eyes if you read or write a lot.
Now, I would like to have that functionality in a laptop too, preferably with a 13.3 inch laptop screen or so. 
I don't know how well the Pixel Qi company is doing, haven't seen a lot of updates from they're lately. Maybe there's another company which manufactures a similar screen that you can tip me about?
Again, I'm looking for a laptop where you can turn off the backlight of the screen entirely. Perhaps a Mirasol screen, or did that product turn into vaporware too?
The technology behind is somewhat irrelevant - what's important is that I want to be able to turn off the backlight.
