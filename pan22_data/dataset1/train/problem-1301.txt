Order means nothing, it is just a convention and makes it easier to remember.  Gateways/routers are typically at .1 (almost everything) or .254 (I've seen it twice), anything else is up to local policy/documentation.  
What I would do is use MAC address based "static" IP leases in your DHCP server, and add appropriate DNS entries using a real domain name that you own but that isn't your website, email, etc. domain.  For example, I work for a university and our internal name isn't school.edu but rather generic looking four letter domain in the .us name space, so our internal hostnames look like lp32.its.abcd.us (linux physical number 32) or wv17.vhost03.its.abcd.us for "windows virtualized on virtual host box 03".
I am replacing some physical servers in my network and replacing them with Hyper-V machines.  Which of course ips are already assigned to the current network.  I just want to know the order of importance for assigning the up addresses.  For example. My domain controller (which I believe is the most important) will be 192.168 .1.1. After the DC what is the order of the next devices?
I will have two hyperv machines, running windows and Linux vms.  I will have two file servers (physical), a backup server (physical), EPO server (vm), etc.
Again, I am just looking for something that will tell me how to open devices in order of importance.
