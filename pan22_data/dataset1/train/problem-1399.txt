Going off the laptop might be a stretch. There are USB-based converters that might do the trick, but my concern is getting 3 hours off of the laptop by itself, let alone the camera sucking juice.
Definitely get a power test tool so you can plug the camera in and see exactly how much power it takes. One popular model is called "Kill-a-watt" but there are certainly many others to choose from.
If it turns out to be overwhelming for the laptop battery, I might suggest going out and buying a small UPS. It doesn't have to be huge, just big enough to power the camera and maybe the laptop - say 350-500VA. Of course you'll want to find one that allows you to turn off any audible alarms that might sound :)
I have a mobile "platter" that includes a laptop and two cameras that should be able to be light enough to be carried to meetings and be able to self-sustaining without being plugged into anything not on the platter for up to 3 hours. 
One of the cameras is PoE / 12V DC powered. My challenge right now is figuring out how to power this camera and allow it to function on this platter while not connected to the network. 
I am thinking either it runs off of a small battery that it can plug into or I somehow figure out how to convert energy off of the laptop so that it can power the camera.
I am open to ideas. Thoughts / RFIs (other than not possible)?
