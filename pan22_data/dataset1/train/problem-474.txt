I think discontinuity refers to an abnormality. I found this
to me, that implies that "discontinuity" is related to bit-size-integer-rollover.
So if you see the sysTime change, you know that counters that are now showing smaller-than-last-time-checked values have, in fact, wrapped around, as if you had rebooted.
The ifCounterDiscontinuityTime is triggered when interfaces are dynamically removed from a device and then that same interface is dynamically re-added. I tested this using a loopback interface but I believe the behavior would be the same for modular interface whose existence would change based on whether or not the module was present. The steps to reproduce this are below and there is some further reading on this topic in the RFC here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2863#section-3.1.5
2. Check the current value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime for Loopback100
3. Remove Loopback100 and check the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime
4. Re-add Loopback100 and check the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime
