Since you're just trying to make your lesson interactive, a low-tech approach might be your best approach.  Providing a work-along worksheet allows you to focus your time and energy on other parts of the lesson when you prepare.
I highly recommend using Jupyter Notebooks. These provide a system for integrated code + narrative.
You can get a quick sense of the results by looking at https://github.com/rajathkmp/Python-Lectures/blob/master/04.ipynb
You can also see a video at https://youtu.be/wpBPGF0yQ9E?t=88 that uses the basic interface.
Students can easily set this up on a Win/Mac/Linux computer using Anaconda python or you can use a hosted service.  You can find a free system at https://jupyter.org/try that lets you try out the different interfaces.
The JupyterLab interface is more comprehensive and includes a better IDE and terminal interface than the earlier "notebook" interface -- the jupyter.org site lets you try both.
There are free / cheap services from Google and Microsoft to run Jupyter notebooks.
