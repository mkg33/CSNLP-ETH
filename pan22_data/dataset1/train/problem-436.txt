Levels give players a sense of achievement that comes in a nicely wrapped box (as opposed to level-less game systems).  If you want to include levels in your game design, there are some considerations.
That being said, a guide to making your own table should consider how long a character should take at a given level to progress, and set the XP values of monsters at that level.  Again, DnD 4e has a pretty good example.
The tables themselves often feel a bit arbitrary once you write them down.  The important thing is that you tailor the appropriate monsters for the character at that level.
I think what makes a good game is the unique idea and design, so no real "rule" should be copied.
But as @DrDeth writes, there are plenty Wikis and sites dedicated to that. Try to ask more detailed/specific questions in this forum, as we will probarbly be better at solving problems than supplying complete solutions. (hench we all need to to a bit of work ourselfs).
To give you something usefull or idea to something I have the following suggestion for a very primitive level guide (feel free to copy my idea or build upon it, thats why I write it here):
First I would decide an offset-value. Lets call this "offset". Secondly I would figure out some "double up" kinda value. We could call this "factor".
My algoritme would be: level = (previous level * factor) + offset
This is how the table would look from those numbers (Level 0 starts at 0 exp):
Thats just a sample with sample values, my idea here is that you can replace both offset and factor and use this with any weapon, skill, ability, scroll, shield or monsters or what ever... very easy to calculate and scale for you.
And very easy to put into tables for quick lookup.
Do you find this usefull or? please mark or comment any questions.
