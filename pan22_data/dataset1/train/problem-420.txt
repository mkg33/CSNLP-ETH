A while ago, I discovered the ObjFW runtime for Objective-C, which is a pretty neat one and does a lot of things - and, is very tiny. But it made me ask lately, which runtimes are available on which targets - and how can one best find out? I'd like to use a small script in my configuration to test if I could use ObjFW on the current platform, with the current clang or gcc installation.
So is there a way to list the available Objective-C runtimes on either GCC or Clang?
Every GCC version starting 4.0 and basically every Clang version ever supports the ObjFW runtime at least partially. That is because the ObjFW runtime uses the GNU ABI, but adds more on top of that. In order to use what's added on top, you need a Clang version that accepts -fobjc-runtime=objfw. For a possible check, see configure.ac included in ObjFW.
This all is only relevant if you plan on using the runtime without the rest of ObjFW - if you also want to use the rest, just use objfw-config: It will do the right thing for oyu.
