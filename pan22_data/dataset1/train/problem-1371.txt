You are likely seeing the impact of overhead in the network stack. With increased concurrency, you will have more simultaneous connections open, so the system and apache has to work harder to open and close these connections.  This typically degrades Apache performance and result in a longer average time per request at concurrency levels.
I also suspect you had more Apache child processes running at higher concurrency levels.  This requires time to spin these up and down.  
Network issues can be further complicated if you are running the test on the same system as the web server. 
Tuning your TCP/IP stack, KeepAlive settings (if on), and Timeouts could improve this.  
However, this is a long known issue with scaling apache.

A closing word: I don't know what "VM" implies in your case, but it could be a performance bottleneck.
