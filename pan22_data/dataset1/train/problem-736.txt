This bubcheck code means that some critical thread or process has been terminated.
Now, the way to deal with bluescreens (beside the usual "let's google the error code") is to:
I have written a very simple batch to perform that analysis. It will grab the appropriate  symbols from MS's web site so you don't have to download them beforehand:
(Just pass the dump file as parameter to the script. You'll need to adjust the path to match your system).
I have a Hyper-V VM running Windows Server 2008 R2 (Host is also WinSrv 2008 R2) that was working perfectly. It has now started BSOD before I even login. On testing if I boot normally and login the vm Blue Screens after 1min 35seconds. If I safe boot this extended to almost 4 minutes. 
I dont have time to check out the eventlog within the vm itself before it explodes but the event log on the host reports the following warning....

Virtual machine 'ZeroThree' has an older version of integration services installed ('6.1.7600.16385'). To help avoid compatibility problems, upgrade integration services in the guest operating system to '6.1.7601.17514'. (Virtual machine ID 'FE5F168E-FE73-438B-82BA-9258E1F3E8E6')
I have tried to upgrade the integration services but it only gets half way through the install before another BSOD. 
All other VM's (Running same os) are working fine. 
Any suggestions, tips, pointers would be most gratefully received.
