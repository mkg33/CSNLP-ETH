It's very likely that Google is blocking your email. Generally, forwarding all email from one location to another can be a bad idea, particularly to somewhere like Google. If you're getting any spam at your domain's email address, it all gets forwarded to Google as well. When Google sees that, they see it as coming from YOUR domain, and not the originator. This is a quick way to get blocked.
I'd recommend setting up something like Google Apps instead, if you would like Google to be picking up your email for your domain.
As for an SPF record, I'm not sure how strict Google is about SPF records for incoming email. However, if it was the SPF being the problem you would likely be getting a bounceback.
Have you watched the maillogs to see what happens when the mail gets forwarded to Google?
zoneedit has been having problems with their mail forwarding for almost a week now.  I noticed it when emails sent to my forwarded domain didn't arrive and people asked me what was up.  I experimented with changing the forwarding to point to several completely different destination accounts with no luck.  Then I used telnet to connect to port 25 of mail.zoneedit.com and test the connection and found that the mail server is rejecting connections due to it being unable to do a reverse address lookup on the IP address of the system attempting to connect, presumably a mail server attempting to send a message to the mail forwarder.
I've already placed a couple of tech support calls with the company that owns Zoneedit, they're aware of the problem and tell me the guys that manage the server in Vancouver, BC are working on the problem.  It troubles me that it has been going on this long and still hasn't been resolved.
