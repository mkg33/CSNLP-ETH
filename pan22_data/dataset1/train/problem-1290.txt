We have a lot of Win 7 SP1, both 32 and 64 bit machines serviced by a Server 2008 R2 WSUS server.
For whatever reason, whenever they check for updates, though there aren't any new ones, the PCs end up using all of their available RAM, even 1.3 and 2 GB just for the Windows Update service.
Interestingly enough, this doesn't happen to Windows 8 clients in our environment, they're just fine using only about 100 MB of RAM.
I have come across this thread https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/4a782e40-bbd8-40b7-869d-68e3dfd1a5b4/windows-update-scan-high-memory-usage but apparently that only addresses SCCM 2012 which we do not have at the moment.
I know for sure it's the Windows Update service on client machines because I've checked it via perfmon and whenever I stop the service from Task Manager on one of these machines that is checking for updates, about a whole gigabyte of RAM gets freed up.
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3050265 fixes this, Microsoft finally got their act together.
In Win 7 SP1 Pro 64-bit, http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3050265 does not fix runaway RAM usage by wuauserv. After the fix has been applied and the PC has rebooted, wuauserv continues to eat 1GB and more of RAM. The service has to be stopped manually, eg find wuauserv in Task Manager/Services and stop the service.
