The booting issue is well known - the SATA chipset that the 8.2 uses is (was?) not well supported by Linux. The fix for this comes down to:
The 8.2 uses a Broadcom 4331 card, you have to go with the open source driver, as Broadcom's binary driver doesn't support the 4331. The patch was accepted in kernel version 3.2, which Ubuntu 12.04 has.
The firmware, however, is not redistributable with the default install - as such, find an ethernet cable and install the firmware-b43-installer package.
I'm writing this comment from Fedora 17 on a MacBook Pro. Previously, I installed Ubuntu and dual booted it with OS X and, atm, the dual-booting comprises Mac OSX and Fedora, through rEFIT. I honestly don't know if you can single boot Linux on a Mac, you should probably try your luck with EFI but, i assure you it's quite easy to dual-boot it. The most important thing that doesn't work out of the box is the WI-FI adapter but it's easily solved by installing the proper BCM (Broadcom) driver.
