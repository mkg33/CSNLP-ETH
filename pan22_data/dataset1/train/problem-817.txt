I'm making a 2D RTS Map Editor and here came the moment to make a Palette which is just a popup frame showing tiles to be clicked on and then applied on the map.
I'm wondering which Java Elements to use for this palette?
At the moment I have set a JFrame which will contain Jlabels which have their Icon set as some ImageIcon (which are the tiles of my game).
(I have a List<ImageIcon> tiles which contains every tiles)
However, I want to be able to click on these JLabels to be selected and so that I can use a function like getSelectedTile in my main JFrame to place them on the Map. But adding a mouseListener/Event to each and every JLabel doesn't seem right.
Thanks in advance! All suggestions will be taken into consideration :)
I'd go with an MouseListener per JLabel. Make a custom subclass of MouseListener which is parameterized with the tileId (or whatever you are using to identify the tiles).
Furthermore would not recommend using Swing for a game /mapeditor, we build a map editor using jmonkeyengine3 and Swing which is not working very well.
