FleetCommand is generally correct. However, if you have DIY skills and want to try it yourself:
If it still fails... the most likely thing to have happened is that something got shorted in the keyboard. On a lot of larger (i.e. serviceable) laptops, the keyboard is an easily-swappable part and replacements are cheap and easy to find ($20-$40). if it's a Dell, they have complete service manuals online. If it's something else, look for service info both at the manufacturer's site and at places like iFixit and YouTube... or just do a Google search. 
In any case, a quick test, if you can find out how to remove the keyboard, is to try it without the keyboard connected. If the problem is indeed in the keyboard the machine should boot ok (but of course you won't be able to type), but at least this will tell you the rest of the machine is ok. 
If it isn't, then your friend is probably in for a new keyboard AND motherboard. 
If it's a machine that can't be disassembled with screws, but is held together with adhesive tape and must be pried apart... forget it. Take it to a service place or throw it away. 
Friend spilt water on laptop, left it to dry for 7 hours and turned it back on. Now stuck on American Megatrends BIOS screen. What should he do?
