Everytime you hit that icon to "Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media", it triggers the same process (in background) as opening Devices & Printers.
A relatively bigger no. of connected virtual and/or network printers and other devices may cause it to work slower.
If you could bear an extra icon in your taskbar, here's a work around (might be little annoying to keep) -
Go to Control Panel -> View devices and printers. Whatever time it takes to open is its one time thing. If you could keep this window minimized (maybe to the very left) on the taskbar, it can save time while trying to eject devices.
Going forward, whenever you connect a device, OS would update this window (devices and printers) in background and would keep it synced. And when you click this icon  it's gonna work faster.
Alternatively, since you have that Devices and printers window opened already (though minimized), you can restore it, click on the device and choose to eject. (two ways as in below image).
I have never used a computer where pressing the "Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media"-button has resulted in an immediate response. Most other functions responds almost immediate, whereas it almost always takes a few seconds for the "Eject USB Product String" window to appear. (I'll admit, sometimes it happens fast, but that's very rarely, even on new computers.)
Is there a reason why this should be slower than other commands? Is it due to the time it takes the computer to figure out what can be removed?
