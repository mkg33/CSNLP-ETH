Recently, a circuit breaker tripped in my home and my desktop lost power. Upon turning it back on, one of my monitors wasn't functioning. I have three monitors supported by two video cards, and I just worked the rest of the day with two monitors.
When I opened up the computer to investigate, I found that the fans on the video card supporting the disabled monitor had completely seized; spinning them lightly with my finger was actually somewhat difficult. The card is about 4 or 5 years old so I suppose the fans might have just been at the end of their natural lives. The card affected is an MSI R5770 Hawk.
So, I set about disassembling the heatsink assembly and eventually disassembled the fans themselves, relubricated the parts (which were exceeding gummy by this point) and reassembled the card. However, upon attempting to use the card again, it's still not functioning.
Windows can detect the card within Device Manager (Windows 8.1), however in the device properties it displays "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"
Yes. Excessive heat reduces component life. Some of the parts have thermal safeties, but many of them don't.
There are three possible reasons. One is just coincidence. Another is that stopping or starting puts additional stresses on components, particularly when it's stopping due to loss of external power. Lastly, it's possible that it failed before the power was lost, but failed in a way that prevented it from starting correctly but didn't have any other obvious consequences.
There's probably not a whole lot you can do. If the fans are spinning and the heat sink is properly mounted and the card still doesn't work, you can pretty much consider it dead.
