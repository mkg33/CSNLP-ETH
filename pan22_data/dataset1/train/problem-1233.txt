I want to sync some folders between my Windows 7 and Ubuntu computers. However, I don't want to sync everything inside each of the folder. I want to be able to choose which subfolders and files inside each folder to keep synced. Any new file added to this folder should automatically get synced.
Basically I want to create a link between multiple pairs of folders, but have the option to exclude some contents of the folders.
I would prefer this to be over the internet, but if it's over LAN that works too, as long as it is automatic.
Doe you want continuous integration or do you want to control when the sync-ing is done?
In both cases, you can control which folders/files are synchronised.
The set-up for syncthing is a bit more automated. You can turn on/off syncthing to control when synchronisation takes place but it is a bit tricky as you need to control both machines to do this.
In the case of unison, you need to set up "ssh" access between the two machines which may or may not be a problem depending on firewall configurations and so on.
