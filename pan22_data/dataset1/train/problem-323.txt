We generally do not offer technology recommendations, because they are very specific to ones personal preferences and to the kind of project one wants to develop and how they want to develop it.
But if you are going to participate in a game jam, then my recommendation is use the tools you know. The reason is that game jams are about rapid prototyping game ideas. You won't get to do that when you spend most of the time trying to figure out how your technology works and how to get things done in a quick and efficient manner. If you want to dabble in a new technology, then it is usually better to do so in a stress-free environment where you don't have a ticking clock and the pressure that you must deliver something presentable. 
I plan to join on solo the 43th Ludum dare in 20 days. It will be my first LD and I would like to know if you have some tips regarding the LD in general or some software to suggest.
My goal is not especially to make a good game but more to challenge myself. If I can post my game in time, regardless of if it's good or not, I will already proud of that.
For the engine, I have a little bit of experience with Unity but I'm not afraid of quickly learning something new (Some seem to use Contruct 2 or I can challenge myself with UE4).
I'm really bad at Art and Graphics so I think I will go for a simple 2D game without modeling or very basic 3D (just cube, sphere...) and maybe Pyxel Edit and paint.net as software.
Apart from Unity, I never use (or too little to mention it) softwares listed above so it will already be a pretty challenging LD for me.
So if you think a software will be better or have any suggestion/tips feel free to share it !
