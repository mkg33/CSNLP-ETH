The socket with a lever means that it is a zero insertion force (ZIF) socket.
You will not be able to properly install and lock the CPU chip in a ZIF socket without first opening the socket (raise the lever).
The best method of separating the heatsink from the CPU chip is by twisting them apart.
Wait until you have a motherboard again.  Open the ZIF socket. Place the CPU chip in the socket, paying attention to the pin alignment.
Apply a slight downward force (so that the chip stays in the socket) and a firm, steady twisting force to the heatsink.
Sadly, I discovered that my MoBo is faulty and that I need to change it, so I had to remove the heatsink and CPU and send it back - I will get a new MoBo soon.
The original thermal paste on the Arctic Alpine 64 plus heatsink must be pretty strong, for the CPU came away with it. Pins don't look damaged.
Now, I know that the AM4 socket works like this: you raise the lever, the plastic grid where the pins go shifts a bit, you place the CPU over it, then you lock the lever again and the CPU falls in place.
Of course, this is not possible if the heatsink is already sticking to the CPU!
Is it safe to place the CPU down without raising-the-lever-and-getting-the-plastic-grid-to-shift, or should I really remove the thermal paste, buy some new one and re-apply it after socketing the CPU again?
