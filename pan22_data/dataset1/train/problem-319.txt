How about enabling "Wake on LAN" in your bios settings? Also, not every PC supports wake on LAN support. Make sure to check if your pc/laptop is capable of this feature and enable it in your BIOS settings.
It was a driver problem and this is what I did. I write down all I did even if it wasn't a part of the solution.
First I updated the BIOS and enabled Power on by PME device again afterwards. Still not working. 
Then I installed a package called firmware-realtek but still not working. 
If I added the letter b as i broadcast in "Wake-on: bg" it suddenly work because it enables wake on for all broadcasting on the network. Magic packets still didn't work though so it was probably something with the network device after all. So I installed another driver from realteks website instead and now it's working like a charm. It's even working when the computer is completely shut down. 
Afterwards I uninstalled the firmware-realtek package and it still works but I don't know if the BIOS update had to do anything with the success. After the second driver install, Wake-on: g was no longer default so I had to make those changes as the debian wiki described.
