Let $u, v$ be two vertices of an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$.
A vertex set $S\subseteq V$ is a $u,v$-separator if $u$ and $v$
belong to different connected components of $G-S$. If no proper
subset of a $u,v$-separator $S$ is a $u,v$-separator then $S$ is
a minimal $u,v$-separator. A vertex set $S\subseteq V$ is a (minimal)
separator if there exist vertices $u, v$ such that $S$ is a (minimal)
A well-known theorem of G. Dirac states that a graph has no induced
cycles of length at least four (called triangulated or chordal graph)
if and only if every of its minimal separators is a clique.
It is also well-known that triangulated graphs can be recognized
My questions: What are graphs in which every minimal separator is an independent set?
Are these graphs studied?  And what is the recognition complexity of
Examples for such graphs include trees and cycles. 
There are two new papers on graphs without cycle having exactly one chord. Both mainly deal with coloring these graphs: 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2749 and http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1928. 
The later also gives an $O(m^2n)$ recognition algorithm. But a faster one 
in time $O(mn)$ is already provided in the paper by Trotignon and Vuskovic 
Seemingly the earliest characterization of the graphs in which every minimal separator is an independent set appeared in T. A. McKee, "Independent separator graphs," Utilitas Mathematica 73 (2007) 217--224.
These are precisely the graphs in which no cycle has a unique chord (or, equivalently, in which, in every cycle, every chord has a crossing chord).
