Some of what you are doing seems like it would be covered by using a combination of a configuration management system (like puppet) and a change control system (like subversion).
As you add, remove, modify packages, you do them through the puppet system; you then check your configuration changes in, and log what changed and why.
This lets you not only reproduce a system, but also lets you reproduce it at any point in time. You also get control over more than just the package files; you can control all the config files in your system.
Although I'm a fan of Puppet myself (well, technically, I love the idea of Puppet and loathe the implementation, but that's a whole other story), and would recommend that in general, you could produce more-or-less what you want with some scripts -- apt is powerful enough to do that.  Also, the etckeeper package does the "config change tracking" bit for you, and would provide an example of how to hook into apt to do what you want.
I use etckeeper on my workstation just to have an idea of what changed and when, but I would not ever consider it as a replacement for a real configuration management system on production systems.  It just doesn't (can't!) keep track of enough system state to make it a viable alternative.
