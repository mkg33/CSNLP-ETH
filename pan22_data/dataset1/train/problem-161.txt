If you are running your production in docker container it's crucial that those container are being made by the same developers that have build the app running on them.
Who else is better place to know what external dependency are needed and so on ... ? 
Also pipeline can fail at any step during a CD, particularly when it's the docker image build step, sometimes it's a file who is missing or a lib that's needed.
At work we've introduce all devs to docker explaining them the basics to build the dockerfile in order to serve their app, also we made the pipeline easy so one can only add a name and a dockerfile and its app will automatically be build on the next push regardless of the tech running it.
Docker quickstart is really a great introduction to do so, after what the devOps team guide the dev in their choice of distro (a lot of them don't know things like alpine). 
Our job is to provide them an easy access to the tools, they do the rest so they can fix it when something is wrong. Docker is really a part of the development process and the devOps team provide them docker images that match our needs and that are easy enough so it take only a couple minute to create a new app and deploying it without assistance.
Here are for example some arguments from a blog post published back 2014 and titled in way quite matching your answer:
