Your premise is incorrect: it is not postfix, or the machine, that sends email without identifying host information; it is the process sending the mail.
That said, not all processes can properly set the hostname on submission; for such non-compliant clients, set myorigin to a decent value for your environment, and add 
For instance, if each VM's postfix instance has myorigin = $myhostname, this will convert ANY addresses without host or domain information to user@$myhostname.
This uniquely identifies both sender and recipient.
HOWEVER, each VM does not need to run postfix, and truth be told, probably should not run postfix.
Instead, configure a nullclient to submit mail to one MSA (which may be postfix), and deal with all mail on the one centralized server.
I have several ubuntu servers / desktops running on the same machine using kvm (under ubuntu server 12.04)
With postfix on each virtual machine I've redirected each root's mail to my gmail account. 
The problem comes that some daemons send notifications without identifying the machine name. So, when I get the email, I dont know which virtual machine has sent it.
Is there any way with postfix conf to add a custom text like "asterisk_server:" before the subject, to identify the comoputer from the email has been sent?
