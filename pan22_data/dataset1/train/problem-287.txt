As per this forum post, by jazzman, in the IrfanView support forum, IrfanView itself has an appropriate option for dealing with rotation information stored in EXIF records.
Corresponding option is called "Reset EXIF orientation tag" and is available within other save-related options in "Save as" dialog, when saving (rotated) image in JPEG format:
Note: Since this Super User answer is just a copy of corresponding forum post (not my own invention) and because Attie provided much more comprehensive answer before me, I keep that answer as accepted one.
Most cameras will add EXIF data to images, which can include a lot of information about the image - camera model, exposure settings, zoom, date, time, location and importantly for your question the orientation of the camera.
This orientation information is used by some image viewers and editing software to present the photograph with the correct rotation, but by no means all...
If you're having issues with rotation and need to be sure, then I'd suggest that you open the image in an editor, select the whole canvas, and copy and paste it into a new image. Once you have the new image (not a "photo" per se, no EXIF data), perform any required rotation and save it.
In some situations it's possible for the orientation to be recorded incorrectly - for example when taking a photo almost straight downwards or upwards the camera can pick the wrong orientation - think of the bubble in a spirit level... with a horizontal lens the orientation is obvious, with a vertical lens the orientation is not.
