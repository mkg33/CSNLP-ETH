I spilled coke on my keyboard, and instantly flipped the laptop upside down to avoid it going underneath the keyboard. Dried it with some paper towels, and resumed work with slightly sticky keys. A few days later, I was starting to get annoyed with some of the keys that were getting worse, not springing back up after being pressed, etc.. the left arrow key was not working anymore. So removed the keyboard and cleaned it with warm water and dried it thoroughly and re-installed it. It got even worse although the keys weren't sticky anymore, so I immediately disconnected it thinking it wasn't completely dry. The next day I retried and it didn't work either. My colleague at work is telling me that the interface on the motherboard must have been damaged. Is that possible? Can a wet keyboard damage the the circuitry on the motherboard? I'm absolutely sure no coke got inside, I disassembled the laptop and there were no traces coke inside, it was a very small spill directly on the keyboard.
Check if you didn't loosen connections between keyboard and motherboard (on both ends). If it's loosen and doesn't have good contact then some/all keys could stop to work.
