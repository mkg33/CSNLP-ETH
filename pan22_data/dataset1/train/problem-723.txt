*If PE1 and PE2 were to exchange transport labels for their loopback address and PHP was enabled, then traffic within backbone would have only a VPN label.
1) So my question is, in such a scenario,  is an mpls tunnel between PE1 and PE2 really needed for VRF customer traffic to pass via the provider backbone?
2) A non-default VRF route can point to a NH in deafault VRF table only if it has a transport label associated with it (even if it means no label)?
3) Can other types of tunneling be used instead of mpls? (GRE for example?)
If the backbone does not support MPLS, the MPLS packet carrying only
   the VPN route label may be tunneled to the BGP Next Hop using the
   techniques of [MPLS-in-IP-GRE].  When the packet emerges from the
   tunnel, it will be at the BGP Next Hop, where the VPN route label
You can also use MPLS over UDP, which was defined in RFC 7510 and is arguably a better choice than GRE as it has better hashing properties.
Note that tge VPN label is still necessary as it defines the egress VRF or interface,
