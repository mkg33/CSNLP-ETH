What do you mean by "the screen doesn't 'exist'"? Can you move your cursor over that space?
I once had an issue similar to this where I was able to move my cursor over the stripe. Somehow, the computer had gotten confused about the number of monitors I had, and started displaying a second desktop next to the primary desktop. Whatever was wrong with the display settings also affected the machine's ability to place the desktop in the space provided by the monitor, so I lost a bit of my "real" desktop off the left side of my screen and could see a tiny part of the second desktop as a stripe on the right side of my screen.
The fix for that was removing the second monitor, restoring default display settings through the graphics card's UI and then recreating the display settings from scratch.
I had the same problem recently and was only able to fix it by tweaking a setting in the ATI Catalyst Control software.  Tried changing things in the display properties for Windows and nothing helped.  Hope this helps you.
