IF Oracle restart is in place, as is often the case when RAC and/or ASM is in use, you can use:
to list the databases that are defined on the current host. This comes very close to the Windows services. You could pipe this into the next lines to filter out the database name and request that status of the database, where the instances are listed:
In case of RAC this again introduces instances running on other nodes so again, filter using the current HOSTNAME
There's no fool-proof way, but here's a list of ideas for you:
Little script to give you a list of SIDs in the oratab:
You can adapt the above script to look in all $ORACLE_HOMEs listed in the oratab, and search for initSID.ora and spfiles for any instances:
Another option is to look in each $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and analyse the tnsnames.ora and listener.ora files to see which instances have been configured.
You've already covered this with your pmon search. You can also use lsnrctl status to see which instances the listener is currently servicing requests for.
