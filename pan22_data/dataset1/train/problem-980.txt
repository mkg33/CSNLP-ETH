A long time ago the first two point where true, but this is no longer the case. Any system produced in the last decades will boot fine without graphics cards.  Older systems sometimes did not boot and had options in the BIOS to ignore if there was no keyboard (Rather then halt with No keyboard found. Press F1 to continue) or no graphics.
If you have a serial port on the workstation, then you can use a serial console.
If you have a workstation class motherboard then you can probably even enter the BIOS via serial line or via Ethernet. This will depend on your motherboard.
Lastly, you can always temporarily use a graphic board to install the system. Then remove it after you installed the OS. (Test remote access first).
I am looking to build a compute workstation.  I want to install the newest version of Scientific Linux.  The issue is that the currently planned hardware does not include graphics (external or integrated)  I have tried googling if installing linux in runmode 3 is possible without a graphics chip, however I have found conflicting information.  I have seen sources (none of the very reliable) stating:
What I am wondering, is would it be possible to boot a different computer with a USB install of SL, modify the install to boot into runmode 3 and enable remote access, then boot/install the server with the USB.
