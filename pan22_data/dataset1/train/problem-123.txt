It does approximately what you want. You can use it like this:
Now, you also want to exclude the host itself from the list of ip addresses. You can do this by modifying the {% for %} like this:
Instead of ansible_host, you might need to use ansible_fqdn or ansible_nodename. You must check what works for you.
I two groups of hosts: dc1 and dc2. Also combined to a DC group.
I need to pass a list of IP addresses of hosts from a foreign DC to a command. with_items doesn't work here at all.
1. Get list of hosts in group DC excluding ones from host primary group. Not sure if that's possible at all, so the dirty way is to set a remote_dc variable (or array).
2. Let's say we have a list of hosts from p.1: groups[remote_dc]. How to use it as a key fro hostvars[ key ]['ansible_eth1']['ipv4']['address'] and get result as a list?
For now I had to use a very dirty way: I've created a remote_addresses list for each DC group and iterated like this:
So is there a proper way to implement p.1 and p.2 and omit manual creation of the ip addresses list?
