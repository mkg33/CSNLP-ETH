I had an Amazon EC2 instance with EBS only disk - 8 GB disk. I needed some more space so I increased the volume to 320 GB. Then, I no longer needed all that space so I wanted to decrease the volume, but saw that it is impossible to decrease a volume size. So, I detached the volume, created a new volume with 32 GB, and attached it to my instance. However, now my instance does not start. When I try to start it from the console, it remains stopped. So, my questions are:
For me Creating a new volume of required size and migrating the existing data is the right way to save the storage cost you are not using, as I don't think there is another way to reduce the size of the original volume.
