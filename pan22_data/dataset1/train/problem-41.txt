On Windows 7, pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete and selecting Task manager would almost always hide any full screen apps to the taskbar. In the case it didn't, it at least did put the task bar over the stuck application.
I had a stuck at loading on windows 10, and none of those tricks from Win7 worked. I could get into the Ctrl+Alt+Del menu. I could select Task manager, but the frozen program was still on fullscreen.
I eventually solved the issue by logging out, but that also closed other windows that I'd rather not have closed.
Is there an alternative to what I used to do on Windows 7? Maybe some registry fiddling would make the fullscreen mode more stable?
This is a really common problem for me with games. The game will freeze and lock up the whole pc. I can open apps in the background, but the game is stuck displaying over everything and I can't access anything else because it takes priority visually over everything else. So far, the best solution for me came randomly a while ago. Press Windows Key + Tab and you will have the option to open another desktop instance. You can use this instance to close the frozen program using task manager.
