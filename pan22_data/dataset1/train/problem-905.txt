To test 'text boxes' in an application of mine, I need the physical keyboard to output Japanese to the screen. Does anyone know how this can be done?
The application is in a Virtual Machine (VMPlayer) running Windows Server 2008 R2. VMPlayer is on a Windows 7 64 bit machine to which the keyboard is connected too.
I've already tried the set the following 'Keyboard and Languages' option in Control Panel of the Windows 7 machine but the keyboard still outputs English on screen of the Windows 7 screen. So getting this to work on the VM is still far away.
The first thing we want to do here is remove the useless "Japanese" input method (that is highlighted in the dialog in the question) so that only the "Microsoft IME" remains. 
But you see how the Remove button is grayed out?  That doesn't mean removing the "Japanese" method is disallowed. The reason it is grayed out is simply that the default language in the combo box at the top of the window is set to Japanese plus that particular input method.  Switch that default language to English, and then you can remove the Japanese method from the Japanese keyboard.
If you do not remove this Japanese method, it will always be the default method for Japanese when a new application is started, regardless of whether it is above or below Microsoft IME in this dialog!
To use the Japanese keyboard, you can press Left Shift + Alt.  You will see "JP Japanese (Japan)" appear in the language bar along with a red icon and "Microsoft IME".  Unfortunately, you're still not ready to enter Japanese, because it is likely the "A Input mode" (Half-Width Aphanumeric). Use Ctrl+Caps Lock to switch to "„ÅÇ Input Mode". This is the mode in which romaji turns to hiragana and then kanji selection.
