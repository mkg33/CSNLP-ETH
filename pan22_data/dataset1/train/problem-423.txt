I shall assume your problem box has these settings:
Now proceed as follows, using two boxes TEMPAD (with ip 192.168.11.100, say) and TEMPDNS (with 192.168.11.200, say):
Note: The fourth step disrupts connectivity from TEMPDNS to your 192.168.10.* LAN, but your remote session is stillworking because it is actually originating from TEMPAD in the 192.168.11.* LAN
In step 6 the following magic happens (I hope):  The machine asks its configured DNS server 192.168.10.2 (i.e., TEMPDNS) for the address of an AD server. It gets as a reply your original AD servers in 192.168.10.* and 192.168.11.200 (i.e., TEMPAD). Connection attempts to the 192.168.10.* AD servers fail, so ultimately 192.168.11.200 is tried (as I said, it may be better to avoid the attempts to connect 192.168.10.* by crippling the DNS on TEMPDNS). The connection to 192.168.11.200 succeeds: We have a working forward route 192.168.10.36 -> 192.168.10.1=TEMPDNS -> TEMPAD and backward rout TEMPAD -> 192.168.10.200=TEMPAD -> 192.168.10.36.
Once all repairs have completed, don√Ñt forget to undo all the crap above.
I've always had success with the "Offline NT password & Registry Editor" found here
No Linux experience required, just follow the instructions to get it onto a CD / USB stick, and go through the prompts (mostly just using the defaults) to re-enable the disabled Admin account and then reset its password.
