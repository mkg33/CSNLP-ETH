You would only use a non-local gateway under very unusual circumstances. For example, if you had more than one local path to the same machine or had a default gateway with a VRRP address. You are not in any such unusual circumstances, so you should set the default gateway to something local.
IP routes on a hop by hop basis. Each device needs to know an appropriate next hop for every destination it might want to reach. But, in normal circumstances, it does not need to know or care what happens after that. So if you have no local device that will work as a default gateway, you cannot reach the Internet. You can only reach a device that's not local through some device that is local. So your default gateway should be the IP address of that local device.
I have successfully put my modem in bridge mode so that i can now reach my pfsense in the browser via the static IP provided by my ISP.
The problem i am facing now is no internet connection. 
These are the settings i pulled from my modem before putting it in bridge mode: 
I gave the WAN interface on pfsense the static IP from ISP. When entering the default gateway address as seen in the image (10.xx.255.x17), i got "not in subnet" message. After i enabled the advanced option "Use non-local gateway", it accepted the gateway address but i had no internet connection.
