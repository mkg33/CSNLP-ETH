Identifiers are limited to 63 bytes by default, which doesn't qualify as "extremely long". Quote from the manual:
Besides the need to recompile that might give pause, increasing NAMEDATALEN by a large margin is not very good idea, because every single identifier stored in the catalog will consume that size, no matter its length.
To me, the only reasonable way to show arbitrary long column names would be to implement it in the client-side presentation layer. Storing the names themselves could be done in the SQL column comments as you suggest, or in your own custom metadata table. The presentation layer could retrieve that data at the start of the session and cache it so that it would be essentially transparent for the rest of the SQL.
For query writing purposes I want to have nice short actual column names.
However, from my actual data source, I have an extremely long "canonical" name for each field.  (This was the column name in the source.)
When showing my query results, I would like to show these long column names.
