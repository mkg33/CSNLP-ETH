I have found that not all memory plays "nicely" well together....especially when using different vendors.  I'd suggest returning the memory and try a different vendor.  
You should be sure you are installing memory in appropriate matching slots.  Each manufacturer is a bit different in how more memory should be added and where memory must be placed within the slots.  You'll have to consult the vendor documentation.
You do not say, but I assume that all the memory is ECC.  Mixing ECC and non-ECC has been problematic for me.
On some systems BIOS modifications need to be made for any memory enhancement.
