I figured i'd share my method which worked to hide VM from Windows/Task MGR (It's also got less needless stuff and is easier to read). I was not trying to activate Solidworks but IMO this thread is more about hiding your running in a VM and maybe should be edited as such. Anyway...
Add the following to your domain.xml and make sure to completley remove the CPU Section
The official way of activating Solidworks server on KVM is to apply for a "Activation Exempt licensing for SolidWorks".  We do this through the reseller, but possibly could be done directly through Solidworks support.
Solidworks sends a license file that Solidworks License Manager loads through the Advanced Options of the Server Administration tab.
Given that the last two years it has taken more than 2 weeks for Solidworks to send the license file, it would be nice to have them not blacklist KVM.
Solidworks has an "Enhancement Request" open with the title: "Provide SNL Server support for VM KVM Qemu Libvirt." ER # 1-9482749288  I found it by logging in to Solidworks portal, finding the Enhancement Request link, and typing KVM.
Please leave a comment on this Enhancement Request!  Hopefully they'll decide KVM is a legitimate virtualization environment.
