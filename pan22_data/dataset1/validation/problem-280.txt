I know the question is pretty common, but I not seems to find good answer.
Setup is following - there is webserver and there is a folder where Apache (user www-data) create directories and upload / delete files.
The webmaster may decide to add or delete some files.
Most hosting setups uses same user for both Apache and webmaster.
I was able to do it inside the folder itself by setting chmod 770 and making a group that include both users, but I was not able to do it for subfolders.
I would use 664 (rw-rw-r--) instead of 770 (rwxrwx---) for files (default is (rw-r--r--), so files can be read by everyone 
For directories (where default is rwxr-xr-x) you need the execution bit to enter the directory and access files.
With setgid newly created files automatically belong to the group of the directory (and not to the default group of the user who created the file),
If your directory is /var/www/html and your group with write permission is www-data, this is all you need:
You can add the verbose -v option to the above commands to see what was changed.
