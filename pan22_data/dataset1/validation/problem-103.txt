Looks like you're selecting the Unit of Measure (UoM) id column instead of the value column.
You'll need to make sure you replace the [fimensions unit of measure id] column with [dimensions unit of measure VALUE] column
NOTE: I'll assume your table are named product and unit; please replace those with the actual names if you try to use any of this.
If every row in product has a valid  weight or dimension unit of measure ID- that is to say, if none of the IDs is NULL, and all ID values actually exist in unit - then you can do this with an INNER JOIN.
If some rows in product have a NULL value in that field, or have a value that doesn't match the actual ids in unit, and you'd still want those product rows to show up in your results, then you need to use an OUTER JOIN.
I'll construct a demonstration query using a LEFT OUTER JOIN for both IDs. IF you have a row where the actual unit row can't be found, then that unit name will come out as NULL:
When joining to the same table twice, you must use a table alias so you can tell which joined table you're referring to.
