I imagine you would want penetration tester to sit in the less secure / outsize zone.  So, plug the Internet link, pen testing server/service, and Dell server into an 'outside' VLAN on the switch.  Plug your computers and Dell into the 'inside' VLAN on the switch.  Make the Dell the layer 3 gateway for both inside endpoints.  No routing on the switch, the Dell is the layer 3 gateway and firewall which has 2 interfaces (whether physical or logical).
I currently setting up my home network with a Dell PowerEdge R300 running pfSense as my router and a Cisco Catalyst 3560G switch. In the end I want to have two separate networks, one that is connected to the internet with a LAN, and another that consists of only LAN for pen-testing and various other things that I want to have completely cut off from the internet.
Is this achievable through VLANS or other pfSense configurations? Would the VLAN be configured in pfSense, on my switch, or both?
If this is not achievable through VLANS, what would be the best method? I would prefer not to run a second routing machine but I will if I have to.
