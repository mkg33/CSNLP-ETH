It's correct as far as it goes, but there's more. The view vector goes from the shading point to the eye point, but it's normalized (divided by its length so that it has length 1). So if you're shading $p$ and the eye is at the origin, the view vector is $\tfrac{-p}{|-p|}$.
It's not always this simple, because the "eye" isn't always at the origin. In a scanline rasteriser, you use the view transform to move things to the origin, because that's the only way to make the projection work - but not in a ray-tracer. The camera can be anywhere in a ray-tracer, and when you trace secondary rays (for reflections, refractions, or some other effects), it's definitely not in the same place as the camera.
In the case you're working on right now, it sounds like you can just normalize $-p$, but you need to remember that it's really the direction from the shading point to the eye point, so that you can do the right thing when the eye point isn't the origin.
All the books and reference I have read say that the view vector is calculated by subtracting the point where eye is at, from the point where we want to calculate light. But since, eye is at (0, 0, 0) the view vector would be just the negative of the point where eye is at? Is my understanding correct?
