I had a Voip server die on me in the last 3 months.  Die, perhaps isn't the best word, since the machine would be bootable after a kernel panic.  Typically, the machine would function flawlessly between 7am and 7pm.  Then, at random intervals separated by 1-30 days, it would be locked-up and unresponsive at the system console when I returned to the office at 7am.
After about 12 iterations of this situation... which invariably happened between 11pm and 7am, it was determined that the motherboard had failed, and specifically, the capacitors were to blame.  I think I read somewhere that temperature extremes can hasten this death.  I suppose my small office is not unusual, but I typically allowed the temperatures to swing as much as 15 degrees F above and 20 degrees below 75 degrees during the off hours.  So, I believe, that small-time operations, that aren't using a chilled data center, are likely to suffer temperature induced failures during the wee hours of the morning.
My recollection, again, is that the logs showed failure during the 8 hours before we opened our shop in the morning -- always.
Typical "working hours" are no more than 40 hours of a week. Less in some parts of the world. A week contains a total of 168 hours. 40/168 = less than 24% of the time of a week is 'working hours'.
That suggests that failures of systems that are running 24/7 will occur 3-times more often during non-working hours than working hours.
Obviously, there are many other considerations that could go into this; multiple shifts, peak times (which for many, might further bias failures toward non-working hours), etc.
