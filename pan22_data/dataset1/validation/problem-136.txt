I would go with Fiber, there is the possibility that in the future we might hit a dead end in how much speed can be had from copper. I mean twisted pair is as old as the telephone, now sure that means that it has had plenty of time to mature, but there exists the possibility of multiple colors running on the same fiber.
Most of the key issues have been mentioned - Fiber is easier to handle, weighs less, makes for a much neater environment and has better range (generally). As LapTop006 mentioned one consequence of this is that the port density on switches is generally higher for fiber, you'll find that many modular switches support a higher SFP+ port count than either CX4 (Twin-AX) or 10GBase-T (STP).
One other key difference is that at the moment 10GBase-T consumes more power per port than CX4 and in turn CX4 consumes more power than SFP+. That may not be of significance if you are only connecting up a few links but if you are building out a significant infrastructure then this may be something you need to pay attention to.
