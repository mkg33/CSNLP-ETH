Only 1% of the tables (that I see) use or need PARTITION.
This may sound naive, however, a partitioned table is essentially no different from any other table from the outside:
The big difference is the speed at which a query can be run against a table when using an appropriate where clause.
For example: if you have 1000 lego blocks, equally distributed between 3 different colors, and you are looking for one that you know is green and has your name written on it, you are only going to "partition" your search through the legos by looking only at the GREEN lego blocks. You are only going to look through 1/3 of your whole set. 
Similarly, if you partition a table according to a certain column, date is always a good example, and you are trying to find an entry in that table where the approximate time is known, you mysql will only attempt to search only in a subset (a partition if you will) of the whole table. So to answer your question: ensure that if you DO use partitioning, that the majority of your queries will include a where clause referring to the partitioning key. 
If my lego example was to abstract, or anything else sounds wierd: i would advice reading up on: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/partitioning-overview.html
