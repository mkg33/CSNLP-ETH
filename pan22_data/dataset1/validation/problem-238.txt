There have been many changes in file sharing (SMB) from XP to Vista/7, one of them being on the authentication method.
You could try making the Win7 machines go back to using NTLMv1 (Google "windows 7 NTLMv1") but this is a bad idea.
You have an environment that is outdated beyond imagination. I would not even think about fixing ANYTHING in it, sincerely.
To get you started on the Right Path (TM), start studying the implementation of CentOS 7 to replace both Fedora/RedHat, preferibly on a new machine. Transferring the old files and setting up file sharing will be a piece of cake (relatively speaking).
That being said, I'm not familiar with jBase and it looks like legacy software. Contact the vendor to check if they support a newer Linux distribution. If not, I would consider migrating from it (and hiring a dedicated sysadmin or contracting with a service provider to maintain your servers).
Go to: Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Local Security Policy
"Network security: LAN Manager authentication level" -> Send LM & NTLM responses
"Minimum session security for NTLM SSP" -> uncheck: Require 128-bit encryption
