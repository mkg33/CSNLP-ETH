In SQL Server it is best to store DataTime as one field. If you create an index on DataTime column it can be used as Date search and as DateTime search. Therefore if you need to limit all records that exist for the specific date, you can still use the index without having to do anything special. If you need to query for time portion you will not be able to use the same index and therefore if you have a business case where you care more about the time of the day than DateTime, you should store it separately as you will need to create an index on it and improve performance.
Indeed, that's a pity there is no standard cross-DBMS type for this (like INT and VARCHAR are for integers and string values). The 2 cross-database approaches I have met so far are using VARCHAR/CHAR columns to store DataTime values as strings formatted according to the ISO 8601 (more convenient, human-readable) standard and using BIGINT to store them as POSIX timestamps (stored more efficiently, faster, easier to manipulate mathematically).
