This is what I would start looking into at this point.
If you have another instance of SQL Server running on your machine on the same port.  In my experience; having run SQL Server and then have installed Visual Studios where an instance of SQL is installed , and it become a race condition on who owns the port.
Enter your services (Crtl R)  for the run box type services.msc to load the services manager.
From there locate SQL Server and disable the service you are not using and restart the desired SQL Server and then try to connect.
I just installed MS SQL Server 2014 a couple days ago and it was working fine until today. I attempted to connect using the Object Viewer and I got the error message 
 A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake.(provider: Shared Memory Provider, error: 0 - Mo process is on the other end of the pipe.) (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 233)
The consensus seems to be that the issue is caused either by Named Pipes being disabled in my SQL Server Configuration Manager or that Named Pipes come before TCP/IP in the protocol order. I have made sure that my protocol order is appropriate. I have it set to Shared Memory first, TCP/IP Second and lastly Named Pipes. Another source said that my port might be blocked but I already have a working rule on my firewall to allow access to the default port which is 1433 in my case. 
Another source said that I need to click the Allow Remote Connections under server properties in SQL Serer Server Manager but every time I right-click and click properties the program crashes...
