You should type 192.168.100.1 this should let you into the modem web console (just like your router) once you are inside browse through option and figure it out. Mine says service provider is allowing 2 computers to be connected under the same modem MAC address. But only one computer is recognized. So it could only be two things either your ISP provider is a fraud and violated your privacy or the technical guys who install the modem can clone your stuff. If you live in an apartment then you are screwed like me. They use a server (Ubuntu) to pipe through and filter your Internet. You can only get what they want you to see. They can control a lot of stuff. I'm sure that your ISP knows all about it. Hope this helps. 
Most of the "MAC Cloning" writeups you find on the internet are now out-of-date, as security enhancements from way back in the DOCSIS 1.1 days have given ISPs a way to prevent these attacks.
To be a lot more specific, there is a mechanism called BPI+ which, if your ISP requires it, will ensure that people attempting to clone MAC addresses can NOT sign on. The problem is, it won't be too easy to find the person at your ISP who can actually confirm whether or not they require all modems to use BPI+. But, odds are, they do require it.
Years ago, it was common to find networks that'd let you sign on without BPI, but it's pretty rare today, so the most likely theory is that your home network really was correctly implicated in this DMCA complaint.
