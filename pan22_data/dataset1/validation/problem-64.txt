Before anything : your code looks nice and seems to be properly commented which is a good point. It could have been a good idea to give a pointer to some reference (wikipedia or anything else) as your implementation does not seem to rely on the usual sieve but on some kind of optimisation of it.
This being said, from my point of view, a bit too long as you are using too many blank lines and too many lines for comment. There is only so much text I can fit on my screens, I'd rather read this :
Everything else I was about to say has just been said by vnp.
As there has already been said something on newlines and braces I will just highlight the "normal java" way of placing braces. As I highlighted in multiple answers of mine, the usual way is to place the opening brace on the same line as the opening statement and the closing brace on a separate line.
And in this short code-sample there are again 3 things I want to put out a comment on:
Single operation if-statements should have braces placed, even though they are not required. Why? Have you heard of apple's goto fail; bug? They forgot to place the braces and broke a core functionality of iOS.
Your Numbers[i] contains true. Why not evaluate that directly??
is actually exactly the same as the following, given Numbers is of type boolean[]
the Naming convention for java fields, methods and variables is camelCase. This means they usually start with a lowercase letter:
