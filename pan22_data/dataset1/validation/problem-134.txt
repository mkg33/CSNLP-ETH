It's solid. I've been running Windows XP/7 on a mac mini for years. If you have enough hardware resources (CPU, Disk, RAM) it's really nothing to worry about.
Macs are more expensive in terms of price the quality is well worth it. Macs are better (quality) than OEM value-added desktop manufacturers (Dell, HP, etc.). I tend to think of the mac as a better alternative to a PC as macs can have a foothold in two worlds (windows and osx) where as windows pcs cannot (excluding hackintoshes of course).
If you're debating on whether it's a good purchase or not, you should approach it more functionally and see if the programs you need will run with windows via bootcamp OR vmware/parallels. 
From my personal experience, using Windows on Mac are just fine both in Bootcamp and in VMWare.
You might want to take a look here, where apple lists the requirements for running windows through bootcamp.
Basically, if your OS can run Lion 10.7, and you have 16+GB of hard drive space (this is the absolute minimum, but I would recommend more since you want to install applications on the windows partition).
