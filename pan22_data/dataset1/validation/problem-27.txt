Almost all desktops have this or similar hardware:
How do I go about upgrading 500 Desktops and Laptops from Windows 7 to Windows 8 in the most efficient way possible?
Depending on how similar your hardware is (or at least with those machines that are similar) you could install Windows 8 on one of those machines and make a complete disk backup and copy it over to all the similar machines' disk. Though I'm not really sure what you refer to as "similar". I prefer Linux and disk dump (dd) for that, but alike Windows software exists, if you prefer using Windows.
Updating 500 machines isn't something trivial. If all those machines are seperately configured you should maybe change your setup. What about a single boot image you make available through a server to let those 500 machines boot off it? This way you would only have to update one version of Windows, though we don't know anything about the purpose of these machines and how they are currently set up.
Nevertheless this is going to be a huge PITA and there's absolutely no reason I can think of that would demand for an upgrade from Windows 7 to 8. Windows 7 is much more stable and reliable, which an enviroment like yours likely relies on. (You should at least use Windows 8.1, but seriously: Stay on Windows 7) Also, (I hope this is needless) never change a running system ;)
Anyhow, you will need to provide us with more information on your problem.
