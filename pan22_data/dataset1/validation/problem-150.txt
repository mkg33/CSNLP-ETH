The display’s specs (manual page 58) are very clear on this:
Some other model can also do it over Dual Link DVI, though it’s not entirely clear whether the G2770PF can. It most certainly won’t work over Single Link DVI or HDMI.
I put this question in Arquade but was told to move it here:
I recently bought an AOC G2770PF 144hz 1ms Monitor which you can check out here: https://www.amazon.com/AOC-G2770PF-Freesync-DisplayPort-Speakers/dp/B013YIR5WU
Currently, i don't have a Desktop Computer so I am running this on my laptop you can check it here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015PYZI8E/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&me=
Anyways, The Monitors 'Extra' Tab on the OCD shows:
Which, of course, is odd considering the monitor literally shows 144hz on the Frame. I am using a Male HDMI and Male DVI-D cable to connect the two (I'm not sure if this is the problem or not) I mainly play csgo on 1400x1050 resolution so I thought that since HDMI 1.3+ can (apparently) support 144hz @ 1920x1080 that I could of course play on 144hz on a resolution less than 1920x1080. when I checked the csgo console command "mat_info" it said that I was running 1400x1050@60hz what is the problem? Also im not to sure what the version of my laptop's HDMI port supports (1.3,1.4,2.0 etc;) would this mean that i cant run on 144hz on HDMI to HDMI?
