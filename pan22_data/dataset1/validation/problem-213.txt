I'm having trouble setting up a reverse proxy with apache 2.4.6 on RHEL7.5.
I have the following virtualhost which sends requests to 3 backends:
which means that the ProxyPass directive is not matching my request. I have also tried wrapping the ProxyPass* directives within a <Location> directive but it did not work either.
Trying an equivalent rule (v1) with RewriteRule works as expected, balancing requests between the 3 servers:
I can see that the requests are matching the proper VirtualHost, since I'm seeing the redirects, but I can't fathom why the ProxyPass is seemingly being ignored.
I've checked and apache is loading the modules (confirmed also by the server-info handler):
I have other servers with similar setups running apache v2.4.6 on RHEL7.4 and apache 2.2.15 on RHEL6.5 which work. I can't find any difference in loaded modules between the RHEL7 servers, but still one works and the other doesn't.
There's probably some difference in configuration which I'm missing. The configuration is mostly default, with changes only to files in /etc/httpd/conf.d (the above virtualhost is contained in its own file).
What is failing here? Why doesn't the ProxyPass directive work?
RewriteRule gets processed at runtime before ProxyPass. The catchall RewriteRule will match everything. Remove that rule and use ErrorPage directives instead.
