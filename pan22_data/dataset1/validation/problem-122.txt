If you have the enterprise version of the software (easily determined by the presence of an "admin" folder in the root directory structure), you can run setup /admin and create an msp file. Put the msp file in the updates directory and run setup (from a logon script or similar); the setup program will now follow whatever settings you put in the msp file.
If you don't have an enterprise version (you get what you pay for); you have to install it manually on every computer (or do something different like AppV).
Sorry, you are "done" - MS does not support MSI installation but pushes people to online script, as you found out. An "EASY" way does not exist - you can take WIX, write your own cusom action and push out the exchange install in it, but this is not an easy way (especially the possible rollback scenario).
I sugest geting the (official) logon script working. The script at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff602181.aspx works fine for me - note that "double click" is not the same as starting via GPO (where it runs with elevated priviledges).
