I am trying to log slow serial data (about 40 bytes per minute at 9600 baud) on the Pi.
I have a rough program using wiringSerial which only provides unbuffered serialGetchar
I could write a serialGets but wonder if/why it hasn't been done before.
PS The last time I wrote something like this was in the 1980s on CP/M
I want the equivalent of fgets(), and was going to write this using serialGetchar but the timeout caused problems, requiring post processing.
I realised the required functionality was already in the kernel, it just required different initialisation.
Do you need to write a program for this or can you just use basic Unix commands? Could you provide us more details on what you want to achieve...
Assuming you serial port is connected through your USB port. You can easily log incoming bytes from serial port by redirecting (or simply listening) the right interface file, such as:
In the same way, you can write on the serial port:
To find out on which interface file your device is available, check /var/log/dmesg or issue a lsusb.
