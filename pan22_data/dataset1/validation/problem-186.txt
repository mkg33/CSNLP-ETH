Now, these are ports that are reliant on your router, and not you're PC that you're streaming with however, the data streaming is most likely occurring on one of these.
To find which port your PC is actually using to stream content to xbox, you'll want to run an nmap scan on your PC's local address, and your Xbox's local address.
a) nmap -sS -sU -p 1-65535 -T4 -A -v 192.168.1.ip_of_your_xbox
b) nmap -sS -sU -p 1-65535 -T4 -A -v 192.168.1.ip_of_your_pc

This command will reset all changes made this process:
This command will delete all rules on your firewall (Not that good of an idea)
Delete all rules: netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule all
