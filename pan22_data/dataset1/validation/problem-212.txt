The most fail-safe method is to take down the master database, and copy the binary datbase files from the master to the slave, bring them both up and start the replication. With 350Gb of tables, I can understand this could be a problematic solution. You can gain some time by making the copy the fastest you can, which usually means copying to an entirely other set of disks on the master server. Then you can bring the master back up and you can take your time moving the copy over a slower network link.
Copying MyISAM files out from underneath MySQL will work, or at least I know it did in the days of MySQL v3 and v4. (Make sure you have the slave shutdown when you run myisamchk.) However, this doesn't work for InnoDB files.
There is a tool called "MySqL Hot Backup" or some such will is also capable of doing all this in a cleverer way. The catch is that you may have to pay for it, at least for InnoDB support.
Have you LVM enabled? If yes, you could use it to create snapshot of partition without shutting mysql and then you could mount snapshot and copy files from it. Here is article describing the method.
If you could shutdown database, you could copy raw data files. Just remember to correct record your master information.
