I cannot say for sure why RMAN behaves in this way, but as a workaround you can edit the resulting script within the same workflow in EM before the job is created:
 ALLOCATE CHANNEL disk1 DEVICE TYPE DISK FORMAT '/disk1/%d_backups/%U';
This will ensure the backups are placed in the destination you specified regardless of RMAN settings in control file saved with CONFIGURE command.
On one database, the Oracle-Suggested Backup scheduled from Enterprise Manager always ends up in the recovery area, despite RMAN configuration showing that device type disk format points elsewhere.
As far as I can see, the scheduled backup job is simply:
Asking RMAN to show all reveals that device type disk is indeed configured to store elsewhere:
If I run the script manually,  the backupset is placed at the above location, when the script is run from the job scheduler the backupset goes to the RECO group on ASM,
Why might Oracle still choose to dump the backupset to the db_recovery_file_dest? 
Ultimately, how can I change the backup destination?
