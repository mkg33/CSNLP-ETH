Calling this effect "the table" is misleading, like talking about "the BIOS". Each videocard has a BIOS, but they're not the same. Each manufacturer has its own, and will likely evolve add functionality to it for new products. VESA just descibes some common parts, not everything.
A bit late but I think I have found something that you or others finding this page could find useful.
In a driver for 64-bit for GMA 3150 I found a Vbios.zip which contains three files with the same name.
An executable that runs only in 32-bit windows (probably the Vbios flashing tool), a .dat file that if opened with a hex editor is clearly the Vbios as it states such in the first line, and a .bsf file that if opened with notepad explains what the numbers at each offset are.
This is way over my head as I don't understand low-level hardware coding, but someone might find this interesting. Especially as this info does not seem to be GMA-3150-specific, although it is a bit outdated (as the GMA's architecture for that matter).
I'm hosting it on my dropbox, but spread the news and rehost this if you can.
I'm including the official support page where they give you driver and this package (and say they do)
