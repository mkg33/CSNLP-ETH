I routinely backup (copy) all my Android phone's files to a portable hard drive using my PC.
My old phone died. They sent me a new one. I restored all my old files to the new phone, but my old contacts did not restore. 
What have I done wrong? Is there some trick to restoring files?
Think of Contacts1.1 as a Windows program that reads it's data from a location that user cannot change... Say, C:\Users\sam\contacts\... You backup your C:\Users\sam\ directory, and restore it on another Windows machine that has Contacts2.0 installed. Now, your contacts are in the new system as binary data, but if Contacts2.0 is reading them from C:\Program Files\Contats only, you wont be able to see them.
You could manually move them, but what if they are also in different format?
In a real scenario, database fields might be different.
That's why you manually export/import data to/from a format that is supported on every version of that program. Program then stores the data as it likes.
Windows Mail client for example uses .eml, Outlook uses .pst, and Contacts uses .vcf.
