I used clustering on my dataset. Now when I'm trying to use a LASSO with cv to predict a response, one of the variables it takes into consideration is which cluster a new point is classified into.(I included the cluster variable as a predictor to see if being in a particular group affects the response) 
Since the information on all variables is already captured by the cluster variable,using it again in the Lasso model with some other variables,does it become redundant/biased?
I think that by doing so, you have expanded the feature space, and I don't think that this additional variable is redundant. 
The cluster categorical variable is a linear combination of the other variables. When you apply Lasso on the dataset, the categorical variable undergoes one-hot encoding and Lasso would pick a subset of values given a level of regularisation. Suppose in the best performing regularisation parameter, Lasso picked clusters 1,3,7 out of clusters 1 - 10; These pockets of clusters might not be picked up using just Lasso on the other variables without the cluster variable.
