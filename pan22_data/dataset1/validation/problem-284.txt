It depends of what features you motherboard supports.  To expand a RAID array, it may be necessary to reallocate the data and resync the disks to accommodate the new array.  So I would not rely on it.
Probably no.  Hardware RAID implementations are very hardware-dependent.  I doubt there is a standard on how to implement a RAID, so each vendor does its own implementation.  One should think the RAID levels are a low-level standard, but they are, in fact, a conceptual description of how the array organizes data.  The low-level implementation may be different so the RAID arrays are mostly not interchangeable.  If you implement a RAID array with a specific controller, that array will probably only work with that controller.
If one of your drives fail (remember that RAID-5 only supports the failure of one drive at once), there are two possible situations:
I feel that for a home-based implementation of RAID, you should avoid hardware RAID implementation and rely on a RAID implementation based in software.  They are not that evil as many think they are (the performance gain are almost the same), they are easier to handle, and they are much more interchangeable with new hardware than any hardware implementation.  So think about it.  :-)
Windows offers software RAID implementations in Windows 10.  To build a RAID-5 you should use the layout "Parity".  I am just not sure if this feature is restricted for some editions of Windows (since you use Windows 10 Home edition), so you will need to check.
I'm considering to build a RAID5 storage from three 8TB hard drives inside my PC being run under Windows 10 Home (if it matters). In my motherboard's manual I can see instructions how to setup RAID5 and it seems to be easy. My biggest concerns are:
