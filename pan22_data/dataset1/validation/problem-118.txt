I've been in charge of hiring for game programmers, been an interviewer, etc. and can say that degree really doesn't matter. I've worked with electrical engineers, people without any degree, and plenty of computer science guys.
That being said, you're still going to have to be spectacular. Personally, when I interview, I dig into algorithmic complexity, optimization, and continually probe until I find a topic the candidate doesn't know and, at that point, have them figure it out. So, you may have some catching up to do.
Remember, it's not just about knowledge. It's about thought process, as well. You need to be able to solve problems, even when they are completely out of your realm of comfort.
Read this blog post. If you're afraid of what it's saying, challenge that fear with knowledge. You're going to need to know everything to get a solid job. You'll need to know more than this, as I'll expect you to know everything here AND as much related to games.
Write games. When I get a resume from someone who hasn't even built a side project game, I typically chuck it. I know that sounds harsh; but, I need someone who'll understand what I'm talking about when/if things are on fire. In games, there's very little time for hand holding.
Write a lot of games. You're going to need to learn about collision, scene graphs, space partitioning, networking, etc. Build games (start small) that let you understand these.
Write games with other people. You're going to need to fail, and hard. The fastest way to fail is to add more people to your team. If you can overcome these challenges, you'll learn a lot. I need people who can work with artists, designers, other engineers, and executives.
I am a 19 year old who has always been interested in video & computer games. I developed the interested for game programming about three months ago and started researching on the profession. The only degrees always suggested on the internet and in books are those of computer science, physics, mathematics, & game development. BSc Information Technology has been my major for the past two years; and even though my university teaches we the I.T. students computer programming (in c++, c#, java) and offers us the opportunity to undertake some computer science courses of our choice in addition to the regular I.T. courses, I am feeling insecure about my prospects in getting into the profession. My question is: Will a game development company hire me if I exhibit good math, physics and game programming skills with an I.T. degree? If NO, will I have to obtain an MSc in a much more related course.
