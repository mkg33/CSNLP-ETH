your boot process sure calls an init script, you have to add the NFS mount on that script.
The init script will receive the variables passed to the kernel at boot time, among the ones you find the NFS mounting parameters.
I want a client which loads kernel and file system from the server through network.
Till now, On server side, i changed the settings in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf to get an ip-address to the client. After that i executed service isc-dhcp-server restart command.
I built openwrt kernel image openwrt-x86-generic-vmlinuz by downloading necessary packages
I created one directory with name /tftpboot and i copied pxelinux.0 from /usr/lib/pxelinux.0 to /tftpboot
And i also copied openwrt-x86-generic-vmlinuz in /tftpboot
Inside /tftpboot i created one directory with name pxelinux.cfg
append boot=nfs root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=nfs:server-ip:/tftpboot ip=dhcp rw
At client side , i restarted system and i selected the boot options to pxe booting
It is loading the kernel openwrt-x86-generic-vmlinuz smoothly . Not mounting the file system which i had given in /etc/exports file
Now my question is how can i mount the filesystem from server to client while booting
or any other method to mount file system while booting
