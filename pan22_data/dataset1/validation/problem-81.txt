I was trying to get python and set up an environment to work on the upcoming project. 
In Windows 10 Ubuntu bash, I run the following command successfully:
sudo wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/Python-2.7.6.tgz
Then I unzipped it and type in some other commands too, until I found that I need gcc in one particular step which I didn't have. So I try the following command:
