The vast majority of hard disks today use 512-byte logical sectors. Some external enclosures and adapters, though, translate groups of eight 512-byte sectors into 4096-byte sectors. Doing so has certain advantages, but it makes it very difficult to safely move a disk from a direct connection to a connection involving an adapter that does such a translation. Changing the sector sizes in this way renders critical data structures, such as the partition table, invalid. If you start writing data with your USB adapter, you're almost certain to do additional harm to your disk.
To recover your data, you should first connect the disk in the way it was connected before your problems began, or at least find a way to connect it that will produce the same sector size as it had when it was connected normally. Only after you've connected your disk in this way will you be able to extract useful data for diagnosis and repair.
