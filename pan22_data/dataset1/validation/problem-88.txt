While looking at my mail queue I noticed the server was attempting to send back a bounce email, presumably to a spammer. Reading the error, I noticed that it was revealing the expanded value of a virtual alias. Is there any way to hide this address and keep it transparent?
local@myhost.tld email@destination.tld in the alias file, and here is the mail content:
Do not solve this problem. Solve the original problem.
There is no need to relay Spam. This is what you are doing here. You accept any mail and then forward all mails to a Google account. Google's Spam filter jumps in and rejects the mail.
So please think of replacing this strange mail setup. If you want to store any mail in Googlemail because it is convenient, then please use Google-Apps and move the MX of myhost.tld to Google's server farm. If it is a per user setting to forward mails to Google, then you have to filter for Spam and only forward the clean ones.
In general you should never bounce Spam mails. The bounces do not reach the correct person as 99.999% of all sender addresses are forged.
There is a better solution I will only sketch shortly.
For relaying mails to Google create a new transport and a corresponding service in master.cf. In the options of this particular smtp service set the -o bounce_service_name=discard. This should discard any bounce mail from Google. This will stop backscatter but if Google temporarily defers mail it won't be affected and retried later.
