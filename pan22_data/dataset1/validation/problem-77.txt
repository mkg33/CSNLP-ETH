The dimming of the screen is a Windows feature, but it does not include the fade in/out option that you mentioned.  To change the settings on this, you just need to adjust the power plan settings from Control Panel:
Depending on your setup, you may need to go into the advanced options to access the Dim the display setting.  If your computer has in fact done the fading when dimming the screen, then that's something specific to your model, as I have never seen it before.  What I have seen, and what happens on all my Dell and Lenovo laptops, is that when pressing the sleep button, it does fade out the screen (and to a lesser extent, fades it in when resuming).  My guess is that you have seen the fading on Sleep with your computer, and on dim with a Mac, and assumed that it happened that way on dimming for your computer.  
It doesn't sound windows specific.  Reading through the above solutions others gave the only other thing I could think of is that there MIGHT be a setting in your BIOS settings.  Also, if you have any specific software for settings that only exist for that machine.  Sometimes if Dell or ASUS puts out hardware that is very specific to that machine software often comes with it in order to tweak the settings on it.
