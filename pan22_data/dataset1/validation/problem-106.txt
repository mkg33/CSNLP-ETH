Looking at dump with Windbg shows this string \??\ACPI#INT3400#2&daba3ff&3#{ee27098e-1b22-472a-89d8-5ccce16b1356}
Which seams to be an "Intel DPTF Manager" or related driver. So look inf this driver was updated and rollback to older version.
Really hoping someone can help me. I'm at work and trying to fix one of our laptops. It's Dell Latitude E5450 running Windows 10.
A couple of hours ago (before I got in, unfortunately) it displayed a popup with an update from Dell. My coworker opted to install it and get it out of the way.
It rebooted as part of the update process, and began bluescreening with the error code: PNP_DETECTED_FATAL_ERROR.
It does this for a few times until it goes to the recovery menu. I can get into safe mode.
Here are the five latest Minidump files: minidumps
Nothing looks off in the device manager. There's three disabled devices, but all of them because of safe mode.
Dell support was.. Well, well-meaning and as helpful as they could be. Unfortunately, it seems like I know more than they did and their only solution as "reinstall".
I've tried similiar things with another latop a few months back. System restore worked then, but doesn't now.
I'm really hoping to save reinstalling as an absolutely last resort.
Anybody have any ideas on what could be wrong and what I can try to fix it?
