If it's complaining about services, then your best option is to look at the windows services.
Try opening your start menu, typing services.msc and hitting enter. This brings up the service management window. From here you can look for any audio related services that are disabled and enable them. After that restart your PC and see if it works. If it doesn't, disable it again and try any others.
Don't enable them all at once - go through them one by one until you find which one to keep. it is a long process, but keep in mind too many unnecessary services can really slow your PC down.
A number of people had the same problem and it was caused by AVG quarantining an audio file after the most recent Windows update. Restoring the files from the Virus Vault, and rebooting solved the problem. However, I inadvertently missed restoring some of the quarantined files having deleted them so my fix was to completely uninstall AVG, reboot, then back up my recents and do a system restore to before the update. And sound is back! Hope this helps others with the same issue. Thanks everyone for your help!
