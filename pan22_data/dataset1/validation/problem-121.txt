I have already dual boot on different HDD now I want install triple boot . On both HDD has Windows 7 I want install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS if I choose Install alongside Windows 7 then other OS Windows 7 will unused?
Triple booting may be possible. But you want to plan this. First, backup your system. Because I have done double and triple boots and there is a LOT that can go wrong. So you should do a bare metal backup of the whole partition onto an external hard disk or the cloud or whatever you like. You must, must back up. 
But I am not sure from the question exactly what you are trying to triple boot. A good site for discussing triple boots is:
though an archive article might have to be found in the site. 
But I'd say that rather than triple booting have you considered using Virtualbox instead? You could run an OS in a  virtual way? That would be simpler and not risk your data and bootloader and so on. Again, the dedoimedo site has articles on virtualisation. 
Sorry but I can't write a lot more. Triple booting 2 Linux partitions and 1 windows? Or 2 windows and 1 Linux? They would involve different considerations.
