Moser's proof of the constructive Lovasz Local Lemma.  He basically shows that, under the conditions of the local lemma, the second-simplest algorithm for SAT you can think of works.  (The first simplest might be to just try a random assignment until one works.  The second simplest is took pick a random assignment, find an unsatisfied clause, satisfy it, then see what other clauses you broke, recurse, and repeat until done.)  The proof that this runs in polynomial time is perhaps the most elegant use of information theory (or Kolmogorov complexity, whatever you want to call it in this case) I've ever seen.
Average-Case Analysis of Algorithms Using Kolmogorov Complexity by Jiang, Li, Vitanyi. 
'Analyzing the average-case complexity of algorithms is a very practical but very difficult problem in computer science. In the past few years we have demonstrated that Kolmogorov complexity is an important tool for analyzing the average-case complexity of algorithms. We have developed the incompressibility method [7]. In this paper we use several simple examples to further demonstrate the power and simplicity of such method. We prove bounds on the average-case number of stacks (queues) required for sorting sequential or parallel Queueusort or Stacksort.'
