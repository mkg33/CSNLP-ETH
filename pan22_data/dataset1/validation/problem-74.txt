You can't effectively get such a list.  You can use inotifywatch if you are using linux and your linux distribution supports it to see files being created and deleted in a directory in realtime, but not historically (such logs are not kept).
You should consider checking your filesystem for consistency if files are being lost.  In ext2 and some other filesystems they will appear in the lost+found folder in the partition root, but the exact way to identify this depends on your filesystem.
Check also whether you have a periodic job running which might delete them for some reason (such as by restoring a directory from a backup).
i have a image sharing website , users log and upload image 
last night i've lost about 30 newly-consecutive uploaded images ... i mean they have been uploaded ... apparently ... they are in the database but the actual image on the server is gone ! 
error log doesn't show anything ... so i thought my best option is to check list of created and deleted files ... if there is any !
is there a log file for created and deleted files on the server ? i'm using directadmin
