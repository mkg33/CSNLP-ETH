I tried adding additional info to the answer by sphilp but that edit got rejected because some people seem to think it's incorrect. I can assure you: it is not.
The Registered Servers functionality in SSMS can be used to connect to several servers in just a couple of clicks.  If you group the servers together by creating a New Server Group under the Local Server Groups node, you'll be able to right-click that group and select Object Explorer. This will open all servers in ... Object Explorer!

You can even influence the order in which the connections are opened (alphabetically).
If you use the SSMSBoost plugin, then you can set any of your preferred connections to "Connect object explorer at startup".
This option can be found on the SSMSBoost->Settings->Preferred Connections->List page of the connection.
Since I like having the master databases of all the instances I routinely work with at the top of my preferred list, I just enable this option for the ones I want to always have available in the Object Explorer.
