Was this for transferring a single file?  Also, is this performance consistent across multiple client machines?  For testing, your best test is to take a very large file (500MB or so) and transfer it.
If all of the above yield 10Mb speeds, the issue is your router.  If the performance is only slow when transferring to/from the NAS, then the issue is your Ubuntu setup (I'd guess network config, bad driver, etc).  If the issue is only from your current test machine, but the borrowed one works fine, then it's likely a driver issue or config (e.g. duplex setting).  
I recently built a NAS box on top of ubuntu server.  I have an average transfer of about 10mb/sec over gigabit wire to my computer.  I was hoping you guys could give recommendations on how to pinpoint where the bottleneck is in this system.  To my knowledge the router is only rated at 100mb/sec, and so are the nics (both server, and client), but shouldn't my files be transferring faster then 10mb/sec?  I made sure to shutdown all other traffic when getting the 10mb/sec baseline.
