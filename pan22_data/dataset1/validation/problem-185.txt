I'm trying to transfer the contents of some VERY old laptops which have Windows 3.1 on them. The only way I can manage this is via a serial cable (no network on the laptops).
I've got Kermit on the W3.1 end but it is playing up and won't run nicely, apart from being a pig of a UI which I can't get my head around.
So I'm after some alternatives for transferring the contents of a 2gb directory from the laptop over a serial link to the Vista PC.
Ideally, something open source would be great. I've looked at ripping out the HD from the laptops but they are so ancient that they are non-standard and won't fit in a PC any more.
A lightweight file transfer tool is available with Zip. It provides a command line tool that is run on the server end to wait for a connection and on the client to send and receive files. There are many options available and the software supports both serial and parallel cables (pinouts included).
As a bonus, the application includes a tool and instructions to copy itself to another machine with just an OS. Great tool to bootstrap communication to a factory controller with no slot for a network card, and routine floppy drive access is not practical.
