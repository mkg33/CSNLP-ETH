Use the route command to show your routing table. Typically, your computer will have a default route (possibly the last network interface added) through which all your traffic will be routed.
The default route will have a destination of 0.0.0.0 or maybe just the word 'default'. That's where your traffic is going through. You can change it with the route command also.

It may be possible to configure individual programs to bind to different network interfaces.
You may also look into bonding your network interfaces but I have never tried it.
So I'm currently connected to two internet connections. My 3G network and the company's wireless connection. But I don't really understand which one I'm using. Is there a way to find out which connection is being used. And is there a way to use both at the same time. Either by load balancing or dedicating each to separate tasks. For instance, one for downloading, one for surfing?
