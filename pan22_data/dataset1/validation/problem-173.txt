Laptops "ramp up/down", and as a result, there are lags. This greatly affects your overall performance.
As to being a better CPU that is largely subjective. The performance points are very specific. So ultimately you will want to choose a CPU that better caters to the areas of performance you're looking for -- video, audio, (cache) bandwidth, "lanes", etc. Truth is, an i5 may actually turn out to be a better choice than an i7 depending upon your needs. Generation is also another factor. Attempting to compare PC CPU to Laptop CPU is much the same as comparing an automobile to a boat. Both have an Engine (CPU). But have very different intended goals/uses. Two very separate classes. :)
Cooling enhancement(s) will improve your overall performance on a Laptop. Because, as you noted above, the CPU(s) are throttled when hot. To prevent failure/death. :)
Speaking as someone who used to game on a laptop a cooling mat is definitely worth it. Even if it doesn't make a difference in performance laptops heat up very quickly while gaming and I have yet to see one that has enough airflow to properly cool itself under high load.
As far as performance goes temperature may be making a difference. Another issue could be your power settings; by default most laptops are set to sacrifice some performance in exchange for battery life. Assuming that you are using Windows you can find those settings if you go to the control panel > power options > change plan settings > change advanced power settings. It is also entirely possible that your laptop is under-clocked slightly from the factory to keep people from melting their computer and extend battery life.
Unfortunately as far as performance goes a desktop is better in most circumstances just due to the cooling and power supply capabilities.
