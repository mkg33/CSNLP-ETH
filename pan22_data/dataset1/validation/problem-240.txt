When I add a user to Outlook delegation, using this method
However when I set the user as a delegate, I get the following error:
The powershell cmdlet you're using there (Set-CalendarProcessing) is only for 'Resource' mailboxes. This refers to objects like rooms, company cars, projectors, and other things that your organization use by booking time on a calendar. 
This particular Exchange object type has a special calendar assistant available that can either automatically accept or reject calendar requests that are sent to it, or you can set a delegate. The naming here is misleading, since delegate is used elsewhere in the Exchange world to mean something else. 
The error you recieved is indicating that the mailbox you're trying to run this cmdlet against is not a resource type, so it doesn't have the special calendar attendant, and therefore cannot have a delegate. 
As far as I know, the only way to set the type of delegate you're trying to set is by doing it manually through the Outlook desktop client (like your screenshot shows).
