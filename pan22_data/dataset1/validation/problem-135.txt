I would recommend - to any still facing this problem - to backup the Easy Settings version and find the proper installer before.
it works adapting it to W7 compatibility once reinstalled after the needed OS upgrades.
The new Samsung Settings do not work properly for every Fn key.
If one of you is still fighting to get Easy Settings to work on Windows 10, here is what I did to finally get backlit keyboard back on a Samsung Series 9 NP900X3C-A03FR after installing Windows 10 version 1709 (Fall Creator Update) :
- You will want to get version 2.1 of Samsung Settings (new name of this utility).
- First install the latest version of Samsung Software Update :
http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/SW/201305/20130521090434453/SWUpdate_2.1.15.1.ZIP
- Launch Software Update and type in your Samsung model number in the upper right corner.
- Select Windows 10: you will get a list of software and utilities to download.
- You will need Samsung Settings for the Fn keys for backlit keyboard and Display Manager for the screen backlight control.
- The downloaded software goes into a folder named SystemSoftware.
- Install the software in Compatibility Mode and restart computer. Works!
