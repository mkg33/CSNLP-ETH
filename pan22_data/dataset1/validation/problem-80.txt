I never used iTerm (or Mac OS); but since iTerm is a terminal emulator, it is probably unsuitable to schedule tasks. On *nixiod systems login scripts are usually executed from files like ~/.profile, /etc/profile, and in shell-specific files like ~/.bashrc and /etc/bash.bashrc. You can read about them in the manual page of you shell (e. g. man 1 bash).
iTerm2 is an awesome utility and makes my interaction w/ the command line much easier. There are a lot of update commands I run on a daily basis, and thought it would be amazing if those could be launched on my user's login. I know that in order to run a script on a user login event a directory has to be created at /System/Library/StartupItems w/ the script that is wished to be run having the same name as the directory (e.g. update_sys/update_sys.sh). The two main issues I have after this is that 1) when the commands are executed there's no terminal window to show any output, and 2) I don't know how to designate iTerm2 (or any other utility) as the primary terminal utility to run scripts. I do have iTerm2 set as the default terminal utility, however some executed scripts will still be launched in Terminal.
(If my conceptions on how to add commands to a user login event are incorrect or if there is an easier way to do so, please let me know!)
