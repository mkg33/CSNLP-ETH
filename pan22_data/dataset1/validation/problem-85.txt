The router will be ok. The main challenge for you is to ensure that client are splitted equally between APs. Also pls note that switching between APs will be not seamless for the client, i.e all active connections will be dropped. In order to provide seamless switching you need to buy wi-fi controller. There are hardware and software ones. Software one is much cheaper and will be enough for 25 clients.
I'm looking into setting up a more robust wireless system for the company I work for. Right now we're running off a NETGEAR AC1200 consumer grade router with about 25 people in one medium size office all with wireless laptops connected to it at once. As you can imagine, wireless performance isn't great.
After doing some research, it sounds like what we need is a couple of wireless access points on different channels that then connect to a router with wireless disabled (for the sake of avoiding interference) and the router connects to the modem. This way half of the people can use access point A, and the other half access point B.
My question is, can I re-use the NETGEAR AC1200 we're using right now as a router for the two access points? Would it be able to keep up with the traffic of 25 people from both access points? Or should I look into something with more power? If so, what type of device should I look at?
Or am I looking at this situation in the completely wrong way?
