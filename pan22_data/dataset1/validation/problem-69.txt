The near plane parameter shall be strictly larger than zero.
The smaller it is the more precision you burn close to the camera, and with zero, the projection matrix degenerates into unusability.
If your geometry isn't where you want it to be when you use a conformant projection matrix, address that problem instead.
I have just completed my custom mesh class and my engine is very basic right now, but now I am facing this strange issue. I have posted the pictures bellow, it seems like z-buffer is not working properly. I am using the following for projection matrix
If I give anything other than 0 for near plane the model barely shows up and if camera is zoomed the geometry seems to be appearing partly and disappearing. I know that my view matrix is ok because if I use 0 near plane the geometry is rendered correctly but then the flickering happens. I used simple HLSL posted bellow. If someone faced the same situation please assist me..
EDIT : I used blender to export mesh to custom format, although unlikely but is there any winding order issue causing this problem??
