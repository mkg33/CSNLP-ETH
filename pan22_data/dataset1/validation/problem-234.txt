You don't need an X-server for this. You need the X-server up and running on the machine where you tunnel to. You even don't need to tunnel anything unless you are behind NAT or some tricky firewall:
export DISPLAY=<IP of machine where you are sitting at:0.0
I'm having quite a bit of difficulty installing X server on a VM running Debian Wheezy.  I basically am just looking to be able to SSH to the box using X11 forwarding.
After installing xserver through the apt packaging system, (apt-get install xorg xserver-xorg) I'm unable to actually run the server:
Googling around a bit, there seems to be a consensus that this may have something to do with the video drivers.  
This seems to be validated somewhat by checking the log, as suggested by the above error message.  The relevant portion of the log reads: 
So it seems that while looking for a driver, startx attempts to open the device /dev/fb0 (not sure what that is - a framebuffer?), fails, and aborts.
So apparently I may need to edit the video driver settings in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  Except, my system doesn't have /etc/X11/xorg.conf, or an xorg.conf file anywhere for that matter.  So I've basically hit a dead-end here.
