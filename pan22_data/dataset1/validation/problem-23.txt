This is a very common problem with TMG, not be design, but by the implementation you decided to use, you need to make sure that you understand the HTTPS inspection before you actually enable it. 
I found out that SecureNAT clients does not work with HTTPS inspection, you will either need to enable the WebProxy clients or install the TMG Client on your client computers to make it work, still some sites will break and stop working after doing so since the inspection will replace the original certificate for the sites your clients are visiting with another one from the TMG server it self.
