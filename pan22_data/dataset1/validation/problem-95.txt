It has nothing to do with static IPs. Your clients need to use the domain controller(s) for the domain as their DNS server(s). Your modem/router is likely setting itself as the DNS server. Change this setting there so that it gives your clients the proper DNS server as part of the DHCP configuration. 
As, just as a side note: please read our faq. Home networking is off topic here. 
I have set up a Windows Server 2012 Standard edition at home for learning purposes with the IP 10.1.1.2/16. I also have an ADSL wireless router which connects everything together and works as the DHCP server, with the IP 10.1.1.1/16. The Server name is in server_name.domain_name.org format and netBIOS name is as server_name.
When I try to join a client win7 PC to the domain_name.org domain by searching the domain as domain_name.org it says unable to find domain and if I try using just domain_name it finds the domain but fails to connect after entering username/password by giving the error Unable to resolve DNS name of the domain
I put a static IP to the win7 client with the DNS settings as primary:10.1.1.2 (server) & secondary: 10.1.1.2 (router) with default gateway: 10.1.1.1. Then searched and tried connecting to domain_name.org it worked really fine.
My problem is, I don't want to use static IPs for my clients. I suspect the issue should be with my ADSL router which is the DHCP server for the LAN. Please help me to solve this. Thanks.
