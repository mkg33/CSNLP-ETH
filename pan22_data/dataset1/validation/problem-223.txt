Noob poster. Running windows 7, recently updated with all critical updates. Had BSOD with a non paged memory error on startup a few days ago. Otherwise, the system runs well, although I have noticed some problems with Chrome browser crashing, which I just attributed to the usual nonsense.
Tried to run windows update today and found the service was not running. Went to Control Panel > Adminsitrative Tools > Services and found Windows Update not running and all the other services hung at "started". 
Started windows update. It hangs at "started" too. Tried to run it, says not runnning, try restart... which has no effect, naturally.
Any ideas? Is this a OS problem or a hardware problem? Virus?
Yes, very likely a virus. There's a few things you might be able to jimmy it with.  
1) Microsoft update fix it. Download it off their website. it'll run a diagnostic set, maybe fix you up.
2) open up a search, look for .cmd. Right click on program cmd in pulldown, choose "run as admin". When you have the dos shell open, type
3) Download combofix off of bleepingcomputer.com(there are lookalikes out there that ARE viruses, which is why i recommend getting it there). Run as admin
