The connectors themself arn't actually specific to a protocol - It simply refers to the number of pins and that its sub miniature. You could in theory wire up any suitable connector to the right electrical connections and to use it.
In most systems I've seen, serial ports had 9 pins (since they didn't implement the whole 25 pin standard). I could also have, in theory the same 9 pins on a mini DIN connector or used the same 9 or 25 pins for another protocol.
On the other hand, printers often had a centronics port rather than a DB25, and once again, the physical connector simply had to support the minimum amount of pins the electrical standard needed.
At the end of the day the smart thing is to check before you plug anything in ;p
I would like to know whether the DB-25 port is a serial or parallel port. These ports are otherwise known as printer ports, aka LPT port. 
I'm very confused about this since, according to Wikipedia, this port is considered part of the D-Subminiature connectors, which are mostly used for RS-232 serial communication. 
On the other hand, we know that this port is known as the parallel printer port. So, why all this confusion? Is this confusion only associated with DB-25 ports on computers? Then how about other devices that have DB-25 connectors (mostly male DB-25)?
