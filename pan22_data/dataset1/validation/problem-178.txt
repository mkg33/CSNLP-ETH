There is no "standard" load balancing set up for MS SQL Server that you can run via a wizard.
This would be a database architecture decision and implemented at the database level not the server level. Techniques would be:
If anyone disagrees, then I'd like to see an article by a respected known MS SQL figure saying clustering is load balancing. The articles quoted above do not mention load balancing. For example, A Microsoftie (Chas Boyd) says it is not here.
My question to the OP would be what kind of load do you expect?
Database servers are usually IO and memory bound, so proper disk configuration (with appropriate filegroups) and as much RAM as possible will go a lot further than any solution above.
Don't forget: SQL Server 2005/Windows 2003 Enterprise 32-bit goes to 32GB RAM (of which you'd have 26-28GB data cache) and you are not limited by drive letters because of NTFS mount points. As for x64...
New technologies for database load balancing, separate from SQL Server, are available. These software solutions integrate with Always On in 2012 or 2014 and support automatic read/write split and other load balancing techniques. Look for NetScaler DataStream or ScaleArc for SQL Server as two examples of this transparent SQL load balancing software.
