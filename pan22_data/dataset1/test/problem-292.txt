Disabling memory overcommit is definitely "safer" than enabling it.
$customer has it set on a few hundred web servers and it helped with stability issues a lot.
There's even a Nagios check calling out fire real loud if it's ever NOT disabled.
On the other hand, people might not consider it "safe" getting their processes going out of memory when they'd just like to overcommit a little ram and would never really use that.
So, you're back to seeing if it improves things for you.
Since You're already looking into it to get rid of related issues - I think it might help for you.

I agree that disabling overcommit is safer than enabling it in some circumstances.  If the server runs only few large memory jobs (like circuit simulations in my case), it is much safer to deny the application the memory request upfront rather than waiting for an OOM event (which is sure to follow shortly)  Quite often we see servers having issues after the OOM killer has done its work.
