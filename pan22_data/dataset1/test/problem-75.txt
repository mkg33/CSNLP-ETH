The OSI model describes how the data being transmitted is structured. It does not describe the hardware in any kind.
In the times of analogue modems for example everything that has been done in hardware was located in "layer 1". All other layers were completely handled in software.
When Ethernet or WLAN is used the hardware does things that are belonging to layers 1 and 2 according to the OSI model; layers 3-7 are still a pure software thing (at least when talking about a normal PC).
Usually when people refer to the NIC as layer one they are talking about the hardware.  The other 6 layers are represented by software.  As an application sends data to the network, that data moves though the network stack hitting each layer once by one, starting at layer 7 and moving down towards layer 1.  different snippets of code in various protocols until the data is sent to the hardware NIC.  The protocols do something with the data at each stack layer and add their own meta data into headers at each layer so that the same protocols on the other end of transmission know what to do with the data.  
You can see from this image how data passes though each layer though a "virtual interface".  But its important to know that these virtual interfaces are just code, the only thing physical is at the bottom of the stack when the processed data finally hits the NIC and sent over the wire or send over the air via Wifi.
