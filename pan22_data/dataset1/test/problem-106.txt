These are all the private IP ranges. Simply put, these packets will never leave your local network, and are non-routable out on the public internet. So, yes, there are thousands (probably millions) 192.186.1.55s, but it always connects to the local one (it's the computer/router's only option).
The 192.168.X.X is used for internal (private) use only. That means it is used in your own network and there can easily be a duplicate of this in every network in the world. Usually your router keeps this "internally".
Imagine you're in a country and your router is the country's border. There can be only one person with social security number (or any other unique property) 123 in your country but beyond your borders (router) there could easily be another person with social security number 123 since it's a different country with a different administration.
To distinguish between person A with 123 and person B with 123, they invented global IP-addresses. These are unique and can be compared to a physical address. Every internet connection (usually shared by several PC's) has one unique global IP-address. This IP-address is used when connecting to PC's outside your own "country" (network).
