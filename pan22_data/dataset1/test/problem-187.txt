Is there an application that can give me mouse gestures across all programs on Windows 7? I'm aware of StrokeIt, but it seems to have some nasty bugs on 64-bit versions of Windows. (Or maybe it's just mine, I don't know, but it crashed a lot last time I used it.)
StrokesPlus is very similar to StrokeIt, but more powerful.  It comes in 32-bit and 64-bit versions.  One thing with StrokeIt is you can't launch 64-bit native Windows apps like Task Manager or Calculator, it instead opens the 32-bit version.
StrokesPlus also has mouse/key modifiers and many other advanced features, though the actions are in Lua script instead of GUI elements...so there's a trade-off between ease of setup and power/flexibility.  
I built StrokesPlus from the ground up in native C++ (no hefty MFC or .NET runtimes required) primarily due to StrokeIt's developer not keeping his app up-to-date or addressing user requests.  So yes, I'm quite biased, but StrokesPlus is freeware, so I'm not really getting anything special out of this =)
