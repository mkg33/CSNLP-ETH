"I still have the DVD and box with the key" - that's really all you need. Retail versions can be transferred to new machines under certain conditions, OEM can't. 
Your 'OEM' copy is probably a small system builder licence, which is meant for smaller shops building bespoke PCs and DIY builders. You can reinstall on the same hardware as many times as you want, and at worst you'd need to reactivate. This is in contrast to the volume OEM licences with system locked preinstall keys. 
I'd prefer a fresh reinstall to a refresh or reset, mainly cause I'm oldschool and seen refreshes and resets fail - but both options should work on a healthy system. 
4y ago or so I built my own PC and bought Win8 and installed it on it.
I still have the DVD and box with the key, but I am not sure if I can reinstall the OS on the same machine without problems since OEM smells to me like some limited version of Win8.
Also if I can not do the reinstall is there any way to purge all the user data from the machine and return it to brand new state - this means all user content, all SW, all registry entries...
