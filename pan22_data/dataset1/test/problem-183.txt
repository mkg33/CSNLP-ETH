I guess you hit the confusion of another community contributors, as so far output of kubectl get pod command doesn't show Pod phase in the corresponded STATUS column, but it actually retrieves the state from particular container inside the Pod, you can find relevant information under containerStatuses: field from within a Pod description, I was answering the same behavior here.
Find the related Github issue addressed #76619 and relevant pull requests #13840, #12397.
My question is highly related to Back-off restarting failed container - Error syncing pod in Minikube. I came across the same issue. My question is: 
Why does "Competed" container result in "CrashLoopBackOff" pod? Per https://sysdig.com/blog/debug-kubernetes-crashloopbackoff/, "CrashLoopBackOff" means "you have a pod starting, crashing, starting again, and then crashing again." But my pod is not crashing at all because the container in it exits without any error. The "starting again" is expected because the default restart policy is Always.
