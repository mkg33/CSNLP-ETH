I think these are new Library folders. This page has more info on them:

I think your solution may be to either switch off the "library" feature (if possible) or change the Default Location for these libraries to the D drive also.
Am trying to get Widows 7 to behave when told to change a user's "Desktop", "Saved Searches", "Desktop", "My Music", and the rest of the folders that "point" to their different directories and that can be found on their profile. This is an Spanish Lang Win7 (Home Premium) so the names in the "visible" folders don't correspond with the name on the filesystem.
The user's profile is on c:\Users\Username, but I want them to save documents in D:\Users\username\Documents, the favorites to be in "D:\Users\username\Favorites, etc..
I've manually changed the "location" data in the properties of the folders, and when I did so, I was asked if I wanted to move the content. So far, so good.
I then deleted the "extra" folders in C:\users\username.. but when I reboot, I get a duplicated "links" (I can't think of any other name) in the "userprofile" folder: the ones I moved and "new" ones that are created. I can delete the "new" ones, but it's starting to be somewhat of a PITA... Also, the user this laptop is for will likely be confused by the "appearance" of the folders, and there is at least a 50% chance they'll end up using the wrong destination to save files, etc, which would be a cause of major pain down the road.
