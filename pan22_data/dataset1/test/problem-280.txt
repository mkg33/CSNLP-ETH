I finally managed to get a stable setup ( no connection lost for 10 days ). I have given up on the USB hub and the current Raspberry Pi charger.
Instead, I have purchased a dual USB charger and a split USB cable
Both the PI and the external drive are powered from the same source - the USB charger and the data connection is plugged in directly from the PI.
Had the same issue with powering up things as you did. When i used a single usb hub to power both the pi and the hard drive i got stable usage from it for over two weeks (never had it on longer than 2 weeks between two reboots). 
I had my boot loader on the sd card and the OS on the usb hard-drive.
My usb hard drive is also a westerd digital password (but an older version).
I actually gone through 10 usb hubs and around 15 chargers before i found something stable. The currently used usb hub is a no-name hub, rated for 2A max over 4 usb ports. I have used the hub with the pi and 2 usb drives and a wifi card.
If you can, get a multimeter and test the voltages of the pi across tp1 and tp2.
Also, i powered everything all the time from a 1100w ups. I never plugged anything in directly in the wall. If you have power fluctuations, burnouts or anything similar, that might also be an issue.
Also be careful of using the same socket for all the power adapters you're using. Never use two sockets on different power lines or a socket and a ups on the same time.
Noroc! (good luck in romanian - for everyone else that doesn't speak it)
