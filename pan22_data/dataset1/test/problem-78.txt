We have a distribution group on our Exchange service on Office365. The business is keen to restrict the hours that the distribution group sends messages to out of hours to reduce email distractions. So if you sent an email to the group at 10AM, it'd be queued and delivered at 7PM. Does anyone have any ideas how I can implement this on Exchange Online?
Well, that's a pretty silly requirement.  And there's no built-in functionality to restrict sending to a distribution group based on time or day.
Having said that, there is the option to "moderate" a distribution group, such that incoming messages need to be approved prior to delivery, and this gives you the option of a hacky workaround - you could set up a moderation mailbox, and then run a script against that mailbox to approve all existing messages for delivery at 19:00, and approve any new messages that come in during "off-hours" hours.
I think that's your best shot at implementing this dubious feature request - everything else I can think of is even worse.
