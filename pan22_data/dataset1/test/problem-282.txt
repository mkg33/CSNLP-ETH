In January of this year, I did a clean install of windows 10 on my laptop. Since then, it has been randomly freezing about 2 to 3 times a week. Before that I had Linux Mint on it and before Mint I had Windows 7. I have seen a lot of questions about this but not many answers. Here is what I have tried:
It is an Acer Aspire 5750-9460. I never got it to un-freeze but maybe I am just impatient. Usually I just hard poweroff my computer.
I have a Acer Aspire 5750 running Windows 8.1 Pro that randomly freezes. Tried all the usual bios, temp files, app uninstalls, power setting changes and it still freezes.
I tried a last ditch effort, as I suspect it is a graphics card/motherboard issue on this model. 
My 5750 only froze when Windows was not being used for a while and required a reboot.
If you don't use your computer even for a few minutes, or make a coffee etc. just press the power button to turn off screen (turns black) and press again to return to your page. (may require a signin) 
A quicker method is go to power options, change plan settings and set "turn off display" for 1 minute and save settings.
Since doing this, I have had no problems for several weeks now and I previously had 2-3 freezes per week.
