In my work place I use 2 monitors, they are both bought from amazon and both are same brand and model: Dell P2217H.
The one on the left is bought around 4 month after the one on the right.
They are both connected to the same docking station my laptop is connected to both using original display port cables that came with the monitors.
I checked 20 times that their settings are identical (I did factory reset to both of them anyway), I tried boosting their brighntess to 100% and did the comparison but the result is always the same, in other words, never the same.
The newer one (the one on the lefthandside) has much whiter whites. The 4 month older brother shows whites yellowish and brushed. It is like it was washed 1000 times together with socks and jeans.
It does not matter the "angle" you look at I look directly at both of them and the situation is just the same. 
Is it normal for a monitor to lose its color and brightness in 4 months or is the first item defective? Or is it normal not to get the same quality from same models all the time? What may cause this very obvious difference in the colors and their quality?
It is normal. The specs have a small variance, and this is probably within spec limits.
If you buy two 2x4 pieces of wood, and measure them with a micrometer, there will be a difference too.
If it bothers you when using them (which is understandable - I actually have the same setup and had the same issue), you can calibrate both of them with whatever method, and the will be perfectly identical looking (although the settings values will be slightly different).
