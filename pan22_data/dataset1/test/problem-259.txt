In practice, it may be possible, but it depends on the file and the disk. If it is a text-file, you may be able to identify the OS that created it by the line-breaks:
Of course these are only the default line breaks used and there are text editors for each OS that can allow you to manually specify what to use.
If it is a binary file, then there will likely be a file-format that governs the format of its contents, so there is no way to know what OS created it.
You may be able to get a clue as to the originating OS from the disk itself. You could examine the type of the partition, but again it is not a guarantee since most modern OSes support most of the common partition types.
You may also be able to glean some information about the origin of the file via its meta-data (if any).
Depending on the file type you may actually end up with a sound heuristic (Synetech pointed out one for text files.)
However, if you were hoping for some kind of fingerprint inherent to all files an OS generates, (as with tcp/ip implementations) I don't think anything the like exists so far.
