The reason why both are the same for you is the hybrid sleep since Vista. Here Windows also copies the data to the hibernation file, so if the power is cut, the data are not lost and Windows can resume like it would resume from a normal hibernation. 
You are correct about hibernation: it copies the current state of your PC to hard disk, then switches off completely. It will no longer use battery power and should return to the same state when you un-hibernate it.
The sleep function however is slightly different: it does not copy the current state to disk, and instead keeps it in memory, which in turn is kept active by a low amount of power coming from the battery. So when your machine is asleep, it still uses power and will eventually decharge. 
The idea is that the computer can wake up quicker than from a hibernated state, and can also go to sleep quicker than it could hibernate.
The sleep and hibernate options can be disabled via the Windows Registry. Here's how to bring them back: http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/85194-sleep-disable-shut-down-menu.html
