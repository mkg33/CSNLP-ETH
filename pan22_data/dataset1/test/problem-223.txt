Got a bit of a problem on my laptop (Windows 8.1); I recently deleted all music that I had stored under C:\Dokumente\Musik ("Dokumente" meaning "documents" in German). Within this directory, I had a couple of subfolders for my music; I wanted to delete the entire "Dokumente" folder.
However, after deleting it, the folder remained along with but one subfolder (D:\Dokumente\Musik\Amazon\Giles Lamb\ ...), which is empty. When I try to delete the subfolder or the "Dokumente" folder, it just says "Element not found". Restarting the computer did not help.
It's not really a problem, however it's annoying, any idea on how to fix this?
b) cd < enter the path of the folder you want to delete here > (ex: "cd D:\Dokumente\Musik")
c) rd /s /q < folder name >  (ex: rd /s /q "Amazon") 
(Note: be careful while inputting the directory name) 
Done. this should probably do it, the reason being.. all the handles from the explorer are possibly terminated (however, the handles from programs are not terminated).
