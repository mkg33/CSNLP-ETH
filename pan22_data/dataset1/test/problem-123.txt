I'm using OpenIndiana 151a on x86 and I want to connect to other remote servers using ssh with public key authentication, but it fails.
The remote server's sshd (OpenSSH) is enabled with ssh-2 protocol. I already have ssh client installed in my OpenIndiana. I can connect to remote host using password authentication.
However, when I try to connect using public key authentication, I get the following error message.
Note that the remote server's sshd is already working with public key authentication, I didn't forget to add my public key string inside id_rsa.pub to the remote server's .ssh/authorized_keys. Public key authentication succeeds in other OpenSSH clients.
This, I think, is SunSSH's problem. I found out that these problems occur only in OpenSolaris, OpenIndiana and Oracle Solaris 11 express. 
Are there any solutions to make my OpenIndiana work with public key authentication? I don't want to change to Linux or *BSD because there are a bunch of Solaris machines still working in my office. 
Try passing -vvv to ssh and read more detailed debug information.
