In Windows Explorer, type the following into the address bar:
That will open a special folder in the path C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo
In there, make a shortcut to the directory you want to copy to, such as DIR-B.
After that, you can go to the location of your files that you want to copy.  Select them, and right-click.  In the pop-up menu, you should see "Send to >".  When you mouse over that, a sub-menu will appear, and DIR-B should be one of the options.  Just click on it, and it will copy the selected files to that location.
within directory A there is directory B, C and file X, Y
method 1. select files, and then drag and drop with mouse
method2. select files, cut those files (ctrl-x) and then go in DIR B, paste those files (ctrl-v) inside
since there are so many dir & files (100s & 1000s), method 1 using manual mouse control
is somewhat tiresome, so I want to use the keyboard mostly
I want to use methode 2 but directly pasting on the DIR-B (by selecting it and ctrl-v on it)
doesn't work, that you should go inside the actual DIR-B, then post.
is there a way to directly 'paste inside the DIR-B' by keyboard shortcuts,
without going inside the actual directory, but by selecting it only?
is there a good 'file manager' software that is useful for these kind of keyboard oriented inteface?
