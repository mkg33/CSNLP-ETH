First you need to get the virtual server on your LAN. If you shut down the VM and go to the settings, you can set the network to bridged. When it boots up again you should see the IP address similar to your Mac. I would expect something like 192.168.x.y. 
Once that is done, check you can ping the VM from your Mac on the CentOS IP.
To test PHP is working with apache you will need to create a file in the document root of you web server on CentOS. This will be /var/www unless you have changed it. Create a file index.php and put the following inside
Now visit http://centos IP/index.php and you should see "I am PHP".
To test that mysql support is available for php, edit the PHP file again and add
Open http://centos IP/index.php again, and if you get an error saying cannot connect, then mysql support is working, if you get an error about function mysql_connect doesn't exist you need to install php-mysql using Yum.
You can use samba or nfs to share a folder on your CentOS machine to make it available as a network share.
You can use NAT type and make Port Forwarding. e.g. your host is 172.1.1.1 and virtual machine has 10.0.2.1, go to Preferences â†’ select Network tab and click Advanced, then click Port Forwarding. Add new rule where host ip is 172.1.1.1, host port 5050 (or any available), guest ip 10.0.2.1 and guest port 80. 
Now you can open browser on your host machine and open http://172.1.1.1:5050
