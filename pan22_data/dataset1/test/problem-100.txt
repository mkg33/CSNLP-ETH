You can put DC's at each location. depending on the size of your SYSVOL, you may have some bandwidth issues on initial replication (this can be solved by standing up the DC's local to an existing DC and then moving it to the remote site).  
If you design your AD sites correctly, the clients should do primary authentication to the local DC. 
If you aren't all that familiar with AD design and configuration, you may want to look at some outside resources to help you with setup/design/install. 
2008 R2 would be a much better choice for a number of reasons if you are inclined to upgrade..
Is it possible to setup several additional domain controllers (ADC) at remote locations that are connected via medium bandwidth DSL (2-10 Mbit) WAN connections for a single domain (intranet.example.com)? And would it be a good idea?
We have five sites and would like to have extremely high availability if any of the site were to lose their Internet connection. However each site is very small, and all are over a fairly small geographical area within the same region, so it would seem strange to have a PDC for each of the sites.
If it were possible to have an ADC for each site, would the clients use the ADC or just use the PDC if it's available to them?
