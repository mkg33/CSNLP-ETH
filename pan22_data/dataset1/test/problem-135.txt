I don't. I'm not actually concerned about the rewrite issue since the write-life of modern SSD drives is long enough that it's sure to die from other causes before you hit it. 
I don't use them because they're the bleeding edge of technology, and I have no services that are so disk read-/write-speed bound that I can justify the additional risk of relatively untested hardware.
My general policy is that if I have to install the piece of hardware myself and it's not necessary for a very particular case (e.g., installing a Digium PRI card for an Asterisk server), that hardware isn't mature enough for my needs.
I'll consider installing them on my routers, load balancers, and web servers when Dell ships servers with SSDs already installed by default. 
Not SSD's per se, but we used Fusion IO in our search engine product. Blazing fast for us and remove all kinds of I/O bottlenecks. Products like Fusion IO should rapidly replace huge SANs in the next 5 years or so.
We used the Fusion IO products since early alpha, and they've improved with each revision. Quality stuff.
