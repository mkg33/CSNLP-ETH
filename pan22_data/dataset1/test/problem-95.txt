Set Keyboard Layout in MDT and SCCM Task Sequence, where I have found listed these
I have used this guide to make a Windows PE flash drive. It works as it should. When I boot a computer into Windows PE a CMD window appears.
The problem is that the keyboard is set to US by default, but I am using a nordic keyboard. 
How can I change the default keyboard that loads on the initial CMD window?
I have tried all the following command without any success:
If I investigate I can see that Norwegian keybobard is in fact installed. That is 0414:00000414. So that is kind of weird.
Do I really have to type wpeutil SetKeyboardLayout 0409:00000414 each time I load Windows PE? Is there no other way?
The input profiles are made up of a language identifier and a keyboard identifier.
A language identifier is a standard international numeric abbreviation for the language in a country or geographical region. For example 0409 is the hexadecimal identifier of the language United States (US) and 00000414 is the hexadecimal identifier of the keyboard "Norway/Norwegian".
and you will get Nowegian keyboard input at the initial CMD screen once Windows PE has loaded.
Not really sure why nb-NO does not work. The documentation says you can use it...
