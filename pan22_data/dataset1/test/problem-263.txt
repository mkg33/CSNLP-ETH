In a puzzle game that I have been working on I have found that an XML file has been a rather efficient way to store level data.
For example, you could have an xml file for each level pack
You could then serialize the xml file into some sort of model object in your code. Even with 100+ levels this should be easy to manage and is way less time consuming than making a level editor.
I'm new to LibGDX and android development in general and am trying to do a puzzle game. Being a level-based game, i'm trying to make it so in every level a certain number of blocks (just rectangular sprites) appear in a certain position / rotation, like in the image linked below:

I've doodled some levels already but i'm really not sure about how to make the blocks's rearrangement over the levels.
How exactly should one manage this? As the position of the blocks won't be random i was thinking about reading from files the information from every level (x, y, rotation, colors, etc. for every block) but to do that i would have to manually organize every level's blocks properties information (to then save), and, considering it would have atleast 100+ levels, it would take too long... Other than that, i could have them as plain assets but having an asset for every single level doesnt't look like an efficient solution either. Do you have any tips, please?
