I purchased a new computer with Windows 10 and my current computer has Windows 7.  I was considering putting the old hard drive into the new computer until I found a topic here where it wasn't suggested.  
Users mentioned backing up the computer but there was no mention of software so I'm wondering what software do you use to transfer programs and documents from one computer to the next?  Is the success transfer rate lower since it's transferring from a HP Windows 7 to a Cyberpower Windows 10 computer? 
I have a WD external drive on the way large enough for a backup file to transfer to the new computer.  Is there a free program that can be used?  My new computer has a SSD which is new to me but I think I'll only upload the previous computer files to the main hard drive. One of my current external WD hard drives has a file labeled "Do your data recovery" but don't know anything about it and that drive doesn't have enough room to do a backup anyway.
We canâ€™t transfer the installed programs from one computer to another easily. You need to install each software and activate them individually on the new Windows 10 computer.
But we can copy and paste general data from the Windows 7 computer to Windows 10 computer directly, this process needs a media, such as an external drive(usb drive) or network connection.
You could copy data to a removable drive, then insert this drive into your new computer, paste data.
Or let these two computer in a same network, share the data that you need to transfer.
