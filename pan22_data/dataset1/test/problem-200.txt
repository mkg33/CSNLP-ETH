You can create a Thunderbird filter which moves messages from IMAP folders to local folders.
Anyway an "IMAP archiver and deleter" appears to be a strong need of the Internet Community since at least 10 years, don't know why no solution came out till now.

1) set up an excel workbook which automates the task of deleting bunch of messages and/or donwload them.
2) Convert such workbook to a standalong VBS script for those who do not have MS Office installed.
3) Create a PHP page which performs such task for everybody, regardless of  Windows/Mac/Linux 
I am at good point for first, the others are still to come.
In the meantime, here they are some  useful commands to manually play with you IMAP server:
They will disappear in quite-real-time from Outlook.
Move such messages to trash folder (else they are just invisible, not deleted):
You can also past all commands into the telnet window to get them executed:
To avoid "blind deletion" you need to know what's inside those messages from 1st to 15th.
You can use POP3 on your client's PC in place of IMAP or at least for one PC. POP3 by default download all emails and doesn't delete if the emails are deleted on server (doesn't do synchronization, only download email), so you can have all your mail downloaded locally and manually delete them if needed. here is the difference of this 2 protocols
Let the non-PC clients as IMAP because it is more handy with the synchronization and if some mails are deleted you can find them on the PC that uses POP3
