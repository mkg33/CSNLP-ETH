Looks to me that conditional formatting of over 28,000 distinct data points will only be a superficial measure. But yes, you can use conditional formatting in a pivot table. If you format the Values area, you will see a few radio buttons on the dialog where you can specify what context the format should be applied to
You may get a lot more traction on your data, though, if you pull it into Power Query (Get & Transform on the Data ribbon) and set a few helper columns to classify your data into good, bad or evil. Then, you can use pivot tables with slicers and filters to get your data under control.
I have the results of numerous tests run on several sub-samples. Many sub-samples make up a sample. Between 5 and 10 samples make up a lot, and I have five lots I'm trying to analyze. 
Each one of the aforementioned tests has an associated set of specifications; in other words, there are definite "wrong answers". In order to look for trends in the data, I've placed all my data into a PivotTable. The problem is that I've now got over 28,000 different distinct data points. 
In an effort to aid my search, I want the "wrong answers" to be formatted differently than the "right answers". At the same time, I'm not sure how I'm going to spot trends, so I'm going to be fiddling with this thing a lot, looking for information. I want the formatting to follow the cells based on their fields. I have yet to figure out a way to do this. Please help!
