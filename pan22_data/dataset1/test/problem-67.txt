I am trying to set up the most basic VPN configuration with OpenVPN. The server is Windows Server 2003 SBS. A typical client system is Windows 7 Professional.
The server has two physical NICs (WAN & LAN). The WAN NIC is assigned a static WAN IP by the router. The server manages the NAT & Firewall with Windows' Routing and Remote Access service.
I have followed the setup HOWTO and attempted to keep things as simple as possible.
The OpenVPN client connects to the OpenVPN server and is assigned an IP address.
The problem is that I cannot ping the server from the client after the connection is established (or perform any other communication for that matter).
I would like to provide more information, but I need guidance as to what information is needed to solve this problem. The following is a starting point:
I've hit the same issue funnily enough, what response do you get if you try to ping a client from the VPN server?
I've found RRAS seems to have chosen to ignore the routing rules, so sends packets to the LAN's default gateway rather than back down the VPN. As the router is set up to route traffic for that subnet to the VPN server you end up with a routing loop and get TTL expired in Transit.
If you simply get Request timed out, try using traceroute (tracert x.x.x.x) and see if it gives you an information.
