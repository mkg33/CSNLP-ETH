I am in the process of redirecting a URL and I wanted to use the 'RewriteRule' directive when in the process of doing so.
However I also want this to work if a locale is added to the end of the first URL.  It could be various different locales (never static), so I want the RewriteRule to take whatever comes after '.jsp' in the first URL and place it after '.zul' in the second.
I believe I have the syntax wrong for the replacement portion:
Just so you can see what the link looks like with the locale, I have placed an example below:
I would want to place '?locale=de-DE' after .zul in the second URL.
Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
To match a specific (specific word is important here) query string, such as the example you mention "?locale=de-DE'" you would need a RewriteCond doing it.
But in this specific case, since the target url is not specifying a query string, default behaviour from mod_rewrite is to append the original query string (whatever it was) to it unless you specify the QSD flag (query string discard).
"/application/web/reservation/index.jsp?whatever" 
and would append whatever query string to the target you specified:
"https://application.domain.com/application2/web/reservation/audioForm.zul" because it does not specify a query string.
