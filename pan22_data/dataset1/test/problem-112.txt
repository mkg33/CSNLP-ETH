I have a Toshiba laptop that I am using with an external monitor. After jumping through many hoops to get this to work in the first place, I have a problem.
Before I disconnected, I reconfigured it so that VGA was disabled and LVDS was running at the recommended resolution. It worked fine, and I shut the computer down.
When I turned the computer on again, I got to the KDE login screen fine (I'm using KDM). But when I try to log into KDE, I get a black screen (though I hear the login sound). When I shutdown the computer and reboot, I can log into GNOME just fine. But when I try to log out of GNOME, everything hangs again.
Does anyone know what is going on? does anyone know of a solution to this problem?
NOTE: When I was using the external monitor, my resolution and monitor settings only took place after I logged in. Before then, it used the default settings of mirroring screens, which made the login screen bloated. This may have something to do with it.
OP solved this by setting the display configuration as the default (System Settings | Display and Monitor ...set as default).
