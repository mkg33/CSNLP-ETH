Ideally, the format you are looking for is ftp://user@website.
However, the results of using such an address depend on the client browser and not on the web-server.
Firefox will do exactly what you ask for, prompting only for the password.
Internet Explorer will ignore the specified user and ask for both.
I have set up a number of an FTP sites using IIS7.5. The sites use hostnames to differentiate between them. One drawback of using hostnames is that you have to pass the address of the ftp site into the username e.g.
I would like to at least pass in the username as part of the connection address e.g. ftp://ftp.example.com|User1@ftp.example.com but I have been unable to do this using Windows Explorer (in Windows 7). Whenever I try this technique I'm still prompted to enter the user name and password. 
I have set the useDomainNameAsHostName=True on the server which allows a bit more flexibility in the username but I still canâ€™t get it to work. Neither ftp://ftp.example.com%5CUser1@ftp.example.com/ or ftp://User1%40ftp.example.com@ftp.example.com/ seems to make any difference in IE9 or Chrome.
