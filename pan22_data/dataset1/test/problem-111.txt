A light sensor usually works pretty well when you can illuminate it with a LED and make sure that the passing marble will block that light.
You only need an ADC / comparator when you want to measure / detect a very specific illumination level. If you instead can make sure there's enough illumination difference to toggle between 0 and 1, you can connect it directly to a digital pin.
I'm trying to essentially build a Raspberry Pi powered pachinko machine, where I need to detect when a magnetic marble falls through a gate/opening/region.  Are there any electrical components/breakout boards/ideas I could use to detect such an occurrence?  I've been debating on using a Hall Effect Ratiometric sensor paired with an ADC converter and GPIO ports to detect magnetic fluctuation to detect when the marble passes, but I didn't know if there were any better ideas.  Maybe some sort of gate that won't mess with the marble's trajectory?  A light or motion sensor?  Something that can quickly detect the marble's presence?
For reference, here are the magnetic marbles that I'm using.  I'm using a Pi Zero too.
