It will be best if you configure your domain, mail server and web application to send from legitimate sender and put your users email addresses in Reply-To and/or somewhere in the mail body. This way you will have legitimate mail sending while keeping the right back connection to the sender.
You have your mail server 2.2.2.2. configured to send mail for domain MYSRV.COM. Configure your mail server with reverse and straight resolving, spf records etc. Configure your webapp to send from  POSTER@MYSRV.COM, and put sender email in Reply-To header.
When receiver hit reply he will send the message to the right email address. No harm for anyone.
Change the mynetworks parameter in /etc/postfix/main.cf to include the IP address of the server you want to send from. Check that you've got append_dot_mydomain = no as well. Don't forget to tell Postfix to reload it's config (/etc/init.d/postfix reload works on most recent linuxes I've used).
Then, your postfix server should accept mail from your webserver and route it, regardless of the from/to addresses. So, configure your webapp to always use that smtp server, with the user's from address.
Increasingly, however, you can expect your emails to be marked as spam. As TomTom points out, domains are starting to adopt SPF, Domainkeys and similar protocols to prevent exactly what you're asking for. If the domain that you're sending from (domainA in your example) has implemented SPF (or similar), you would do well to ask them to add your mail server to the list of authorised senders.
