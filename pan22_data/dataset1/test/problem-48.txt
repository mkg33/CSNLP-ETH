RAID0 and data recovery do not go well together. By using RAID0, you doubled your chances of catastrophic failure. At this point, you have two options:
By mucking around with the disks any more yourself, you're just decreasing the chances of ever being able to get data off of them.
I had setup two 500gb disk in RAID0 on my server, but recently suffered a hard disk failure (saw a S.M.A.R.T error on the HDD at boot). My host has put 2 new disk in RAID-0 again (re-installed the OS) and re-attached the old drives on the same machine, so that I can recover the data.
How can I mount these two disks back in RAID0, so that we can recover the data from our old drive? Or is this not possible any more? Have I lost all my data?
This is my /etc/fstab and df -h: http://i.imgur.com/iVjpDNN.png
This is my fdisk -l: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=68puYEXD
I read somewhere that you can do this with this command: mdadm -A --scan however, it does not yield any result for me -> No arrays found in config file or automatically
Any help/tips/advice regarding this is much appreciated.
