You can definitely use NTLM auth, especially if you only have users connecting that are logging on with their domain credentials to their workstations (even cached credentials).
You can't use a client cert that I'm aware of.  I don't think Outlook has a means of passing the cert along.  If you look at the auth mehthods, the only thing close to this would be a 2-factor auth using a smart card.

I would like to understand the possibility to limit access from Internet to Exchange (RPC over HTTPS in Outlook) by requiring the machine or user to present a client certificate (before the login session).
I saw a lot of docs for the Active Sync part (where this is possible) but I just recall seeing once a technical document for client certificate authentication with RPC over HTTPS (and frankly speaking, I am not that sure I saw it, since I cannot find it again despite repeated searches).
Alternatively: is it possible to request an NTLM token as the sole authentication mechanism (which would be available only from a domain controller, thus rejecting machines from outside the domain)?
