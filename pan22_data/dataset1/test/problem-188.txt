After the macro runs, sheet2 remains the same as the screenshot above, this is what Sheet1 looks like
First of all, please note CharlieRB's comment, there are not enough details in your question so I am basing my answer on some assumptions.  Secondly, this is a very elementary approach to validating your data but it'll do the job relatively quickly.
Assuming your sample table's columns are A, B, and C respectively, and row 1 is used for those headers; add headers "B Column Validation" to E1 and "C Column Validation" to F1 (See image below).  
Now using the same layout, paste the back-up data in a separate sheet of the same workbook.
Go back to the original sheet and enter this formula in E2:
Note: Obviously if your sheet is named differently or your starting cells are in different locations, you'll need to modify your formula to reflect it.
Drag fill both columns down to the final row of your spreadsheet.  Finally, if you want to color-code it you can use conditional formatting. 
Again, this is a VERY elementary way of doing this and there may be better solutions but this will work if all that you're doing is comparing two columns of data against each other.
