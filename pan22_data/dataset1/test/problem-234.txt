I have some trouble with my USB sound card  68878 from goobay.
Secondly when I use alsamixer displaying Playback items. I see both a Speaker and a Mic:
I would expect to see both a stereo mic and a stereo speaker, without the Mic in Playback
When I run speaker-test -D hw:1,0 -c2 my mic suddenly emits noise.
Additionally all images I've seen on the internet there the yellow plug is the mic and green for the headphones. This is flipped as you can see on my photo: 
So at the moment I can only playback and record audio from the green plug. I haven't been able to play any audio out of the yellow jack.
How do the items I see in alsamixer correlate with the hw:1,0
card 1: Device [Generic USB Audio Device], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
I bought one of these too - Goobay 68878 USB sound card - and the labels are reversed!
On the manufactuer's website (wentronics.com) they show them correctly - green headphone, yellow microphone - but on the actual product they are reversed. How stupid is that?
