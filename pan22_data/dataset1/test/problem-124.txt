Focus on achieving your goal, not on fixing the specific tool. If you're trying to kill Chromium's tab processes but not the main process, start by comparing their command lines, e.g. using ps -efww or pgrep -alf chromium.
You'll see that all "child" processes have a parameter like --type=zygote or --type=renderer. Since this directly describes the process' purpose, it will be more reliable than relying on minor differences in the executable name (which has nothing to do it as all Chromium subprocesses are named the same; the fact that "chromium-browser" used to work was just an artifact of Ubuntu's packaging).
Since this is part of the command line, you'll have to use pkill -f to match it:
I had been able to do killall chromium-browser to stop all chromium browser sessions, but not anymore:
That's been a while since my chromium is upgraded to newer version.
Is there still some tricks to kill chromium browser sessions this way? 
I searched and found pkill chromium, but that's not what I want, because when using killall chromium-browser, all my chromium browser sessions are stopped and memory released <-- this is what I want. All the windows are still there, if I want to see the content again, I just need to refresh. 
But when I try pkill chromium today, all my chromium sessions are dead dead, no way to refresh, or resume. The only way out is to stop and kill them all. But chromium will not offer me to do restore this way. I.e., I lost everything.
