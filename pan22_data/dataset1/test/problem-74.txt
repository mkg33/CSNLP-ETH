I work in a pretty noisy environment, lots of noise near me like the TV and people yelling and talking in really loud voices. It makes it really hard to concentrate and since I can't really move my PC to another part of the house I was thinking of getting a decent pair of noise-canceling headphones. I've never owned or used a pair before so I wanted to ask, do they block outside noise completely? As in, I'll hear nothing but silence as long as I'm wearing them?
I tried $400 and $200 Sony noise-canceling headphones at Best Buy. They were hooked up to rock tracks, and you pressed a button to broadcast the sound of a jet engine from an external speaker. They didn't kill the jet sound, only lowered it by maybe half. They were the style that covers the ears with a cushioned rim - which would've blocked out part of the external sound anyway, without the noise-canceling. I also tried 2 other sets with the jet sound playing, different makes, and they were also ineffective. Plus, I didn't like the tone of any of them. They tended to muddy up the sound with too much bass. There were many other models but you weren't allowed to listen to them!
So I don't recommend noise-canceling headphones, or Best Buy. I went to a pro music store (Long & McQuade in Toronto) and got a pair of Shure headphones for $60. Not noise-canceling, but covered the ears comfortably. So they lowered ambient noise, and most importantly sounded good,
