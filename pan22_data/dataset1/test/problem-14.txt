Tainted kernel means a condition that likely is out of support for the upstream Linux developers. Most maintainers on the LKML will ask for a reproduction of the problem on a non tainted kernel. 
Proprietary or out of tree kernel modules are a very common reason for this to be reported. But not the only one, for example a processor logging a machine check exception will be tainted. A faulty CPU can cause all kinds of strange behavior, so replacing that before claiming a kernel bug exists is prudent.
Other support channels like your distro OS support may be willing to deal with tainted kernel, ask them. That error is not necessarily a functional problem, just that a script could not identify details of proprietary modules. 
In simple term, you are using something which is not shipped with kernel or you altered something within, kernel will remain tainted even after you undo what caused the taint (i.e. unload a proprietary kernel module), to indicate the kernel remains not trustworthy. Regrading error you should check the source of the module or with vendor who provide or module is not build properly.
