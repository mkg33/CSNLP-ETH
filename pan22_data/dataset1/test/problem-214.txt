Okay, so the issue is that you made some changes with gpedit, but the changes are not present in the registry right? Have you checked to see if they are in the registry immediately after making the change with the policy editor?
You may want to audit the registry entries to find out who/what is changing them. That will make it much easier to stop it since as you considered, it may be something else (like a system process or something) that is making the change, so setting restrictions on the user group has no effect.
You can set it up with the Group Policy Editor, but I find the Permissions Dialog dialog to be easier:
Background: I run a small computer lab of 10 computers using Windows 7 x64 Enterprise.  Our users are set up as limited users.  For additional restrictions, I set up local group policy for non-administrators using the microsoft management console.
Problem: Recently, I found out that some of these restrictions had been removed.  Reviewing the settings MMC and in ntuser.pol showed that the settings should still be in place.  However, the related registry settings were missing in ntuser.dat.  I already have registry editing disabled in the GPO (though not in silent mode).
Question: What is the best way to deal with this situation?  Should I look into preventing registry setting changes?  Should I set up registry auditing to found out how these keys are getting changed in the first place?  Or should I give up the ghost and write some kind of logon script that enforces registry values if they've been change?  Any other ideas?
