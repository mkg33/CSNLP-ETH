Sounds like you all you need to do is add the command in the exec shell dialog. The other settings sound right to me. What's in the console output of your Jenkins Job?
If you added the git repo location and the system has proper access to that repo, or if you setup credentials in the Jenkins job, try setting up an execute shell command by adding the full path to Python and the local path to script.
Our Jenkins installation executes from a local workspace container for each job.
I have a python script that takes in 3 arguments to run. Via a terminal you would use it like this:
I want to create a new jenkins job which basically utilizes this script and runs it after the 3 arguments have been provided. However I cannot find any examples which run such a job. The script is placed in a github repo so its path looks like this: https://github.com/username/repo/folder/script.py. This is what I did:
 1. I went ahead and created a new job New Item --> Freestyle Project.
 2. Under GitBucket --> Githubproject I added the path : https://github.com/username/repo/
 3. I then clicked on This build is parameterized and added 3 choice
 4. Then under build I selected execute shell and gave the command python script.py $param1 $param2 $param3
My question is that , in step 2, should I be giving the path to the script as https://github.com/username/repo/folder/script.py or is it right the way I have it now.
Any suggestions / links to tutorials will be helpful
