I write a paragraph saying who I am, and where and how long I have taught.  This is standard for all letters.
I write a brief second paragraph stating how long and in what capacities I have known the student.
I then answer these four questions from an old Columbia form. 
A.  Please tell us about the candidate's intellectual qualities and
academic work.  We are interested in the nature of his or her motivation for scholarship, breadth, and depth of intellectual interest, originality, and
capacity for growth.  Cite specific examples where appropriate.
B. What are your impressions of the candidate's character and maturity?
How do fellow students, teachers and you regard him as a person compared with
contemporaries?  Does the candidate show open--mindedness toward opinions,
values, and backgrounds different from his own?  Does he have any special
strengths, weaknesses or problems of which we should be aware?  We would
welcome any additional comments you think might be helpful to us.
C. What has been the candidate's most valuable contribution to your
D. Do you have any reason to doubt this student's integrity?
Lastly, I have a closing paragraph that looks like this:
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.  If you have questions,
please send me e-mail at XXXX@gmail.com; this account is entirely separate
from the school and you may communicate in complete confidence.  You may also call me at home in the evening at 919-XXX-XXXX.
My work phone and address appear in the head of the letter.
I keep my letters of recommendation short (half page); HR (human resources) are only interested in validation. The second interview -- typically in front of the hiring manager-- will go into greater depth. My signature reflect my credentials; my composition reflects my education. Employers aren't interested in me; they are interested in my proposed candidate.
How Long to write? I collaborate with my students. I provide them a rough draft template, and request their input on other facts they wish to reveal. Unfortunately, 90% accept my rough  draft as final copy.
