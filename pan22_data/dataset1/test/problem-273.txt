I saw this question asked some times but no one correlates to mine. I see people using the GetComponent() function but this one should work too.
First I receive a Bool value from a toggle button and assign it as a field of the object 'hydro':
Then I have the object where this bool change should be recognized and sent as an output, but it doesn't:
As requested, this is where the function ControlPanel() is called:
Do you have any idea why does this Bool does not get updated? Any help appreciated.
You're actually referring to 2 different instances of HydroElectric, which is why you're not seeing the bool change value.
As it stands hydroProwerControlPanel holds an instance of HydroElectric whose value changes when you call turbineState, but PlayLevel1 holds a completely different instance of HydroElectric and that instances value is never modified.
There are a couple of ways around this. You could implement the Singleton pattern if there is only ever going to be one HydroElectric per scene, or you can pass PlayLevel1 the instance of HydroElectric that you want to monitor (known as Dependency Injection)
