So in your previous setup I suspect your fully qualified domain name was something more then just the bare hostname.  Perhaps router.local., or router.lan. or something else like that.  With a fully qualified name defined, you could then the DNS search path setting for your network via your DHCP server.  
So your routers hostname would be router.local., and your DNS resolvers would have a search patch of local.  That when your clients perform a lookup for router, the DNS client will automatically append the .local. and then successfully resolve the address.
If you are using DNSMasq as both your DHCP and DNS server making this happen should be trivial.
I realize that a trailing dot after a hostname is technically "correct", but it's a pain in the butt to type and is unintuitive for non-technical users. I had DDWRT on a Linksys router of mine many, many years ago, and it resolved local hostnames via dnsmasq without the trailing dot. However, having just installed Tomato onto my Asus N66U, trailing dots are always required. For example, "ping router" doesn't work, but "ping router." does.
Assuming my router's hostname is "router", I'd like dnsmasq to allow me to type "ping router", "http://router/", etc and have it work as expected. Does anyone know how to configure dnsmasq to do so?
Modifying my HOSTS file is not acceptable, and I've shut off NetBIOS over TCP/IP completely (I'm slowly transitioning to a Linux-only network), so that is not an option for numerous reasons. Thanks.
