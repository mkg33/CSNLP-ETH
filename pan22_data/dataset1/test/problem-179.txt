As the comment says offset only effects the children, i.e the text inside the button.
Since you set the same image for up and down you wont see any change on the actual button when you click it. You need to change down to whatever color or image you want to show on click, giving it an animation effect. 
If you want the actual button to 2move" like the text inside it, well I don't think libdx has any built in methods for that. 
Sorry yesterday I was a wreck :) but I just found a solution for you. Simply build up the button yourself... lol, I cannot believe I didn't think of that yesterday?
You can add any actor you want to the button since it's actually a table with a click state. Anything within the button should be offset and thus you can put a label with background like I did, a stack with an image and label on top or even multiple tables inside the button.
So in your case you just need to setup a label with your text and use your achievements region as the background or seperate image. Put those in your custom made button and you are set.
