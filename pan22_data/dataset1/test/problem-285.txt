Do you know about ZFS-Fuse?  It's stable and fast enough for everyday use now.  I'd really recommend it over running an OpenSolaris VM just for ZFS, especially now that OpenSolaris has been discontinued.
If you want a dedicated ZFS NAS, take a look at FreeNAS.
Please don't use virtualization on that Core 2 Quad Q6600 processor! While it won't be a total waste if you insist on doing it anyway, there is a huge disincentive to doing so: your processor is so old that it does not have the Extended Page Tables (EPT) CPU instructions. This means that page tables in the guest have to be emulated in software, which is slow. Benchmarks comparing performance between EPT-enabled and non-EPT processors heavily favor the EPT processors.
Since EPT has been on three generations of Intel CPUs by now (original Nehalem / Core i7, Sandy Bridge, and Ivy Bridge), your hardware is, frankly, obsolete for the purpose of virtualization. So either don't virtualize, or upgrade.
The rule of thumb is: if the processor's branding is named "Core i" followed by a number, it has EPT. If the processor's branding has anything else in the name, it almost assuredly does not have EPT. This only takes into account mainstream desktop processors; server processors such as Xeon also offer EPT, but the rules for determining which processors have it and which don't are less clear.... you're better off reading the detailed tech spec sheets in that case.
I am not making a product recommendation here; I am merely cautioning you that your current hardware is extremely suboptimal for full operating system virtualization, compared to other products that are readily available on the market. EPT isn't anything new; I've owned multiple PCs with it since 2009. It really is the key to opening up like-native performance in virtualized guests, especially on the desktop.
