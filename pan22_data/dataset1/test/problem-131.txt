This is more of a hunch, but given that it is an older ms sql server... and that you can remove sluggishness when you restart the sql server instance, perhaps the issue is a use of temp tables either getting too large and/or not having proper indexes? 
If the sluggishness persisted after an sql service restart, i would say it could just be basic SQL bottlnecks (which typically involve optimizing the queries, indexes, and tables used). I am also not entirely sure how ms sql 2000 works in terms of recovery modes and transaction logs, but i would presume it would be similar. Transaction logs build up if the database is in "full" recovery mode, unless you have a maintenance plan that backs up and archives those logs. This might detract from the disk space available for the temporary tables to form.
As far as seeing who is logged on, i believe you can use the SQL management studio (might be called some form of query editor in sql 2000) and run the command "sp_who" or "sp_who2" which will show you the current connections being used by SQL...usually it includes the hostname of the computer who is connected as well.
Ok I am our only IT guy here and all this was set up by the previous guy. I know pretty much nothing about databases.
We have some software called E2 that keeps track of all our inventory. We also have centerpoint payroll for our payroll.
We used to restart our server (2k3) whenever E2 was starting to be laggy and sluggish. We would do this by
Well one day I figured out that I could go into the SQL server service manager on the server and hit stop and then start on the AMCO\RWS server and it would have the same effect as a full restart but was a 30 second ordeal rather than 15 minutes plus. Also we only had to have everyone log out of E2 rather than everything.
But now that I think things over I am not sure I am doing right here. I am restarting the AMCO/RWS server for E2 however I am of a passing thought that that may be the database for the payroll software seeing as our payroll is done by RedWing Software. However if i stop that then E2 no longer can connect so they seem to be related somehow. And I can't really tell if anybody is logged into payroll seeing as that person works from home via remote desktop.
