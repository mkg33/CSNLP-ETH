I have Windows 10 / Windows 7 dual boot on my laptop. Boot mode is UEFI with CSM and my hard drive is correctly formatted and partitioned in GPT. Windows 7 used to work well before I decided to fully re-install it.
First bit of background, (I believe) I am experienced in installing Windows and playing around with WIMs and related utilities. I manually captured a backup WIM a long time ago but now I don't want to use it. I took install.wim from the 64-bit Windows 7 DVD image and applied it by hand:
I formatted drive G prior to installing so it's clean.
I left the BCD unchanged and tried booting it. Well it stuck at disk.sys. I then applied the backup WIM to make sure everything is fine. So it is. The system from my backup WIM functions normally, without anything else changed. This ensures that all my configuration like BCD and BIOS settings are correct.
I do NOT want to create any USB installer or burn a DVD. How would I make a freshly "installed" Windows 7 boot?
Your assumption is incorrect that the unchanged BCD settings can be used for the new install.  You need to generate new settings with either the bcdboot or bootrec command-line utilities after you've applied the image.
