It is common to see this kind of "probing" where someone is guessing whether specific directories exist.  It's a kind of profiling where the existence of certain pages indicates that certain software is installed on the server, or that certain usernames likely exist on the server, and can be a precursor to other kinds of hacking.
I run a number of websites, and all of them see this kind of probing almost daily.
The fact that they are coming from different IP addresses could be an indication that the probe is being conducted via a botnet - especially if there appears to be a pattern to the probing across various IP addresses.
There is nothing you can do to stop this; however, you could definitely minimize the impact on your system by serving up a very simple 404 page.  It could also be a reminder to ensure all your software is patched and up-to-date, and you have strong passwords on any internet-facing servers. 
Well if they're really only hitting you once per ip address, for all different pages, then there really isn't anything you can do but trim down the 404 page...Or you could just redirect 'em to the front page and declare it as a page view...;)
