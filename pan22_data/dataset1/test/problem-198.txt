I have been investigating the various products that Microsoft's Azure has to offer on and off for about a year now.
I have setup a couple of App Services which operate against some SQL databases hosted on their servers.
I am now looking to tidy up a bit and have selected the ResourceGroup which contains everything.
There appear to be some services within this group which I dod not remember creating. I'm not saying I didn't do so whilst experimenting and exploring, but I'm really not sure.
I'd like to get rid of anything which is unnecessary, but I'm having difficulty determining what is and isn't required.
Obviously I don't want to kill anything which is actively being used.
Here is a list of unfamiliar things which appear to be in my ResourceGroup
What steps can I take to determine the necessity of each of these?
You can also look in Activity Log of Resource Group to see who is operating with those resources. Logs are saved for 30 days, so if resources were created recently you will see the name of the person who added the resource in your resource group.
