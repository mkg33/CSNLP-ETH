Ethernet can run on different media, e.g. fiber-optic cabling (supposed to be installed in a crossover fashion, while UTP cabling is supposed to be installed straight-through). So when you refer to an ethernet cable, you really need to explain to which medium you refer.
A crossover cable is where the transmit line(s) on one and go the the receive lines on the other end, assuming both devices are the same type (both DTE or both DCE). Remember that UTP cabling is used for more than just ethernet, so don't limit yourself to believing that.
"Local custom terminology" in many places I've worked is:
2-pair crossover was for ethernet but also allowing other use of the cable, such as phone usage.  4-pair crossover is just for ethernet, but is needed if you have 4-pair ethernet.
We liked straight white for voice, yellow straight for ether, red for crossover.  2-pair crossovers went in the bin.
Etherent crossover cables are not much used now that auto-crossover ethernet ports are so common.
Flat swap cables are mostly common in Cisco-type RS-232 console use, and is normally "flat" cable, not twisted pairs.  It is, of course, a crossover cable, but not for ethernet.
