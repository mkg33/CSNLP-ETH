While it is possible to embed files and other things into Excel spreadsheets, this should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
Excel spreadsheets are designed to handle numbers and some letters most efficiently.
When you place something else, for instance a PDF, into a PDF by embedding, or even by screenshot (which creates a picture, which is also not numbers or letters), that the spreadsheet is not designed to handle, it may be CAPABLE of handling the content, but it will not be as effective or efficient in doing so.
The file sizes will likely balloon, and there could also be compatibility issues in certain circumstances.
The best thing to do is to keep each file in its own appropriate type.
I would like to import Legal and Professional Invoices into my Excel workbook so that an auditor will not have to receive additional emails that would normally include about 50 invoice copies. I can import pdf as object, one page at a time, but the file gets too large. Importing as a picture requires too much photo editing. Is there a way to import a multi page pdf into Excel that does not make the file excessively large?
