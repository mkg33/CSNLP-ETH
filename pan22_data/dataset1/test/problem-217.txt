I've never explicitly set deadlines for myself like that, but getting things done quickly can be important when working for yourself.
When writing a game yourself, efficient code is usually not the problem.  The problem is often staying motivated.  Getting something that works, even if it's not optimally efficient, can be a big enough motivator to keep you going and finish it.  You can always go back and refactor later if you end up with something good.  Trying to do everything right from the beginning might lead to it never getting finished.
I do this a few times a year;  give myself a week to design and implement and release a game.
I do it because I'm a perfectionist.  Given my choice, I'd work on a game forever.  Having a hard deadline (which I publish in advance) forces me to actually stop developing and to just release the damn game on schedule.  Since my personal rule going into these exercises is that I'm not allowed to modify any of these games after their deadline passes, it also keeps me focused on future projects, and not distracted by thoughts of tweaking older ones.
