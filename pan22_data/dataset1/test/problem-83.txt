I don't see anything wrong with the way you are testing.
You may want to include negative numbers in your test cases. 
I prefer to have test cases broken up. It's easier to track down failing tests:
Even in tests you should follow naming standards. Names such as A, B C are not very descriptive. Also they should start with a lower-case letter. result would be a better name. You use the same variable throughout.
Use assertTrue and assertFalse instead of assertEquals(true/false, x).
IMO arrayLength would be a better name then n. Or you could use arr.length.
There isn't anything inherently wrong with repeating assertions in the same test, and for few test case values like yours this is perfectly fine. But if you need to test a large set of values, consider using a parameterized test like the following:
                {true,  new int[] {32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 34} },
                {false, new int[] {32, 32, 34, 33} },
                {false, new int[] {32, 32, 31, 30, 32} }
        assertEquals(expectedResult, SortedOrNot.isSorted(array));
