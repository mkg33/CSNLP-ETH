Take a look at the "postscreen" feature of postfix:
RBL-Checks to differnt RBL-services are made, to check if the sending mail server is known as a spammer.
The DNSBL rank log entry shows the ranked value of all tests.
If this exceeds postscreen_dnsbl_threshold which is a mostly configured by 3, the server rejects the mail, and ask the sender to try again later.
Most spammers will not do this, since they only try to push out as much as they can, without trying to re-send.
Postscreen will remember a connection try from a specific sending server and the receiving mail-address.
If the postscreen_dnsbl_threshold was not reached, a later try will let the mail pass (logging it with PASS NEW).
If the server re-sends the mail after a few minutes, postscreen will allow it (logging it with PASS OLD), 
I'm getting the combination of these Postfix infos and I was wondering if I should be aware of something / someone.
There are some parts like Look up 182.176.115.31 on whitelist, result 200 DUNNO or PASS OLD [87.243.7.183]:64492 which I do not really understand.
What does PASS OLD or PASS NEW mean? I googled for it and read something about spam prevention, but for me this looks like spam, so why is postfix preventing the IP from it?
