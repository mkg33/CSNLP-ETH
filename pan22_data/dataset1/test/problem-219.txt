You might be interested in an online algorithm, which is one that processes the input in a serial manner. Here is a paper with fast algorithms that tests planarity after adding an edge or a vertex, and does so much faster than $O(m+n)$ time (it does so in $O(\log{n})$):

You will be interested in the edge-addition version of this. And you could ask your question with any two edge sets, but since you seem to have info that both $G_1$ and $G_2$ are planar, you can start with the one which is larger, knowing it is planar, then add edges from the other graph one at a time.
In a 'worst case' where $|E_1| = |E_2| = m$, you would have to decide when this $\frac{m}{2}O(\log{n})$ is better or worse than just applying a $O(m+n)$ planarity test.
There are a number of ambiguities in your question.  If you are given both $G_1$ and $G_2$ offline, then from a big-$O$ perspective, the problem is $\Theta(n_1+m_1 + n_2+m_2)$. If one or both are given online, then you should follow what Jim said.  It sounds like your measure of efficiency is a practical one, in which case you're better off using industrial software to run the obvious approach.
