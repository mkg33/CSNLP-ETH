To that extent I don't believe there is any StackExchange forum that will suitable to ask this question as the answer depend on your situation and requires extensive followups.
The behavior seems very much like a virus but it will need further investigation.
Install  Microsoft Security Essentials and perform a full scan with it. If its a virus it should be detected and removed.
Go to a website dedicated to fixing computer virus like HijackThis based forum, http://www.hijackthis.de/ and ask for help there. They will ask for a hijackthis log and the forum will have detailed instruction on how to get the log and how to post asking for help. Follow the rules and you will be get help soon.
PS : That behavior in it self doesn't imply a virus but it is very likely. It could also be a malfunctioning program but the help forum linked about will give you the definite answer.
