It sounds like "as new" is dishonest or there is malware on the system. The first thing to do would be to check the fully charged capacity /health of the battery - if its less then about 95% of new capacity I dont think it can be considered "as new" (and I've returned a laptop on that basis). If its < 80% the battery is considered end of life.
You did not advise your OS, but if its Windows 10 you can generate a report by running the following command in a cmd box launched as administrator, then use a web browser to read the resulting report:
Another thing to check is self discharge - if you fully charge the laptop then turn it off overnight how much charge does it lose? If a cell is damaged, it could explain heat buildup and short runtime.
The second thing to look at is the CPU utilization. It sounds like there might be something eating up all the available CPU - this will drain the battery fast and cause a lot of heat which will cause the fan to be on. Look at task manager to see cpu utiluzation and processes and run av and anti-malware across the system.
Also, look at power profiles. The system will perform more responsively but drain a lot more resources if the power profile is set to performance as opposed to a more balanced mode.
Lastly, try look into the fan grate and see if there is lint blocking the airflow.
I just bought a 'Like New' Dell Latitude 5590 laptop. I ran an initial diagnostics when I bought it, and everything seemed good.
After a full battery charging, I realize that the battery can't last more than 2 hours which is very low. the battery is 68 WHr 4-Cell
The fan makes some noise!! sometimes it starts making a lot of noise for a good amount of time!!
What do you think about these two problems, is it normal or not for this Dell Latitude 5590 I7 8th gen 16G RAM and 500G SSD
