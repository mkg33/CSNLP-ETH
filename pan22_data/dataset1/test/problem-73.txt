I have an odd situation here, so I thought I'd see if anyone else has run into it. I have a Hyper-V host (2012) that had two VM's on it, one of which was an Exchange 2013 server. The other is a 2012 file server. The Exchange server has been pegged at 100% utilization, the file server is about 50%.
As a test I built a Windows 2012R2 server and being a fresh install doing exactly nothing it had CPU utilization of 10-15%.
I have been troubleshooting with MS thinking it was something on the Exchange server causing the issue.  But today I moved it (using Hyper-V move while it was running) to another (similar hardware) Hyper-V host, and the utilization has dropped to 2%.
The hardware is roughly equivalent but not exactly the same.
MS support was unable to isolate a cause for this condition;however, migrating all vm's off of the host, and then back fixed the utilization issue.  I can only assume that it was something in the way the VM's were interfacing with the physical processors and the migration process eliminated it.
Check your bios. Make sure to set performance to maximum instead of power saving mode. Some Dell servers have that issue.
