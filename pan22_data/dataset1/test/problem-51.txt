My ADSL is being upgraded to FTTC/VDSL next week. I'm told that it no longer involves an engineer visit - BT are sending me a new router, and I just plug in the new router where my current ADSL router is plugged in.
I'm using a microfilter because I don't have a filtered faceplate. Do I use my existing microfilter, or do I need a new type of microfilter for FTTC/VDSL?
Extra info: I have just the one phone socket with no extensions so it's a very simple config. The existing ADSL has been working fine for several years so the existing filter is fine for ADSL.

Using an existing microfilter can result in much lower speeds than when a filtered faceplate is fitted.
Faceplate filters are inexpensive (Â£9.95 from Amazon) and will generally deliver significant improvements in broadband speeds.
