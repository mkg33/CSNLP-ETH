The Pi in this diagram is being used as a Wireless Bridge to connect the wireless network to the wired network containing the NAS.  
A bridge is a device which (almost seamlessly) joins segments of network which may be different physical or low-level protocols (802.3 for wired and 802.11 for wireless.)   If it offered up an SSID for wireless clients to connect to directly then it would be an Access Point.
Because of the relatively slow performance of the Pi's Ethernet port (up to 100mb) it would probably be better to purchase another wifi router (which will handle better throughput) and configure this as a bridge.
Before doing research on how to configure the Raspberry Pi, I need some help knowing what the role of the Raspberry Pi, in this set up, is called.

Note: In the network schema, the rest of the network users are connected by WiFi.
