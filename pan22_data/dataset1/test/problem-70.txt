I would like to perform a fresh install of TFS 2010 on my HP MediaSmart Server EX 490. The EX 490 has a 900 GB drive with a 20 GB partition for the OS. I have added two additional 1.5 TB drives extending the storage space. This balances those two drives and the D:\ partition of the first drive across as one volume.
This article (Installing Team Foundation Server 2010 on Windows Home Server)
seems to indicate that I should not have included both drives as storage hard drives, but rather have one separate for the SQL Server Express 2008 database.
I am incline to just put the database in D:\, which is magically across these three drives, by installing SQL Server Express first. Is this a good approach? Finally how do I install anything, given that I have ISO files to work with?
SQL server data files are best put on their own drive.  Due to the large number of reads and writes this may overwhelm WHS drive extender.  Your second question about ISO files...these are image files that need to be burnt to a DVD (not copied).
Since you have TFS2010 I assume you have an MSDN subscription.  I'd suggest installing 2K8R2 on a separate server and putting TFS there.  Personally I wouldn't want to mess with my WHS functionality.
