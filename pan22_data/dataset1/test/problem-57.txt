Have you checked to make sure that your .ReSharper.user files aren't marked as read-only? As far as I can test, Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 can write to hidden files just fine (look for a .suo file next to your solution to check). If you're using version control systems, it'll generally mark the file as read-only while they're checked in. If you are, you've probably included the .ReSharper.user files in with your project and checked them in which would have made them read-only. Check them out or remove them from source control to be able to write to them.
I am currently able to reproduce the issue in ReSharper v6.0.  Issue likely stems from a File.Exists() call not detecting the file when hidden.  As such, I've logged a ticket for potential resolution:
RSRP-287503 Error saving solution settings ( ReSharper.user ) if file is hidden
I wouldn't say that Windows programs are inconsistent when working with hidden files, but care must be used when designing software to properly accommodate situations where accessing a hidden file might come into play ( as in this instance with ReSharper )
