I also had problems with ext4 and the raspberry pi (3), when trying to format a usb stick with
(after creating a gpt table and a linux partition with fdisk)
So I tried to format the usb stick with gparted on another pc and 
when it worked I checked for the command gparted was using and tried to format the usb sick with this command on my raspberry pi.
It still took some time (about a minute) but it worked.
You can also use parted for this purpose. I formatted two external disks with parted as ext4 and they work well.
Before you plug the device run ls -t /dev | grep sd and run it again after you plug and note the device letter (I'll use sdX). Unmount the drive if it is automatically mounted (it will have a partition number when mounted):
Run parted without the partition number an as root:
Now plug and unplug the device, if does not mount automatically, mount it as root. Note that, since Rpi is a low power consuming device, USB port does not feed an external HDD which does not have separate power supply.
