The mark up column isn't a document feature that is copied from one document to another, instead it's a feature of the Word editor itself which appears over the whole document when there is markup such as comments or revisions to be viewed and can be turned on and off from the ribbon.
I hope this explains why it appears and why there won't be any way for it to appear on a certain subset of pages only. In order to localize markup to one page you may want to think of using textboxs and shapes instead of comments.
I have a .doc document which has comments and the markup column (call it A), and I want to insert it in a bigger document (B), which is the plain format master document. When I insert A to B, B takes the format of A and the markup column is being inserted in the whole B. How can I change that?
I tried working in different sections, via the break, and insert text via 'Insert object', but B keeps obtaining the markup column. Google did not help.
Is there any way that I can disassociate completely different pages in one word document, and therefore only selected pages in the whole document have the markup collumn?
