You really need to look at the HTTP streams beneath to find out what is going on.  If you aren't fetching the same exact HTML document from your local IP and Internet-facing IP then you've introduced additional variables into your investigation here.
Off the top of my head I'd say it's your browser asking for the favicon.ico as well as the index.html from google.com.  It'd be two separate HTTP requests.  Given AJAX and such Javascript may also be involved. 
IE uses a zone model, treating web sites differently depending on what zone they belong to. If your non-routable IP is considered part of the intranet zone, it is expected to receive different treatment. This does not only influence security settings; intranet sites may also be rendered using prehistoric rendering standards even if they have a HTML5 doctype. (Note: Your testing IP may or may not be considered intranet, depending on your configuration.)
As sites in a intranet typically have a very low round-trip delay and high reliability, it would make sense to keep less parallel connections open. It is also possible that IE does other things differently (e.g. preparing to load certain resources, fetching favicons, ...).
I could not find any document explicitly stating that any such behavior is different depending on the zone, but that means little when it comes to weird IE behavior. Some of the differences I mentioned are explained here and this document mentions that caching is separate for the zones.
Even if you don't have the intranet zone enabled, I would not be surprised if IE had some special handling for non-routable IP addresses (the pointless "ignore HTML5 doctype if in intranet zone" shows what weird stuff is to be expected from IE).
Also note the weird timestamps in your screenshot. Maybe something is wrong with the capture or your interpretation of it.
TL;DR: Do not use IE. If you do, do not be surprised if it does weird things.
