You can do it from the GUI. It's not where you would normally find it though. When connected to Remote Desktop there is an additional menu item, usually name something like "Windows Security". I can't recall the exact wording on XP. In there you'll find your usual shutdown, logoff, etc.
Using Remote Desktop (RDP/Terminal Services), I can't select Shutdown/Reboot from the Windows XP start menu, so I generally have to open a terminal and enter shutdown -s -t 0 to initiate an immediate shutdown.
But, for a new system, I have added a non-administrative user to the Remote Desktop Users group, and when I try to issue a shutdown command as that user, the command returns the following error:
I verified that my user has the "Shutdown" privilege in the Security Settings (in the Group Policy editor: Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment, the Shut down the system policy). What other privilege do I need?
In addition to the Shut down the system right, also ensure the user has the right to the Force shutdown from a remote system policy.
In my case, I added the Remote Desktop Users group to that policy.
