For that distance, if you want to do twisted pair, I would do Cat6A, not Cat6.  Cat6A can do 10gigE at 100 meters.  Get plenum-rated cable.
Fiber is also an option.  Thinner, less prone to interference.  You will need fiber hardware on both ends of the connection though.  Since your switches have SFP ports, this should be fairly easy to do.
The company I work for is expanding to a new office on the same building but one floor below.
I wondering how best to connect the two network together in order to have one single network.
Upstairs we have all internal servers (NAS, domain, etc) and the endpoint for the Internet connection.
Ideally clients of both offices would share the same access to servers and Internet. 
There will be around 15 users active per office, at peak times.
If I run a cable between the two switches, that would be around 70 meters long. Unfortunately the cable will have to pass near electricity cables.
Could I achieve decent performance with a couple of cat6 cables? Is it worth to invest on fibre cables?
