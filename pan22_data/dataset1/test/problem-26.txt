This is more a comment but too long so have to put as an Answer.
So you have common shared services that have separate entities for each household. A bit like a Datacentre has multiple Servers for different clients but they cannot access each others? 
I think you need to split the Services apart so rather than throwing them all in one topology you need to think about which ones are shared open and which are shared in isolation. For example this web server what is it going to host? I guess one website all the households can view therefore it can be 'open' to all.
The SIP Server can setup using forwarding to push telephone numbers to a specific IP so no household visibility is required they will simply get a number for VOIP and that's that. I would need to know a little more about the IP intercom with video stream to really give my opinion.
Most likely you are going to be looking at a situation where you have this topology:
Outside world > Firewall > Shared Services > Firewall > Open Services > Household...
The wireless can be configured once each household has a cabled connection...
The solution is as follows. First, every household gets a separate VLAN. The shared network also gets one. 
Centrally we will use a switch with VLAN access control. Every household gets a switch that routes known ip addresses to the central switch and all other traffic to the internet modem.
We will supply ip addresses from a central DHCP server.
