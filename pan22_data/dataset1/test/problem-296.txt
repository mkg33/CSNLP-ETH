If it is only an HTTP connection to Oracle website, why don't you make them use web-proxies?
The question is - Is there a risk in allowing production servers to have HTTP/S connections outbound to the Internet.  The short answer is NO.  The longer answer that the security risk is so minimal that it outweighs the cost (in terms of time) to manage those servers.
The first point it mitigated by restricting Internet access to known sites, and ideally not allowing web browsing at all.  Additionally, there is a certain trust in your administrators to not act in a malicious manner.
On the second point, considering that the server was already compromised in some fashion, whether or not Internet access is available is a moot point.  The attacker has already found a way to get code on to your systems which means they can get additional code to that system or retrieve data from it.
Obviously, this may all depend on specific circumstances (like meeting certain customer or regulatory requirements).
