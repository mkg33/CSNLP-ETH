I have a feeling it's the DHT startup. When you first start the client, it's trying to join the DHT swarm (iirc the initial bootstrap node is node0.bittorrent.org) which would then pass you off to a bunch of other nodes, probably in a datacenter like AWS, before you get regular everyday nodes (other clients)
I have this weird situation that every time I open my bittorrent client application, upon its start, it starts to make a lot of multiple connections(more than thousands) to amazonaws servers and as you can see, all of the connections statuses are SYN_SENT
the number of connections are so high that during the first 20 or 30 seconds of the application start, my computer will become very slow and the application continues to make new connections for few minutes and then stops after few minutes and then the connections start to close gradually and in the end after 5 or 6 minutes from the application start, everything will go back to normal.
BitTorrent.exe   TCP    my-pc   49788   ec2-23-23-85-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com  http    SYN_SENT
I've read the the application is looking for the update and also some seedboxes are using amazonaws servers.
As these connections start to created at the same time I run the application and even before the application load my torrents list so downloading torrents from the amazon servers is not my case. and about the update, I'm not sure, but making this much connections is way more that what is neede to check for the update.
I've searched for this problem, but did not find any results.
So does anyone have same problem as I have or know the solution for my case?
