The bleeding edge (4.2.x) versions of dhclient support this by providing a gethostname() function.
So with the latest dhclient alpha, you can put something like this in dhclient.conf
Ubuntu have a patch in their version of dhclient which lets you do 
Redhat patch their dhclient to provide -H and -F (-H = send host-name, -F = send fqdn.fqdn) command line options. So on Redhat you can run 
I'm not aware of anything available for Debian though - you might want to look at patching your dhclient with the Ubuntu patch 
My DNS Servers are updated by our DHCP Server (Microsoft Windows 2003 R2 SP2).
My clients are Debian Linux Distro's, and I have to modify my DHCLIENT.CONF file on it to send his Full Qualified Hostname.
BUT I've about 1600 computers and I don't want to modify each client one by one, then, Could I for exemple use a System Variable on the Config file?
send "$hostname"  where $hostname variable is the alias write on BASHRC for the hostname -f command.
Many thanks for everyone (you both), I've discovered a huge tools, named Puppet and increase my skills in scripting.
