I found the simplest way to solve this was to write the initial backup to disk then duplicate the backup images to tape.  
Multiplexed backups are more likely to span tapes, are harder to import or use outside netbackup, are slower to restore, and are an all-around ugly hack created to prevent shoe-shining tapes.
Netbackup has really nice direct-to-disk functionality and the CLI tools make it pretty easy to script up image duplication mechanisms.  
My question is... what multiplexing factor in NetBackup is recommended / do you use for Oracle RMAN backups over 1Gb/s management network to LTO3?
With enterprise backup tools like NetBackup, there is the concept of Multiplexing which is the combining of data from a number of backup clients simultaneously in order to feed modern high speed tape drives as quickly as possible.
The number of simultaneous client data streams interleaved is determined by the Multiplexing factor. The higher the multiplexing factor, the more data fed to the tape drive, but the slower any restores.
As overall restore speed is mostly determined by the messing about (log incident, determine if tapes are available, recall from offsite, load, inventory, etc. ) than by the actual tape restore speed, I feel confident using a high factor for filesystem backups.
Oracle backups with large datasets, which are more often restored all together, pose a different challenge to filesystem backups.
