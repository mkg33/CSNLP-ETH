I'm assuming the e-mail being sent contains data covered by HIPAA.
The short answer is probably not. You're likely required to use end-to-end encryption.
However the real answer is you should talk to a HIPAA auditor, or someone with a deep understanding of both the legislation, and how auditors and judges have been understanding it.
Please don't take any random answer from the Internet when it comes to things like this where a slight mistake, in addition to putting you out of business could cause serious hardship for people.
You need to talk to a HIPAA security specialist, however the EPHI standards would cover TLS.  However you are correct in that it would have to be forced you would have to reject a connection that refuses tls.
Contrary to what a sane admin might think the hipaa regs are not about security per se.  They simply spell out some requirements that some senators thought meant security.  Eg as Chris S correctly pointed out encryption clients should have to prove their identity, however that's not part of the standard.  Email is usually not encrypted as it is transferred to a users system- however that's specifically not required (storage on the destination system is) - however either storing it in a password protected PST on on the exchange server is adequate as it's not cleartext.  This doesn't mean that you can't or shouldn't do the right thing, it just means that from the lawyers standpoint the requirement was fulfilled.
IMHO both 21CFR part 11 and HIPAA both need serious overhauls, and not from folks that think the internet is a series of tubes
