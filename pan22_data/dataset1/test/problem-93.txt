Did you try to expose the  Virtualization Extensions to the VM?

I would like to run hyper-v on a hyper-v server which in theory is possible. But when I try to start a VM in the child hyper-v I get an error. I checked the Event log and there it is, code 41. Hypervisor launch failed; Either VMX not present or not enabled in BIOS.
We are running the host Hyper-V on an HP DL580 gen8 with 4x Xeon E7-4890 v2, 512GB Ram and 4TB accessible storage and 2x 10Gb Network.
So I've checked the BIOS and Virtualization is enabled, VT-d was enabled, I disabled it, because I read it on an old TechNet blog that U should disable it.
VT-x enabled, No-Execute Protection enabled, HT enabled, 0 Cores disabled and Power Management set to OS Controlled.
It did not made any difference that VT-d is enabled or not. The child Hyper-V always gives the same error. Oh and there is another error, if I manage the VM with Windows Admin Center when I click Virtual Machines I get an error notification that Powershell can't get CPU info, but in overview it shows the correct cpu and core count. 
The child hyper-v is running in a Gen.2 VM if it makes any difference.
Oh and both the Host and VM is Hyper-V Server 2019 (Core)
I read a loads of TN forum posts, blog entries about this error, but almost all suggest the same. Disable/Enable: VT, Trusted Execution, Disable Execute Bit... and turn off the machine and start up else the changes won't take effect. But this didn't helped me.
