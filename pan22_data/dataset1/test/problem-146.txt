is from attempting to run a plugin. Do what the message says:
Secondly, your change of permissions was very, very, very BAD. Do not do this. As it is now, anyone who logs into (or cracks into) your box will have full ability to write into all these directories, and can run things as the nagios user, and can potentially craft bad web pages to hack further into your system or into others. Don't ever set permissions to 777 (except for /tmp, which is actually set to 1777).
Lastly, make sure you have a configuration set up for services, hosts, et al - not just for the server itself. In the Nagios web page, you should be able to see the configuration by clicking on a link to the left (towards the bottom). My guess is that if you do that, there will either be an error or nothing will display.
When you're starting nagios, you're using an init.d script? If running "/path/to/nagios -v /path/to/nagios.cfg" says there are no problems, but trying to start it "normally" balks, then the init.d script might be trying to start it in a different way (perhaps wrong config file path?).
A return code of 127 means "file not found". Some packaged nagios installs use a nagios "resource" for the plugin path (like "USER1=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins", and then $USER1$/check_disk for the path), and this might be set incorrectly. If not USER1 or similar, then the path to the plugin is just plain wrong (or the plugin doesn't exist) in the command definition.
