I opened the video source of the gif in VLC and MPC-HC, took snapshots using the program menus, took screenshots using PrtSc, and exported the frame (from both the gif and the video) using ffmpeg: http://imgur.com/a/hustU
The ffmpeg image from the video matches VLC's snapshot, but does not match the screenshot of VLC (unless "Use hardware YUV->RGB conversions" is disabled). The screenshot of VLC seems to be the closest match to the frame from the gif. MPC's snapshot and screenshot are nearly identical, but they don't match the other images (though they are closer to the gif than to VLC's snapshot).
I would tends towards trusting ffmpeg over the video players, except neither of them are close - except VLC with "Use hardware YUV->RGB conversions" disabled. I believe VLC uses ffmpeg, so that would explain why VLC's snapshot matches ffmpeg's frame export. I would guess that MPC also uses "Use hardware YUV->RGB conversions", though I can't find a setting to change this.
Is ffmpeg extracting the frame wrong, or is "Use hardware YUV->RGB conversions" at fault? Or is it something else?
(The video is Monogatari: Second Season ep 13 at 22:57)
This is an old question, but I think I can offer a satisfactory answer:
I suspect neither image is "correct" because there's actually no objectively "correct" image. After all, the GIF format only allows up to 256 different colors, so different converters may choose to preserve and combine different colors. I assume the source video uses more than 256 colors.
I can't absolutely verify this because I don't have the original file, but one way to verify this is to take a snapshot in VLC (the default hotkey on Windows is Shift+S), and compare how the colors differ from the matching frame of the GIF.
