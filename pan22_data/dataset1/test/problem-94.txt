One Stop Systems went a couple of hundred meters with their fiber optic cabled expansion chassis and daughter boards.

But for a small cable like that, it is really determined by the motherboard and your motherboard's north bridge's ability to handle electrical noise introduced by having physically longer traces.  Shorter traces are generally better and some cables, much like the one you have shown, have introduced shielding to help prevent noise from being introduced on the longer traces but ultimately it's your motherboard's tolerance for that noise which will determine how long you can make a cable as you desire.  This will vary wildly between different motherboards, even between different motherboards of the same make and model.
I used to test PCI-E charactaristics for a fortune 500 company's NVME drives. As a group, we would buy dozens of motherboards and then cherry pick a couple which had the best noise tolerance for performance testing. Although we never attached any extension cables to these boards, I imagine that you could get some pretty long cables to work with those boards because of the amount of electrical noise that they were able to tolerate. We would then take the boards which didn't meet those stringent requirements and then ship them to other parts of the company for use.
Your results will vary wildly with the use of such a basic cable. Maybe 50 Ft. Maybe 1 inch. This is not really determined by the cable.
This looks like a cheap (unshielded riser) and the answer with the short lengths is probably true.

With good risers Linus achieved over 3m extension.
