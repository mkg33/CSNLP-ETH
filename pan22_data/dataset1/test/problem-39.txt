Or maybe if you do use them, than just let them exchange it for a decent amount of gold / score at the end (or when item is obsolete).  So if you ended up hoarding it, it doesn't become completely useless.
Personally when I see such items in games, it makes me quite upset. The reason is if I use the item, and still died, I wasted it. If I don't use the item, it will just take up room forever. Sometimes I just toss the item away or use it on next stupid thing, so I don't have to worry about it for the rest of the game.
I think a good example of a well-implemented version of this type of item is the Master Ball from the original Pokemon games.  For those that are not familiar, allow me to give a quick summary...
The Masterball was a one-time-use super item that could capture a Pokemon 100% of the time, no matter how much health it had left.  You only came across one in the entire game.  Other types of balls had a capture rate well below that of the Masterball and usually only worked on a weakened Pokemon.
Sure, some users may have saved the item and never used it, but most users that I know used it on one of 4 extremely hard to catch Pokemon (Mewtwo, Zapdos, Aritcuno, or Moltres).  That's not to say nobody saved it forever... but overall, I think this item had a pretty good balance.
That said... here are some options/suggestions for creating your own super item.
Even super items need to have limitations.  Have you ever played an RPG where you could kill the final boss by simply using an all-powerful item, avoiding the fight completely?  I personally have not.  A super item should not be so powerful that it takes away a user's sense of accomplishment.
Remember the Warp Whistle from Super Mario 3?  It allowed you to skip past vast sections of the game.  The benefit?  You got to finish the game faster/more easily.  The drawback?  You missed out on some fun levels! To bring this idea to modern gaming... perhaps certain game endings/storylines can only be encountered by beating a certain boss the old-fashioned way, instead of using the super item.  (Note: this sort of contributes to the too-awesome-to-use problem as opposed to relieving it, but I thought it was worth including anyway)
Only allow the super item to be used in dire situations
Perhaps a super item only becomes available when the user's character is below 15% health.  At this point, the user would likely be willing to try anything to avoid losing!  An example of this is super moves in various fighting games (such as the Fatal Fury series) that can only be used when a character is very weak.
Use storytelling to guide the user as to when to best use the super item
While this example is a bit of a stretch... FPS games come to mind.  Say a user finds a rocket launcher, which is obviously overkill for a single armed guard.  However, suddenly there is a cutscene with a massive, chain-gun shooting, rocket-launching helicopter flying around wreaking havoc!  Most players will instinctively pull out the rocket launcher instead of trying to beat the helicopter with a normal gun.  Let's say they already wasted the rocket... perhaps you could require them to sneak around the helicopter instead of shoot it out of the sky?
