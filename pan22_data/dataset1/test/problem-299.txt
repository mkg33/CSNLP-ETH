I'm looking to create a text based MUD, so a lot of the elements of the XNA framework seem appropriate to what I need.  Especially things like the general game loop, networking, etc.  It looks like XNA is tightly coupled to an interactive environment with UI and audio, so I'm not sure if it's the right way to go.
Would it be easier to just recreate these types of aspects myself, attempt to bend the XNA framework to what I need, or is there a better framework for this type of work?
If you are interested in supporting audio, friend invites, et cetera than I believe XNA is the way to go.
The major limitation you face with using XNA for networking is the player limit of 32 players per game.
When you develop a game with the XNA framework, it isn't absolutely necessary to be coupled to all the various APIs. Many people use the XNA framework but rely on other frameworks for networking.
My suggestion is to physically (write them down in notepad or something) list your needs and wants for the networking aspect. Then compare and contrast the various frameworks.
