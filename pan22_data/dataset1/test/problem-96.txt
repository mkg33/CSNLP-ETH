A VPS is located in a data center where someone pays a huge amount of money for one or more extremely fast Internet connections that the server machines use. Your "original PC" in your home is probably at the end of a relatively inexpensive, relatively slow Internet connection. The speed of the home broadband service you're paying for is the problem. If you paid a lot of money for say gigabit residential Internet service, your home PC would be able to do Internet things a lot faster too. 
There's no magic way for your VPS to upgrade the quality of your broadband wiring or the broadband modems on both ends of your home Internet connection. 
That said, it's possible that you're not getting the full benefit of your home Internet connection because you need a better modem or you have avoidable packet loss or bufferbloat problems. But that would be a whole separate question.
