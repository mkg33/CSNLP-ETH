I don't know if it's the same where you are, but in the UK, most of the major ISPs provide modems. If your modem is broken, get the ISP to replace it, or switch (/threaten to switch) to another provider who will give you one for free.
If you do decide to by one bare in mind that DSL services are not all 100% compatible, best thing to do here is ask your provider. Don't forget there is always the option of getting a plain DSL modem (from the provider) with no router or wi-fi built in, and getting your own wi-fi router as a separate unit. This opens up the choice a bit on the router because you don't have to worry about DSL compatibility.
The only wireless security protocol that is still even vaguely secure is WPA2 with AES encryption (and a nice long key), so make sure whatever your get supports that.
I've had a fair few home routers and in the past 5 years all have supported MAC filtering and port forwarding, so I think that's pretty standard.
Depending on your usage, you may find Port triggering is an alternative option.
(As an aside, MAC filtering is useless as a security technique, so if that's all you want it for, it's not worth the bother)
I currently have an Actiontec GT701-WG DSL modem which I purchased through Qwest when I signed up for their internet service a couple years ago. Unfortunately this modem has started to fail so I need to get a new one.
I am primarily a software guy, though, so could use some guidance:
What would be a newer model of the same type of modem? What features should I look for? I know I want wireless capability like the GT701-WG. My current unit has only WPA security; what is the latest security protocol recommended? I also use port forwarding and MAC-address filtering, but I suspect those are pretty standard features. Should I buy from Qwest or can I buy from any retailer? What else should I be considering?
