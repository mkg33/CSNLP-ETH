~20sec is pretty close to the DNS timeout in some Operation Systems.
So it could be that the first DNS resolver might not be working correctly and after beeing too long "idle" cache could be emptied.
Sorry if this has been answered before, I've scanned through the forums and didn't find anything that could provide me with an answer.
In my scenario I have an ASP.Net site hosted in IIS 8.5 (according to the IIS Manager). The site currently hosted on an internal testing server. All the functionality works correctly and I have no issues with it bar some improvements as is usual. However, I've noticed that if I were to let the site idle for a short while, about 2-3 minutes, it would take very long to respond once the user would resume activity, usually longer than 20 seconds. As you might guess this breaks the user flow and can make the site unpleasant to use.
At first I thought it was my sessions clearing or dropping but I've since adjusted those and the problem still persists. I've investigated the problem with both Fiddler as well as Internet Explorer and Google Chrome's developer tools, and noticed that each time the website takes a long time to respond the process that takes the bulk of the time is the DNS Lookup (usually about 18 seconds). In order to continue my testing I've changed the host-name in my URL (for example "http://myapp/frmHome.aspx") to use the IP Address ("http://192.168.1.1/frmHome.aspx") and this immediately solves the problem. However, this would make navigating to the deployed website somewhat more difficult as its not a name the users can easily remember.
Does anyone have any advice that can help me solve this problem, or another tool that I can use to narrow it down?
