You can use WKey Disabler to temporarily disable the Windows key. If you're willing to learn some scripting with AutoHotKey, it's trivial to disable the key automatically when certain programs are running.
I just got window 8 with new laptop (sadly, and yuck this OS sucks, if it wasn't for gaming I would so switch to ubuntu).  I've been systematically disabling and changing settings till I have almost gotten it to a working OS.
My current issue is with the new hotkeys, most notably window + D.  I play MMO with many hot keys mapped to to speed up activating them, and ALT+D is a major one, so I'm not happey when my finger slips to window+D and I toggle out of the game only to come back to everyone dead.  I want to prevent this toggling while I have a game open.
Ideally, I like to know if there is a way to keep the shortcut, but just disable it when I have an app running in full screen mode open, or even disable it only for certain apps.  Failing that I would settle for a way to either re-map the hotkey or remove it entirely.
can anyone help me?  a dead raid thanks to window's 8 will thank you.
