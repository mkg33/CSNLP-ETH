I don't have experiences with data recovery services, but from what I've read this should be a minor recovery.  I read, data recovery places have circuit boards for the various model hard drives, and if a similar make/model board is installed on the drive it should work.  If the damage is more extensive, the motor or some liquid leaked in, that will cost more.
I know after this you will probably get backup religion so I will skip the backup lecture.
Good luck recovering your data.  I think we all have been there.
WD40 is a common method to remove gunk on circuit boards, you will however need to carefully remove the WD40 after removing the gunk as the oily residue can eat some plastics. Lexite PS is the industry standard and is the absolute best option, but is a bit more expensive, although it requires no extra care once you've used it, it is safe to leave on the board.
EDIT: I forgot to mention, professional recovery on a drive that won't power on or has any type of mechanical flaw requires rebuilding in a clean room and this is pricey. You can expect a service like this to be around $1000 or more.
