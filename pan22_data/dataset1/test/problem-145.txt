Your WRT3200ACS isn't asking for a DHCP lease from your ISP router. As such, it isn't getting any DNS servers or any other service information either. The WRT3200ACS will not request any DHCP lease from its LAN ports, and this is fine for what you are doing.
When you plug your ISP router into the LAN port of your WRT3200ACS, you should stop considering the WRT3200ACS to be a router and think of it as a switch instead. It doesn't matter if the WRT3200ACS can ping anything or if the router has DNS. The only thing that matters is if every device connected to the WRT3200ACS can see the ISP router. The ISP router should, functionally speaking, be your primary and only router. Park the IP address of the WRT3200ACS on an IP outside the DHCP range of your ISP router. Disable any services on the WRT3200ACS that might cause a router conflict, nominally DHCP.
Yes, you can configure dual routers with advanced router software like dd-wrt, but I don't see the point. Perhaps you can elaborate on your use case?
I've got a dd-wrt Linksys WRT3200ACS router working in 'AP' mode.  My ISP supply a modem which runs a DHCP server.  The modem is connected to the LAN port on my router and then the rest of the wired LAN is connected on the other ports.  The router pumps out wifi.  All other devices (wireless and wired) on my network work online perfectly.
From the router itself, in the shell, I can't seem to resolve DNSes.  DNSMasq is disabled and Local DNS setting is 0.0.0.0.  I can ping IP addresses on the internet directly, so it definitely has a working connection.
I've tried updating the local DNS setting in the dd-wrt frontend to both that of the ISPs modem (this is what all other devices get from DHCP) and also to 8.8.8.8 for Google's.  Neither of these work.
