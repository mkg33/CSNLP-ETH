If you setup /etc/network/interfaces as in How to set up networking/WiFi
then you can see if it has connected (and the IP) with ip a. 
route -vn will show if there is an entry in the routing table (and the metric).
I'm remoting into a RPi Zero W using SSH. The RPi is connected to the internet via Ethernet cable. I want to set-up the WiFi at the current remote location and check that it will work when the Ethernet cable is disconnected.
I can set-up the WiFi via raspi-config or by directly editing the wpa_supplicant file. Is there a way to verify remotely that the WiFi will work once the Ethernet cable is unplugged?
If I run iwgetid I get nothing back, ostensibly because the wireless LAN is not currently being used. The command iwconfig gives me:
If I run sudo iwlist wlan0 scan I can see the network I want to connect to. Is there any way to test it while plugged into Ethernet?
OS is Raspbian installed via NOOBS v. 2.8.1. I did verify the RPi can connect to the internet over WiFi at my location before shipping it off to the current remote location.
