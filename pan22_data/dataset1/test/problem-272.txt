It will probably cause problems for the hallway-standing neighbor, but you can't rule out the possibility that it could cause problems for the network-owning neighbor.
If you're intent on unneighborly passive aggression, consider forging deauths from the real network's BSSID to the hallway-standing neighbor's wireless MAC address.
The SSID is not a problem when you use a different channel.
The SSID is a different problem that is explained later.
Most WLANs are on channel one, six, or eleven by default.
In an apartment building, a standard procedure in setting up a WLAN router is to scan the channels, see who is using what, and then select an unused channel that is as far away as possible from the heavy usage as possible. (Usually channel 3). You will notice that using an unused channel also provides better speeds because there are no "collisions". Now to the SSID:: Never use a common SSID that contains the name or model of the WLAN router. Making this error makes it easier for hackers to break in because they can quickly look up the known weaknesses of a specific model on the internet.
