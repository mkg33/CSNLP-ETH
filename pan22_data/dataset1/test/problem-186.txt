You are right in that the integrality gap of a relaxation has as such nothing to do with any rounding algorithm. These are two different notions. An integrality gap is a property of a particular relaxation. That is, how much larger is the value of that relaxation compared to the optimal integral value?
Why do we care about linear/convex relaxations? To efficiently approximate an integral value. Hence, we typicaly talk about relaxations only in cases where the optimal value is hard to compute and we're interested in efficient approximations. Integrality gaps show us the inherent limitations of what can be achieved by such techniques.
So, why do we care about rounding algorithms on top of the relaxation? We use rounding algorithms to solve the algorithmic problem of finding a near optimal solution as opposed to just approximating the value of an optimal solution. Moreover, often rounding algorithms are used to bound the integrality gap of a relaxation in the first place.
There was a very interesting paper "On the advantage of network coding for improving network throughput" which showed that the integrality gap of the "bidirected cut relaxation" for the Steiner tree problem exactly equals a type of "coding advantage" in network communication. I don't know of a lot of other similar papers. However, one should also note that seemingly better LP relaxations for the Steiner tree problem are known (e.g. see the new hypergraphic LP-based approximation algorithm of Byrka et al in STOC 2010, I also shamelessly volunteer that I coauthored some recent papers studying the hypergraphic LP).
