This happens on multiple machines, some connected by WLAN, even on the one directly with LAN, and the packet gets always lost between the device and the router. That's why I can only assume that it's some Router-internal problem. Restarting/Resetting the router doesn't do anything, and I haven't seen anything in the router settings that looks helful. There is also no warning light or anything activated on the router.
An idea I had was that maybe some QoS setting might be responsible, but that doesn't even come up in this version of the firmware. The Box is a Vodafone EasyBox 904 xDSL.
as a side note: most ISPs can run a line quality check. Calling up your provider and asking them to run a check might be helpful.
Any idea is very much appreciated, as I just have no more clue where to look at. Thanks for your time.
How do you know that the packets are being dropped between the router and the modem? DSL is notorious for dropping packets when the line quality is low. 
You can't connect your modem directly to your computer to check because it's integrated... but if you have another DSL modem, I'd try connecting it directly to a computer. If it works fine, the router is the culprit for sure. 
the problem in itself seems very straightforward, but I can't find the cause. It started a few weeks ago, and ever since every device in the network experiences packet loss. If you just do casual stuff, say, checking wikipedia or the like, there might be 0,1% loss or even less. But as soon as you start some big download or an online game, the packet loss skyrockets, making games unplayable. It doesn't stay on this consistent high loss though, after a few minutes it usually works fine again until it just randomly reappears, but giving him high pressure, like a game patch, triggers some initial package loss pretty consistently.
