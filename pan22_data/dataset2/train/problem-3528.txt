Is 4096 the buffer size in bytes allocated for one frame, there being multiple number of such buffers or is it the number of buffers?
According to this article, the size of the ring buffer controls the number of SKBs (socket kernel buffers) descriptors. You can read more about SKBs at the links provided, they show the C data structures which make up an SKB.
I found this article which helps to illustrate the function that the ring buffer aka. (driver queue) serves, which may help in understanding its purpose/function. The article is titled, Queueing in the Linux Network Stack.
Looking through that documentation, it does not appear that the ring buffer is simply frame buffers related, but rather pointers to a much more complex kernel data structure related to the packet.
Tx/Rx buffers are memory spaces allocated by a network adapter to handle traffic bursts. Buffering takes place when the traffic exceeds physical capacity of network adapter. Increasing the buffer size would help to avoid packet loss when adapter is overloaded.
