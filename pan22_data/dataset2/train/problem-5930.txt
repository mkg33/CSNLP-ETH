I use the built in backup utility for Windows 7 because it's automated and flexible enough to allow me to schedule a daily shadow copy backup of particular files and folders directly to a separate internal RAID 0 array (2 x 1TB). It's also lightweight and stays out of the way.
For off-site backup purposes, each week I copy the contents of the internal backup from the RAID 0 array to an external 1 TB drive. I then store move this drive to a different building.
You can target an external device with Windows Backup. At our company we use 2 external drives for off-site backups. One stays connected to the NAS device, and other is off site or in a firebox. Every day they get swapped after the backup finishes.
Personally, I'd use MKSBackup found here: http://www.magikmon.com/mksbackup/wbadmin.en.html and set it up to schedule the job weekly to the external drive with email notifications to you that it worked.  That way you'll know when you unplug the drive that the weekly backup is on it.
Why don't you just use wbadmin cli to create another scheduled task backup job exclusively for the external drive?  Schedule it to run the day you typically move the external drive to the different building (assuming you don't want to go a completely different route).
Is there a better way to synchronize? Microsoft's SyncToy application does a pitiful job, and often leaves the folders not truly synchronized... which completely defeats the ability to use the backup's restore feature.
