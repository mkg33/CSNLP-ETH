Select. I can see why your code does not work without using Select. And you do not need it. You have unqualified references to Range objects (in this case Cells) that are acting on the active sheet. By selecting the sheet, you are changing the active sheet but there is no guarantee that it is going to stay that way!
Is better expressed in a With statement for brevity and ease of reading (note that the "." are also in front of the Cells, this is the critical change to your original code).
I would guess that your biggest performance hit is iterating through the dictionaries. If you could bring your data in in a cleaner fashion, it may help your performance.
ReDim. Probably not a huge issue, but you ReDim every loop instance on values that are passed in at the start. Set your Values array up once before you enter the loop. By the looks of your code, you clobber the values in the array each time you go through the loop, so you don't even have to clear it.
Here's a very quick example of how you can simply assign a Collection and Dictionary directly from the parsed JSON object directly into your objects, then convert it into a 2-D array.
