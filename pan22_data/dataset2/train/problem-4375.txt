I know there is always some issue with getting the right drivers for installing Linux, so I was hoping you guys who've done this before could give me some advice on how to take advantage of my old machines.
Any Linux distribution should work on older hardware - Unless you've got something truly exotic drivers for all your hardware should be in the base kernel.
Edit: If you're willing to spend any money, you may want to check out a Micro EC2 instance from Amazon(aws.amazon.com) or a 512 Linode from linode.com. I've used both for dev work and they're both cheap options.
I'd 'personally' recommend Debian i386. Its relatively simple to setup and has a great track record. Ubuntu is nice, but not ideal if you don't know how to tweak out some of the cruff that comes pre-installed. Once again, this is just my personal opinion.
I have a couple of old PCs sitting around and I thought I could turn them into web servers over my cable modem! 
I wish I could have a remote web host with root access -- but I can't really afford $100+/mo plans, so this seemed like a good way to make my own!
If you have no familiarity with Linux I would suggest starting with an Ubuntu server installation - they go out of their way to be "user-friendly".
