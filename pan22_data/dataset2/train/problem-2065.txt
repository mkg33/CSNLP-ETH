Busted wire in the mouse cable was causing mine. Oddly enough, the mouse was fairly functional till the day I noticed a skip and pulled the cable taught so it totally lost function as a troubleshooting ploy. Got rid of the badonk, badonks with the new mouse, Windows 7 hasn't complained since.
Check the "Safely Remove Hardware" applet in the Notification area periodically. What's there only some of the time? That device is your problem.
Had this problem. It was the monitor going into 'sleep' mode then coming back up - Windows struggled to recognise that it was on after 'sleep' (even though it was displaying just fine). Turned it off & on again, problem went away. Can't say it will work for you, but if you have any peripheral that goes into 'sleep' or 'power saving mode', giving it the off-and-on-again is an easy trick to try before mucking about with settings.
Make sure that any USB, Bluetooth, Network devices in Device Manager in the Power Management tab do not have the option Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power checked.
In my case, once my phone is at full charge it tends cause the "device disconnected" sound to play (with no corresponding "device connected"), including when it receives a text. If I remove the phone I won't get the periodic sounds.
It may be devices that are charging. Consider unplugging things such as phones and observing whether the behavior stops.
