The discrepancy appears because Explorer double-counts files that appear under multiple names. Windows uses hardlinks for some system files, and to programs that don't account for that, they appear as completely separate full-size files.
A lot of files in \Windows\WinSxS are familiar/normal system files hardlinked to from other system folders. WinSxS can appear to be fairly large (>9GB on my Windows 8.1 machine), but most of the files in it consume no disk space by themselves. A difference of 5.5GB is entirely reasonable from WinSxS alone.
Don't worry, you haven't lost any space. You'll be able to keep saving data until the volume is full - the drive's properties are telling the truth.
I would say this is result of virtual box not Windows 10. In my virtual drive I have similar disproportion. If I will check it through file system it uses 500 GB space, but if I check 100% of its space its 498 GB. That difference should be paths, aliases and other system information that is not counted at disk space view.
