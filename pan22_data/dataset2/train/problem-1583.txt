Try looking for 'resource monitor' in windows 'start menu', there in 'network' tab, you will be able to see exactly which process with which PID is taking up all this bandwidth with bandwidth speed also next to it.
Open Task manager, go to the processes tab, tick "show processes for all users", click the "name" header to sort processes by name, then right click on one of the svchost exe entries and select "go to Services", it will open the services tab and automatically highlight all the services running under that one svchost process. Might give you some insight to what can be safely disabled.
Download the Free version of Net Balancer, run it, it will show you what is using bandwidth and how much, leave it open for a while you will see what is constantly using bandwidth, some of it is an unavoidable consequence of using W7, as it is much more chatty on the network than XP.
If the network adapter is disabled, nothing can traverse it.  You can then reenable updates.  In Control Panel -> Windows Updates there is an option to not automatically update - it may be better if you control this.
If you don't use IPv6, disable the IP Helper service.  It has something to do with tunneling IPv4 or IPv6 or vice versa or similar.
You may consider getting a cheap dial-up connection if you can get one for like $5USD/mo., and using that for overnight Windows Updates and such.
