If you want to "reset you wear leveling tables" then you're going to have to wipe the drive completely, as it requires either re-writing every block on the drive to one state; or by wiping the LBA tables by issuing a "SECURE ERASE" command (see here) - AKA 'low-leveling the drive'.  
Without an OS that supports the TRIM command the drive does not know which subblocks are empty and so the data on the SSD becomes fragmented below the level that the OS sees.  The only way to 'reset' it involves clearing all the data whether you use the proper utility or try and do it manually.
I intend to try it myself, since I have been naively running my X25-M SSD on a laptop with suboptimal settings and I think the performance is falling.
I'm aware of the DOS utility to "Reset" an Intel SSD to factory settings, but I'd rather not shut down my system to do this to my SSDs.
If your SSD is a COMPLETELY separate drive from your OS drive(s) you may be able to get some decent results by using a good 'secure hard drive eraser' app of some kind, but I wouldn't count on it.
All of which will blow away your OS (and anything else) if it's on that drive, effectively preventing you from doing it from within the OS. :)
If you want to avoid the hassle of backing up/ghosting regularly when it slows down then you need to use an OS that supports TRIM.
