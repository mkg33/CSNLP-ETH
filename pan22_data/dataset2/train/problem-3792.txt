However, I would also recommend to take a closer look at your shell scipting options (you did not mention your environment, but TiZon's recommendation with bash is cool when using Linux). Using a full-blown general-purpose programming language like Java will only get in the way when trying to be productive with shell-like tasks, e. g. moving files around, invoking commands and the likes.
PowerShell, an object oriented shell which can use C# libraries, has been opensourced and is available for Linux.
You could write your shell scripts as described in the BeanShell docs, but you would have to make the Beanshell jar file available to your Java installation for this (e. g. put it into the /ext/lib folder of your JRE installation), otherwise java will not find the bsh.Interpreter class. 
I wrote jpad.io to allow running java "shell scripts" and interactive snippets while also providing nice visualization of the results. This shows what I mean:
Yes, there is. I have been using BeanShell from time to time, even though it is not under active development at the moment. It is an interpreter for standard Java syntax and also comes with a graphical interpreter / environment, if required.
Yes, add the beanshell .jar into your Javahome/jre/lib/ext  directory and then you can launch scripts like so:
