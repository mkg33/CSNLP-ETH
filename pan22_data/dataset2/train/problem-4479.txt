If you are trying to do anything with dynamic disk, see if you can first convert them back to basic disk under Windows (which may not be possible anyway) before using any partition utilities.
For Linux or general use I'd agree with GParted - it hasn't bricked anything for me yet including some complicated NTFS+HFS+EXT3 partitioned disks, but it does fail at completing tasks at times, not doing any obvious harm though (yet ^^)...
If you are performing operations on Windows Dynamic Disks (you only get them with Windows server OS's) then be extremely careful. Most partitioning & resizing software is OK with basic disks but useless with Dynamic.
Also be aware that partition imaging/cloning software (like Ghost or PartImage) are similarly hobbled in dealing with dynamic disk. If you find yourself stuck with a RAIDed dynamic disk, about all that you could trust is to back-up the disk to a file using NTBACKUP, onto another drive (like an external USB drive) and then you at least can restore if everything falls apart.
Look at Paragon Software products. I've been using Paragon Hard Disk Manager Professional and it works fine.
When it comes to stable and safe I'd go for the built-in tools for each OS. For Windows that's diskpart that can shrink and extend partitions as far as I know, though it's obviously limited in what it can do to the boot volume unless you boot say Windows PE from a disc and run it (=boot install media and bring forth a command prompt, ctrl/shift f10 or something).
I recommend the Parted Magic CD.  I've found it to be a VERY good all-in-one package for things of this sort:
Even Server Magic (a version of the proprietary "read $$$" Partition Magic disk partition software made specifically for Windows Servers) does not really support volumes that are RAIDED or extensible by Dynamic Disk.
Add another vote for Gparted (Open Source). There are a number of commercial alternatives but I've heard no compelling reason to use them.
