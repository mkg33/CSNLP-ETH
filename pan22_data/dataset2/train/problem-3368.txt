Use a partition table reporting tool without this bug, and you'll soon see that the impossible is not happening on your computer.  â˜º
From what you have written, there is no "Primary Partition" in an "Extended Partition" from what you have provided above.  What you have is a "root" partition in an extended partition.
What you have is a bug in Microsoft's Disk Management tool, introduced in Windows NT 6.0 ("Vista") and still present in Windows NT 6.1.  Although the partitions are secondary partitions, because they have a partition type code that Microsoft's Disk Management tool doesn't understand, it erroneously says "Primary Partition" and uses the colour for primary partitions.
It is possible (and common place) for the root partition to be anywhere on the system.   I believe that in this case, all that is needed is that GRUB (or whatever bootloader you are using) recognizes the partion and allows you to boot from it.
AFAIK, there can not be more than 4 primary partitions in one HDD because of the size limit of the MBR.
