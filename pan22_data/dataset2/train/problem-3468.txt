4) click In the box labeled "Source" then select the cells that contain the values set up in step 1) 
Also the restriction in step one of the first answer "(These have to be in the same sheet as the cell you want to restrict)" is not true.
In the Source box  you type an = sign immediately followed by the name you chose for the Named Range
To get round the restriction mentioned you must set up a Named Range to identify the list of allowed entry items.
1) Enter your list of the fixed values. (These have to be in the same sheet as the cell you want to restrict)
I'd like to setup a column in excel with several fixed possible values (like 'in-progress', 'done', 'canceled').
You will see a pull down icon next to the restricted cell(s). Click on it to choose only values in the list. Excel will not allow any other value in this cell.
Because the Named Range is recognised throughout the entire workbook you can then use this name to specificy the list in any other tab you like.
If fact it is good practive, especially if you have quite a few of this lookup list in use to put them all on a LookUps tab and then hide the tab so that general users cannot see it & fiddle with it.
I'd like to set it up so the only possible values in these column are from the fixed list, and it would be easy to pick one of these items whenever I try to edit a cell in this column (a drop-down box would be ideal). How can I do that?
