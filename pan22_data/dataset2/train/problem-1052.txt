Here is a detailed description of the key, and how to restrict access to specified drives if required - http://www.pctools.com/guides/registry/detail/1157
It appears that the issue is because, once applied at any time through Group Policy, the 'Prevent access to drives from My Computer' policy setting is not reset in registry when a policy that sets it is no longer called.
Does anybody know what else could be restricting access to these drives for local admin, or if there is perhaps more settings in GP that could be causing this that I am unaware of? Thanks.
I've checked the local policy, and sure enough there is no restriction on these drives set (Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Explorer -> Hides these specified drives in My Computer / Prevent access to drives from My Computer).
To fix, change the 'NoViewOnDrive' key in the location below to '0' (to allow access to all drives) -
One of our servers, TTSA, has no group policies applied to it when logging in as a local admin (other than the local policy), yet access to the C:\ and D:\ are still restricted.
