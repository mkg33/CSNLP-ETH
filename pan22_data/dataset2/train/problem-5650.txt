There are usually no legal ways to make the signal stronger. Most wireless access points broadcast in the 2.4GHz or 5GHz range, which is legal for everyone within certain (low) power levels. 
There are two ways to get more range. As others have noted, there is no difference between "better signal" and "more range" in your situation.
My Wifi has a good range but i have bad signal? in my basement so i can watch Netflix. i can watch it upstairs via Wifi but not in basement. i know theres walls and floor, but is there a way to make the signal stronger. The router is on my desk and there to walls that are about 4 feet high i guess the signal goes thru then a floor  would putting the router up higher help it skip the walls and just penetrate the floor
Another option is to get a more modern router that has multiple antennas. Perhaps the best signal path between your computer and the router will not be a direct line through the floor, but may instead be around the corner, down the hall, and through the basement door. Multiple antenna routers can do a better job both sending signals to your computer through a complicated house layout, but they also typically do a better job amplifying the signals they receive so that it'll do a better job hearing your computer's responses.
That means that you will need to get different hardware and a license (and pass training/exams for that in order to transmit with your more powerful custom hardware.  For most of us this is not an option.
