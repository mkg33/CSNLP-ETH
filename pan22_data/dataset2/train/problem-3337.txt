You could knock something together with, like, ZIP and a scheduled task to FTP the ZIP file, but if you're going to do that you might as well use NTBACKUP.
If they're Windows XP-based PCs, you can use the built-in NTBACKUP and fire it off from "Scheduled Tasks". This is a good "no third-party software" solution, and catches NTFS ACLs. You can backup to a file and then move it with FTP.
It's extremely space-efficient; can handle many types of connections; has a good web interface; needs no client-software; etc.
There are a number of builds available for Windows environment, the one I use being that found in the CygWin distribution: http://www.cygwin.com/
If you're not stuck with FTP, and perhaps concerned about bandwidth usage you could use one of the various rsync ports and an rsync server on the Linux machine. Cwrsync (http://www.itefix.no/cwrsync/) is a decent one, but beware that it doesn't replicate NTFS ACLs.
There is a windows client, mac and linux. It runs under apache and stores the date in the public_html location. Simples! 
Even know everyone has added their own version, I have used Owncloud. Run's as a linux server and requires a client. Sync's the folder, very useful.
Have a look at Bacula - our hosting company is using it to backup our servers and don't seem to have any trouble.
