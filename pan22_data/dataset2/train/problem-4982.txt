Depending on the version of OS X you are running (Mavericks and later), you can mouse over where the dock would be on another screen and it should appear there.  
If you are not too picky with the task bar being on the far right, I find setting the "position on screen" to "right" will move the dock to the second screen, WAY over to the right of my workspace. Not a BIG deal for me, some I imagine would get annoyed I would guess. For me I use the dock mostly for monitoring what my Mac is up to and use a mouse button to jump between apps. Is an option. Hope it helps!
On High Sierra, the only way I got it to be on the left on my second monitor was, with the dock set to appear at the bottom (that's the only position it would show on the second monitor), I moved the menu bar in Preferences > Displays > Arrangement to that monitor (by grabbing it), then when I changed the position of the dock to the left it finally appeared. 
Try DragThing. I haven't used it myself in a long time, but back when I did, it could create docks with almost any layout and function you wanted. It's not exactly the Mac OS X Dock in the sense of having minimized windows and so on, but it may serve your needs.
At least not native. OS X ties the menu bar and dock to one "main" monitor and uses the second as secondary displays.
