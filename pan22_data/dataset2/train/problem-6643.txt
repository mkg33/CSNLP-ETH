CTRL-Q seems to work the same as CTRL-W did previously. But CTRL-W seems to wait for about a second before executing the new mapping.  Is there any way to have it execute it immediately?  Would I have to remap every combination of <C-W><C-W>, <C-W>_, etc. ?
When I configure just those two mappings I do not see any timeout delay after typing C-w. You might want to check if something else (a plugin?) has defined any additional mappings that start with C-w:
You will encounter the timeout (see :help 'ttimeout') if you have any other (normal mode) mappings that also start with C-w.
I'd like to map CTRL-W to something else, but I'd also like to retain the functionality of CTRL-W, for resizing windows, moving between splits, etc.  So I'd like to move it to something like CTRL-Q.
E.g. If you also have the mapping nnoremap <C-w>f ifrob<Esc> active, you will see a timeout delay after typing a C-w (until you type some other character so that Vim can tell whether you wanted the C-w mapping, or the C-w f mapping).
