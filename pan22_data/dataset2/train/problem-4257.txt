Save the script as e.g. handout.sh, make it executable and call it with a PDF file as only argument.
This opens an Evince session where the PDF is already correctly formatted for direct printing. One could modify this to send the result directly to the printer, but I would rather get the preview in Evince in most cases.
Here is a quick attempt that I could get to work like this. Note that it assumes that the input file is in landscape mode, as is usually the case for presentations. My lines.pdf was created with Inkscape in seconds (A4, landscape, create a textbox that fills the entire canvas, size 100, fill with underscores).
LibreOffice will do this.  Create your slides as a presentation, then print it using 'Document: Handouts' and 'Slides per page: 3' by setting up your Print dialog like this:
Start an empty Impress presentation. Change the page size of the presentation to match that in the PDF (match the actual paper size in millimeters/inches, not just aspect ratio).
Using PDFjam, the solution is even simpler for the user. We still need lines.pdf as above, and we can modify the script to:
It could be done using the PDFtk CLI tool (included in the Ubuntu repository) and either directly in the standard PDF reader Evince, or using PDFjam, which requires a LaTeX installation, though. In Debian Sid, PDFjam is currently contained in the texlive-extra-utils package.
