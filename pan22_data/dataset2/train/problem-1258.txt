This is a bit of an embarrassing question: on one hand one would assume it's straightforward (lot's of similar hits in google, I haven't found it asked here before...), on the other hand all purported solutions I have found have failed.
Side note: I have Nmap for windows installed, with its Npcap library. Having it running requires some unusual/unexpected arcane tweaking (resetting network w/ "netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt")...in case this might be of relevance.
The gist of my problem: I have 2 computers. #1 is aWindows 10machine. #2 is an arbitrary os (i.e., any of *nix, OS X, windows). I want to ssh from #1 to #2.
Sorry for the long question, but I'm too tired to figure out how to summarize it in any shorter way.
When using Dhcpserver I've seen at times a sporadic notification saying something like "Dhcpserver assigned IP 192.168.137.2 to mac address ...", but A) it doesn't show up systematically, and when it does, it happens after quite a long time after starting the Dhcpserver, and B) neither map nor ssh (putty) can access pc#2. 
The context: #2 is running an ssh daemon. I know that #2 needs to get an IP address somehow from #1. In that respect, #1 has an additional feature that should help find a solution, namely, #1 is connected to the internet via wifi. I'm also aware I need to find the IP address of #2, once it gets one, before I can ssh to it. Let's say #1's IP (wireless adapter) is 192.168.10.62.
The same negative results when running the Dhcpserver as service in windows or as application. Also, I ran the app's automatic configuration of the firewall.
I'm shaking my head at the time I wasted here. I can't believe this can be that complicated, so I guess I'm missing some otherwise obvious step/setup.
