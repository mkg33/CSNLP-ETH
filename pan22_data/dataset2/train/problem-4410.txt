Some blog sites have Abode flash player embedded and automatically play musics when the page is loaded. This is annoying. The music can be stopped by clicking "stop" button in IE/Firefox. I was wondering how to manually stop it in Google Chrome. I know clicking the "stop" button in the flash player certainly works, but find out where the player is located on the page is annoying too. So hopefully there's a way to manually stop it from Chrome.
Menu -> Tools -> Task Manager, then look for Plug-in: Shockwave Flash.  Usually the ones that are playing annoying music and/or animation are using more CPU.
It's not quite what you're asking, but if you open Chrome's settings and click Show advanced settings > Content settings > Plug-ins > Click to play, Flash won't load with the page at all, and you can choose to activate it as you wish. This has the bonus of making advertisement-ridden pages much faster.
BUT, my personal approach is to use the "FlashBlock" chrome extension so that Flash does not run anywhere unless I click the [f] icon on the page.
