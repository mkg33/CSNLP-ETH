For software, the de-facto standard for Linux hosting is Apache. For rapid serving of static content, nginx is popular along side Apache. PHP, Perl, Python and Ruby (rails) are commonly supported for scripting as well. For assisted script installation, software like Fantastico is a popular choice when bundled with cPanel. You will also want to look into an end user database system such as MySQL.
To outline things in general, you will have to answer a few of those questions at least. Horsepower required depends on the quantity of users and the type of hosting, as well as features offered.
I know some free hosting websites that host upwards of 10,000 users on a single server (3 Ghz Dual Xeon, 48G memory IIRC). While this is generally not a good idea, it is possible. The reason for this is most of the users' sites don't bring in a lot of traffic, and lots of users are inactive. Hardware required will vary greatly depending on user needs.
Where I'm going with this is, you're going to have to spend a fair chunk of money somewhere if you want to get anything out of it.
