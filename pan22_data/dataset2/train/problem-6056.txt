So what exactly does this 23.264 number mean to me?  Is it similar to an average of Task Manager's CPU reading for this user?
I know that Perfmon doesn't have anything exactly like Task Manager's CPU usage display, but I'm trying to figure out how to monitor user's CPU usage via Perfmon in a similar way, and trying to understand the measurements (or how to convert the numbers to get a similar understanding)
So... using this as an example, I see that they have an AVERAGE % PROCESSOR TIME of 23.264 , and have spiked as high as 103.124
Here is an example. Say I'm interested in "black line" user in this graph below, as his process is spiking quite high compared to all the other users:
Or, since this server has 8 CPUs, should I divide this number by 8?  (23.264/8 = 2.9% AVERAGE CPU LOAD?)
Through other research here I learned of a registry change that I made so that the PID shows up with the w3wp process so I can easily identify the site later by cross-referencing it.
For example, if in Task Manager, a particular user is consistently using more than 5% CPU, I would want to contact the user about it.
This is for a 32-bit Dual Quad Core Windows 2003 web server (8 CPUs), there are many web sites on the server, each running within their own application pool/worker process ID.
