Carbonite is a really neat backup service. It uploads your data to the internet, making it accessible from anywhere in case of an emergency. It's been advertised by the popular tech-personality Leo Laporte for many years.
I've been using AJC backup for a number of years now on all our workstations, in addition to Windows backups on the server.  What I like about it is that it versions files each time they are saved, and you can restore any previous version, rather than just the last saved version.  Pretty much like a simple to use version control system for dummies, with good revision comparison tools for text and images.  The program is stable, cost effective, and easy enough to set-up.  That said, I use it for documents not huge media files.  Horses for courses and all that.
I use SyncBack by 2BrightSparks. It has a wide range of functions, including backing up to a network drive, and synchronising two folders. The free version has been sufficient for my needs.
I see that Seagate has now released their Replica, which looks to be a Time Machine/Time Capsule for Windows. I haven't used it but I'm interested. For most of my clients, ease of use and automation is key. I also don't like backup programs that put the files in a proprietary format (which is why Second Copy is nice). I'll definitely have to check out Replica. The hard drive sizes seem a bit on the skimpy size (250GB single PC, 500GB multiple PCs). Seagate's site says the single PC is ~$130 so I will wait to see some reviews before buying one.
For imaging and incremental backup, I like Acronis True Image. For a very cheap ($29.95), scalable, pure copying program I like Second Copy (www.centered.com). My tech partner and I have used SC for years for our clients, ranging from home users to small businesses.
You can use MirrorFolder for backups, even for some kind of RAID-1, though I've not (yet) tried that.
