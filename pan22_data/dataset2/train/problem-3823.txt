Check your slow log and check for periodic queries that run within a few hours of when the crashes usually occur.
My guess is that your system is swapping itself to death because of waiting web requests when the database locks.  You probably have one or two queries that run sporadically - possibly from a cronjob - that cause one of the database tables that is frequently used to lock.  Once it does, all the queries start backing up behind it until the system starts swapping.  Once that starts happening, it's the end of it.
The top output indicates that you're running out of memory.  Nothing in the top (CPU) users that you've posted is the culprit.  While you could leave a top running in memory-sorted mode (press capital-M in top to switch), you're far better off collecting the data to disk for later analysis.  While sar is useful in general, it's no good for per-process stuff; for that, you need pidstat (in the same package as sar -- sysstat on Debian).  Unfortunately pidstat lacks some of the bulk data collection niceties of sar, but it's not hard to cobble something together that'll get the necessary data onto disk for later perusal.
