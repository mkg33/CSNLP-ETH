Similarly, the Western Digital VelociRaptor drive uses smaller platters, even though the enclosure is the size of a standard 3.5" HDD, for greater performance, though with limited capacity.
In addition to the 2.5" mobile drives, there are 2.5" "enterprise" drives for heavy file access.  See the Seagate Savvio.  By having smaller platters, high RPM is more practical, and seeks are physically shorter.  Further, more drives can be packed into the same space, which, with a good RAID controller, will give higher performance.
As a rule of thumb, though, 3.5" tends to be a standard desktop hard drive, 2.5" tends to be solid state drives and laptop hard drives, and 1.8" tends to be laptop-only SSDs and HDDs. (5.25" is pretty much exclusively optical drives.)
It's the width of the drive (note that it's the actual platters, not the case, so the drives are slightly wider than this).  These are standard drive sizes, and you should buy whichever one the device you're buying FOR supports.  PC cases or laptops should blatantly say which size of drive bays are available, if you'll actually look.  If you absolutely can't find a drive in the correct size, there are adapters and brackets to make small drives fit larger mounting as well.
