Most managed switches will provide some means to view their MAC table, which will typically contain port information, either via SNMP (more rare) or their CLI (common).
You could ping the subnet broadcast address and check your ARP table (which after they all reply will contain an entry for every host that replied), but keep in mind that not all hosts will reply to things like pings to the subnet broadcast.  This will also not give you which switch nodes are connected to, but this is because switches are supposed to be transparent, and ethernet doesn't carry or need this kind of metadata.
There is no standard protocol for determining layer 2 topology in a vendor-neutral way.  ARP is used to map between layer 3 addresses (IPs) and layer 2 addresses (MACs) in the same broadcast domain, but cannot query the MAC of everything connected to the network.  Switches may expose this data via SNMP, but are not required to.  It is possible to watch traffic on the segment for MAC addresses, but it is not a requirement that all of them appear on your segment for them to exist within the layer 2 broadcast domain.
