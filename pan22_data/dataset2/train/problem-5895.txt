Does such XEvent session affects server performance when no one is monitoring events with Live Data tab?
Below are batch requests/sec measurements with no trace as well as unfiltered  sql_batch_completed and sql_statement completed traces. The results of these tests show about a 8% decrease on throughput with the sql_batch_completed trace while the sql_statement_completed trace reduced throughput by a considerable 63%.
The overhead of an active event session with no targets depends on the frequency of events. Costs will be significant enough as to impact performance only under extreme cases.
Given that it's quite easy to start an existing trace with a right-click in SSMS Object Explorer, my recommendation is to run traces that don't have targets only when you want to actively view live data, even though the impact will be insignificant unless high-frequency events are captured.
Extended event session can be created without targets. In such situation you can watch collected events in SQL Server Management Studio in the Live Data view. For such session a LiveStreamTarget is created whenever Live Data view is opened. If no one is monitoring such session, there is no target created for it.
