No, and its entirely possible, and common to have multiple network adapters working at once, or to select one over the other. Laptops commonly do this(with mini pci-e cards for wifi and onboard ethernet), as do quite a few modern PCs that come with internal wifi cards (which are often internally USB based).
No, your network card is separated from your USB hub and therefore your USB devices. The only case which I'd answer this question with a yes is if there were some sort of electrical spark or other damage caused by the device, but something like that happening would be extremely rare.
I'd warn though, that its PRETTY rare for onboard ethernet adaptors to fail, so I'd take a good hard look at my motherboard. Anything that could knock out the ethernet chip could knock out other things as well
Physical Network Cards are independant from one another. If one is broken, the others will continue to work.
If the network card simply stopped working, you should have no problems using a USB WiFi dongle. Just make sure you install the drivers first :)
