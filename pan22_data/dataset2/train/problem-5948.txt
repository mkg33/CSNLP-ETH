I am only using PHP so that I can host some mailing list software, I can map it to newsletter.mydomain.com. So my question is, is it possible to run Tomcat on port 80 on 1 IP address and Apache on port 80 on another IP address?
(More on Tomcat: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/http.html, more on Apache: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/bind.html)
You need something on port 80 that can forward requests to Tomcat (and maybe even to whatever you use to serve PHP). For example Apache can work as a reverse proxy. And nginx. And varnish was made for the exact purpose.
For Tomcat, make sure to configure your connector with the parameters port="80" address="your.second.ip.addr".
Easily use one IP with port 80 for Apache: Make sure your configuration has Listen your.first.ip.addr:80 (ex Listen 92.12.0.2:80) and not just Listen 80 (since that would listen to ALL the IP addresses of the box on port 80).
You could also just bind Tomcat to port 80 on one IP, and your PHP web server (apache?) to port 80 on the other IP.
