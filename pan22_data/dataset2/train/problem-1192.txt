The operating system will attempt to recognize that the other network card is a local dev. I think you can use the 'dev' option to 'ip route' to force it out the other network card.
then you can use the 'dev' option to 'ip route' to specify the device used. This way you can specify that the other network card use itself for the ens3 ip instead of it using ens3 (itself) when you try to access it from the local machine. The trick to this is that you have to use policy routing too. Because you can't have the network card try to access itself and go out the other cards interface too because it will never find itself. So you have to specify with policy/source routing that it should only hop through the other card when that card is trying to access it. That is where you would have to specify a source match. Even further then you would have to make sure you are binding to the correct ip source address in your network software of choice that you are trying to use or test with. This should force it to access the other network card over the switch. Of course then you would do the same for the other card but the other way around.
This may solve your problem. Look at the 'ip route'  man page for route precedence and the 'dev' parameter. Then Look at rule matching to do the policy part. It should look something like this:
