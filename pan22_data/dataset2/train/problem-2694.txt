My next step would be ordering a new mainboard and switching that out, guessing that it might be a problem with the SATA controller, but who knows? Anyone who can make an educated guess at what could be the culprit?
I've had my main desktop PC for years, running Windows on a 250GB Samsung Evo SSD. A couple of months ago, all of a sudden I get lots of bluescreens at completely random moments. Mostly IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, but the fault message varied. 
I've analysed minidumps, ran Memtest86+, ran chkdsk, everything, to no avail. I switched out the SSD for an old HDD I had lying around, installed Windows, and it runs absolutely fine, with no BSODs whatsoever. I ordered a new SSD, installed it, installed Windows... and the BSODs were back. I've switched SATA cables and SATA ports, installed windows with the drives running in AHCI mode and in IDE mode... nothing works. I've switched out the PSU, thinking the HDD may be more robust in weird voltage fluctuations or something, but to no avail. As long as it is an SSD - random crashes. If I use an HDD, everything is fine. The weirdest thing is that I've run this exact same system with that exact same SSD drive without any problems for years.
