I wrote a script for the player movement in c#. Whenever the player presses A or D, it moves him/her to the left or right by 12 units and when the player presses W or S, it moves him/her up or down by 12 units. My script works fine, but if a person starts to spam all of the keys at once, it glitches out and the player object is not in line with the level anymore. I want to have the script check if there a movement is currently happening before executing the movement on the keypress. Here is my script:
In my sinple games I have two integer variables: forward and right. Every loop these variables are reset to 0. If W is pressed 1 is added to forward. If S is pressed 1 is subtracted from forward. Then in your case I would add 12 times forward as the vector in moveObject. I would do similarly with the right variable. Keep in mind that using this method of movement means going forward and sideways at the same time moves faster than going forward, because you are going forward 12 and sideways 12. (12 squared plus 12 squared = a number more than 12)
