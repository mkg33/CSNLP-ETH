I'm building a RAID1 array with two 2TB drives on a PERC H200 controller. It's been going for 60 hours now and is at 43%. Is it normal to take so long?
If the server has battery backup you can enable basic drive caching on the Logical Volumes without risk.
A time estimate from Dell's tech support monkeys could be interesting/useful -- If you're seeing substantially worse performance than you "should" there may be a problem with your drives, controller or RAID options...
Performance of SATA drives on an H200 will be fairly poor, how much data are you looking to write each day, if you continuously write large amounts of data on that controller you could potentially see high iowaits whereas an H700 would be much more suitable (at a cost of course).
If I recall correctly the initialization will automatically continue in the background, so you can begin using the array while it's initializing - just expect reduced performance since the controller (& disks) will busy building the array.
If you're referring to the "initialize" process, and you're watching it run in the foreground this could take a while depending on the speed of the disks, though 60 hours does seem a bit unreasonable: I've initialized 2TB software RAID arrays on SATA drives in substantially less time than that (about 15 hours).
