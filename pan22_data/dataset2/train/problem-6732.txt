Later, I found that it would come with the error of 'No boot sector found on internal hard drive.' I assumed it was an MBR issue due to a virus or cutting a Windows update short.
That seems odd to me, considering it's a newer (two years old or so) Windows 7 computer. All new Hard-drives have SMART. So, I checked the BIOS. No mention of SMART anywhere. Greaaaat.
I decided as a last-ditch effort to switch the hard-drive type to ATA in the BIOS (God knows why, I was getting frusterated) instead of AHCI. VOILA! It actually attempts to boot, gets halfway through the little windows animation, does an incredibly (Half a second) quick BSOD, and shuts down.
I started to think (After multiple attempts to get the MBR sorted out, including creating a new boot sector) that the Hard-drive was possibly starting to cave in on itself, so I booted into a linux bootable CD and went to check the SMART data. Odd, say's it's inaccessible. 
I'm having an issue repairing this computer. It was brought to me with the described issue of 'Not turning on'
