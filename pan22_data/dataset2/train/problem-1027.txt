That alone is worth upgrading and the other reasons mentioned: other apps may use it, other individuals may use it, and for testing are defiantly worth considering.
However, the best bet might be to wait a couple weeks so the initial bugs get ironed out then do the upgrade.  
Keep in mind that while you may not directly use IE, the IE rendering engine or other components may be used by other applications you may run.
Until such time as we get a server version without IE it needs to be updated. IE has always had more than its fair share of vulnerabilities and your server needs to be protected.
Had I upgraded to IE3, my server would have been infected as well. (I'd prefer not to have IE installed at all).
Even if you don't upgrade, i don't think it will be a problem: thanks to the uber-protective securty policy applied to internet explorer by default, IE6 is already crippled to a state that renders it useless
I used to run a SCM server that used NT 4.0, which comes with IE 2, and I had never upgraded.  Despite the fact I had the server configured to only allow connections from internal IP address, nimda had infected our exchange server so it still managed to get on to my server using the ..\.. alt encoding trick. However, nimda failed to infect my server because it  used a fnc in WININET that wasn't in the IE 2.0 WININET.  My IIS logs were full of these failed attempts.  It took quite some time to figure out why my server didn't actually have a nimda infection.
