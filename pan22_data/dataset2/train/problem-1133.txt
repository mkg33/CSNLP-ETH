X2Go is a software that enables you to access graphical desktop of a Linux computer. It performs really well even over low bandwidth connections. You can choose to use an entire desktop, or have only a single application (over X11 with a persistent session). If you are familiar with solutions like GNU Screen or tmux for command line sessions, X2Go is a similar tool for graphical sessions. X2Go uses NX technology under the hood.
And if the box you are connecting to virtualized using KVM (or RHEV), you can use Spice which performs exceptionally well.
If you have a reasonable fast link, X11 is the native remote technology on Linux and every other Unix-type system, as the X11 system was designed from the ground up to work over the network. These days, it's mostly used with ssh port forwarding (like ssh yourname@example.com -X), and NX, mentioned in the answer by alvosu, "merely" improves on the compression, making it accessible over slow links with a high latency. 
Depends why you need it.  xrdp is a wrapper around vnc but it solves most of the difficulties I have with vnc on Linux.  http://xrdp.sourceforge.net/
