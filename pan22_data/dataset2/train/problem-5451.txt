Hi: I got a new Macbook from work and it does have some software installed from work. When I started up Chrome, I noticed that there was a cryptic message that it was managed by an organization. I looked at the policies and these two policies were in place: 
AuthServerWhitelist specifies which servers are allowed for integrated authentication. By default, however, this only supports impersonation not delegation. 
I deleted these in terminal because I just want as little connections as possible between my computer and my employer. Does anyone know what these policies do? Have I caused some problems for myself?
So, if you add a server to AuthServerWhitelist, you can, for example, log in to a website which can then impersonate your user. However, let's say that website would further want to connect and authenticate to an SQL Server database on behalf of your user. That would not work since this is delegation.
Adding the server additionally to AuthNegotiateDelegateWhitelist should enable that delegation use-case, provided you are using Kerberos (Negotiate) and everything has been set up correctly.
