I'm no expert with the Random class. There is a lot of subtleties with generating random numbers. What you need to be aware is that generating a new Random for generating a new number can screw the randomness. You should declare a private Random instance and use it in your generate method. 
I would strongly advise you to stop using this method. It's drastic! When you will deal with more complex application, you will have resources that you will want to close gracefully ( a database, a GUI and etc). System.exit() does not leave place to cleanly stop the application.
generaeRandomNumber() is not complex and from what I can understand of your code, is not called anywhere else, so you could just implement it directly in generate. 
You did great with startGame(), with making 3 call to private methods. By using private method you encapsulate what you're doing and that is great.
Let the application finish normally! It's not the responsibility of the Game to determine if the application should stop! 
Note that package names in Java should always have lower case. So ishan.guessingGame.randomNumberGenerators should be ishan.guessinggame.randomNumbergenerators.
