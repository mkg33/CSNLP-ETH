You can use the commands listed here to manage Terminal Server connections. query session /server:<servername> is probably the first one you want.
These all require remote procedure call, which is part and parcel with CIFS/SMB (the IPC$ share). Check that the RPC service is enabled first. Second, you can't/shouldn't (depending on network configuration) run these services over anything but the local network. If you're trying to do this sort of management over the Internet, you should be using a VPN or some creative SSH tunneling.
Another option i've thought of recently - use PSExec and get the output of netstat on the remote computer. You can easily get the IPs or hostnames of any remotely connected computers.
You should be able to use Terminal Services Manager. If you don't have this on your machine, you can RDP into a server that has it (any server should) under Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Terminal Services Manager. Then, go to Actions and choose "Connect to Computer". That will list all active and inactive sessions and users.
Note that this will always return the user logged on to the physical machine. It will not return terminal service user or users inside a virtual machine. You will need administrator privileges on the target machine. Get-WmiObject supports the -Credential parameter if you must authenticate as someone else.
Use the eventvwr to remotely view the security log for the remote computer, and scroll through the security logs until you find a login event for the other user:
