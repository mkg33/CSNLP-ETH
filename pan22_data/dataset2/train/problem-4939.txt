Okay, I'm more of a coder, and not as familiar when it comes to things like system setup, though I try my best.  I'm currently using Slicehost (stats below) to run a personal website that gets an okay amount of traffic.
Amazon offers a simple monthly calendar, but I'm not sure I'm entering the right info both in terms of finding a comparable setup, as well as what the price is coming out to be.
I guess that's about it.  When I try to make some rough estimates of what I assume is about right, it comes out to $63/month with a $350 setup fee.  (This also doesn't include any of the S3 expenses.)  I'm assuming the additional cost will be well worth the pain it will solve me in the long run, but I'm not even sure I'm putting the "right" numbers in the calculator in the first place.
If you focus on costs, you could try cloudorado, which will calculate price of a server at multiple providers. It won't calculate backups though, but server and transfer. 
Unless there's something fundamental missing in your question, I'd say AWS would be a terrible move for you.  Even before you factor in traffic and EBS (which you'll definitely need to store your PgSQL and SearchSphinx databases) it's double the cost, and for what?  Your use case doesn't appear to include any of the things that AWS is actually good at (handling very peaky loads, particularly those that can be handled by background processing; or dealing with rapid growth and an incompetent IT staff that can't do capacity planning), so you'll be paying the "instant scaling" tax without getting anything back for it.
I'm in the process of a site redesign, and with it, I'd like to move to AWS (EC2 & S3).  I'm trying to figure out a similar (probably a little better in terms of RAM since I've consistently had high root & swap IO usage) setup, and how much that'll cost me.
