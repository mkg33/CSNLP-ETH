The problem with trying to shoehorn version control systems into file synchronization systems is that you'll end up wasting a ton of disk space keeping all the old version history data in the repositories.
When all is said and done you might want to consider simply copying the whole lot of files to a safe place prior to making any large changes to your collection; when you're actually using MP3s in a normal day-to-day fashion there's not much reason for changing the files and the expense of having a revision system watching rarely-changed large binary files seems hard to justify... but if you're set on it then SVN at least does binary diff's, CVS does full copies (much larger)
The free and popular SCM's are all so-so at the task.  SVN for example will work fine, but the repository will quickly grow and the local .svn folder will be quite large as well.
Windows Vista & 7 offer Shadow Copy / Previous Versions.  It's definately not as feature-rich as a true source-control provider but does give you some of the benefits.  As others have said the storage required to house multiple revisions will likely be fairly massive--depending on the size of the files.
Personally for my large binary media collections, I don't care about being able to revert changes to any given file.  All I care about is that the collection is synchronized between my systems.  There are many file synchronization solutions out there, but they all have their various pros and cons.  Some claim they're cross platform, but that only means Win/Mac.  Others really are cross platform, but don't have large enough file size/quantity limits to be useful for large collections.  Some offer web access to the files, but also suffer from the file size/quantity limitations.  Any solution that keeps a copy of your files on a 3rd party server is inevitably going to cost you money if you have a large collection of files.
