Otherwise I wouldn't worry about it. He wont have the connection shut off for receiving a mass "we saw you download this" emails or letter. The chances of it going to court are very slim. Personally if I had a T1 (or something faster..) I'd ask for a ip address block and give each apartment it's own public ip, then it's trivial to trace who did what and to shift blame.
The owner is probably best served speaking to an attorney about this (though that's going to cost money). It would be a good idea if he made sure he wasn't going to end up being the target of litigation.
I'm going to have to be really negative about this... Trying to fight Bit Torrent the technical way is going to lead to a lot of headaches for near zero efficiency. Bit Torrent can be encapsulated in SSL on port 443 making it no different then browsing an HTTPS website.
He needs to be very careful of his legal standing, as mentioned in the other posts. Talk to a lawyer.
If the tennants are doing peer-to-peer networking he'll need to do some traffic profiling at the egress onto the Internet. You could do that on the cheap with a Linux iptables installation and some logging rules.
There are a few technical means to deal with this. But I am afraid that trying anything will just get him in deeper. A lawyer could spin his attempt at technical control in several directions.
I'd look at graphing bandwidth-usage statistics. Since he's using wired distribution, using SNMP counters (provided the distribution switches are capable) is one great way to get statistics (assuming that the tennants aren't sending traffic anywhere but the Internet-- i.e. not peer-to-peer on the LAN) about bandwidth usage. MRTG, Cacti, etc are your friend for this.
The best social solution I've seen is to give the letter to the tenants and after 3 notices terminate their internet service. Most complexes I've worked in have that policy and it works well. After the first or second letter you see their bandwidth usage drop significantly.
