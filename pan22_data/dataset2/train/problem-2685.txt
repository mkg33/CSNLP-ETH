If so, then that is it's default gateway for the network to which it is physically connected; manually configuring it with a different network's parameters will, in most cases, result in a connection.
Is there not a network administrator for this network?  It's usually courteous to involve the network administrator in such reconfiguration activities, regardless of whether the position of network admin is formal, or voluntary.
If the printer is wired to the same LAN as the other office's network (I won't speak to WiFi; WiFi connections almost exclusively use DHCP), and doesn't receive a DHCP parameters, then its gateway may be determined by examining the network parameters of another device connected to that network.  Note that if you manually configure an IP address on the printer that is already in use by another system on that network, it will cause problems for both devices, even if it seems to work at first.
Finally, for a given network, A.B.C.x, with a netmask of 255.255.255.0, the default gateway IP is most often A.B.C.1, occasionally A.B.C.254, and rarely anything else, though x technically could be any number greater than 0, less than 255, it's usually 1.  The reader's mileage may vary. Use at your own risk.
