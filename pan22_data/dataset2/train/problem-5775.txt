The Pi could be on another address. When I scan my network with the iOS tool Fing, I can find the address of my Pi. It's easy to find in the list with the name Raspberry Pi Foundation. Fing is also available for other systems, including Windows. 
I had exactly the same problem.  Turns out my laptop was connected the main home network on my router while I had signed up my Rasp Pi to the guest network on the same router.  So, Raspi gets internet, pings router etc., all okay, and so does my computer/laptop, but they don't ping each other, and naturally SSH doesn't work.
I think that your problem could be a disabled SSH server. Before I explain my solutions, make sure your firewall allows communication between the Raspberry Pi and your computer. If that didn't work, here are my solutions:
1. Connect your Raspberry Pi to a TV and keyboard. You should see the terminal screen. Login with your Raspberry Pi credentials and then type the following command: "sudo raspi-config." You should be greeted with a screen. Using the keyboard keys, navigate to *Advanced Options, click SSH and then enter Enable. You should now be able to access your Raspberry Pi through SSH.
you should connect the TV to your RPi to find out what's going on with the network, is it working properly and what is the allocated IP address. after that, you may try to check if sshd is actually started and listening to the port.
2. I am assuming you have Raspian or something similar as the Raspberry Pi's OS, * format & reinstall a FRESH copy of the OS image onto the SD card and try again.*
Um.  I think I may have an answer here.  This will also prove how dumb I am, but in the interest of helping out ... [  :)  ]
