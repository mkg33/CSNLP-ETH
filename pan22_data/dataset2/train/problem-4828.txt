If I write a simple gtk hello-world program and I link it with just libgtk, with no mate or gnome or desktop libraries, it works. It displays the selected appearance. I'm pretty sure that "org.mate.interface" is not hardcoded into libgtk. And I'd assume that "gsettings" is not hardcoded into libgtk. So how does it get my configuration? Environment variable, dotfile, X server property, what?
Usage of the XSETTINGS protocol makes the backend irrelevant – e.g. older GNOME and MATE versions used GConf, while Xfce uses XfConf, and there is a standalone xsettingsd which uses a text file. (On the other hand, as you can see the protocol is very specific to X11 and cannot be used within Wayland.)
Since you're using MATE, mate-settings-daemon is the XSETTINGS provider. It reads org.mate.interface from GSettings and re-publishes the value as Net/ThemeName via XSETTINGS, where GTK can finally retrieve it.
On X11, however, GTK uses the XSETTINGS protocol, where a separate DE-specific daemon gets various settings from wherever it wants, and republishes them in a standard format using X11's selections mechanism.
That's a bad assumption, since GSettings is the primary configuration storage for most GNOME programs and indeed used for retrieving the theme name in GTK 3 under Wayland. Specifically, gdkdisplay-wayland uses gtk-theme in the org.gnome.desktop.interface schema.
Note that not all desktop environments run an XSETTINGS provider. For example, using LXDE's lxappearance simply edits the configuration files: ~/.gtkrc-2.0 for GTK 2, and ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini for GTK 3. These are always read, but used at the lowest priority – the GSettings or XSETTINGS specified parameters always win.
The xsettingsd package also comes with a dump_xsettings tool which dumps data from whatever provider is currently running.
