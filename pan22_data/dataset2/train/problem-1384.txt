There are of course some deciding factors here such as storage requirements.  As you have mentioned you are thinking of cloud storage for disaster recovery although this may help guarantee no data loss this would not satisfy the automatic fail-over of a mission critical database for this application if it needs 100% uptime.  Going back a sec If this is a very small database mirroring over a WAN will possible although with encryption is recommended.
However, If there is any secure information in the database it might also be important to see if there are any compliance regulations for the contents of the database that it not be stored on a public cloud but rather a private cloud to satisfy things such as PCI in special cases.
Mirroring over WAN has a very sensitive latency threshold and in the event of poor performance due to network throughput this can cause the mirror to fall out of sync intentionally to protect the database however... in the event of corruption in a database mirror set the corruption would then replicate to all the replicas.
