This could be benign, or malign.  Let's hope for benign: there is something running on your machine that thinks it knows better than ARP and is updating the ARP table "by hand".  I suspect something like a firewall or other endpoint protection type of program, but if you really can't track it down by reviewing what's installed then your only recourse is to break out heavy-duty audit tools like WPR/WPA or ProcessInternals, let them do their thing, and then tie the events back.
An old strategy for defeating the first, btw, is to set up static ARP entries for all the local targets you want to talk to.  For the second, well, if the attacker is on your machine, it's too late. 
It could be malign: a classic man-in-the-middle attack is to send out an ARP claiming to be Alice when you are really Bob: everyone updates their cache and from then on everyone who sends to Alice thinks they are talking to her when in fact their traffic is going to Bob.  Or (another way around) someone breaks into your machine and sets up static ARPs to the "wrong" targets.
