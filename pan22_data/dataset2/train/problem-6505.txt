In addition to local changes via the user interface or the registry, in Active Directory domains Group Policy can be used to apply the setting to all clients.
The policy setting is called "Turn off caching of thumbnail pictures" and is found under User Configuration –> Administrative Templates –> Windows Components –> Windows Explorer
Still, you'll have those old ones left. If you want to get rid of them, do this in Windows Command box:
You could do the same for .DS_STORE on OS X clients and whatever else is common in your environment.
If your users are primarily Windows users running Explorer, you'll speed up the browsing process by pre-generating the thumbnails for them and make it easier for them to find the photograph they are looking for.
Since these files are quite common, make sure to turn off the e-mail and event log alerts when they are blocked.
A better solution is given here  (http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/what-are-thumbsdb-files-and-can-i-delete-them-windows.htm).  Follow the 2 steps to simply prevent WINDOWS from creating the THUMBS.db file  :-)
This has the benefit of only blocking thumbnail caching on your file servers only versus blocking it on all workstations.
Create a new file screen, type in the path and then select Custom Properties.  You will need to create a new file group that includes "thumbs.db" and turn on Active Screening.
On Windows 2003 R2 or later, you can use the File Screen Management console (inside the File Server Resource Manager) to block the writing of "thumbs.db" to particular paths.
