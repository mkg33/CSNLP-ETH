Um, either way this isn't going to work. If you can't uncompress the images onto your filesystem then there is no way you'll be able to import them into ESXi once you do uncompress them. Am I missing something?
If you've not got room locally, you could copy the file to the esxi server, SSH in, and then unzip it there?
If I understand what you are asking, you want to run the VM without decompressing the files. This is not possible. Depending on if the VM actually is using 80 GB of data, you man however be able to move them to another system that has enough space, decompress them there, then import them into ESXi using the VMware converter (or ovftool), selecting "thin disk" as a deployment option so they don't take up the entire size of the virtual disk issued to them, but there might actually be 80GB of data in the disk, in which case this wouldn't get you anywhere.
Uncompress the gzip'd file onto a Windows desktop machine, and use vmware converter to shrink the disks, or basically get rid of the zero'd space at the end (which is why you are getting such a high compression rate.
Assuming the .gz file is on another machine, you could try using gzip and piping it to netcat. Not sure how easy it is to get netcat running on esxi though.
