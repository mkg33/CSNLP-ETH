For php just go with the remi repo. It is actively maintained and it's maintainer works for RH. You can even install it as a Software Collection.
Notice than the most "official" solution to install recent versions of various software on Red Hat / CentOS are Software Collections.
I want to install PHP7 and on Centos you can only do that by installing extra repositories. I see a variety of them (remi, ius, webtatic), and the comments on forums are both pro and contra. 
I am not asking for personal opinions, but I am interested in what are the professional reasons to chose one over another - criteria that I should take into account and possible pitfalls that I should avoid. 
Red Hat Software Collections version 2.3 provides both php 5.6 and 7.0, and are maintained by Red Hat, and available for CentOS users in centos-scl repository, maintained by the SCLo SIG.
I am one of the IUS core developers.  On multiple occasions, users have given me feedback that the reason they use IUS is that it is sponsored by Rackspace and maintained by multiple Rackspace engineers. The other repos mentioned in the original question (Remi and Webtatic) are maintained by individuals.  The bus factor for individual side projects is not optimal, regardless of employer.
