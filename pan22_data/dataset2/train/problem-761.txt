You should look at John the Ripper - its a password cracking utility.  You can run it in dictionary attack mode which takes a list of passwords from a text file.  Your word list could consist of just your default password.
I would set Enforce password history to a high number (say 10) and either decrease my password age to 30 or script an expire password for all users.  The next thing to do is look at service accounts and reset their passwords.  If you have a large environment this will be painful (thus the new managed service accounts in 2008). I agree with Bart in that the utilities that can retrieve the password are often more trouble than they are worth.  Hopefully you are in an environment where they will let you expire passwords at regular intervals in which case this password will certainly go away in time, as long as you have the password history set.
create a share where you are being asked for a password when doing net use. then write a script that tries to map the share with all the usernames and the default pw.
There's no official way to view user passwords (it's possible, but you have to delve into ... security utilities).  It's probably best to approach this from a password-age angle.  It sounds as if you could compare the user creation date to the date the password was last changed, and if there's a match, toggle the 'password change on next login' field.
