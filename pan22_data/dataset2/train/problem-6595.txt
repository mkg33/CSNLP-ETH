Lets say in a table with a few million records and a non clustered index on a field such as read would a select perform way worse than if the field were a Boolean?
I would like to use a date time field so that I can just quantify all unread messages as having null or a date time value for read. I get Boolean operation and a timestamps.
I have a table where I want to track Boolean type operations. in addition, a business requirement is that I know the date of the action and not just the Boolean value. 
Look into creating the index with included columns. Check this link. If you want to select all the unread messages and see their dates, create the index on the READ column and include the DATE column. If you want to select a date range and count the number of read/unread messages, then create the index on the DATE field and include the READ column.
Also, you can set the Boolean READ column with a default value (lets say 0) that corresponds to unread, instead of using NULL. I am not sure if there will be any performance benefits to this though.
