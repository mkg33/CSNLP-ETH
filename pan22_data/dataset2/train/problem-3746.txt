If I try to refresh the trust by locking and unlocking this time with the network enabled I get the same:
I have two computers in the same domain that I use, recently I changed the domain password on one of them.
This is how I have guys fix it who aren't familiar(or not trusted) with powershell. Basically it just tells the DC to delete the Computer account, then recreate it again. 
If I disable again the network I can log in with the old password. If I enable afterwords the network connection I am able to see the domain dns, etc.
I knew that I can log with that account and the old password if I just disable the network connection. So I logged in with the network disabled and the old password and it work.
How to establish trust relationship from this situation without having access to domain control server?
This can happen for a few other reasons, but the common ones I've seen are another PC has been given the same name, or the computer hasn't been logged in to for quite a long time.
You can however reset computer password (trust password) on the Domain Controller if you can get access.
If your user has administrative rights i would create a local user and login with this user to reestable the domain trust with valid domain credentials.
