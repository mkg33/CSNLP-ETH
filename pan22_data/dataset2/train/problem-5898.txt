A macro is not necessary to automatically insert the author's name.  It can be done using just a template and the Author field.  To do this:
To create a new document and have it automatically grab the author's name, just double click the template file or, from the New document window, select New from existing and browse to it.  The new document will open as a DOCX file, not the DOTX template.  The original author's name will be grabbed by the document and it can be saved as a normal document.  The name should not change unless someone opens the footer and explicitly updates the field.
2nd Note: You can add Document Property fields to a regular DOCX document, but it will usually re-update the author each time the document is opened and saved (i.e., grabbing the name of whoever opens it, not the original author).
Note: To edit the template itself after closing, hold down Shift while right clicking the file, then select Edit.  Opening it otherwise will turn it into a standard document, not a template.
