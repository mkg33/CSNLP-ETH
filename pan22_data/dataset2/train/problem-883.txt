however if two disks are indeed actually faulty then you're basically hosed. (outside using an expensive data recovery firm)
As dyasny written: find the drive that failed 1st; remove it (disconnect sata cable); try to rebuild array with other drives (mdadm --assemble /dev/md0 /dev/sd[b-d]1 --force).
You need to do a procedure called "re-tagging", and it might work. Basically, the idea is as follows:
I would strongly advise to make a bit-for-bit copy of all drives before you start rebuilding (e.g.  with dd). If you picked wrong drive you can try again with other drive removed. Also mark on what port of your controller they were connected. It's not good idea to change this order.
you might be able to force a disk back into an online state if it's just the raid software that took it offline, that may allow you to rebuild the array. 
This should leave you with a degraded but usable raid array, to which you can add a new disk, or rebuild with the old one, if it had a scsi timeout softfail.
