I have read that it should be possible to solve this by putting the router in bridge mode, but I have not been able to find how to do this.
The workaround involves turning off page styles on the webpage to be able to view the additional feature.
Turn DHCP off and set the router IP to below or above the existing available DHCP range. Change the channel so it's not overlapping with the original router. Plug the ethernet cable into one of the LAN ports, not the WAN port. Voila!
Or if that is not possible a cheat would be to set up the second WLAN router with a WLAN, disable DHCP on it and connect the wired LAN interface to the dlan adapter.
What I have done now is to get a second wireless router (same model as first). I want to connect the second wireless router to a avmini adapter. When I run the setup for the router, I get a message at the end that I cannot connect to the Internet.
So SSID, and WPA2 and wireless key all the same, just change the channel on each. Give AP1 ip x.x.x.2 (assuming your router is x.x.x.1) AP2: x.x.x.3 and so on.
The first wireless router would then serve DHCP to its WLAN, to its LAN and by extension of LAN-DLAN to the LAN and WLAN of the second wireless router. The two WLANs can be named the same or named differently.
Another way to do this is to give each access point a different IP, make all other wireless details the same EXCEPT the channel. Make the channel for each Access point different.
I have a cable modem attached to a D-Link DIR-635 wireless router. This works fine if I am in the part of the house near the router.
Note that you should always set WLAN's to free channels, so the two WLAN routers should use different channels and you may want to avoid default channels like 6 and 11 (and probably others).
