I had the same problem.  It was frustration having to use internet browsers to read PDF files.  Until one day, I tried to open acrobat reader XI again and the user agreement came on. I clicked agree and everything is running fine now. Do you remember the user agreement coming on after a successful re-installation?
A little bit later, I found my answer. I had this same issue with Adobe Reader and Acrobat. It was not the EULA. I was messing with the task manager and I realized that killing the process acrobat_sl.exe for Acrobat and reader_sl.exe for Adobe Reader solved my problem. I then created a batch file that auto ran everyday and killed these tasks.
I just had the same problem and this answer helped, thanks! To force the appearance of the user agreement I opened EULA.EXE by double clicking, which should be located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Reader 11.0\Reader or a similar path, and accepted the agreement and now everything seems to work. 
I know I'm late on this thread, but none of the things above helped me out, but I did find a solution to the proposed problem. Since my Adobe would not launch from the desktop, or the .exe in program files, I found a known good computer with the same Adobe and copied the Adobe files from that computer and replaced it with the broken PC adobe files. Adobe works great now.
