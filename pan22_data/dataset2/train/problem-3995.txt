In postfix you could hold all incoming messages (that matches some pattern, or simply all of them), have your application pick them up in the hold/ directory and then place them back to the incoming/ directory once done. This is how the antispam filter MailScanner works when used with postfix.
There were suggestions for using procmail above, it is a great product, but honestly what I have presented is the fastest and simplest solution and it works in more versions of *NIX with more mailers than any other.
Too, non of the other answers really tell you how to process the inbound message and so you would, in your script read input from standard "in" (stdin) and then parse that data using whatever algorithms you may have to process it properly as follows:
I want to parse and insert some information from the mail that just arrived in a mission critical application's mail server. 
It can be written in php, bash, perl, python, whatever you want and whatever you have for an interpeter.   You could even launch a compiled binary written in c/c++, etc.
The effect of this is to tell Postfix to move all messages to the HOLD queue, when your application is done I believe you should put the mails in the incoming/ directory.
You can use /etc/aliases to pipe email directly to a program to process, so if you wanted to run a script to process all email to test@domain.com you would put this line in /etc/aliases (works for postfix, sendmail, etc.):
