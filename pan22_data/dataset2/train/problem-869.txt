Since that's the first Received: header, it tells us that the message wasn't handed to a server until March 16. Note also the Date: header is March 16.
It is unlikely to have been stuck at a mail server, as most mail servers will discard messages they can't deliver within a certain time frame (typically 4 days)
Thus the only conclusion I can come up with is the message sat in the sender's outbox for a month due to some misconfiguration or problem on the client end.  Maybe his outgoing server configuration was wrong?  Then whatever was wrong, it got fixed on March 16 and the mail client was able to successfully send the mail.
If he really did press send at that date it might have gotten stuck in the outbound e-mail queue of his mail client and then, by chance delivered a month later when he happened to restart the mail client or something similar.
My first suspicion would be an incorrect date setting on one of the systems involved. Send date is set by the system that creates the email, so if it has the wrong time it will be sent at the wrong time.
