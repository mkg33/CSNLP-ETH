All that a schema upgrade really does is extend the AD with new object classes and properties (that an application or newer version of AD can make use of), so scope for disaster is quite limited.  This technet article gives a decent overview and covers some potential Bad Things Happening cases.
Standard approach for me would be to ensure that everything is functioning properly beforehand (via dcdiag, replmon, etc), and ensure that I have a known-good backup of AD in case the worst happens.  I'd keep this backup for as long as possible, as AD can be so damn robust that problems may not manifest for a long time afterwards.  So standard backup and restore would be my rollback.  But like I said, I've never seen that be the case.
I've never seen a schema update (so long as it's done properly) go wrong.  MS really seem to have pulled out all the stops in making this a solid and reliable process, and it shows.  The only real scenarios in which I could see anything bad happening would be if you lost power partway through (even then I'm not certain), or if your AD was already screwed to begin with (in which case you have bigger problems).
