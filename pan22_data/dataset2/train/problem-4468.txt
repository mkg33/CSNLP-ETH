But there is this project called C#/XAML for HTML 5  which build HTML based on XAML. That way you could use Cordova to deploy apps to *nix Operating Systems.
Is it possible to run UWP apps on Raspbian Jessie, or failing that, is it possible to design GUIs with XAML for Raspbian? I looked into alternatives, but I would prefer to remain with XAML.
You can also explore the Xamarim SDK in VS2015 - I think they offer their own XAML designer for cross platform applications.
I am sorry to say that UWP will not run on anything but Windows 10.(It is universal for any Windows 10 device... not truly a universal OS solution :( ) The portability was intended for Windows 10 devices only. It depends on the Windows Runtime (WinRT) which the API is only available on Windows 10 at the moment.
I'm part-way through making a headed UWP app for my Raspberry Pi 3, which is running Windows IoT Core. I would like to switch to it running Raspbian Jessie, so that I can use the RasPi cam, but I don't know if this is possible.
