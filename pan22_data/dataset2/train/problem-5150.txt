For further information you might look up registered memory, buffered memory, FB-DIMM, or fully buffered memory (they are all the same to my knowledge)
My work station circa 2011 takes ECC "E" (unbuffered at the time) and my server circa 2006 takes ECC "F" or fully buffered, which then for a time was labeled "R".  It just depends on the times.
I have read that registered memory was a crutch to quicken the pace of technology (more capacity/channels) at the time for the cost of performance and power consumption. I'm not sure its used as much now but now there appears to be a "P" ?!?!
As @davidschwartz pointed out in the comments, the "R" memory is registered which "means it has additional buffers". Sometimes registered memory is called buffered memory.
To extrapolate, the "E" memory does not have the additional registers and is unbuffered. They both are ECC, but they both are NOT registered. You usually cannot mix them, but sometimes enterprise server boards can accept both; with "R" usually allowing more installable memory capacity I think.
