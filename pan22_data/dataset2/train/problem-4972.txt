You don't need extra clients when the functionality is already there: access your Google Drive files through WebDAV using OS X’s built-in WebDAV capabilities.
I was trying to use synchronize and it would choke after doing a few files on the "mirror" setting.   I wanted to preserve time settings on the files.  Eventually I conceded defeat.  
Use the online service provided by synqya for the WebDAV access, then use the “Connect to Server…” option from the “Go” menu in the Finder, enter connection details and once you have an authenticated server connection, it will mount a network drive on your desktop.
The best free solution I found was to use Syncplicity  It's got a limit of 2GB but since a couple of hundred of my files totals up to 21MB, I'm not too worried about that. It's also got a limit of 2 devices that can sync.   For me, that's not an issue right now.   My use case is wanting to have things in Google Docs that I can work on when I'm not connected to the internet.
I tried downloading from Google Docs itself but you get a bunch of files without the collection labels and the time is set to Jan 1 1980.
There may be some workarounds, but here is a request link for dropbox to add functionality to their product to sync with Google Docs: http://getsatisfaction.com/dropbox/topics/sync_dropbox_with_google_docs
This is currently only supported if you have Google Apps Premier Edition using the Google Documents List Data API.
it's fantastic and will do exactly what you need to, access your google docs from your desktop/non browser.
I spent the afternoon fighting with CyberDuck on my Macbook, trying to get it to sync Google Docs to a local directory.
I'd prefer to not use a third-party service and would like a Dropbox-like solution from Google itself.  Which there are rumors about but so far hasn't happened.
I tried an extension for Google Chrome but although the extension was free, you only got 15 days of free syncing before you have to pay $5/month.
