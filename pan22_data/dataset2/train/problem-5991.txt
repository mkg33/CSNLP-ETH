Also the Check the firmware (amazing how many people do not do this) HP excerpt: In BIOS revisions prior to 11/03/2006, the default configuration for SATA models will not recognize when more than four drives are installed while running Microsoft Windows operating system. To recognize all six drives, AHCI mode has to be enabled and SATA AHCI driver installed. For further information on how to enable AHCI mode, please refer to the RTF card that is shipped with the server.
The drive listing on the document is out of date. The ML 350 g3 was retired June 2008. I would suggest you look and see what type of drives you currently have and stick with those. The chassis comes in a hot plug and non-hot pluggable setup. If you have access to larger SATA/SAS drives then the ones listed you might try one. The documentation does not advance much after a chassis is retired. 
The HP documents I have looked at say you can mix and match the SAS/SATA drives as needed. Most folks use the same disk type in order to make RAID optimized. Seems basic info but some people do not know so try and make all your drives of the same type and capacity.
