I'm using XCP on production environment. Currently using XCP 1.0 in 6 physical servers with around 20 vms running at the time, everything connected with a NetApp storage with 3TB usable, NIC bonding in some cases, automated backups and things...
I have been using both in our labs - 4P and 2P servers, NFS storage - 150+ VMs .....almost no major issues
There is eucalyptus bundled with the latest ubuntu (9.10) which is essentially an open source version of the amazon cloud platform.
HA is a cloud doesn't necessarily mean anything, though, as the cloud itself is HA and the Xen image can migrate between underlying nodes.  So you think about clouds differently than normal virtualization since with normal, in house virtualization, you put together several virt head ends into an HA cluster and that... for all purposes, is an in house cloud.
Amazon, Rackspace, Eucalyptus, etc. use Xen.  Xen is NOT XenServer wrapped as open source.  Xen is the base package that is then repackaged by Citrix, Oracle, Sun, Virtual Iron (RIP) and others and sold as commercial virtualization.  Xen is not in any way "stripped down", it is actually more full featured as it gets the features first before the commercial variants get them downstream.
Citrix does "own" the Xen project but it is fully OSS and XenServer from Citrix is a derivative of it.
