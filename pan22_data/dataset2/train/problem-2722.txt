The problem is that you are running your mouse coordinates through Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint twice.
I'm trying to create a voxel based game, now I want my character to remove blocks with a melee weapon, but I'm not sure which way to go.
So my world looks like follows: I got a 3d Sidescrolling game, so the character is moving on x and y axis, the z axis of the world is on -16 btw. thats because i change the z value of the raycast. It doesnt work with 16 nor -16. I think this direction part is not fine, because the values are kinda odd.
When you also have the problem that you are shooting in the opposite direction, it will help to replace:
I mean is it the only way to get the Block with a raycast? I don't really want a rigibody weapon and the blocks with a trigger btw. . So if the raycast is the solution, how is it done? I don't get my code running, I just want to shoot a ray for a short distance in the facing direction, or better in the mousedirection. I've found a lot of code to do that but none is working for me :( here is my code so far.
