If your use of SQLMail isn't particularly fancy (just running queries and sending to email addresses), you might be able to write a shim procedure that looks like SQLMail to callers but essentially just passes parameters through to Database Mail. I tinkered with something like this a few years back but we wound up biting the bullet and actually changing the application code. So, your existing code would be probably untouched, it would call the "SQLMail" code that is newly written, that code calls Database Mail and people should get email. That would let you start to rework the SQLMail->Database Mail code at your leisure.
We use SQLMail heavily in the organization, both to send e-mails and to import some into a database.
Does SQLMail still work in 2012, and if not, how easy is it to replace with Database Mail, both for reading and sending e-mails?
I understand the dangers of SQLMail but we do not have the resources to rewrite the scripts right now and would prefer to do it later on.
I'm confused because this MS page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb402904.aspx seems to imply that it would still work?
