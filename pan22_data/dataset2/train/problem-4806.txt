Even if your data looks like dates, actually you've TEXT in your sheet and not date values (quickest way to check it is to see horizontal alignment, text is left aligned and numbers are right aligned by default).
After that I was able to change the locale to my real one and it still recognizes the format I need as a date.
Verify that there are no extra spaces or other non-visible characters at the beginning of the date values in B and D.
So you need to convert your data to dates, quickest solution is to use: =DATEVALUE(A2)+TIMEVALUE(A") function. Now you will have the value in the cell, just need to format it to the desired format.
Assuming your values are actually stored (not formatted) as dates, you can just do a simple subtraction as use this number format:
So I "solved" this by changing my computer's locale to en_US, so the m/d/yyyy h:mm am/pm format would get recognized.
There is nothing wrong with the pattern or the formula you are using.  The formula works with the several date formats that I tried.
