No-ip, you can setup a no-ip name and then use that name instead of your ip. No-ip has a client that automatically updates your no-ip with your current ipaddress so the name always points to the right place.
I'm using a Windows 7 and want to connect to the mysql server on my dedicated server running of FreeBSD.
As you know, keeping the mysql port 3306 opened is unsafe - but I would like to use a good mysql administrative program instead of phpmyadmin, which requires 3306 port to be opened.
Create a secure tunnel to the server using SSH port forwarding from your client or some other tool.  That way you can have the server only bind to the loopback adapter, and not be publicly available.  It will be completely encrypted over the tunnel, and only authorized users will be able to login.
If you install phpmyadmin on a server it does not require 3306 port to be open since the database is on localhost. Then you can connect to phpmyadmin on your server through https, which is encrypted:
This blog post discusses using a DynDNS address and iptables to create a "dynamic" firewall rule through a script that runs frequently, detects any actual IP change, and updates the iptables rules accordingly. 
Of course I can allow only my ip address to connect to 3306 port using ipfw, but the problem is that my IP address change itself every 24 hours, so I would have to add a new rule for every IP address...
