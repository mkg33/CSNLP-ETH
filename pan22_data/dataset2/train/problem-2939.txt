This is one option. However, performing a query every second for a potentially large table of players is not exactly appealing - but I might be underestimating my server. Am I?
I've been interested in developing a browser game ala OGame or Ikariam etc. Basically, a menu is displayed with your resources and, overtime, they increase depending on how advanced are you in the game.
... Maybe when you upgrade your gold production, goldModifications will be modified by your current amount of gold (so if you had 1500, we would do goldModifications += 1500), then creationTime will be overwritten to the current time.
But wait. Players can upgrade their gold production. Hence, goldProduction isn't constant and this formula is flawed...
So I have two methods. One is incredibly simple (just update the database), but I am unsure if it is too much overhead or not. The other is very complex as there could be any number of factors affecting gold production, but certainly requires less processing power.
