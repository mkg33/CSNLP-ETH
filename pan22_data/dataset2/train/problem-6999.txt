Once you change the transmission-daemon user to root the permissions problem is gone with either a usb or smb share. 
None of the answers here worked for me, so I am writing a new one referencing https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-torrentbox/ which worked great for me and allowed me to run transmission as pi user to access my USB drive. This is not directly answering the OP but this question is very popular (first Google result) for this sort of problem so I put it here.
I tried every single answer given on this discussion (including root) in a hundred different ways with different options and could not get transmission to save on my usb SSD drive. Then while reading something different, it was mentioned not to mount in /media/pi since daemons or other groups may not have access.  So i mount the USB drive to /mnt/usb_disk, set the paths in /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json to /mnt/usb_disk/downloads and transmission starts saving to the disk.
I believe your problem is your USB stick is formatted as NFTS or FAT, filesystems that do not support the per-user/group permissions. The solution is to reformat as ext4. If you do that, you will also have much less lag if you are using your Pi as a media center. The drivers for the Pi are much faster when you use ext4.
And then run (this is really important else the daemon from the service will just run as debian-transmission)
I think one of the main things people are overlooking is that you should mount your usb/external drive in /mnt/myUsbDrive folder, and NOT in /media/pi/myUsbDrive.
FYI, I did change owner of /mnt/usb_disk/downloads to pi and group to debian-transmission with 777 permissions.
I found that the file system was the problem for me. Luckily it was a brand new usb hard drive so wasn't an issue to format it.
