Now we need to disable the wifi when they login with that specific account, but it needs to be enabled when that account logs out.
Set it only to run when the user is logged in (and of course select the user that should not be able to connect wirelessly) 
Name refers to the name of the network profile that is used to connect to a specific wireless network. The network profile name is set to the SSID by default.
What you rather can do is make the wireless adapter unusable by making a task in task scheduler that disconnects the wireless network whenever it tries to connect.
Has anyone got an idea? We've already tried creating a script with gpedit and Windows Task scheduler. In the batchfile is netsh interface set interface "Wireless Interface" disabled, but that didn't work. It looked like the user-account won't run the script.
I've got a Windows 7 laptop here. At my internship we use network accounts, except when they need to use a laptop external from our locations. We've got an account, but we have a Sierra Wireless Broadband chip in there.
Administrator rights are required to enable/disable network interfaces. Without sufficient rights, I get the following error message: "An interface with this name is not registered with the router."
