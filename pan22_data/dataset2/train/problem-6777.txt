Check the syslog config file in "/etc/syslog/syslog.conf", and specify the log destinations accordingly. 
The cause seems to be on the ownership of the file, should be syslog instead of root. Couldn't found the bug report.
The details of syslog.socket (https://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/plain/units/syslog.socket) offer some explanation of what is going on:
See https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/using-systemd-drop-in-units.html (for example) for a bit more on drop-ins. 
Aptitude shows that I have installed the package inetutils-syslogd, and the package rsyslog is not installed.
Or, in other words, you should probably consider leaving rsyslog enabled  (sudo systemctl enable rsyslog.service), unless you have a specific reason for wanting to use another syslog implementation. 
rsyslog is the default log server present in your system, and you can find its config file in  "/etc/rsyslog.conf". Dont try to remove it simply disable the rsyslog daemon by executing "systemctl disable rsyslog", so that on the next boot it wont restart automatically.
In more practical terms, journald uses /run/systemd/journal/syslog to bridge to syslog (any syslog implementation), and syslog.socket links that path to whatever the OS's default syslog is. 
I have found out that there is a service called rsyslog, which is breaking my normal syslog service. But rsyslog is not installed on my system, so I have no idea what is going on, and how I can permanently remove rsyslog.
The syslog.socket unit is a generic unit that (in effect) simply ensures that a socket exists for journald to speak to a syslog daemon when it needs to.
