You can run as many VMs as your resources (memory, CPU and disk space) on the host allows. The 4 VM count with Enterprise Edition means you get 4 windows licenses for free with the purchase of Enterprise Edition.  You can buy additional licenses if you go over 4
Here's the URL you're looking for:  Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 . Note the "Guest Virtualization Rights Included in Host Server License" row, where it states:
I'm not sure if you can "stack" enterprise licensing - buying two enterprise licenses doesn't get you 8 VM licenses, I believe it gets you 1 host, 4 VMs plus one more Enterprise.
So Enterprise means you get a license for the host, plus 4 additional VMs.  If you need a fifth, you buy a liceneses for Windows Server.
If you're planning on running 12 vm's on one physical host , with no previous licensing, Datacenter Edition will probably be a better deal money-wise in the long run.  Especially if those are going to be Enterprise versions that you want to run (Datacenter allows you to install any lower version of Server).  It also allows you expansion in the future if you decide to upgrade hardware capacity.  Hyper-V itself can run as many VM's as you have license for and that your hardware can support.  You can also use existing Win client/server licenses if you're migrating those physical machines into the virtual space.
