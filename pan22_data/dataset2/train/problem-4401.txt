As far as I know, the SMB component in 10.7 is not capable of acting as a Domain Controller in any way, neither NT4 style nor AD. All it can do is act as a SMB2 server.
They have discontinued Samba in 10.7 because Samba switched to GLPv3, a license Apple is unable or unwilling to use and instead wrote their own minimal SMB server. 
As for Open Directory, the documentation is pretty scanty about exactly what it is doing. There are two ways to join an AD domain:
Not likely, Lion having only been out for a couple of days as of this posting. I've already had to dissuade some of my users from upgrading due to critical incompatibilities.
In fact, it isn't clear at all that it is making an Active Directory domain. It could just be creating an NT4-style domain with a PDC, the kind that Samba has been doing for years now. Those don't need DNS records. The domain name in your case looks like it's either "MIRANDA" or "PILIF".
An earlier documentation page shows one way that Open Directory does what it does. It isn't terribly clear, but the "magic triangle" it is talking about suggests it is using AD for Auth in Open Directory, and allows using all the other Open Directory bits with it (whatever they may be).
As far as I am concerned, 10.7 Server is a terrible joke and it's the end of the line for me with Apple on the backend. 
When it comes to emulating a straight up AD Domain Controller, which is what is needed to emulate Active Directory, things get a lot trickier. I know of one commercial product that can do it, as well as the still-in-development Samba 4 suite. The commercial product borrowed heavily from Samba 4 as I understand it (IIRC it has a GPL component and a closed-source component) to do what it does.
