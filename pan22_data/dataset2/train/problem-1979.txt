Set up your HP SIM/iLO environment properly (or your server manufacturer's equivalent) and you never have to go into the server room. Well, almost. 
Get a small wireless hand vacuum with a plastic-tipped end (no bristles). I always vacuum my computers when they get dusty, and have been for years. Beats using compressed air which just blows the dust all over the place.
Buy a few dust masks. Make sure you get the ones with a wee exhaust valve, not the just cheapest ones, and you'll appreciate that feature after about ninety seconds. 
Canned air and a vacuum works wonders.  Also if you need to get real nitty gritty I have had to use Q-Tips to clean fan blades.
I concur with Ernie regarding the server room environment.  For cleaning machines I like to stay away from canned air as 1) it spreads the dust around to where I can breathe it in and 2) it forces the dust into tiny places that don't react well to little particles (like drive mechanics).  A good shopvac for the big things like vents, power supplies, etc and a micro vac (or micro attachments) for the more sensitive areas.
There's a fine nasal spray called Livostin which acts fast to relieve the symptoms without whacking you out for the day.
