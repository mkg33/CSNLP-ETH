Is the "domain" still active - can you ping the domain?  What domain related errors are in the event logs on the other servers?
I have a setup here with a single domain controller and 4 servers which were whithin it's domain. The servers were brought down and are being repurposed, but we would like to keep backups of the machines around.
Don't forget that the default username = administrator and the password = what you put in for the directory services restore mode password when you created the DC.
I am going through one by one and taking the backups, which requires that I login to these machines. I've been able to login to all the servers, except the domain controller. The domain controller itself seems to have not started all it's active directory services, and when one tries to login, it complains that the system cannot log you on now because the domain XXXXX is not available.
I actually had a similar issue this weekend - in my case, I had brought the DC up without a network connection by accident (the switch hadn't finished powering up). I rebooted it with the net connection active and it worked fine after that.
Is your workstation part of the domain?  Can you log in over the network from one of the other servers?
