2.) Use the HDMI -> VGA adapter that comes with the card to connect yout TV (if it has a VGA port). No overscan adjustment necessary on my display in this configuration (no sound on TV either). Image quality is really just as good; can't see a difference myself.
That's all i could ever do with the same stuff, i could get the high resolutions to work, but they would flicker and lag. 800 by 600 and usually 50hz was the only setting it worked for with HDMI.
Have you tried an external cofiguration tool such as PowerStrip? They offer a free trial and you may be able to tweak the settings you need to get it to work. I had a similar problem a few years back with an NVidia card and was able to manual set it to output correctly.  
As for the particular settings that will work for your TV, you may look in the owners manual for the specific input it expects or search for you model tv online.
Had the same overscan problem on my Samsung TV and Radeon 4800 series card (& Windows 7). The following 2 ways both worked :
1) Catalyst latest version 9.10 (2009.0925....): Grahpics->Desktop & Displays. Right click your TV display (in the lower bar, not the big panel) select Cnnfigure. Go to tab Scaling Options, adjust overscan. Be sure to use the HDMI -> DVI adapter that came with the card, generic HDMI->DVI cables did not work for me (no sound).
