You can (and should) also weigh up the risk of not achieving each project. That is, the chance of the project ending up with no value gained for the given cost.
If you were releasing this as a commercial game, some factors you may consider to be valuable could be:
And of course, in both situations - how much personal satisfaction you'll gain from seeing this idea brought to life.
Whether a personal project, android app or fully publisher funded release - the key aim is to create as much value as possible for the resources you invest.
The values you attribute will range from super fuzzy (personal satisfaction) to concrete (earning $x income). Some will have higher or lower priority for you, and there is no way for anybody except yourself to decide "how valuable" a project is to you overall.
For personal projects, this is often the value vs the time investment (which should not be undervalued). But the same skills will apply even if you do decide to make a commercial title.
Importantly, if you have multiple projects that you've deduced to be equally valuable, and equally risk-free; choosing any of them will have the same result and so you can just pick one at random - they are all equally good options.
Again the costs may be fuzzy (additional stress) or concrete (monetary cost of tools and your time which isn't $0 - even if you're unemployed).
However, once you've made a case for each project - and how valuable you expect it to realistically be - you can set that against the cost to make it.
Once you've properly planned out the projects, and have made decisions on what is or isn't valuable in each one - you can more objectively decide which project gives you the most value for your investment.
These can be measured in a number of ways - such as looking at similar and previous titles, asking your customer base, and many other aspects of market research.
