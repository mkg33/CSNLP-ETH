In this case connect the device with the most disk transactions per second to the faster controller. Connect the drive with the sustained (large file) transfers to the slower controller.
Spinning disk has a hard time getting up to 6Gbps speeds - In practice as of April 2012 only a few high-end 15K SAS drives can come close to 6Gbps performance (e.g. the IBM 44W2244 clocking in at 4.7Gbps), and the only drives that can saturate 6Gbps SAS or SATA connections are solid-state disks.
So a faster controller is better even though the physical spinning disk may not be faster than in an older drive.
The difference between these would be minimal because a hard disk's transfer rate is lower than 3GB/s. 
There are some advantages to a faster bus, even if a single spinning drive can't sustain that bandwith:
As you've surmised the ST3000DM001 drive can't saturate a 3Gbps port based on its sustained read figure (210MB/sec => ~ 1.7Gbps) so any benefit you would get would be limited to burst transfers out of the cache -- I would connect it to a 3Gbps port.
A hard drive benefits from being connected to a 6Gbps SATA port when the drive is capable of sustained transfers faster than a 3Gbps SATA port support.  
Depending how you use your computer, you may cause tiny amounts of data to be transferred to or from the drive (actually the cache attached to the drive) many, many times per second, so if you are doing some task that does thousands of tiny transactions with the drive per second you will save fractions of a second many times per second. Over the course of a working day this may add up, leaving a minute early and not missing your bus, potentially saving you 15 minutes to the next bus. 
I just formatted my SSD, install the new Windows and try to answer this question after I known my mainboard support SATA 6gb/s. Here is the difference of SATA 6Gb/s (above) and SATA 3Gb/s (below) on Samsung Evo 850.
