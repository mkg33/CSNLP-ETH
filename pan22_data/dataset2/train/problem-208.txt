I'm getting to the point of uneasiness and necessary professionalism that I want to do this thing right. Instead of simply copying files into a chroot environment, I think I want to re-build a new VPS from scratch to get rid of old cruft, make sure I configure the chroots properly, etc... 
Does this sound reasonable Do you folks have any suggestions as I move forward with this research and build? 
I'm wondering if its possible to configure yum to update everything in every chroot jail on the server. Chroot jails (and configuring them) are probably one of the things I'm least knowledgeable about in terms of operating web servers. 
I'm currently providing web hosting on a shared web hosting VPS environment - that has no chroot. This is obviously a big security concern, although I've made sure that only the owners of files can edit their own stuff. 
Have an instance of MySQL running on the root server to handle all databases. Postfix, etc... will obviously also run in the root environment. Then, don't even run apache on the root server, but have separate instances of it in each chroot jail for each user. Jails would also have separate instances of rssh (providing sftp/scp access), but nothing else.
