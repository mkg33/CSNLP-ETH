Due to having to support headphones and video over the same jack the pin outs are non-standard.  Swap the red and yellow connections on the TV to get correct video and stereo sound.  (Cables purchased from Apple for this purpose are marked correctly for the iPod.)
Well you would have to have some device that used the same method to transfer video.  That cable is just using one of the possible 3 channels on that cable for video. It still works for audio because it is using the other 2 channels like standard left and right channels of audio. 
I had one with 3 stripes for my D90, which enables direct playing of Video / Images from the camera directly to TV (the other end is RCA jack).
However, video iPods (but not iPhone or iPod-Touch) do support sending composite video out the headphone jack (and doc connector audio port) using the cable described.
The cable has a third terminal on the jack that is for a video signal.  I have the same thing and use it with my Zune whenever I'm traveling or at a friend's house.  Your audio port on your computer is likely not going to have a video signal coming out so video to a tv will be the s-video or vga route.
3.5mm Jack can be a bit strange. If you noticed, some of them have different numbers of black stripes on them. 1 stripe for Mono-Audio, 2 stripes for Stereo-Audio, 3 stripes for Video + Stereo-Audio (rare, and usually usable only for specific devices).
This is not a set standard that you will commonly find on 99% of computers. That cable will work with the orginal device it came with and maybe a few other devices that used that method of video transfer (Certain models of the iPod photo and video used this method to transfer audio and video through a 3.5)
Although the physical cable supports transmission of Video Signal, but normal headphone jack on your PC/Mac will only supports sending Stereo-Audio as they are designed for.
