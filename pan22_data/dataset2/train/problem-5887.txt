If they are not members of a domain (or you do not have privileges to active directory) then your task is harder. Let me know.
If the computers are not in a domain write your login script and put it in the Startup folder for the user.
Domain controllers have built-in support for a logon script.  There's tons of information out there on this and we'd need more information to guide you here.  (What software is your DC running?)  GPO is a better option if you are using a Windows Active Directory back end.
Are the computers members of a domain? If so, you can specify a startup batch (or vbs) file that will run every time the user logs on.
If they're on a domain, you can use GPO to set up printers, but we sometimes have print driver installation errors (no one can narrow down why, it's not supposed to happen).
Are the XP machines all in Active Directory? If so, check out this technet article "Creating logon scripts" for some pointers.
We've run batch files in the c:\documents and settings\all users\start menu\startup folder. Whatever is in that folder gets run by the user when they log in. Just stick the batch file in there. We used to add printers using AdPrintX (freeware) in a batch file using that method.
