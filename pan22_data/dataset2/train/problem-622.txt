I don't know anything about the firewall config and if you'll be able to alter it this way, but at least you'll have file-level access.
If you have installed the custom script extension, you may use it to disable or configure your firewall.
There is no way to run commands on an Azure VM from outside the VM itself; there also is no VM console access. This is a really big limit in Azure, unfortunately.
EDIT @massimo already answered this (and I didn't realize he covered the attach-disk solution). But, since I already typed this up, I'll leave the answer here, since it contains a bit more detail about attaching a disk from a locked-out VM...
To access your VM's disk if you're locked out, you can delete the Virtual Machine (but not delete the disk/vhd or any attached disks), which breaks the lease on the page blob holding the vhd. Then, you should be able to attach the vhd to a running Linux VM as an attached disk. At this point, you should be able to access the files on the disk.
Azure provides an extension to recover access to Linux VMs in many scenarios. Jointly with custom script, as @proteus mentioned, you should be able to fix this without recreating the VM.
If you accidentally lock yourself out of a VM, the only way to recover it is by downloading its virtual disk and running it on a local Hyper-V server, where you can get console access and fix whatever is wrong; or, if the problem can be fixed offline (f.e. by editing a configuration file), you can attach the disk to another Azure VM and work on it from there.
