The text is more compact (and eye pleasing especially for long class name) so rarely needs line wrap.
Put a space in front of one row ... since space is relatively wide, ruins the whole thing. Now you have to either space it several times, ... until widths again match, or ... it's a bad idea. There isn't even a discussion on this one.
Say you were to "draw a box" out of a smallest characters in the given font. And somehow managed to get it to line up.  
The vertical line-up is maintained with tab, which I defined as number of pixels. Adding a 'tabify' routine and using small tab-width (about 3 spaces) you can line up any block code neatly: not only at begining of line but multi-column struct or multi-line #define
It is possible to do many thing with variable spaced fonts, but history has shown, as well is the general opinion that it is a bad idea. Most editors aimed at programmers therefore don't allow you to use them, and rightly so.
I'm using a modified SciTE (windows) which make use of Scintilla (portable from source code) and have switched to proportionnal font after many years as monospace fan.
