1) Give the KDCs in krb5.conf instead of locating them via SRV records, and do not do realm mapping via DNS TXT records:
I was wondering if there's a way to set up SSH with Kerberos authentication without using a DNS server at all ?
I do not agree with the previous answer's claim that "compromise of the DNS infrastructure does not (directly) compromise the Kerberos infrastructure." Using SRV records to locate KDCs does not, since clients can authenticate the KDC (they share a secret with the KDC, or the KDC must present a valid certificate if PKINIT is used), and in any case a bogus KDC will just produce bogus tickets which won't work when used. But DNS name canonicalization and realm mapping can be hazards. A DNS spoofer can cause a client to acquire a ticket for a different service than the one it intends to contact (by changing the hostname portion of a "hostbased service" name, the most common) -- perhaps a service whose keys the attacker has previously compromised. Similar comments apply to realm mapping, though it's harder to take advantage of misleading the client regarding the realm.
2) Make sure all your hostname->address and reverse mappings are in your /etc/hosts file, and perhaps just disable the use of DNS for gethostbyname() etc. in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
But if standard DNS is a security problem for you, maybe you can take a look at DNSSEC: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions 
Kerberos will not work correctly unless the hosts can resolve each other properly.  This is almost always done with a DNS server.  Theoretically, however, it could be done by distributing a hosts file around to each machine that is going to be part of the Kerberos domain.  This is almost certainly not what you want to be doing.
