I had this same error. My issue was that I accidentally installed another instance of DNN to the same SQL database. I restored a backup of my database to a new database then pointed the config file to the new database. Then both instances worked great.
I found that my file was actually named index.html.txt even though it was displaying index.html prior to checking the above setting.
I've had this issue before - I had to set the username and password in again at Anonymous Authentication and it worked perfectly. You can also switch on Detailed errors at Error Pages in IIS to give more info.
I have added a folder with a page in it in the \inetpub\wwwroot directory. The full path to the page is then C:\inetpub\wwwroot\folder\file.html.
I have restarted the services but if I navigate to localhost/folder/file.html I get a 404 file not found error.
For anyone that run into this and don't find the other suggestions effective, also check that Windows is displaying file name extensions. Open Windows Explorer, click "View" in the top bar and then check "File name extensions".
In the IIS Connections pane, click on the Sites node and check the Status column on the right. In my case, the Default Web Site was stopped and was giving me 404 error.
I have just installed IIS on Windows Server 2008. If I go to localhost, the default page is displayed, so the web server is ok.
