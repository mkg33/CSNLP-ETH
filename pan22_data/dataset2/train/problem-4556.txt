On the server side, I've edited named.conf (I had a local view, so I created a public one: match-clients and match-destinations set to any) to include the new zone and created the zone file. After the setup I've tried digging the address of the nameservers, but I keep getting (normal dig, without @ returns info of the domain, without the IP of the ns):
The domain in question is currently parked on another server, because I'm in the process of migrating the server.
I have a CentOS based VPS, which I've started setting up to use it's own nameservers. The domain is registered elsewhere, and I've already registered the nameservers with my registrar.
Is the reason the dig command can't find the address connected with the fact that my domain is still parked elsewhere? Or have I misconfigured something?
Another possibility that springs into my mind. My named.conf has the statement option listen-on set to port 53 on 127.0.0.1. The allow-query was set to localhost, but I've already changed that to any.
