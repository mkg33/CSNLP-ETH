Cloning: I create VMs so I can clone them - always promote to a DC after cloning. Sysprep (or any other tools used to regenerate SIDs) destroys domain controllers. You only want to clone without running sysprep in an isolated environment (e.g. a lab manager fence).
You can configure your ESX hosts to use NTP for time updates, and within your DC's have the vmware tools sync their time with the ESX host.
We've had virtualized DC's for years now.  I'd recommend using at least two physical hosts setup with ESX and configured with DRS.  Within DRS set up a rule to prevent the two VM's (I'm assuming you have a PDC and BDC) from running on the same host.  If your hosts are already clustered with DRS enabled just setup the DRS rule.
Yes, it can be done, I have done it and it works well. You do need to take some things into account when doing it. This KB article provides a good guide to these considerations.
Yes, it can be virtualized, no we didn't run into any problems (VMWare ESX & VMWare Server 2), and in my experience, it's pretty much the same as running the DC on a physical server.
It's been a little over a month since I replace our physical DC with a virtual.  Utilization is typically VERY low, and it hasn't had a single issue.  On an unrelated call into MS virtualization support, I asked a few question, and they didn't have any warnings or caveats to throw at me.
