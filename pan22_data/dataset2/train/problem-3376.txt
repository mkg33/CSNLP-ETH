I recently had a new home constructed, and went from the CAT6a of my previous home to whole-house fiber, and provided you have it done during construction it doesn't actually cost much more at all.
I would definitely recommend fiber for in-wall use, the bandwidth is outstanding, and then CAT6/7 for out-of-wall wiring/simply P2P connections where bandwidth isn't the biggest concern, or you're otherwise limited to where 16-32Gbit/sec doesn't benefit (i.e. transferring files from a PC to a simple 2-Drive NAS with RAID1, you will not see any benefit from fiber). However, if you have some serious hardware and need access to large data NOW, nothing beats it (i.e. my basement server room; a single 36-drive RAID60 array buffered by 2 IODrive Fusion-IO 2.4TB PCIe SSD's can push a LOT of bandwidth, and FC was a MUCH cheaper option than trying to go with copper 10GbitEthernet + switches/hubs running everywhere, in fact is was about 1/2 the price overall).
From what I can understand, Cat 6e does not actually exist but a number of manufacturers are selling some cable labeled as Cat 6e.  Some sources say that Cat 6e is just Cat 6a but the manufacturers just added a few extra things to "improve" on it (like shielding I think?).  And some say that it's actually some knock off Cat 5e.
I asked for Cat 6a but I got Cat 6e instead.  How can I tell if this cable is legit Cat 6 (10 Gbps)?
