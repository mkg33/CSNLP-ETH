For each "Some Name" <some@address.com> pair you want to use, you need to repeat the following three steps:
(Just to be explicit: you don't need to edit the EmailAddresses array or the FullUserName key at all when using the above method.)
Under MailAccounts there are a few Item dictionaries, from 0 to 2 in my case. Expand the one that contains the EmailAddresses key (Item 2 for me).
You need to create a new key called EmailAliases as a sibling of EmailAddresses (i.e. at the same level on the plist tree), if it doesn't already exist. (It probably won't since Mail.app doesn't have an interface to create these aliases AFAIK.) Make it a type Array.
Be careful to put all the items in the correct tree levels. The name and alias keys are siblings, the key names have to be lowercase, and their values must not have quotes around them.
~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist in a property list editor (I used Xcode's built-in one). Be sure to close Mail first and make a backup of the plist file.
Save the plist when you're done and restart Mail. The "From" dropdown in the new message window should now contain the name/address alias pairs you just created. If they don't, recheck the structure. I've confirmed this method to work in Mail.app for OS X 10.7.1.
