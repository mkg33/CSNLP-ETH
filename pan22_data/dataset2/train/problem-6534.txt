This kind of problem can occur if the disk subsystem is not available due to a RAID controller failure or hard disk failure.  Binaries and libraries which are still in memory/disk cache can still be run but any other binary fails with IO errors or other fatal errors.  If the reboot binary is still runnable then reboot -fn will force an immediate warm boot of the system.  If  the hardware is still functional you should be back in about 5-10 minutes, otherwise the system will be offline until someone can physically get to it to repair/replace it.
Otherwise the only think I know of is issuing commands directly to init using telinit, but I thought that that was what shutdown and reboot both basically did anyway.
The runlevel command returns 5.  Any other options for getting this server to reboot?  This is a remote machine, so I don't want to just shut it down if I can avoid that.  
I am trying to reboot because of a journal abort on /, so / is read-only.  Most commands now return 'bus error'
From the description is sounds like you may have a serious hardware issue that will prevent you from being able to reboot, as the commends you've given should have done the job for you already.
Kyle, I'm not quite sure if this is what you're looking for (since it's like pressing the reset button), but this has helped me in situations where a server refused to reboot:
I would try to gracefully kill important processes, remount all your filesystems read-only, and yank the power.  
Sounds to me like the binaries that would be running the shutdown are all corrupted.  What does init 0 do?  
When trying to reboot a Linux server I got the typical 'System going down for reboot now', but the server has not rebooted.  I have tried:
