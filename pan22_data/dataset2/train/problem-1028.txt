I have the unfortunate task of debugging a large Microsoft Word document that has unwanted page breaks after some paragraphs. The spaces in question previously contained an image, but remained after the image was removed. The "show/hide formatting characters" button shows nothing out of the ordinary, the paragraph settings don't have anything unusual in them, and there are no manual break (^m) characters in the document. I have noticed what appears to be a hidden table however.
Has anybody experienced this problem before? Is it a table that has been embedded in the document? Most importantly, how do I delete this unwanted page break?
If I start with the cursor immediately at the end of the paragraph before the break, and press the right arrow key, it jumps to the beginning of the paragraph after the break, and the delete and backspace keys will not delete the object. However, if I double click in the middle of the break, it will display a cursor centered in the page and allow me to type. Additionally, if I click the button that draws a border around the current object, it will draw a border around the line of text like you would see with a table cell. When I have the cursor in this cell though, Word does not display any table editing options, and I have no way of selecting the border around the object and deleting it.
