You can use Ethan Gardner's pngquant script to convert a photoshop file to alpha-tx PNG. It works on Mac and PC. 
I'm using Photoshop Creative Cloud 2015 (for PC, I don't know if there is any difference on Mac) and there is a choice to 
There aren't a whole lot of options to adjust from here, but if you select PNG-8 format it will automatically use full (or what appears to be full) alpha transparency in a PNG-8 format. Mileage may vary depending on image size and number of colors as to whether or not the result will actually be smaller than a regular PNG-24. On average the images I have been working with have resulted in about 1/3 final file size when compared to a PNG-24 of the same image.
NOTE: Check that the image mode is NOT indexed (lock icon on the layer) as I was not able to get the alpha transparency to work otherwise. I used RGB mode with successful results.
look at right side there is a drop down after Preset you'll find there PNG 8 there are some option related to transparency,just check them out. 
This is an important subject, especially for web design. A big png24 image can be ~1mb, almost impossible to consider for web site design use. But same image as png8 with alpha is ~250kb, ok in a lot of situations.
And finally a drag-and-drop solution for png8 with alpha transparency, free as of 2013 04: http://tinypng.org/
If you're on a Mac, you can use the excellent (and free) ImageAlpha tool to do this to a PNG-32 using a GUI, live preview, etc.
