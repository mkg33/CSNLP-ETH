If you can physically touch the drives, you should be able to determine which one is clicking, since the click is (I believe?) caused by the motor moving the head to the end of the platter repeatedly. 
If you can get at the drives, and the clicking sound is quite regular you can place your hand on top of the drive and often feel when the click occurs in one drive or the other.

An old back-woods mechanic trick can come in handy for this kind of thing. I once saw an old mechanic old a long straight stick hard against the palm of his hand and then press his knuckle up against his ear. He placed the other end of the stick on parts of the engine and could hear which cylinder was not firing correctly. Wood conducts sound well if it has no gap air gap to jump. If your old enough you might remember in movies a cowboy putting his ear to the train track to tell if a train is coming or the Indian listening to the ground to hear the buffalo. The same principle applies here. As crazy as this sounds you can use it to track down the clicking sound, give it a try.
Poor man's stethoscope:  Long'ish screwdriver. Tip on the drive, handle on your ear. Listen to each drive. If either clicks you should be able to quickly isolate it.
