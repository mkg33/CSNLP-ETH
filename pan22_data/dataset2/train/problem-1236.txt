I've Googled around, and from that, I've checked /etc/mail/aliases (there's some in there, but this is mainly used for Blackberry forwarding as it seems incomplete) and virtusertable (empty) and from what I can tell, mail is delivered to local users.  However, there's a lot of local UNIX users in there and by the date modified, I'm guessing a bunch are old.
Depending on your software your logs are a good place to find the ids that are really being used.  It also depends on how long you keep your mail logs.  A little scripting magic and you should be able to get counts by email id. 
Surely there must be another localpart (email address) to local user mapping somewhere or a better way to tell what email addresses are active (or at least, functioning; I can handle some inactive ones as missing some would be worse, obviously).
The various alias files are for redirecting delivery.  Many aliases are for required ids like abuse and postmaster, or system ids like root to which many alias may point.  You will want to filter out the system ids, and configure the required ids in your new server.  
Normally privileged accounts (UID < 500 or 1000) shouldn't be receiving email.  Other than that any id acceptable to your authentication system should be valid.  Try running getent passwd to get a list of users.
Sendmail usually uses the standard mail.log file to log message deliveries. Once you have found the appropriate logs it shouldn't be too difficult to select and pars the delivery messages.
i've seen instances in *nix distribs where there exist both /etc/aliases and /etc/mail/aliases - and the latter is not actually used (nor a link to /etc/aliases). can't hurt to see if /etc/aliases exists and may have more info in it...
