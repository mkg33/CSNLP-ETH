There are no major issues with Windows 7 i have found. Its quite different from XP tho which takes a little getting used to-like the new look control panel.
The drives do get assigned different letters than what you are used to, putting the Windows 7 disk as C: which can be confusing to start with. As long as you name your partitions its not a problem. I simply assigned the Windows 7 partition the name Windows 7, which appears no matter which letter its been assigned. Makes keeping track of which HDD easier.
The boot manager installed with Win7 will call XP "Earlier version of Windows" and Win7 will be the default boot OS.  To change the boot manager config, you'll have to use bcdedit (installed with Windows 7):
This feature can make the Windows folder expand to many tens of Gigs (i.e. my 8 month-old Vista install has a 25gig Windows folder). 
In Vista, there are a couple of folders which continue to swell as they accumulate different versions of dlls installed by your programs. This is for compatibility reasons and was likely carried over to Windows 7, although I have not confirmed this. 
To my knowledge there isn't anything too significant you should watch for as long as you don't let windows 7 wipe out your main hard disk.
As for dual booting, this video is really good (if somewhat in depth at times). Take you from XP to Windows 7 and what you NEED to do: http://edge.technet.com/Media/Dual-Boot-Between-Windows-XP-and-Windows-7/#Page=2]
I currently have a windows XP machine and two internal hard drives.  I want to dual boot with Windows 7 on the second drive.  I'll have the license for it in August.  This will not be the release candidate.
