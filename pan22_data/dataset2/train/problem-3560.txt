Your code is begging for the use of the Chain Of Responsibility patern (or rather, a variation of it).
Besides all the other useful answers, I would suggest splitting up the password validation from the HTML generation. You could define an enum with values for the different types of errors + success and return one of those. Then you can easily write some unit tests to verify the correct behaviour of this method. Finally a separate method would call the validation routine and then generate the appropriate HTML.
In fact, I would personally go for an even more sophisticated approach that also separates the types of results to make changes to the logic even easier. But this might be over-engineering it at this point. You get the idea.
What you have is a bunch of requirements, which each need to be met, in order for the password to be appropriate. In Java8 this would be done with Functions, but, let's use an interface for the moment:
Don't return strings like that. The logic should be separate from the representation. So do something like
