I have managed to setup a squid proxy server as an HTTP proxy and this is working well. However, it does not work with HTTPS. I am looking at making use of an external machine to setup as a proxy for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc. I took a long and hard look at what might help on the internet. I think a SOCKS proxy will work to both secure my data (from the internet connections I use while traveling) and conceal my changing location.
However the rkthkr's answer contains a much more flexible solution, speaking of compression, encryption standards, and so on. In case of firewalls, try to change the protocol to TCP and the port to 443 (https). Encrypted traffic through 443 is normal.
But a proxy will not "secure your data" in any way because the connection between you and the proxy is not securised.
Is the SOCKS proxy route the best to take for HTTPS, FTP and IM? Are there any recommended SOCKS proxy software that I can download and setup on windows/linux servers? Will a VPN server be a better choice?
In that case I assume that proper knowledge how to setup an own OpenVPn solution is not present. Therefore one might recommend Hamachi or other very easy tools, that ease the setup process.
If you connect from untrusted point (wifi access) to internet and don't want to directly access some ressource for security reason you have to use a VPN to a reliable server then use it as a proxy. With this the connection between you and the proxy will be securized.
