B) You can actually get apache to to not only proxy requests to your internal-apache, but also rewrite the response body before it will be transmitted to your users. (Normally a proxy only rewrites HTTP headers/responses). mod_substitute in apache 2.2. I haven't tested if it stacks well with mod_proxy, but maybe the following works:
Five) Sometimes developers are completely clueless and have their applications not only generate absolute URL's but even include the hostname part in their URL's and the resulting HTML code looks like this: <img src=http://internal-apache.test.com/icons/logo.png>. 
Three)  One and two are often unlikely to happen... If you're lucky the internal app only uses two or three subdirectories and those are unused on your main site, simply write a bunch of ProxyPass lines:
A) You can use combo solution of a split horizon DNS and scenario 4. Both internal and external users use the internal-apache.test.com address, but your internal DNS points directly to the ip-address of internal-apache.test.com's  server. For external users the public record for internal-apache.test.com points to the ip-address of your public webserver and you can then use solution 4.
