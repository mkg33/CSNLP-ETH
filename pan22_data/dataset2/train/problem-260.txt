You can check this out http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/ you get so many thing to create Live CD as well your own server or desktop cd you create 
The Ubuntu documentation has some howtos on how to create an Ubuntu Live CD. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
My goal is to create a Linux Live CD/DVD for a reasonably new (less than 2 years old) PC (not Mac). When booted in Linux, the System will be used for "general" computing tasks like web browsing, word processing, and audio/video playback. This is neither a gaming machine, nor a development environment. The PC has a CD/DVD burner.
It's been a few years since I've created a Linux LiveCD, so I thought I'd ask this community for some best practices before I make my next attempt.
There even are tools that do this online. You select what should be placed on the CD/DVD, and the system makes an image for you to download: http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2006/02/create-custom-linux-distribution.html
Check out the openSUSE Build Service's KIWI program, which makes it easy to build your own openSUSE-based LiveCD/DVD. Currently, all the official install media for openSUSE is built using KIWI.
