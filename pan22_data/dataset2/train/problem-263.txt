I dont see anything in the comments suggesting that you look into udev and its rules which should install eth0. On my system, in /etc/udev/rules.d/75-network-devices.rules, I have the following;
You may also want to try ls /etc/init.d | grep eth and see if there is anything in the init as an artifact that ETH0 was ever there. The above is what use in Gentoo, I think Ubuntu uses a different mechanism but its worth a shot.
I had a similar problem.  By running ifconfig -a, I determined that the only network devices on my computer were p4p1 and lo.  There was no eth0.
In general if you don't see your network interface, it's either that it has a different name (like eth1 instead of eth0) or it doesn't have its driver loaded. When I had similar problem, I was able to fix them by either adjusting /etc/interfaces or by modprobe .
Back in Ubuntu 6.06 I had an issue like this, I ended clearing the CMOS on the MB and somehow it solved my problem. That's a stab in the dark though.
So I edited /etc/network/interfaces, replacing all instances of eth0 with p4p1.  The file's contents are now:
