Evan mentioned "Unbind File and Print Sharing for Microsoft Networks from the box's NIC". This is the method I would choose. In fact on servers with extra NICs (e.g. Hyper-V servers) I routinely unbind the server and workstation services to stop that NIC being used for file/print stuff.
then restart the server to make sure no files are locked by users, then you can begin copying files over
What's the best way to temporarily disable the Windows 2003 File Sharing service(s)?  Sorta like the equivalent to shutting down Samba on a Linux box.
In the Network Connections click the Advanced menu then Advanced Settings. Choose the network interface and untick File and Printer sharing. Tick it again to turn the fps back on.
every share has a separate set of permissions on the share itself.  open up compmgmt.msc and then look for "shares" under "shared folders", right-click on the share, choose "properties", then uncheck everything in the "share permissions" tab, effectively taking away everyone's ability to see any files in their mapped drive.
