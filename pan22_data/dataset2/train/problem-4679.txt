Ok, if your user is local "root" on that machine he can do anything on that machine. Blocking "su -" would not really prevent anything. "su -" trumps everything, it is inherently local.
I would classify this as a 'security exploit' between the relationship of the Linux 'client' system(s) and FreeIPA.  Though not necessarily a 'bug' it DOES expand the local root accounts ability beyond that of the local O/S instance (which it should 'not').
Please check Simo Sorce's answer in a related Bugzilla, it pretty nicely summarizes Linux security model and what you can or cannot do as a local root:
The repetitive statements that this issue is all about UNIX and how it works is incorrect.  Though a 'root' account has the ability to create a localized version of any account ID and 'su' to it,  the use of FreeIPA permits the local root account to obtain and access resources existing externally to the local instance (though specifically configured 'not' to be available to it).
For something you want to accomplish you need to design your HBAC rules against service called 'su-'. The main thing here is no user account should have local root on the boxes.
That IS an issue with the FreeIPA implementation, permitting the local "root" account to escape its boundaries...
