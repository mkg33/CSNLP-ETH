Under the web GUI for Logs..Syslog..Settings there appears to be settings for "Message Generation: Enable" and also "Severity Mapping" that might be able to silence or downgrade alerts.
The management card obediently sent me two emails to tell me about this: one that the test had failed, and one that told me I have a faulty battery.
According to my email server logs, these are emails being generated by the management card -- they are not stuck or looping somehow in my email systems.
It is starting to bother the on-call guy.  Now I can turn email notification off, but that sort of defeats the purpose of having it.  
The problem is,  every two minutes since then, it has sent me the same two emails.  The device logs imply that the tests are not constantly re-running, so it looks like this is some kind of alert that needs to be cleared or acknowledged.
I'm not onsite and so can't get into our Symmetra UPS at the moment to check the settings but I've seen this before.
You can either turn off the alerting for that event (don't have to do so for everything) or simply increase the re-alarm rate to something longer, say 60 mins.
So does anyone know how to make it stop?  Ideally without having to go in (since this is the holidays) or powering it off (there's stuff plugged into it for a reason).
So last night, I had an automatic weekly self-test run.  The test failed, claiming I have at least one failed battery:
