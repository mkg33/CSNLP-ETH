It does not have to be a problem related to sockets. Try connecting to MySQL from a simple PHP script:
If you don't want to muck about with config settings for either mysql or php, then set up this hack:
For your PHP.ini path, look in phpinfo(); for "Loaded Configuration File". It does not have to be located in /etc/php.ini.default
Simply creating the /etc/my.cnf file with contents and creating the directory, per Vikash's recommendation, did not solve the problem. mysql.sock still was living in /tmp, even after doing this and restarting the machine. I manually moved the file from /tmp to /var/mysql, and then the error resolved. I had a feeling, though, that upon restart the problem would resurface, and it did. This time the error was slightly different - connection denied. I found that a new socket had been opened in /tmp and the old one was still there in /var/mysql; the code was trying to use the old one and getting denied access. So I used Sid's hack with the symlink and that fixed the problem. I'm sure when I restart, this fix will still work. However, I'd love to know what is causing the system to open new sockets in /tmp instead of the configured /var/mysql.
