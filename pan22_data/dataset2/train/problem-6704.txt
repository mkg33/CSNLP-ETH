But still the interface is not shown in the interface list. So I assumed that the drivers are not installed in the system and tried to install them from the CD that they have provided. When I try to make the source file it gives out and error saying 
I've also found that similar issues have been occurred previous also but its disappointing to see them unanswered. If anyone can help me with solving this issue i'd be really grateful. 
This network card is ancient and the sundance driver is no longer supported in EL7. The drivers given by the network card vendor are for a much older version of the kernel and are unlikely to work on modern systems. Just go get a $10 gigabit NIC, before you have spent much more than $10 in labor costs trying to make this work.
I have plugged in a separate network card named TF-3200 to the PCI port. I also have ensured that the card is detected by using lspci command and it gives,
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -O -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -I/usr/include  -DUSE_IO_OPS  -D_COMPAT_WITH_OLD_KERNEL  -c -o sundance_main.o sundance_main.c
