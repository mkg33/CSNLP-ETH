It doesn't matter whether the page is accessed over http or https - it fails to load either way. Every other page on the site, as far as I can tell, works fine for them. Not only that, the same users can load that specific page fine in Firefox.
Is there any way to get IE to give the user more information than just "cannot display the web page"? There's a "More information" button, but all it tells you is to make sure that your DNS servers are working, make sure you're not working offline, etc. :(
Personally, this is the point where I'd crack out either Fiddler or Wireshark to see the actual request / response that is being delivered to the server. IE can be next to useless in terms of telling you what's going on (IE9 is better with the dev tools), so proxying the request or packet sniffing is the only way forward.
