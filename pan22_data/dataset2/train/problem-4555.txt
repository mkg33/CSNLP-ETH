I have a specific purpose for this setup. In the event of a staff member deciding it would be better to start moving company data to other non company owned equipment (which has happened before) I need to be able to lock down the device. This can be done in theory with an iOS device through "Find my iPhone", but the problem is all that this app will do is lock the device down with the current user pin number which the staff member already knows.
I have an SBS2008 Standard server running Exchange 2007 and all the bells and whistles it comes with. Lately we have been adding a few iOS devices such as iPads and iPhones.
Although I have some control over these devices through EMC (remote wipe and such) I don't have as much control as I would like. I also run Blackberry Server which looks after all of the BBs on the network which gives awesome control over these devices.
My question is, how would I somehow get Mac Mail Server to link up with the host Exchange Server to pass emails/OAB to the iOS devices?
OR would I be able to keep the iOS devices attached to the EX2007 system, but somehow still use the Apple Profile Manager to push profile settings to the devices?
What I am trying to do is to run Mac OSX Lion server as a virtual machine (licensing aside). I have the machine working and server running.
