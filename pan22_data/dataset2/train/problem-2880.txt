You should use wireshark to inspect the data. If your application uses a standard encryption scheme (like ssl/tls), you should see the whole handsake process. 
If you have a contract with the application developers/company, you should ask them if and what kind of encryption they used.
Use a packet sniffer such as Wireshark to view the network traffic.  You can run the packet sniffer on either the client or the server.  If the application is using SSL, Wireshark should be able to tell show you what cipher was chosen by the SSL handshake.  However, if the protocol uses its own encryption scheme, you can't really tell how secure the encryption really is â€” it could be as secure as AES or as flimsy as repeated XOR with a fixed key.
If all you see is random binary data, it is very hard to know what it is. With an unknown software, you cannot easily distinguish between compressed or encrypted data (both look like random binary garbage), and you will have to use other means to figure it out (hard, expensive). 
I am not a technican person, can you help me to find out if communication between client and server is encrypted?
