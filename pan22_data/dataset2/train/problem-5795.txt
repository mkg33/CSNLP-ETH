Launchy will give you very easy single-keystroke launching of applications. Regarding the command line things have got a lot better in terms of funtionality with XP SP3, Vista and 7. From my somewhat limited experience of the Linux prompt it seems that Linux works that way from the ground up, whereas Windows has always been a GUI and any command line functionality was largely a hangover from MS-DOS days. But now there's a 'headless' version of Windows Server it'll have to get a lot stronger in this respect.
Think of Windows as a superset of Linux, because that's basically what it is:  All the techniques and utilities you use in Linux will translate directly if you use the same programs.
Various Linux GUIs have one or more of these abilities, but you cannot rely on them across various Linux installations.  On the other hand, you can always do these things in any modern Windows (eg since Windows 2000), so you are free to focus on the problem at hand.
I have a similar issue the other way around- these tools and other customisations are a reason I don't use Linux regularly. I'll get to learn some day.
The one thing that I would recommend with it though is running the rxvt terminal window instead of the normal command line window.  That way you get better copy and paste support and also a more familiar, x-win like shell window.
I have found that the cygwin toolkit is invaluable on windows.  It gives you a nice linux like shell on top of the windows os.  
On the other hand, Windows provides many new and rich shortcuts and techniques not available in Linux.  Some of my favorites are:
First things first: Download PowerShell. It still won't be better than bash, but it's better than the abomination that is cmd.exe
