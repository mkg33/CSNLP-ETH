You can see the system yourself on my etoys website. I hadn't considered selling it but if it looks like something you'd like to use I'm sure we could work something out.
In theory, any web hosting service can provide access to files, be it HTTP, FTP, SSH or other protocols. The services you use add simple simple announcement messages that package the process. Any web server with enough space and reasonable upload policy can provide the basic functionality - you may have to handle the announcements yourself.
Sorry to respond to such a dated question... but I stumbled upon this randomly and have looked at solution called masstransit.  It does what you are saying... but it also has a bunch of other features.  Not sure if it's the right fit though.
Accellion makes an appliance that can be deployed on your own virtual infrastructure, in Amazon's cloud, as well as selling hardware units to perform the same function.
After messing with FTP and getting fed up with it being plain text security and having issues with various FTP clients thanks to an open ended spec I finally just created my own file management system. Basically I log into a site which shows a list of my files, I click create new archive and load up a silverlight client that uploads the file to the server. I can then create download tickets which are direct links to the file and allow me to send the links to whomever needs the file. The system also has some minor archiving functionality where I can upload an updated file under the same archive and all download tickets will point to the new file.
