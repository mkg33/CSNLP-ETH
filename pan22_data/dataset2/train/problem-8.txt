This is a known issue with Win 10 if you have older VPN software installed like Cisco or in my case Junos. What worked for me was to uninstall the VPN and reboot. However the articles out there suggest registry editing:
Go into Device Manager and see if the driver is installed under the Network Adapters category. In device manager you can also check if the driver is disabled or not. You can open Device manager by following these steps, or you can search for devmgmt.msc in the search bar from the Start Menu. 
PS: If you want to create a wifi hotspot (when your wireless adapter is working properly), try the following command in Command Prompt
However I got the "registry key not found so I unstalled the VPN, reboot and wifi is back. Next I installed a new version from Win 10 store and everything works great!
Now it can associate with WiFi AP securely but it still fails to get an IP address... well, at least something.
I had similar situation where the network drivers and the hardware were fine (Device Manager listed all network adapters and Linux used the network just fine, but there was no network in Windows 10 and no Network Connections in network settings). My guess is that I had Cisco AnyConnect VPN installed in Windows 8.1 and then upgraded to Windows 10 where it all got messed up.
The first time it failed and gave many errors. Then I tried netcfg -d command again and then it was successful (bizarrely). 
I have had same issues but got it resolved. Always turn off the wifi of PC/Laptop before shutdown. Whenever PC/Laptop is again started wifi adaptor will be available under network adaptor tab. Switch on Wifi and search for required wifi network.
