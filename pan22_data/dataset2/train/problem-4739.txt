Alright, I have been unable to find a solution to this problem anywhere else online, so please bear with me: 
I was following this tutorial https://www.sunfounder.com/wiki/index.php?title=How_to_Use_an_RFID_RC522_on_Raspberry_Pi
Puzzling because the changes in config.txt were to deal with HDMI display issues (trying to get a 5" monitor to work).  Once restored to the original config.txt, WiFi resumed working normally without any change hardware or software change.
I have a new Raspberry Pi Model 2B which came with a wifi dongle (Ralink RT5370) and when I fired it up with the pre-installed Raspbian, the wifi worked correctly.  I also bought a mini HDMI screen for the pi which wouldn't work without installing the driver from a DVD shipped with the screen.  After installing the driver, the screen works well, but now my wifi stopped working.  The light on the dongle does not turn on anymore and I am unable to scan for wireless networks.  
As a side note, I have triple-checked that my network information is correct and that the wifi network is discoverable from other computers, so I doubt that the problem is on that end.  I am at a point where I really have no idea where or what my problem could be.  I have tried downloading wifi managers, that didn't work.  I have rebooted, updated, and upgraded my software versions repeatedly, that didn't work.  I have tried altering and/or removing lines from the above files, that didn't work.  I consistently am unable to scan for wireless networks (Note: ethernet works fine) despite successfully connecting to networks before installing this screen driver! If anyone has any idea what my problem might be and how to fix it, I would be extremely grateful.  Thanks! 
And when I run sudo ifdown wlan0 && sudo ifup wlan0 to see if the network is reachable, I get the following output:
After some searching on Google, I have determined that the dongle is recognized (it is listed when I run lsusb), its module is installed (the module rt2800usb is listed when I run lsmod), and the firmware seems to be installed (I ran ifconfig -a and it displays wlan0 information).  However, when I run iwlist wlan0 scan, I get the output:
I have tried editing both /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf according to various examples online to no avail.  Here are my current versions:
