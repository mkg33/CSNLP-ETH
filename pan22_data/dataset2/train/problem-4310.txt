It's a few days now the network can be very slow for some time, then it's back to normal, then slow again. I installed wireshark to find out the reason, but I'm new to this and still trying to find my way, reading howtos and so on.
My home network consists of mostly linux clients, two to three windows clients, some android devices, six routers and five raspberries running servers: dhcp, bind, nfs-kernel-server, samba and the likes.
At the moment I'm trying to find out how to filter for just requests for one IP, to see if the device stops asking after/if getting an answer, but as I said: I'm new to this, as in: installed it said 20 minutes ago and still reading the wiki...
Any help more than welcome. (I'm pretty sure I have no loop in my network cables, and I do not even succeed in telling my wlan clients to bind to one specific router, so I rather doubt I have devices connecting to two routers at once, as I read in another question...)
Right now I'm capturing traffic, and the first thing that catches my eye is a LOT of arp requests. Maybe not a "flood", since it's just about 230.000 in 20? minutes, but multiple requests from the same IP about the same IP. 
As I said, I run a simple local DNS-server on a raspberry, along with a DHCP-server, and I changed a couple addresses about three days ago. Since all of the asking devices are constantly running, surely they should have updated their arp-tables by now, shouldn't they?
As it seems, about every router/raspberry in the net is asking the same thing over and over again. Surely by now they should be up to date?
