So how do I categorize such a spreadsheet to achieve the described format? The spreadsheet contains about 150 rows and 8 departments.
You can also add a secondary sort, so the names are alphabetical within the department, but to make that work the initials would need to be in a separate column, like here:
Probably the only thing that you need to do to get your pivot table to work is to change the datatype on your telephone column from number (or general) to string.  This is also a good trick for preserving leading zeros in things like zipcodes.
However, my manager has asked me to make a print friendly version so he can print and hang the list at certain locations.
Extracting the initial can easily be done with the Text-to-Columns function, if you select "delimited" with " " (space) as the delimiter.
I tried using a pivot table for this. It went OK until I tried to add the contact details as values. It then gave me the sum(?) of the value in the cell instead of simply the value.
I am using Excel to generate a list of people working in the company containing information about the employees relevant for our department.
On screen the list works great. We can filter by department or function and just do general CTRL+F searches.
If you sort the spreadsheet by column B (Department), the rows will be re-ordered so all people in the same department are listed together. That will give you your desired print format. The only other thing you may want to do is to insert header rows with the department names.
