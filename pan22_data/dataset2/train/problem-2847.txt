This corresponds to a vector colouring in the obvious way; e.g., the vertex at the North pole is coloured with the vector (0,0,1).
The Grötsch graph has 3 types of nodes. A single degree 5 nodes (at North). Five degree 4 nodes (on the Northern hemisphere, equidistant to N, you can make out 3 of them). Five degree 3 nodes (on the Southern hemisphere, equidistant to N, you can make out 3 of them).
N is connected to its 5 neighbours on the Southern hemisphere with green edges. (Note that the green edge looks as if it is incident on the degree 4-vertices on the Northern hemisphere, but that’s an artefact of the embedding.)
If my calculations are to be believed, all neighbouring vertices are at more than 120 degrees from each other, so this constitutes a valid vector 3-colouring. The Grötzsch graph is 4-chromatic. 11 vertices, 20 edges. I’m particularly happy about this example because the vector colouring is in 3 dimensions, to you can visualise it. (And draw random hyperplanes in order to explain the KMS graph colouring algorithm.)
Viewed from the top, you can make out the pentagram described by the degree 4 nodes, similar to Lovasz’ embedding of $C_5$ in the plane:
