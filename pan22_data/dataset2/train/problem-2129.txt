I have no fix for the HP, but the Acer problem went away with the latest (1.22A) version of the BIOS.  A multithreaded make on the Acer that took almost exactly 10 minutes on the 1.15 version of the BIOS now takes between 12 and 13 minutes, but never seems to fail any more.  I think the new BIOS may be enabling memory throttling (since the hot spots on the bottom of the laptop are where the hard drive and the memory are located).
There is a sensor on most laptops that senses when the lid is closed.  I have seen that sensor fail and it leads the OS to believe that the lid is shut and so it does what the OS is set to do.
I would say you've taken the right approach so far with cleaning the dust out and adding extra ventilation. I think heat may still be the cause of your problem. Try downloading one of those free programs that monitors the temperature of your CPU. Keep an eye on it and see if the temperature increases dramatically until it shuts itself off. I did this and I saw that my laptop is hitting over 170F right before it crashes out, so I'm assuming I need more cooling options.
I have seen the same problem in an HP 17" workstation (2.93 GHz Lynnfield processor) and an Acer Aspire 4730Z 14" laptop.  I get a non-specific power failure error log message (possibly a thermal shutdown?) and it usually occurs with multithreaded makes.  I can avoid the problem by exposing the bottom of the laptop to a window unit air conditioner.
I believe I'm experiencing the same issue as you. In response to the other answers referring to the settings for your lid being closed, I am assuming that is not the issue. With my laptop, I have specifically turned off the option for turning off when the lid is closed and I STILL experience this problem.
