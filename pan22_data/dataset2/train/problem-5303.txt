Does anyone know the peculiarities of Linux networking, such that I can repair that which obviously requires repair?
Recently I decided to subnet. I changed LAN1 to 192.168.64.80/255.255.255.240. This gave me x.x.x.80 as the gateway, 14 usable IP's as x.x.x.81-x.x.x.94, which is plenty, and x.x.x.95 as broadcast. I then rebooted the router and the new IP's were propagated via DHCP. Windows networking received the DHCP data and I could access LAN1 and the Internet with no problems. Tried the same with Linux and can't access anything on LAN1 or the Internet. Consulting both the network applet on the desktop, and ifconfig via terminal, it was clear that Linux was aware of the new DHCP data. So I'm confused as to why I can't access anything!
When I first installed both Windows and Linux, I setup LAN1 as 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0. I had no problem accessing LAN1 or the Internet from either OS.
OK, first I have a dual boot system. Linux Mint 18 (Sarah) Cinnamon and Windows 7 SP1. Good thing I did this, because I'm new to Linux.
