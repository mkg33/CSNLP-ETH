Tip: In Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Language\Advanced settings -> Change language bar hot keys you can set hot key action for "Between input languages" to "(None)" to avoid accidental keyboard layout switch.
Mikel's answer above fixes this.... but just in case this reappears for you (as it did for me): Do you perhaps have a custom AutoHotkey shortcut to change keyboard layouts?
I didn't have 409 entry in the registry (see accepted anwer). The steps I took to remove English (US) from the quick selection menu:
Actually it seems the issue is also with the same key under your actual user profile (HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-...\Keyboard Layout\Preload), not just HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Keyboard Layout\Preload. 
In sum, you may want to make sure that you don't have undesired languages in neither  HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Keyboard Layout\Preload nor HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-...\Keyboard Layout\Preload.
I can replicate this pretty consistently - when I add a key 00000429 (Persian) for example there and reboot, I get the Persian keyboard automatically added, and when I delete it and reboot, the Persian is no longer there. 
So while in my desktop this would work beautifully and switch from English (UK keyboard layout) to Greek (GR keyboard layout) and vice versa, on my laptop that has a US keyboard, this script would be responsible for the extra layouts appearing out of the blue on my language switcher.
The demo above configures the US layout as a default with the additional NL and BE layouts. Adjust as needed.
Windows 10 anniversary edition contains a new "feature" where it assumes that both regional and language settings come with a mandatory keyboard layout. Those layouts cannot be removed via the settings GUI.
