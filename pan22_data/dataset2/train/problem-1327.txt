Going off of Noor's answer that migrating from Premium to Standard is not supported, I had to take a different, higher level route. Ultimately I had to create and attach a new disk, copy the existing disk's files to the new disk, and remove + delete the original disk. Here are the steps:
I have an Ubuntu VM with a separate mounted data disk on a Premium storage account. The data disk is very large and as a result it is costing me more than I would like. I've tried copying the VHD according to the instructions here, but the operation completes immediately and the resulting VHD size is 0 or -1 according to Powershell (Azure portal shows the proper size, however). Regardless, I detached the premium disk and attached the standard disk in its place. This went poorly, resulting in an initial error message that the disk size of -512 bytes was invalid, and subsequent error messages of
where "attach/detach" was dependent on which operation I was performing. I tried deleting the new standard storage account and starting the process over from scratch, but still had no luck. Ultimately I re-attached the existing disk on the premium account and I was able to start the machine successfully once more, but trying to migrate to the standard storage account was a miserable failure.
Additional help for adding and removing disks from Azure Linux VMs can be found here and here. Though one link is for Resource Manager and the other for Classic resource models, you can handle creating and deleting the vhds through the Azure portal and the Linux commands still stand for either model.
Is migrating a data disk from a premium storage account down to standard possible? And if so, what are the steps?
There is a way to avoid the xcopy or robocopy route. I stumbled on it while trying to figure out a way to migrate azure premium managed disks across subscriptions using powershell. The following site goes into the specific detail https://cloudpuzzles.net/2017/05/moving-azure-managed-disks-around/
