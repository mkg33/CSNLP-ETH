If the destination subnet is the same, the sending host will forward the packet to the destination at layer 2. If the destination subnet is different, it will forward the packet to the gateway at layer 2.  Either the destination host must be local or a local gateway must be known.  You can't have a non-local gateway.
You can't do this.  The gateway is an interface which is on the same subnet as the interface a packet is forwarded on.  When a host wants to forward a packet, it will look at the destination address and use the netmask to determine if the destination is on the same subnet or a different one.
This way you would have 2 VLANs which would seperate your network; but they would be able to use the same physical default gateway.
The 'encapsulation dot1q [number]' is to tell your interface to which VLAN it should be listening. In this case either VLAN 10 or 20.
A sub-interface is an interface that uses your physical interface for moving data. That way you can create "multiple networks" in your network by creating the amount of sub-interfaces.
I have a block of IPs a /24 which i have subnetted into 2 /25s. In the first block one of my clients is requesting I give him 3 x /28 and 1 x /30. Subnetting is not an issue. My concern is how do I tell those blocks of IP's that I will subnet to him to use the x.x.x.1 as their default gateway when they are in different subnets to the default gateway. The setup is 1 router with a cable running to a 48 port switch and all servers and users are supposed to connect to that switch.
