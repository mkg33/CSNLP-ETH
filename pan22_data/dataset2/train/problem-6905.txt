Using this identifier ("user"), you or your staff can say, effectively, that they want to share a calendar or (apparently) portion of their mailbox with someone (effectively anyone) without requiring them to have (or log into) an account on your system.  
There is a user called "Anonymous" who supposedly has no permissions. A quick google search showed that a tech from Microsoft said that the user can be used to read/access/view a folder even though they might not be users in the organization if they know the URL
Often this requires someone sharing the URL with them, so the URL can function as a sort of password, but it is essentially a shared password, and relatively easily shared at that, so, yes, there is a security implication.
It sounds like this "user" is intended to be a placeholder or a way of specifying the large class of people who don't have accounts on your system.
Does anyone know what the real purpose of the "Anonymous" user account?  Also, is it a security risk?
I was digging around in Microsoft Outlook for Mac and I noticed a strange user account when I was looking at the folder permissions.

It may make sense to share something read-only with this "Anonymous" identifier, but I would tend not to provide write permission.
