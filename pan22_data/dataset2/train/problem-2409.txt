It really depends what you want to do with your home server. If all you need it for is file storage, what your doing sounds great. However I use my home server for study and devopment, it has VMWare ESX installed and performs a variety of functions, from a file server, mail server, windows home server, to providing VM's for testing new stuff or studying and learning new skills, so I chose to throw a reasonable amount of hardware and money at it so that it could to all this.
These days the kind of storage you're talking about is so cheap that there's really no reason to use anything other than RAID 10, if available.  4 x 1 TB in a RAID 10 array will give you 2 TB usable with high performance and good redundancy.
You might also consider getting a RAID appliance like drobo (http://drobo.com) direct attached to an atom-based server.  That should be pretty quiet with a small footprint.
So I would suggest thinking about what you hope to gain from your server and what you might want to do in the near future and spec accordingly.
One side note to offer...have you looked at the FreeNAS project? It was made for projects just like the one you're suggesting (instead of OpenFiler). Take a look at both and see what you think.
Filesystem-wise, I'd suggest XFS if you're managing the drive array at that low a level (Openfiler may handle this for you).
I agree with Kevin's other suggestions though. I wouldn't worry about the RAID hardware (swap trays) unless you're really needing those features for some reason; for a home server, you shouldn't be worried about losing money or productivity due to downtime.
I would definitely recommend some form of a RAID setup, whether in software or hardware depends on the tech available to you.  As soon as you start adding multiple disks you're increasing the possibility of one failure causing wipeout to your data.
You might want to invest in some external drive(s) to use as a backup scheme, though. RAID is not a backup...
