Click Owner. Are you the owner? If not, make sure you are the owner (inclduing subfolders) then try to delete it. 
Microsoft wrote an article listing many different things that can prevent deletion and fixes for each:
Share the folder and give it full permissions to everyone, log in from another PC on network which can see the folder and try to delete it
With a directory named cygwin, the problem is probably "Cause 5: The file name includes a reserved name in the Win32 name space" because cygwin contains a dev subdirectory containing files which may overlap with Win32 reserved device names.  The solution is to use the \\?\ prefix to name these files.
Make sure you delete it without selecting the folder. So, in Windows Explorer, Single click another folder (whilst keeping the folder in question visible in the view), then right click the folder you want to delete and select delete (this will prevent the folder opening). The issue can be (I think) about Windows trying to display a .thmb file or similar).
