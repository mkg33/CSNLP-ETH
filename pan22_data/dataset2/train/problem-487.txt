Furthermore, if your program is modifying the data as it works with it things get far worse--dirty pages get written.  If there's much modification of data you'll deplete the drive of spare blocks and your write speed can become truly atrocious.  (A page must erased before being written.  Last I knew that was an operation measured in a substantial number of milliseconds, although I'm not finding current data.  Normally a drive keeps a supply of empty pages around to handle writes but when the writes come in faster than it can wipe the pages the pool gets depleted and a write must wait until the eraser finishes with a page.) 
It sounds like your program is going to be going all over that dataset while it's running.  That is going to cause a tremendous amount of swapping.  You point out a fast SSD can be at 10% of RAM speed--but your program might have wanted 100 bytes of data while the system proceeded to read 4096 bytes off the disk.  Your 10% doesn't mean it merely takes 10x as long to run.
