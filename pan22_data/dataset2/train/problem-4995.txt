No special considerations I can think of when sending to GMail addresses. One optional neat trick is to send mail for each domain to a separate address and have GMail automatically label it accordingly. Forward mail for foo.com to you+foo.com@gmail.com and bar.com to you+bar.com@gmail.com and corresponding filters. See this GMail blog post for more.
run postmap /etc/postfix/virtual to create the database from the map file and postfix reload to re-read the configuration. The virtual table is quite flexible -- you can match specific addresses or whole domains and forward mail to multiple addresses.
I haven't tried but one method to filter spam is to incorporate SpamAssassin. A Google for this turns up quite a few handy-looking guides.
Note that when using virtual aliases or mail forwarding, Postfix tends to retain the envelope sender from the original message. This causes problems for Gmail and others that use SPF:
Warning: This replaces the envelope sender for all messages passing through your server, which may have unintended side-effects. The message From headers should not be modified by this however, so sender addresses should still display correctly.
