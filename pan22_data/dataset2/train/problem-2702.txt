From the server, using a packet analyzer, if you see TCP-SYN packets from the client machine, again connectivity is confirmed. You can probably even use netstat to check recent connections after a telnet attempt.
Are you running it from the command line? Try explicitly spelling out the ip when you run the server:
From the client side, if telnet connects successfully (don't expect any other activity on telnet with your port 8080) then port 8080 is reachable.
Since, you can locally reach the port and I presume the other person can ping your "192.168" IP address, I'd expect a firewall related problem on the path.
You can probably use the Cocoa Packet Analyzer to check if their connection attempts are reaching your server. 
Or whatever your actual IP is. You could also use the --port flag as well if you wanted to use port 80 or something.
When ping is confirmed to work, the next step is usually to try a "telnet your_ip 8080" from the client side machine to check they can reach the server (no firewall is filtering communication).
