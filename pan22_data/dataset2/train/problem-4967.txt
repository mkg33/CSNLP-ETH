I tried out office 2013 thinking it might be better than openoffice.org, but I was really dissapointed. 
You have uninstall modes from basic to advanced where it will delete leftovers and registry entries for you. It's a pretty decent solution imo.
You can try to use the Microsoft Fixit solution given on the top of the page, but most probably, it would fail or only partially succeed.
The only bullet-proof way to really uninstall the Office 2013 Preview after it expires is the Manual Method described here:
By the way, it took NINE installs / 8 deinstalls to clean out everything.  That is because I did not do the registry first.  
Well, it will likely always leave some remnants of itself behind, but after uninstalling via Programs and Features, you can go into Program Files\Microsoft Office and delete everything under the Office15 folder, if the folder still exists.
Even if you delete the trial office before you do anything else, this click-to-run "feature" will much up any install of office.
on most new computers, Office now has this "Office 15 Click-to-Run Extensibility Component" that runs an office install on the first click.  
In my past experiences it is nearly impossible to completely remove office without screwing up windows - that's when I originally switched to openoffice.  How can I make sure that I remove every file and folder that was installed with office 2013?
If you don't have the stomach for it, still give it a try. Just follow the instructions, and everything will be alright!
This registry hack shows how to get rid of that feature.  Don't do it if you are not comfortable in the registry.
