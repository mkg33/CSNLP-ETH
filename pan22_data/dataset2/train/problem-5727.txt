I've had this issue too a while ago. I didn't really solve the install, but I got it running afterwards. The configuration wizard is really just for configuration. The installation is already done at that point. 
Remove the MySQL Reference from c:\ProgramData As It keeps the reference for SQL DB. After removing this It allowed me to re-install mysql.
i had this problem after un-installing and re-installing. during the MSI install, when it asks for the root password - check to see if it's asking for 'old password' in addition to a new one. If so, this is an indicator that there are old database files kicking around. I found my db-files in C:\ProgramData\MySQL. Uninstall MYSQL, nuke this directory (assuming you don't care about the database) and then re-install and you'll be good.
The install crapped out on me as well.  I closed the hung process and then went to START > All Programs >> MySQL >> MySQL Server 5.1 
At this point, you should hold down the SHIFT key, and right-click on "MySQL Server Instance Config Wizard" and select "RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR" from the menu.  You should be able to run through the entire setup again, and it should not hang at the end.  "RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR" made all the difference!
Try right-clicking on the msi and choosing "Run as Administrator".  Remember that starting with windows Vista you don't run with administrator privileges by default, even if you're logged in to an administrator account.  Instead, using an administrator level account merely gives you the ability to elevate particular processes when you need to.
