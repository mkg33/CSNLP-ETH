In case it does, you may set Aero to turn off automatically when and only when VPC is run, by right-clicking its executable, choosing Properties / Compatibility and checking “Disable desktop composition”.
why not install from a copy of xp. windows 7 VPC has an option to add a ISO image to the virtual pc.go to the Virtual machines window and click on the virtual machine you have set up and go to settings. then go to DVD drive and either pick Open from an ISO image or Access a Physical drive.  This will automaticly install which ever version of xp you want.here
Every time I attempt to start Windows XP Mode, the setup starts, I accept the licence agreement, leave the installation folder as default, enter my password, select either of the two protection options, then click start setup. All this does is create a vmcx file called Windows XP Mode 1 in C:\Users\My Username\Virtual Machines.
I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate edition and the latest versions of Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode available here.
The single biggest eater of CPU resources is probably Aero. You may test turning Aero off to lower the power demands, and seeing if the problem disappears.
I've tried creating a new virtual machine, but the behaviour repeats and the machine never powers up.
I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Virtual PC from the Windows updates, as well as doing the same for the Windows XP Mode install. I am a full Administration on the machine and UAC is off.
