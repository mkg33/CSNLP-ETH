Cables are mostly out of the way, and I don't have any whacky components clogging up the main compartment -- just a modest, horizontally mounted video card and the water cooler's supply and return cables to/from the cpu.  So there are no "gotchyas" as far as I can tell with regards to airflow.
All 4 fans report mostly the same RPM and they're all 120mm, so I'm reasonably confident that they're all moving about the same amount of air (the intakes have an air filter to get through and the exhausts have a radiator to push air through).
Am I correct in my assessment that deciding whether to mount the fan and in which direction basically comes down to the "negative pressure versus positive pressure versus neutral pressure" argument?  If not, which direction should I mount that rear fan, if at all?  
So I've got a straightforward build: two fans drawing in air from the front, two fans exhausting air through a radiator on the top, and a spare fan I'm considering mounting in the rear of the unit.  
As far as temperatures, the CPU is completely happy with its water cooler, and the mobo temperature sensors are generally fine (one peaked at 76 degrees, but I unfortunately don't know where the sensors are located on the board), but since I have that extra fan and some space in the rear of the chassis to mount it, I figured I'd look into mounting it.
