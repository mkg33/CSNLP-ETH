Probably the best option would be to add in the other packages with matching versions, but since these particular packages are of little consequence to the current incarnation of this platform I just removed cyrus-sasl-lib from the version lock altogether. Now yum installs/upgrades everything to latest and the instances bootstrap themselves without issue again.
I've got a chef recipe to bootstrap some worker nodes that I've been using for quite some time, and for the first time in a while I needed to increase the size of my worker pool, but found that the new nodes were not bootstrapping properly due to the yum error:
cyrus-sasl-md5-2.1.26-21.el7.x86_64 requires cyrus-sasl-lib to be on the version 2.1.26-21 but you have another version (2.1.26-20).
The problem turned out to be that someone had configured the yum version lock configuration for only cyrus-sasl-lib but none of the other cyrus packages, which is what seems to have caused yum to be unable to resolve the versions correctly.
Where abc-os is our internal repo so we can lock down package versions. Naturally I assumed that this was the problem, but on checking into the repo I found that the complete set of packages for both 21.el7 and 20.el7_2 are present.
