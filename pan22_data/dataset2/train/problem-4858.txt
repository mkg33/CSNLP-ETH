Ive ran McAfee, Bitdefender, Spybot, Ad-aware and Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware... it came all clean (just a few tracking cookie files).
This is getting increasingly frustrating, as I have no idea what I can do anymore. Making a system restore everytime I want to go online is not healthy. If there is a kind soul out there that could give me some pointers, I would appreciate it.
Completely remove any third party firewall software, then do the update and reboot. If this solve the connectivity problem, then try reinstalling your security software. Many firewall products don't tolerate updates to components they monitor or interface with, and rather than reporting the issue, they just block all connections.
If the problem doesn't occur, then it is actually an installed application or third-party driver that is killing the Internet connection.
Im having major problems with a new windows update. On the latests update, my internet connection becomes broken. This is very abstract. The only way that I can fix it is to obviously do a system restore to before the update.
Do you still have any network connectivity?  If not, it could be a fluke, and you networking card may be faulty.
I have as well done system restore and disabled Windows Update, but it STILL kills my connection on reboot.
