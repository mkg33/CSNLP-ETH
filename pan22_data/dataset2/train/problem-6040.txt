using 3 6:64 latches, driven by 6 gpio for the address lines, 2 gpio for the chip select lines and 1 gpio for the desired new state you can control 64 RGB LEDs I.E. using only 9 gpio lines.
Actually, with 17 GPIOs you can drive 72 LEDs using time multiplex (8 groups of 9 LEDs are driven one after another for such a short time that our eyes believes they are on at the same time, just less bright). Do you can have 24 RGB LEDs this way.
Using LED modules that include the WS2812 controller, you can drive as many as you want from a single pin.   You can get them in circles, grids and strips, or individual modules.
By increasing the number of gpio being used for the chip select lines you can easily control even more LEDs.  I.E. double the number of LEDs for each additional gpio chip select line.  However by routing those first 6 gpio (for chip select) into a 6:64 latch, (and adding another GPIO for this new latch enable) you can control 64*64 (4096) RGB LEDs using only 10 gpio
And if that's not enough, you can cascade I2C LED drivers resulting in hundreds of LEDs if you want.
