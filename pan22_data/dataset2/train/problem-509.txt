I am looking to determine the best practice approach to managing Office 365's Clutter feature in a decent sized enterprise in Office 365.  The intention is to provide a solution that allows users flexibility, but allows administrative control to bypass Clutter handling for some "mission critical" messages.
The action in the rule is the same in each case.  Stamp a header in the message, and let it continue on its way.
Create up to four separate Transport rules to handle Clutter based on organizational needs.  Pick and choose as needed!
b.   REGEX, can use $ to denote end of string. Addtional stuff (partial match) should result in failure.
I always start with one for new clients that ensure internal messages are not collected.  I used to do this only for addresses like Executives and such - but found there is the better buy in if you just leave all internal messages alone. I then layer in messages from outside services as/if needed.
If users are not aware of Clutter - they will generally come to hate it and be annoyed when they can't find a message.  When they understand what it does I have  a fair amount of buy-in, and most users keep it on (a small bit will still turn it off). 
It's a combination of Transport rules to force bypass of message you never want to be collected by clutter, and user awareness and training.
e.   This type may be necessary for some external services, where SenderDomainIs doesnâ€™t catch the necessary results.
