I agree with O.S. Upgrades being a Bad Thing, particularly between really different systems like 2003 and 2008 (they're different just like XP and Vista, don't forget that).
I did an in-place upgrade of 2003 R2 x64 to 2008 x64 because it was in the datacenter and I wanted to minimize my time in the batcave. It had SQL Server and some other little things on it; 6 months later, no difficulties so far.
1) The server has a very plain vanilla configuration with all the defaults still set and no additional software is installed.  
2) The cost of re-configuring the server after a clean-install outweighs the cost of having to iron out any legacy 2003 settings that may have adverse effects in 2008.
I have a x64 2003 server and want to upgrade to x64 2008 server.  Can this be done as an inplace upgrade or do I need to blow the machine away with a fresh OS install?  The 2003 machine has SQL, IIS, and several VMs.
If it's SP2 R2 you can do an in-place upgrade (I believe).  However, I can not stress strongly enough what a bad idea this is.  A fresh build is the best way forward
