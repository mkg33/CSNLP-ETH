Depending on your shell skills, the next part might be a bit tedious. You need to compile a list of the packages to provide as an argument to dnf. If its a small list you can copy and paste them. If its a long list, I would suggest putting them in a text file. You can separate the packages by a space or a new line.  
Where PKGLST is either the actual package names (copy and paste with each pkg name separated by a space) or if you have them in a file, assuming the path and file name of /home/purpe/pkg.lst use this syntax:
If you can't address the issue, post the dnf output and the commands you tried. Use something like pastebin because the pkg list and dnf output will likely be long
If you have issues make sure the list of packages is accurate - no missing spaces, no extra info from dnf history, no typos. 
That will provide a transaction list in order of most recent first, along with a transaction number. Using the latest transaction number use the command
To get a list of packages involved in that transaction. Its possible the update wasnt the most recent transaction, so repeat until you find the right one.
