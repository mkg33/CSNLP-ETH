What you should do is to update only the state of the keys in the event handlers and process the movement outside those. With your keys array you are already almost there. Change your code to the following:
You need to call update() repeatedly, once per "frame". Where you should call this method depends on the rest of your code, but typically it's one of:
When you press a key, AWT will call this method once. After a delay (typically 250-1000 milliseconds) it starts calling this method again repeatedly with a smaller delay (typically 30-400 milliseconds). When the key is released, this repetition stops and keyReleased() method is called. In Windows these delays can be controlled from Keyboard properties inside Control Panel. If you hold down multiple keys simultaneously, the repetition events are sent only for one of the keys.
You also need to consider timing so that either this method is called with a constant rate or the implementation of update can handle variable time steps. (http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/)
