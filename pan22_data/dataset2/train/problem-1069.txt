Caveat: if he's reaaaally good, and he has nothing better to do, he could have planted a rogue hypervisor in the Bios. But he's not THAT good. 
Even if he can't see your session directly, he can still watch the traffic coming out of your PC, or the address/port it's destined for, and get an idea of what you're doing that way.  If this is presenting you with a problem, maybe you shouldn't be doing it.
Bring your own external HDD with your OS of choice. Fire up KVM/Xen/VirtualBox/VMWare/VirtualPC, have it run the OS on the main HDD (this might take some work unfortunately but it's definitely possible). Your admin can see what's going on in the virtualized system, but he can't see what you're doing above.
There are also few spy tools available but they contain all sort of malware so I guess your administrator wont install them.
For example if I'm having a conversation in Skype, can he secretly log in in parallel with me and watch my screen? If yes, how to block him? I believe I have admin rights on my dev PC.
Yes, it is very much possible to login to a system and see what a user is doing. There are softwares like RAdmin and VNC which gives you real time console. 
Have you given your admin a reason to want to watch you? To be fair, asking the question "Can you see what I'm doing?" is as good as painting a target on your back!
