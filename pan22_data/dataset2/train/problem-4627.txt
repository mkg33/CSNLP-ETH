While it's not terribly difficult to go to every project file and unblock it individually, it's a pain. And it does not appear you can unblock multiple selected files simultaneously. 
Windows XP SP2 and Windows Vista have this deal where zone information is preserved in downloaded files to NTFS partitions, such that it blocks certain files in certain applications until you "unblock" the files.
A very easy workaround for this kinda ties into the first answer, say if you have around 1000 files that are all blocked just take all the files, and put them in a new folder on your desktop (or whatever folder directory you're working in them right click said folder and then click Send To and then out of the options Click Compressed (zipped) Folder, then after that delete your original files and extract the .ZIP folder and Viola!!! all your files are unblocked :D, worked for me on XP Pro SP3, so kinda assuming it will work on vista as well
I have a usb external Hard Drive that works great for removing the blocks... I made a small partition and formatted it in FAT32..when I want to remove the block from something I simply move it to that drive and then move it back :-)
Is there any way to unblock all files in a directory without having to go to them all individually? 
this will not remove the Zone.Identifier data stream but clear it's content which seems to work fine. 
So for example if you download a zip file of source code to try something out, every file will display this in the security settings of the file properties
I was searching for a batch method (without using powershell) and after reading this post I came up with this simple solution
Along with an "Unblock" button. Some programs don't care, but Visual Studio will refuse to load projects in solutions until they've been unblocked.
In your case, takeown /f *.* /r to recurse into all sub-directories and unblock *.*.  Play with the pattern if necessary.
