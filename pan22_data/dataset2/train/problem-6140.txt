I had to delete filezilla from two different vm machines as the installer was installing hooks which caused vmware to slow down and consistantly reboot the os. If its the installer or not doesn't concern me, as the opensource community is responsible for both. I'd be very wary in anything downloaded by sourceforge as any bad apple can seed files to their hearts content.
I downloaded 'FileZilla_3.7.3_win32-setup.exe' from SourceForge and AVG is repeatedly nagging me that it's infected with 'MalSign.InstallCore.AFD'. Searched that exact term on the AVG website - returned nothing useful.
I would agree however that AVG has sometimes been problematic as I have experienced some of it's occassional false positives.
Finally I used a Shell Extension Scan of the same folder and AVG again detected a problem only with the version 3.7.3 file in there. So I think just delete that file and get a 'clean' copy of version 3.7.4.1.
I downloaded 'FileZilla_Server-0_9_43.exe' from SourceForge and it is fine - nothing picked up by AVG.
All these files I have sitting in the same folder and AVG is scanning them in the background because periodically it pops up its screen telling me there is a virus in version 3.7.3 but none of the others.
To circumvent this, select the "Show additional download options" link on the FileZilla homepage. The link on this page has the ?nowrap parameter and should be free of unwanted additions.
It is the setup installer from SourceForge. Try downloading the .zip instead. There is no problems with AVG and the .zip of FileZilla.
Well I'll just start by saying, I'm using AVG AntiVirus Free Version 2013.0.03462. Virus database version 3722/7168(Saturday, 8 March 2014, 6:40PM). I just now checked via its interface panel and it says my AVG is up-to-date.
Interestingly the file size of version 3.7.3 is showing as 645kb, but version 3.7.4.1 is showing as 4710kb - a significant difference. I think there is something wrong with the 3.7.3 version file from SourceForge.
I downloaded 'FileZilla_3.7.4.1_win32-setup.exe' from Softpedia and it is fine - no virus warning from AVG.
I then downloaded another copy of 'FileZilla_3.7.4.1_win32-setup.exe' (which I have renamed to allow being in the same folder) from the filezilla-project org as mentioned above which redirects back to SourceForge for the actual download link.
SourceForge is wrapping the actual program in a crapware installer. This might well trigger your AV scanner.
