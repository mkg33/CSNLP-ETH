I have a 70 pages word document with many formulas, graphs and images. It moves real slowly (compared to other open word documents on the same computer). 
I've experienced a similar problem when converting from Word to PDF, where whole pages displayed in bold text. After testing, the problem was not the particular monitor or computer and the pages printed correctly. The problem was consistent when I remade the PDF in the same way -- the same pages were always bold. There were no differences in the font styles used.
I experienced a similar problem: when I converted some word documents to PDF for reading on my ereader, random parts of the text showed up in bold. I found that changing the font (Calibri) of the entire word document - to Arial, in this case - before converting to PDF solved this problem completely.
But the main problem is that when I save and close it. After I open it I find that some paragraphs became bold, I don't know why. The same happens when I try to save it to PDF.
I used a previous response concerning the kerning and pixels, and found that if I saved the word document with the setting to be best for printing (instead of best for viewing on screen), that the problem of the random bold of characters went away.
The solution I found was to change the Acrobat Preference setting, accessed from the Word ribbon, from Press Quality to High Quality Print.
I realize my problem wasn't identical to the one discussed here, but it may be sufficiently similar to help solve this problem.
