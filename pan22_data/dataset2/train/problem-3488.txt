1600% CPU usage equals 16 logical (8 physical) cores on a X7550 maxing out. You should note that hyper-threading on database servers is highly debated, as it usually gives you a tiny bit of more write performance and a tiny bit less read performance. On the other hand, disabling it will not solve your problem.
It sounds to me like your database and/or your application isn't designed very well in terms of optimization and processing time. 250 users literally killing 8x2,4GHz cores is not something I would call ordinary, and it's not something mysql server settings can solve for you.
32GB of RAM on a heavily used database server is not a "monster", but it depends on how your database is used. If you have a bajillion of requests - AND the data (that's being requested) can't all fit into RAM, you'll have a serious issue with the disk system hammering I/O on the data storage. It doesnt sound like you need more RAM, as you're maxing out CPU.
It's fairly basic, but the "mysql performance tuning primer script" (http://www.day32.com/MySQL/) provides some good suggestions to get started.
Apologies if this question is vague. My knowledge with adjusting mysql server settings is very limited. What settings do I need to adjust? And what should I set them to? I am guessing that memory is one of them? I am predicting a user base of 10,000 sessions running simultaneously. With my current settings, I can only have 250. Any guidance from experienced server admins would be very appreciated.
I have developed a php game that is obviously depending on mysql queries. Im running it on a monster server: Intel Xeon 7550 with 32GB RAM (Redhat x86_64 ES 5.0) with cPanel installed. I released the game on Facebook and only 250 users could use it before the CPU went mental.
I had "top" on and monitored the CPU usage. MySQL was at one point using up to 1600%! All other stuff was around 3%. Obviously I need to adjust the settings for mysql in order to release this on a bigger scale.
