I would not be so pessimistic as 99%. In some parts of Europe and US, household size is quite small, so If you want to reach singles, you may have a better chance than if you want to reach families (particularly with teenage children). Also, at least one Swedish ISP modem firmwares default to port-forward on the first connected host.
Also note that it is very common for mobile operators to simply block inbound TCP connection attempts. If you have mobile aspirations, all TCP connection initiations need to come from the mobile end.
One thing that might be worth looking at is Teredo. If you can programmatically enable it then it will do the port forwarding and hole punching for you. It basically routes IPv6 over IPv4 and supports direct connections.
But, swayage is still in order, given that the IPv4 trend points strongly towards increased NAT over time.
its probably safe to assume that currently most common isp internet connections make use of NAT so that one home can share a single public IP etc this is how probably around 99% of wireless routers work out the box as well
