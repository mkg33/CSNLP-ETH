I've tried different types I've read, like compacting my folders, or not using Internet Calendars / RSS features, and right now I've even disabled Xobni...but still no effect.
While viewing task manager, minimize Outlook and you will see your memory usage plummet. Mine went from 130MB to 7M. Just minimize Outlook every once in a while.
I've been using outlook for years now, and I've never run into this problem before. Using Microsoft Outlook 2007, with only 1 email account, and no more than 100 emails in my inbox (though I have many many folders, with emails in them), Outlook can sit around and eventually get up to > 700mb of ram usage.
Try temporarily moving all the messages in the main Inbox folder to a subfolder.  I know Outlook treats messages in the main folder a bit differently than those in subfolders.  Although that may have been more to do with network use...
Is it Outlook or WINWORD? I got that issue a while ago and the only way I fixed this was by formating the whole computer. I tried to reinstall Office so many times, System Restore, Updates, some fixes on some forum... but no luck at all.
There's an excellent article on reducing Outlook memory usage here.  There are a number of reasons that Outlook will hog memory, and this article shows a number of approaches to take to reduce it.  Another thing you can do is remove all the Add-Ins that Outlook installs by default.  There's a little blurb on doing that here.
