Recently I contacted my shared hosting provider about setting up private SSL for a few of my sites.  I have several sites hosted under the same plan (the plan allows for unlimited domains).  However, I was told that since it is shared hosting and ultimately each site runs from the same IP address, I could install only a single certificate and secure only 1 of my sites (since each certificate requires a dedicated IP).
The other option they gave me was to use a shared certificate; this is unacceptable since the browser would generate a certificate warning.  My question is: is this typical of shared hosting providers or could I find one that allows me multiple private certificates?  I am currently developing several sites and would like to keep costs at a minimum which is why I am not yet upgrading to VPS or dedicated hosting.  Thanks.
That's no longer the case if using Apache 2.2.12 implementing SNI, a single address is no longer required per certificate. Hopefully we'll see more of this available to shared hosting now.
Does your host not allow you to have Dedicated IPs. You should be able to find a host that allows you to purchase a plan with shared hosting, but dedicated IPs. We are doing this with Server Intellect www.serverintellect.com for example right now. Basically, they just charge us a separate small fee for each dedicated IP we require.
However it is technically possible to get a certificate that is valid for domain1.example.org domain2.example.com etc...
