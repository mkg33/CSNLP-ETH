And I know that Chrome is doing it, because the sniffer tells me the User Agent String for the request - in my case, it is: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/35.0.1916.153 Safari/537.36
To stop it you'll either have to block the URL(s) it's trying to contact, or identify and uninstall the culprit extension.
Fire up an incognito window - this disables all extensions. Make sure to close all others and see if you have the same results.
If you try to navigate to http://s1821.crdui.com/service2 it will redirect you to http://t1.webovernet.com/service2.
Just to clarify, if the subdomain is s1821, then the request path is always /related. If the subdomain is s821, then the request path is always /service2.
Note that the origin is a chrome-extension. I looked up the extension ID and found that it's "Awesome Screenshot". If I disable that extension I no longer see requests to *.crdui.com. Apparently Diigo is tracking you if you use their program.
As soon as I opened it, selected my network adapter (an LTE stick), it started showing me requests from Chrome to s*.crdui.com (where * represents a 821 or 1821, for example: s1821.crdui.com).
