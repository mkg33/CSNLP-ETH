Operating hard drives are an entirely different piece of cake since the writing (and reading) heads pick up and focus external fields.  As a result, you can damage operating hard disks.  While the signal frequency of a degausser (except when switching on/off) is far too low to interact with the typical read signals, it's at least conceivable that its almost-DC part can drive the first read electronic stage into saturation, making it unable to process the real signal.  That effect, however, would be temporary.  The potential change on the platter is more of an issue.
Another answer stated that the casing of a hard disk drive acts as a Faraday cage: that's quite irrelevant since a Faraday cage shields electric fields but we are talking about magnetic fields here (to keep out the 50Hz magnetic field of a degaussing coil, the size of an electric cage would have to be several kilometers).  Effective shielding from magnetic fields would instead require a cage of magnetically conductive material (like transformer iron plates) directing magnetic fields around the drive.  I don't think that hard disk drives have significant magnetic shielding.
Magnetic platters need far larger field strengths than an external degaussing coil produces.  As a result, hard drives that are switched off are not likely to be affected from degaussing.
