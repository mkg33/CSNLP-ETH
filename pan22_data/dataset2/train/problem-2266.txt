We use Scalr for that there is also rightscale, heruko makara, cloud foundry and others. It would be easier for you to get into EC2 if you use ready AMIs from a cloud management service rather than developing your application and then thinking of how to transform it to a cloud management environment.
my advice is to use a service that runs the instances for you and allow more instances to be added as traffic grows.
A photograph will be resized to around 1MB at client side and one HTTP request is uploading only one photograph.
I'm assuming 8,000 users can be online in worst case scenario and 1000 of them will be uploading photographs.
i think you should start out with a micro instance, they are listed to be included in your subscription of AWS, but just be careful; Amazon charges for everything.  Then when the demand of your site increases, spin up more instances and through it behind a load balancer.
I'm planning to host a website where in the first phase I would target 30,000 users. It is in php and runs on Apache server.
