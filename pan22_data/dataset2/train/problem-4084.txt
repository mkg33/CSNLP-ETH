The ping utility does what it's supposed to, hit the ping interface using ICMP, you can't just ping any port you like with it. I'm sure there's a million ways to do it but most people just use 'telnet IP port', i.e. 'telnet 1.2.3.4 25' to test connection.
Are we safe to assume you're trying to set up a web server? If you're trying to set up apache or some other web server, it's not listening on port 443 for ipv4 traffic. Either it's configured incorrectly or you don't have the daemon running.
ping generates ICMP echo-request packets, the ping command is not intended to operate on upper networking layers.
What you want is probably telnet xxxx 443, where xxxx is your host name (C-c to interrup telnet and then exit).
You can't ping ports. What is happening is that 443 is being converted into an IP address and ping is attempting to contact that address (0.0.1.187).
The notion of "ports" is only relevant for UDP and TCP protocols. Ports are used by the TCP/IP stack as a hint to demultiplex IP packets data and deliver them to the right application.
