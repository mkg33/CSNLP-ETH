I'm trying to work out why one article within a publication isn't replicating. I've scripted it out and confirmed the replication procs it's supposed to call are the correct ones, and have run a trace on the destination instance looking for those procs being called - no results.
I'm guessing that there's a bitwise value of 32 which is missing (why else go from 16 to 64) and I'm guessing that 24 should actually be 32 as 24 isn't a valid bitwise value.
But even if I add all bitwise values above excluding 64, I can't get a status value of 57. The max is 49.
Can anyone please explain to me what a status of 57 is, and whether it could be the cause of my article not replicating.
Thankfully this isn't on production, so I'm going to try and update the status manually, and if that doesn't work, take the table out of replication and add it again as its own publication.
I'm not sure what that status value means, but most of my articles are listed with status 57 and they are working just fine.
Querying the sysarticles view in the published database, I noticed the article in question has a status of 57, whereas the rest of the articles have a status of 17.
Looking at msdb, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms174970(v=sql.90).aspx, there are 5 bitwise values available: 1, 8, 16, 24, 64.
