3) I plugged in the sd card in the laptop...I tried to copy the data on the sd card just ctrl+ A > ctrl+c just in case I can put them on a bigger sd card (can't do that OS should br burnt on the SD card)
1) I was trying to install a new package on the pi and then error no enough space (memory).I closed the connection then.
I have a serious problem as everything of my project is on my sd card and I can't connect to the raspberry pi as I have been doing for the last 2 months
In future, it's also a really simple way to make a complete backup (which I've wished I had done on a few occasions). Just power off the Pi, switch the SD card over to your laptop, read the data into a backup folder using Win32DiskImager, then return the SD card to your Pi.
2) the day after I tried to connect I typed the user name and password as usual then typing lxsession this error appeared.
You could try using Win32DiskImager to read off the data, then write it back to a larger SD card. I've never tried writing back to a larger card though - it may not recognise that the extra space is available - but worth a try.
