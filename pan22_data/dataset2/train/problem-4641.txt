Back to AD software deployment - there's some good MS documents out there.  A starting point being http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/816102.
A distribution point, BTW, is simply just a file share that can be accessed by "authenticated users".  The Group Policy Object (GPO) itself can be targeted using security filtering - basically, you can target a given PC or user.  I'd recommend deploying the software based on computer name, and define the settings in the "Computer Configuration" part of the GPO.
As jlehtinen says above, Active Directory Group Policy Objects (GPOs) can be used to push software out to selected AD clients.  It's not massively difficult, but relies on the software install to be packaged in an MSI format.  This isn't normally an issue.  However, the post-install configuration also needs to be carried out.  There are two options here - MST (Master Transform) files, which are rolled into the MSI deployment at install time, or - and this is likely to be the easier option - use Group Policy preferences, which let you cleanly apply registry changes, put XML/INI/CFG files in place, Etc., Etc.
