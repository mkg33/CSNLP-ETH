Based on your desire to kill an individual process, I'm assuming that you are ok with a solution at the Terminal.  The Terminal is pretty light so should be responsive even if your system is swamped, or if you're logging in via ssh.
For example, if you know the name of your process is my-prog-0 or whatever, you can go to the terminal and do:
to see the manual for 'kill' command and also scroll down and see related commands which is mentioned under, "SEE ALSO" section.
One thing to note about OS X is that some system processes will be automatically restarted if they are killed by the launchd daemon (I think??).  For example, if the Dock is not responsive you can do a killall Dock and it will restart automatically.
The above example is to list all the 'Symantec' related processes. Replace 'Symantec' with your own phrase. Next use variations of 'kill' command. You can either use:-
Beyond the basic kill command, which kills processes via their pid (which you'd need to get from either a ps command, or the Activity monitor), a neat trick at the terminal is the killall command, which allows you to kill a process by name rather than pid.
Force Quit is used for simple applications, while the activity monitor can be used to kill processes.
The is no process killing keyboard shorcut, only for running applications. The only way to kill processes is through Activity Monitor or through Terminal using UNIX commands.
Go to activity monitor, find the dock and highlight it. Hit the kill button (Stopsign with X in it, top left).
