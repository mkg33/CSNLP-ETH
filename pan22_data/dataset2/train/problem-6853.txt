Adding to Jimmy's excellent answer, games can not only progress in terms of statistics but also in terms of complexity. You see this a lot in character action games which give you metroidvania-like abilities to access new areas but at the same time such abilities are usually also new fighting moves that are incorporated into your arsenal and can combo with your other moves, thereby increasing the complexity of the fighting system to a noticeable degree. 
Thus, one thing you can do is decouple stat bonuses from complexity as the main source of difficulty in your game. Keep the statistical differences small, but increase the complexity of enemies with player progress. This way, late game enemies may have more complex movesets or, depending on the type of game, require combinations of different attacks or spells to defeat but have similar (although not equal) values of HP or strength compared to early game enemies. This is especially useful if you want to create a more grounded, realistic world - after all real people tend to differ much more in skill than in physical ability. This would also mean that a large buff in any given stat can make a difference for your character against every enemy in the game and never creep out of relevancy while you don't absolutely need to fight any enemy.
