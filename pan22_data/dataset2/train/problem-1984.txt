The RAID controller you are refering to is considered as being a fake RAID controller (source: Dell employees).
The disks work and AFAIK the raid software is installed correctly. I've seen this issue on RedHat issues also in the past. The RAID was initially setup through the BIOS on this server and appears to be functioning fine apart from this.
Have you installed a 3.x.x linux kernel on that? Most versions of MegaCLI I have seen are broken with it because they mistake it for a 2.4.x and try using long obsolete interfaces.
This server is a Dell R200 running Ubuntu 8.04LTS using a LSI SAS1068E raid card supplied from Dell, I suspect that there might be some kind of RAID issue with the hardware raid built into the motherboard, but I can't seem to get MegaCLi to return any useful output:
MegaCLI is only built for "real" RAID controllers, therefore you will receive no useful output from this tool. I recommend mpt-status for LSI controllers: http://freecode.com/projects/mptstatus
Normally, the price of "real" RAID controllers starts at 150 Euro, while "fake" are cheaper. There is no real border (150), but that value is based on my experience.
The SAS1068E is closer to a "fake" firmware RAID controller than a "real" controller.  MegaCLI is designed only for "real" controllers.
