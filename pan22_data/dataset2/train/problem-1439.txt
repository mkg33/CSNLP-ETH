as of now you cannot do so directly or indirectly through something like resource hacker.  I changed the profile icons (png pictures) in the Chrome.dll which is a file Google Chrome loads.  However, in spite of them changed using resource hacker, my new icons do not show up in the settings section of Google Chrome so don't bother trying.
Select your account, then Syncing to (your email address), and Manage your Google Account, you can change your profile picture there. To get the new image to display on the task bar, select Syncing to again, and turn sync off and on.
By the way.. When you have a different profile create in the above way, you can then choose any Google-profile-image that you want, associated with you google account.
This is probably too simple, but it works: I removed the file "Google Profile Picture.png" from my user directory, and put another file with the desired picture with the same name in the same directory. Worked.
Changing your profile icon is possible with the solution given at https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=91230#c43 with several limitations.
