Name servers are assigned on a per-connection basis.  In Windows, here are typically two name servers assigned to each network connection, though the upper bound for how many can be assigned is much larger.  The configured DNS servers are tried in order - the first one is queried first, if it is unavailable, the second one will be queried, and so on.
I am trying to figure out a few things about DNS Client caching.  Specifically, I'd like to know how many name servers for a particular domain are cached when the client resolves a record for the first time, and what happens if the cached name server becomes unavailable when future requests are made.  Also, is there a way to display the NameServers in a client cache on a windows servers.  ipconfig/displaydns only seems to display the cached A and CNames, not the NameServers.
ipconfig /all will display a connection's currently configured nameservers, as will going into the connection properties through the GUI, but you will not be able to find a "nameserver cache" because one doesn't exist.
