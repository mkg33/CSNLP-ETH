My problem is that I have a fresh installation of XBian and XBMC but I cannot connect to the RPi via SSH from a Windows 7 PC in the same network. The router recognizes the RPi (I got the IP) but any connection is refused. Both, computer and RPi are connected via WLAN. I tried root and xbian for usernames. I tried Putty and WinSCP. The UPnP sharing of libraries works nicely (but is readonly).
I am new to Raspberry PI and I met the same issue on first install - connection was refused before having the chance to enter the password.
If you have a similar error, look at this: SSH not working over WLAN (ssh enabled, ping works, tcpping on port 22 works)
When connection the PI to the HDMI cable, it is obvious that another step is required to complete xbian installation (can be done with a USB mouse - no keyboard needed).
In fact, I used the windows install package to format and copy the files to the SD card. I though the OS was installed on it.
I've found that the first attempt to connect fails. If I immediately attempt to connect after the failure, I get a login prompt and can login.
