Finally, the problem has gone completely, after I started using LAN2 interface instead of LAN1. For now it's OK because this computer is a sort of playground (yeah, I apologize for question that is not exactly on-topic here), so I don't need such features as IPMI, but it would be nice to have two fully functional LAN ports.
My questions are: does this problem look related to incorrect IPMI configuration? How to fix it (i.e. I need a working LAN1 interface; IPMI is not necessary)?
Disconnecting the network locally (via ifdown/ifup) cures this problem. It can also disappear after waiting for some time (say, an hour).
My problem is the following: when I use LAN1 to connect this computer to LAN, it works OK for some time, but then SSH connection spuriously fails. The host responds to pings, but attempt to reconnect via SSH fails like this:
I've got a workstation with Supermicro X10DRi-T mainboard. It has three Ethernet ports. One of them (IPMI LAN) is dedicated to IPMI. The other two, LAN1 and LAN2 are general-purpose. This question Configuring SuperMicro IPMI to use one of the LAN interfaces instead of the IPMI port? mentions that LAN1 can be used as IPMI.
