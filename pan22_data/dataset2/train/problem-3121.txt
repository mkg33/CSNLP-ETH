Elevated Powershell/CMD - File creation failed. C:\Windows\System32\MPIO_Configuration.log. Error 5 Failed to write MPIO configuration to file. Access is denied.
I "think" I have everything working properly but when I try to create a log file to verify via the MPIO properties (GUI) or invoke the "mpclaim -v" powershell command (or command prompt) while elevated as Admin, I get the following errors;
I am in the midst of migrating to a Hyper-V 2012 R2 cluster and am currently configuring the first host to connect to the iSCSI CSV via MPIO.

I have only been able to locate one article relating to the same problem but the solution was not applicable to me. Someone made a reference to " Local Security Policy/Public Key Policies/Encrypting File System/Properties/Certificates" and to allow something there but when I go there on the local machine, there are no keys or anything.. just a message that says "No Encrypting File System Policies Defined".
