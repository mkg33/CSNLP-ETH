I'm surprised that no one's said this yet: Is there a firewall getting in the way? For instance, Windows Firewall?
You mention that it has several services that listen on these ports.  Just a thought, but is the service that is supposed to bind to port 8081 stopping for some reason?  Or is it even really starting at all?
for instance, I use PRTG which runs on port 81 but port 81 is only active and listed in the netstat (running with no options) output when I'm running the web based management tool in PRTG.
(If you do change it to another port, you need to change the "CommandCenterURL" parameter in the "web.config" file in the ControlPanel folder the new port, too. Stop the "Publisher Services" before making these changes, and then restart them and ControlPanel should work, assuming that the server really does start listening on the new port.)
You've double-checked the "CommandCenterListenPort" value in the "C:\Program Files\QlikView\Publisher\CommandCenterService\QVPublisherCommandCenterService.exe.config" and seen that it's set to 8081? You might try setting that to another port just to see if it will listen on another port. If it doesn't listen when you try changing it to another port I'd say that something is up with the application.
