When I generate my keys I tend to name them, and add a comment that includes they time they are generated.  So something like this.
There is very little reason to do this.  But, I have found a few, rare, applications that won't work properly, when I sudo -i -u anotheraccount.  When I ssh anotheraccount@localhost I can use those applications.  One example is disconnected GNU Screen sessions.  Screen is somewhat picky about ownership of the terminal used to re-connect.  Using SSH to another account makes it work.
There is no automatic notification.  Additionally, if you overwrite your existing keypair, and that was the only thing that permitted you access to the remote systems, you would no longer have access.  I strongly suggest you not overwrite keys.  Instead make multiple keys.  Then use your .ssh/config to define a key for a specific connection, or add all your active keys to an ssh agent.
Once you create a new keypair, you need to re-publish the public key to any hosts you need to be authenticated on.
