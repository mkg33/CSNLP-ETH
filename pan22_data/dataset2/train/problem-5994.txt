Microwave the drive.  Effective and dangerous.  Just be sure you don't use your own microwave. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUyp00RvTw
Google for a local shooting range, offer them a target of your Hard Drives. They'll shoot it to shreds (if they're any good).
I used to work for a Computer Service and we used to destroy platters inside small laptop 2'5 hdds just by hitting them hard over the desk using hand and nothing else. This was done so that the platters would break into pieces (you could hear them that they are in very small pieces) while still the external side would be fine with no visibility of external damage. Then we usually sent them back to producer on warranty case. Worked all the time. Not sure how big drive would react thou :-) 
If that doesn't work, find a sidewalk and have some fun with smashing it into the ground. Repeat until you're happy with it in pieces.*
By far the cheapest and easiest method I've found for destroying drives is to triple bag the drive in good garbage bags and swing it at the concrete a few times. If you have a couple drives you can put them in side by side.. Otherwise adding a couple rocks to the bag helps. 
My preferred method as of late is to take my arc welder to the drive.. Melting a drive that has given you headaches is so much more fun. 
Free Method: repeatedly throw the HDD against a sidewalk or concrete wall until it comes apart. Then continue to smash the platters (internal disks) until they are extremely damaged.
