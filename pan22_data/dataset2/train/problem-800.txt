That is not possible if you use inbuilt wifi card. You can buy an USB wifi dongle and enable it in virtual machine. Ensure to have all guest addons. If you expose the USB, you can use it in guest OS. 
Compare VirtualBox with VMware Fusion and Parallels for Mac. All 3 of those programs behave the same way. The only devices that can be directly accessed are usb devices. Everything else is abstracted though the virtualization engine. (Though you could argue that the vm has lower level access to cd rom's and storage devices). 
Some improvements have been made at the hardware level to support hardware passthrough. For example, Intel has released processors that have advanced virtualization features. You can in theory, connect multiple video cards in your computer, and assign one of the video cards to a Virtual Machine. That VM would then have full control over the graphics card.
