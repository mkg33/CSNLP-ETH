If you have profiles on a central location you  can set security on the profiles so that users can't change settings in a profile if you want that.
Solution-get a second printer, set up employees to use it by default, and train them when it's appropriate to use the other printer manually. You're working against the purpose of the printer to try forcing it to be a B&W type of printer to save money after getting it.
With similar issues the only way we can get around it is to have another printer set as their default that only does B&W, and train users to use that printer for things that don't require color. Otherwise I haven't found a reliable way to prevent a color printer from being used as a color printer.
The key may be to configure the permissions on the printer object to deny users the ability to manage the printer. Then set the defaults the way you need and see if it works.
I usually just install two printers for them: "<printer name> B&W" and set that as the default; I'll install another printer (same printer, different settings) and call it "<printername> Color".  Haven't had an issue doing it this way.
