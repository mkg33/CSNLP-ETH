Also as I know VmWare Workstation has something called Guest Additions Which is installed on the OS once it has completed installing the OS on virtual machine. This little program has the drivers needed to use the virtual devices made by VMware itself.
Virtual Machines have their own devices, i.e. They virtualize your devices to their own type. This means that you may not have to install the drivers.
So the answer is NO, You dont have to install all the drivers on the virtual machine compared to physical machine, neither for virtual windows nor linux installation.
For the most part this will be the same experience you would otherwise have, although some of the driver behavior may be a little different due to the virtualization.
Microsoft's virtualization system is called Hyper-V and is included in Windows Server. There is comprehensive information for Linux under Hyper-V located at Linux and FreeBSD Virtual Machines on Hyper-V. Also, see Ubuntu 14.04 in a Generation 2 VM on Ben Armstrongâ€™s Virtualization Blog.
For a non-"Windows Server" OS a couple of your other virtualization options are Windows Virtual PC and Oracle VirtualBox.
