I was thinking about installing a fresh copy of Server 2008 R2 on the Air and then transfer the virtual machines from the HP to the Air...?
Basically the problem is. I currently have a HP Elitebook 8530p running Windows 7 Ultimate x64 SP1 and dual boot with Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 SP1 to run 4 virtual machines with Hyper-V.
Install both Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 like you normally would on an Apple computer.  At this point just transfer the virual machine files to the new Windows Server 2008 installation.  As to your second question, you can do your own research on what CPU comes with the AIR, and what Hyper-V extensions it supports.
And my last question, does the Air have support for Hyper-V (vt-x, vt-d, or what are the flags called in the CPU)? The CPU does support it, but don't know if the Air itself has it enabled or even knows the technology...
I'm going to buy a Macbook Air 13" 1.8Ghz/256GB SSD this week or the next week. Now my question is: is there a possible workaround to get the Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 SP1 installation on the Macbook Air? I know you can install Windows on a Mac with their own program, but I don't have the possibility to install all the virtual machines again. They must be copied (or something else).
