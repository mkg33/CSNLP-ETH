If you want to use a desktop app, and your hosting provides remote access, LibreOffice's Base program can remotely connect to a MySQL server (may require some fiddling).
PhpMyAdmin is a common GUI, web-based front-end for managing a MySQL database. Many shared hosting providers have PhpMyAdmin built in to their hosting, so check your hosting panel.
I am very familiar with MS Sql Management Studio, which I use daily on my day job to work with Sql Server databases, and something that allows me to edit Sql queries and run them against the remote MySQL database where my phpBB resides is what I need.  
I have a phpBB installation on a shared hosting site, and I need to be able to run Sql queries on the underlying database from my remote (home) workstation.  I am checking the MySQL website for tools and I see that there are a few, but which one does what I have just described?  
For MySQL performance i recommend using NEOR Profile SQL  - is  great tool for profiling and optimizing the SQL queries. and is for free.
