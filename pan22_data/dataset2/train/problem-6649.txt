I hope this is the correct place where I could ask this question. My mother is an accountant with a degree in economics. She works as a freelancer and she needs some licenses for her job.
That being said there are a small number of things (which you may never use) that you do need an Adobe licence for, most specifically if you want to create documents with 'enhanced usage rights'. A document with enhanced usage rights (which are enabled by the document being digitally signed using a secret key inside Adobe Std/Pro) allows features normally only found in Adobe Standard/Professional to be used in Adobe Reader when viewing that PDF. In particular some features for filling out, adding comments to and saving PDF forms can only be used if the user owns a Std/Pro version of Adobe, or if a Std/Pro user has digitally signed the document (and there are restrictions on how many you can sign). 
The biggest problem is adobe acrobat standard, which costs 400â‚¬, quite a lot. I want understand if she must buy it to create pdf files or she can use some free (even for commercial use) programs that she has because of her job (the chamber of commerce provide some advantages to accountants).
She is actually using PDFCreator, which as I can read is free for business usage (open source also!!): http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/
Adobe does not own all rights to files with a PDF extension. The only reason she would have to be licensed by Adobe would be to legally use their software. Any open source PDF creator used will be covered by its own licensing, not Adobe's. Create away! 
No, you do not need an Adobe Standard or Adobe Professional licence to create PDF files, assuming you have legally licenced another program which creates them (there are some that are free as long as you follow whatever licence or 'copy-left' agreement they come with).
