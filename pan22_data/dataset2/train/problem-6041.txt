The magic to connect in such networks is that connections to the pi are impossible to establish, because of the NAT network, but rather make the Pi connect a server. 
Setup a VPN where every Pi connects to or use a HTTP site that the Pi periodicly GETs with instructions should you want to run something.
Since most of the mobile networks don't provide external IP (you're behind NAT) this will be rather impossible without a 3rd party server.
I went with a HTTP Server and the Pi polling it every 5 minutes for new instructions to run. You should use TLS to encrypt the sensitive data stream. Should the Pi get an instruction it runs it and sends the result back to me via a POST, but uploading it to an SFTP would work too.
You would have to configure some kind of VPN or have the RPi connect directly to your server/computer with external IP and static domain.
Remot3.it is probably the best service to achieve what you require. Install it on Raspberry Pi and you can access it via SSH from anywhere with internet.
Maybe it is worth to use Teamviewer (or something similar). It'll allow you to avoid using dyn dns service. 
I had to do something similiar for a project, where either restricted Wlan or a 3G Stick was used to connect to the internet.
If my understanding is correct, you want to access RPi connected to the Internet through 3G connection. 
The second method is setting up a VPN server and make all your Pis connect to it when you're connected too you can easily SSH into the Pi.
