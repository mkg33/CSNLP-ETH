Anyway, once I rolled back my firmware, I rebooted my Pi and it only showed the rainbow splash screen for a second, then the screen turns off. I waited for the entire night and nothing happened. I Googled it, and most articles said reinstall Raspbian. I decided I needed to start over and reinstall Raspbian on the SD card, and at that point I hit the second problem. The SD is recognizable by OS X and Kali linux, but it is read-only, therefore not allowing me to use DD, gparted, fdisk, or Disk Utility to erase the SD card. I tried using dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/theindentifierofthesdcard bs=somenumber, regardless of what OS I was on, it still said "Permission Denied". I also tried sudo chown -hR username /dev/SDIdentifier, yet it still didn't help.
and I got that command from this site: http://raspipress.com/2014/06/tutorial-install-mysql-server-on-raspbian/
I foolishly rolled back my firmware so that I could install MySQL, because some tutorial told me to do so. I am usually good about not messing up that bad.
