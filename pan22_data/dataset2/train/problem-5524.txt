Oh and I can scan for groups, too. So I'll look for the really nice ones like Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins or groups which look particularly interesting. And I'll see who are the members of the group in question and look to go after them.
So while anonymizing usernames may seem helpful, I don't think they do much to actually increase security. And they make it harder on end users, support staff, and administrators when troubleshooting a particular set of users' problems.
Technically, the username is half of a cipher so using an easily guessable username is the same thing as using an easily guessable passphrase.
I'm going to approach this from a Windows domain perspective. If I'm an attacker, I don't care what the usernames are. I simply want them. So I'm going to look for a system that doesn't have RestrictAnonymous, or a Windows 2000 system, and I'm going to scan for all the usernames in the domain. Or I'll gain a single valid user account on the domain and then issue said scans. Now I have ALL user accounts to try against.
