The destination farm also has to be at the same product version (i.e. service packs and hotfixes) or higher as the source farm's installation. Usually installing the latest Cumulative Update on the destination farm solves that issue.
The easiest way is to just make a backup of the content db and reattach it to the new farm's sql server, then add the content db to the web app. Full urls in content (like for instance a publishing page's link to it's pagelayout) will need to be "realligned" though. (i.e. pages etc.) 
I would not go with backup/restore, as this can cause conflicts with duplicate GUIDs. When you restore a site to a new farm, it only creates a new GUID for the site collection. All included objects like lists and items retain their GUID.  You don't need to have a (blank) site in place when using this backup/restore.
I've used the built-in backup / restore feature to move a site to a new install.  In my case it worked without any real issues.  These features are available in the Central Administration app or via stsadm.
To move sites or site collections to another farm, I'd go with export/import. You'll have to pre-create a (blank) site on the target farm, however. Also, pay attention to the options of those commands, like includeusersecurity and the versions to include in the export.
You have the following methods to move sites and site collections (there is a difference, so it helps if you know which one you're dealing with):
