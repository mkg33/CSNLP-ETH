It sounds like the rails app was built with either a previous version or new version of rails. To fix this, you'll need to cd to the topmost parent of the app (the parent of app,config, and other directories) and run:
That said, if you got the app from someplace, running the above may not work. Get back to the machine that the app was built on and update rails as well as the app on that machine.
Missing the Rails 2.3.4 gem. Please gem install -v=2.3.4 rails, update your   RAILS_GEM_VERSION setting in config/environment.rb for the Rails version you do have installed, or comment out RAILS_GEM_VERSION to use the latest version installed.
I have a rails app running on passenger/apache 2.2.3/RHEL. Everything was working fine until I had to restart Apache. Once I did that, I got the following message:
I'm not sure what to do, since the app was running fine before. I did touch restart.txt to try to restart it, deployed from Capistrano again, and removed/installed the rails gem again but nothing worked. rails -v prints Rails 2.3.4.
I solved this a while ago by restarting apache with the command /etc/init.d/httpd restart rather than service httpd restart. Not sure why that worked, but it did. None of the environment.rb changes did anything.
