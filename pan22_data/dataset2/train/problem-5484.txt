Please note that with the video, YouTube has done its absolute best to remove any detail from it, meaning it's difficult to see the shimmer under the encoding artifacts.
But anyway, is there a filter of some kind I can put into my shader to prevent this shimmering?  I'm at something of a loss here.
I understand shimmering in textures is caused by sub-pixel accuracy aliasing against the regular grid of pixels on the screen when drawn.  I have a good example of it here, whereby I'm attempting to scroll/pan a 2d texture by modifying the texture coordinates rather than by moving some actual geometry.  The texture is "wrapped" and my idea was to fill in the bit falling off the left (or right), filling it in on the other side, to effect a single scrolling/panning surface of (almost) infinite size.
(To complicate matters my texture is actually just L16 luminance and I'm palettising it in the shader - the L16 is sampled with LINEAR, the palette texture is POINT, though I'm pretty sure this makes little difference to the shimmering).
Unfortunately with random noise on the texture, when I'm zoomed all the way out the shimmering is kind-of horrific.  When I zoom in a bit it seems OK, which is kind-of confusing to me.
