I have been using the INT formula to convert boolean values TRUE and FALSE into 1s and 0s. However, I have copied some data I have been given into my spreadsheet and Excel hasn't recognised the text as boolean in some cases.
None of these solutions worked well for me (Very long formula resulting in the text), so I got annoyed and wrote my own solution. 
Is there any way I can make Excel recognise this without having to click on every cell and hit enter?
As you anyway convert your logical values to number why do you want to change your data instead of adjusting your formula to accept text too: =INT(IF(ISLOGICAL(A1),A1,A1="TRUE"))
This doesn't bother with dealing with 1's and 0's, but you can wrap it around a string and get True, False, or the original string back, depending. 
The TRUE and FALSE text is aligned left and is formatted as 'General'. The INT formula doesn't recognise this as boolean. However, as soon as I click a TRUE or FALSE cell and then hit enter, the text becomes center aligned and my formula recognises it as boolean and converts it to an integer.
