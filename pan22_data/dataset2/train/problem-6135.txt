There is another alternative: Ubuntu has an xrandr utility which allows you to set almost any desktop size you want: your terminal screen becomes a panning window into this virtual desktop. It is an X-windows function, so most Linux releases should have it.
If you're asking whether you can record the desktop screen at 1080p resolution using screen recorder software, then the answer is no, you can't.
If you watch a 1080p video (or a 1080i video, for that matter) on a computer with a 720p screen, one of several things can happen:
No the video from using a screen recorder can be at maximum your screen resolution for the ones I know. I suspect there is probably a way but most screen recorders try to make the video recorded look exactly like the one you see.
The software usually will record at whatever the current desktop screen resolution is (which you can lower). However if your graphics card is capable of setting the screen resolution to 1080p, then I think it could be possible, however I haven't tried this out, so I'm not sure about this.
I have successfully used this technique to capture higher-resolution images from web-sites, for example when I want to screen-capture a whole web-page which needs scrolling on a normal desktop. The only limitation seems to be that you need more RAM for a larger desktop.
