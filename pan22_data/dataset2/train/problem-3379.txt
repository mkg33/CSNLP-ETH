But then, at the terminal window I changed to the desktop directory. After that I executed the ssh command this time with simply putting 'key-pair-filename.pem' instead of '/desktop/key-pair-filename.pem' and it worked.  
The problem seemed to be generating from the path name of the EC2 key pair in the ssh command. My key pair was on desktop. So earlier, I tried executing the ssh command from the HOME$ prompt and mentioned the pathname of key pair file in the ssh command from the last step of the instructions as '/desktop/key-pair-filename.pem', and it dint work.

I have made an EC2 key pair and saved it to a location under my home directory on mac. Also I have changed permissions with 'chmod 600 /path/to/saved/keypair/file.pem'. Now I have followed the following instructions to run pig on EC2:
