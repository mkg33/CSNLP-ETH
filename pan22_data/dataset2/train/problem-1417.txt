Double click them and then go to the tab enhancements and you should be able to see all the built ones that support your device, and you can click advanced to edit a few other settings.
I had the exact same problem in Windows 7, there are various drivers that sort of work with minor issues.
If you can not find what you want here, try downloading and playing with different versions of drivers for your chip as the Windows Vista / 7 sound control panel hooks directly in to functions that the drivers provide - if you do not see a option that you previously had, it is likely that you are using the default driver and not one designed for the audio chip.
If you right click on the speaker icon then click playback devices, you should see the speakers listed.
Sounds like it could be a problem with your codecs if Windows is able to work ok with surround sound, but your files are not. What player are you using? I recommend Shark007s codecs: http://shark007.net/
You are looking for what is usually called "speaker fill."  That means you want to take the 2-channel mp3 sound and expand it to fill in the full set of surround speakers.  You want to look for the options in your driver-specific software.
