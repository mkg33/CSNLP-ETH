Sorry, I couldn't follow the link. Compiling OpenCV from source may run into swap file limits. Check the value of the CONF_SWAPFILE in the file /etc/dphys-swapfile. You may want to increase it because the default Raspbian Buster setting (as before) is 100.
OpenCV is part of the default raspbian repository. Just installing it with apt works out of the box. How to do it you can look at Pre-Built openCV on raspbian Buster.
Since you have restarted the system while a build was in progress, I'd recommend cleaning it up (make clean, or just scrap the whole folder and start from scratch) before you re-attempt a build.
If you didn't install any cooling, a thermally throttled CPU can take days to build something substantial. Running at extreme temperatures will also damage the board sooner or later.
2) If suggestion 1 doesn't get you passes the ram stall; Try building with different opecv version. I generally get better results on the RPI when building with versions 3.4.
If the build process doesn't throw an error and keeps the CPU busy, I'd assume it's still working. I never tried to build OpenCV, but 2 hours doesn't seem like an extraordinary time. Building Firefox on an RPi 4 takes more than that.
You don't tell us why do you want to compile OpenCV from source so I assume it is not necessary. We have seen many problems on this site doing it. You also try to compile for python version 2. This is nowadays only used for backward compatibility. It is strongly recommended to use up to date python3.
