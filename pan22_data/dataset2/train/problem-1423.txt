If you need to compile something from source then I recommend using a consistent layout and naming scheme. Read up on how autoconf works and make use of the --prefix directive.
I am a bit confused, as there are two ways to install applications.  One being to configure and make from source and the other from a package manager.  If one were a UNIX/Linux administrator, is it fair to use package managers and is it trustworthy?  I have come across a few places, which seems to say today's admins really don't know what they are doing, because they don't do things from scratch and instead prefer package management.  
If you are going to use any kind of automated configuration management, like puppet, chef, cfadmin, et al, then you'll need to be comfortable with how your *nix's packages work. Also know where the good 3rd party repositories are as they generally contain updated packages if you are using an Enterprise or LTS distribution.
So as an aspiring UNIX admin, I know I should know both methoods and I do, but which should one choose first.  As an example, on a job interview if asked to set up Apache, does one reach for the source or the package manager?
Will allow me to add /opt/bin to my $PATH and switching between versions of nginx is as simple as installing the new version into /opt/nginx/nginx-$VERSION and updating the symlink
If you're getting your packages from a reputable location, you're probably ok.  I wouldn't have any particular qualms about installing Apache with apt-get, but I should qualify that with noting that we mostly use Linux for non-critical functions.
