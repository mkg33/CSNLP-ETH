In your computer Ubuntu and windows 7 is installed in two different drives so while upgrading only the windows drive gets upgraded and Ubuntu files remain untouched. After up gradation you will find a folder on the windows drive named windows old in which all your windows 7  files will be there. The Ubuntu files remained untouched but you will have to re install since after up gradation you will not find the option to select the Ubuntu at the start up. 
I guess you still have the Ubuntu ISO or Ubuntu Live DVD. You can use Gparted partition editor which came with Ubuntu to delete the ubuntu partition and format it to NTFS.
Or On Windows open up Disk Management and just simply delete the Ubuntu partition. This will unallocate the space. Now create a logical partition from Disk Management.
If you are using Wubi, it installs Ubuntu in C: and adds an entry in Add or Remove Programs. Just go to add or remove programs and uninstall Ubuntu from there. Then go ahead with your upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8 :)
In this case you can upgrade without problems, and because Ubuntu is installed within the Windows partition you don't need to repartition either.
You can delete Ubuntu before or after performing the upgrade to Windows 8 but in any case to remove Ubuntu you'll have to do this:
Done, you'd have Ubuntu effectively. Note that you can execute those steps in reverse order too, you can first delete the entry from the BCD store and then remove the ubuntu directory.
If you installed using Wubi then run-> appwiz.cpl (add/remove programs) and there will be a uninstaller link. Use that to uninstall Ubuntu.
