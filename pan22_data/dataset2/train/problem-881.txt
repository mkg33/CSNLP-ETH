However if it is actually just a standard monitor and these flies are that small they can get in between the layers, I do not think they can be removed without causing significant damage to your panel.
Next, I am not really to sure - If your monitor has a layer such as glass or plastic, your best bet will be to open it up, remove the layer and get it out.
I thought the bug was right behind the first layer, between LCD and glass. However as I found out these two layers are permanently glued and sealed. That's a good news as no bugs get in.
I found the bug (actually 3 of them, two that I didn't know of) between diffuser and LCD. This space can be quite easily reached with just basic tools (pry tool, flat and Phillips screwdriver) within 30 minutes. You can follow detailed steps in Acer Thin Bezel Monitor Disassembly.
You should turn your monitor off as soon as you spot them, usually they will make their way out again, if you leave it on then they will stay and bathe in all that lovely light.
