My hunch, though, is that you'd be happier working in another language for a while to get some experience before you come back to C++. There is plenty of general game programming experience to be gained elsewhere.
Java is a good language to start game programming in if you're at least somewhat comfortable with object oriented programming. You have libraries like JogAmp, LWJGL, and Java Monkey Engine to get started, as well as tools like Eclipse. 
Lua and Python have similar libraries to Java available and are also pretty good for getting something on screen relatively quickly and making it move around, although I have to defer to someone else's experience for starter libraries and tools for these languages.
If you're comfortable with C++ and would like to stick with it, then I think it comes down to a matter of personal experience, priorities, and taste. The options you listed are all good ones generally, but you'll want to read up on the APIs, strengths and weaknesses, and so on to see which one fits you best. 
If you're fairly new to game programming and programming in general, I recommend against starting out learning everything in C++. Either set your sights lower than sprite-based games while you learn C++ (e.g., practice with a text adventure while you get comfortable with the language) or go for the less cerebral, more fun route with another language.
