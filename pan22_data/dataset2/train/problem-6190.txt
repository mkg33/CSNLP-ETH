It should be noted that a proxy does not really protect you all the time from this sort of method. More often than not, the reason for attaching a externally linked picture is not to track a ip but just to confirm that the email was received in the first place. The other use is usually just for time-critical content so proxy doesn't really make a difference
So yes, if the image was hosted on a site controlled by the sender, it is possible for them to see which IPs have connected to load the image. This does not link your IP to your email address unless you're the only person receiving this email. Pretty unlikely.
This has changed between now and the answers from 2009. According to Google, images can no longer be used by the sender to obtain the IP address of the recipient:
Some mail server software (such as MailScanner) can quite accurately tell web bugs from normal images, and then disarm the web bugs by removing or replacing them. But Gmail does not claim to try that, though a few say Gmail in fact does.
It is the same as with Hotmail, Outlook or anywhere else which is why you usually get a warning when the picture is going to load (and usually blocked by default)
Yes, the image is loaded on to your machine as if you were visiting a web page, so your ip will show up in their server logs or script that is monitoring the email e.t.c.
The only pictures that are safe from this sort of thing are the ones that are actually included / attached to the email.
Just to reiterate that last paragraph: Please note that it is possible (indeed common practice) for the sender to obtain the information on whether or not you opened the email and at what time you opened it. This is a common feature of standard mail services (e.g., Mail Chimp).
