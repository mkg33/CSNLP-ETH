The problem is clearly with your ISP, and you have already found the workaround - use a VPN to modify your traffic profile in a way that it gets priority.   If you want a lower ping, the trick might be to find a VPN provider more directly in the path between yourself and the server.  (If your VPN is not provided out of the West Coast, maybe shift to a server that is ?)
DynDNS won't help your performance issues, and neither will the new router (unless you want to run the VPN from that - and its a nice piece of kit worth having anyway) 
Its possible, but unlikely that your ISP is "changing the way it routes traffic".  Its more likely that its a combination of the way your connection is delivered  [ are you using DSL?  If so, many variants renegotiate periodically, and this may be happening at 8am for you ], and the usage profile - Your low latency times coincide with off-peak times.
Whats most likely happening is that your ISP is breaking the bandwidth up into pools, and, it appears, they don't particularly cater to gamers. (Its also possible its a routing bottleneck the VPN works around)
