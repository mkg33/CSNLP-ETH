If the balancer is designed corectly, it will only switch to the second, wifi network, if you saturate the wired network. This is the way it works with home office style load balancers. 
One of the cool new features many sites mention is "Integrated Load Balancing" in Windows 8. It is supposed to do the following:
The feature is actually called Network Interface Card (NIC) Teaming and has been around since Windows Server 2008. It can balance loads over different Network Interface Cards on your system.
Even if you enable integrated load balancing, defaulting to cabled network is the optimal fusion of networks as the cabled network will have lower latency and hence faster browsing. 
I would love to see this feature in action. I am connected to a WiFi access point and to a different network by cable. Yet I don't see the operating system 'intelligently' balance the network load when for instance downloading multiple files. Is there any way to enable it or should I adjust my expectations?
And also, according to this document from MS (from back when it was still refered to as "Windows Server 8 Beta"):
I believe it is targeted towards server-systems and not towards the other editions as they wouldn't really benefit from this improvement.
Also, if you try to use the PowerShell command for network teaming on Windows 8, it will tell you you need a Server SKU.
This is evidenced by the fact that to set up teaming you're supposed to use the "Server Manager" UI:
The "Windows 8" in the linked post you provided is actually just a general pre-release reference.  In the end the NIC teaming functionality is for Server SKUs (now called Windows Server 2012), which is why it's not working for you. :)
