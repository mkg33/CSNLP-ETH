You don't need a patch panel, you can terminate one end with an RJ-45 connector and plug it right into the switch and you can terminate the other end into a wall plate. It's not as clean, but it'll work and save you time/labor if you really want.
I would personally stick with CAT5e for home wiring.  CAT6 will show no improvement, and will cost you more.
I would also avoid a patch panel.  I think they are overkill for a home project, and just considerably add to the cost.  I would just terminate with RJ45 and hook it up to the switch.  I personally just got creative with a shelf and some zip ties.  I mounted the shelf pretty high up in the laundry room so you can't see the cables at all.
Go with Cat6. Those who say stay with Cat5e are probably the same ones who said you would not need anything more than MS-DOS to run your computer. Cat6 means you are not wiring the system again in a couple of years.
I just have one thing to add on the patch panel, and that is you especially don't need one if you're planning on having everything patched.  You still want to label the ends in case of a fault, but if everything's always patched than there's really no need.  Now if you're going to need to change out what's patched where on occasion, then a patch panel can be a time saver.
However, if you want no cables coming out from the wall without a socket, then, patch panel can keep the thing more organised. I think it is worth it for my home. i don't know about you, but this boils down to costs.
These are bandwidth rating and for the matter the current crop of Cat5e and Cat6 cables would be more than necessary for Gigabit ethernet. The 10Gbps ethernet is based on a 500MHz bandwidth cable, and I don't see it being useful for the time being for home users or even small to medium businesses. There is simply not enough data to put through these channels.
