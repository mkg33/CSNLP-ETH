So, in order to always run cmd.exe as admin, make a .reg file with the following content and run it:
I use the tool nircmd, which is an advanced command line tool. Here you can elevate programs easily via commandline on demand:
Make a Shortcut on your desktop for the command prompt, right click on the shortcut and select properties, on the shortcut tab click advanced button, when another window opens tick the run as administrator box, click ok, ok to close both windows.
Windows 7 navigate to C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories
If it's not possible when you start the cmd, could it be done via a command inside of it, like for example sudo on UNIX systems?
I know about Ctrl+Shift+Enter in the search list or adding a Registry Entry for a new Context Menu, but I was wondering if there's an easier way.
You can supplement with /savecred, but that one is not recommended - it allows running ANY application as admin without typing in password. And It does not require tinkering with UAC.
You can run any program with admin privileges by making a string value entry in the Registry under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers with the path to the file as the name and a value of ~ RUNASADMIN.
