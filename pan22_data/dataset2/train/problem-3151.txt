You didn't say what OS, or what virus checker.  Some virus checkers (Norton for my situation) are WAY too active and don't always show up accurately in the process table.  If you can do it safely, turn off the virus checker, reboot and see if it improves the responsiveness.
Try finding out how healthy it is by installing some software that asks the drive for its S.M.A.R.T. readings.
Another potential silent hog is the "Microsoft indexing service".  If you don't need it then turn it off since for most folks it's just a PITA.
Yeah, defrag is good.  I would strongly recommend uninstalling anything you don't need, cleaning up the HDD to delete anything you aren't actually using, then running a defrag.  If you can get to 30% or more free space and low fragmentation it should get better.
Make sure the disk drive is not more than 90% full. If the drive is fuller than that, then defragging won't help (much, or for long). If there's less than 10% free space, then Windows may have trouble because it tries to swap memory to disk, since the machine only has 1GB RAM. 
Silly question, but have you tried defragging it? - I'd suggest jkdefrag (there's a newer version called mydefrag but its bloaty rubbish IMO) since it does a few things regular defrag won't do - since excessive hard drive spinups can be a result of excessive fragmentation
You might want to run something like SpinRite (grc.com) on your hard drives to see if they are in "near-fail" mode.  If you get a lot of retry events on the HD then it will slow down greatly also lead to more heat than usual, thus the excessive fan operation.
