As an added benefit, if you create the chart yourself, you can animate it so that it comes in by series or by category or even by individual bar if you have that much to say about each one. 
First, there are two different ways to embed a chart from excel. I'm not sure which one you did, but try the other. Those two ways are:
Second (and I think this is the better option), is to create the chart in PowerPoint directly. Copy the data from Excel and in PPT create a new slide with a content layout. Choose the chart icon and it will take you to a sub-program where you can create the chart. Paste your data into the datasheet it gives you. It has almost all the same tools and options as excel charts and works the same way. 
b- make sure the chart is on its own separate sheet in excel and make sure that sheet is the active sheet when you close and save the file. Then in your PPT slide, go to the insert menu --> "object" -- and select the "create from file" option. Browse for your Excel file and it will insert in the slide.
When you're done creating the chart, click on the slide outside the placeholder and it will take you back to PPT with your new chart on the slide. If you need to do further edits, just double click on the chart and it will take you back to the sub program.
