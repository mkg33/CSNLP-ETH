What could be an issue or are my graphical cards really not good enoughfor a good use of Windows 10?
My issue is pretty broad/difficult to explain in detail. When I look to pictures or my background it looks al fine. But my text looks a bit blurry since I've upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I did even a whole reinstall. 
It's not only an issue on Windows 10 itself but also in a game which is using my NVIDIA driver the text looks blurry. I don't know much about how good or bad graphical cards are. (This laptop is nearly 4 years old but works still fine). 
I updated my Drivers using the Intel(R) Driver Update Utility 2.6 and for my NVIDA driver I downloaded the latest from their website. Windows tells me the best drivers are already installed for my graphical cards.
I have it off myself and the text in outlook looks blurry but flipping it on seems to make it smoother
Right-click on the background and select "Display Settings" then Change the size of text, apps, and other items: to 100%. After your graphics card driver is installed, sometimes it will default to 175%, which will make text within windows blurry and oversized.
