everything is simplified as much as possible with easy data/troubleshooting so diagnosing a problem is easy and reliability and ease of administration is maximized.  If we could have everything in one pane, it would be nice.
We are a tech company and pride ourselves on being agile and lean.  We are taking a step back to evaluate potential problem areas before they become problems.
Basically I'm looking for an outside opinion.  So far, the cisco switches have been working just fine.  Do I proactively change them?  Should I buy more Netgears and make a stack?  Bang for the buck, it seems like Netgear is the way to go.  What am I giving up by staying with Netgear?  Or do I just leave the current switches with a spare on hand in case one goes I just change it out?  The consultant is saying the Cisco switches have more reporting ability to integrate into 3rd party monitoring tools.
We are looking for how we can have a more reliable, simpler network.  How can we keep out administrative burden low, and work smarter not harder when it comes to our infrastructure?
We had one of our core switches (netgear fiber stack) fail and it took a while to troubleshoot it because problems were intermittent. 
I have a new consultant who has recommended changing out our client switches to Cisco catalyst.  The switches he wants to replace are older Cisco SG500 switches, with 2 being POE and 2 non-POE.
