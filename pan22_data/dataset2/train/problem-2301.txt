Since they are bringing the server to down during size changes , the script need to run by own once they started the server.
For example, initially if RAM size is 8 gb we set up the threshold (65% from 8gb) based on current size.
Recently the team has increased the RAM size and started the server but there is no change in threshold (which means script doesn't run by own).
Due to some need if they increase the size to 16 GB we need to set up the threshold(65% from 16GB) manually.To avoid that I created  shell script which uses JON CLI. to update threshold value( during maintenance  they shut down the  servers and increase the RAM size as per their need.)
In case if server(which is in in cloud ) RAM size is increased  we need to manually change the threshold level using GUI .To avoid that I wrote a shell script which uses JON CLI to update the threshold of RAM (based on current RAM size), script is working and no problem in that.
You can make any executable run at startup using a cron job.  To add a cron job, enter the command crontab -e.  This will open the cron table editor.  Now, enter the line @reboot /path/to/execuable and save and quit.  Make sure to replace "/path/to/executable" with the path to your script.
We are using JON tool to monitor our infrastructure .we set up the threshold for RAM usage(60%,65% of total RAM)using tool GUI.
