In Kubernetes, if you want to expose a Port to the outside world, you can use Service with Type NodePort or LoadBalancer.
For example, if you have a cluster with three nodes with external IP addresses 12.13.14.151, 12.13.14.152, 12.13.14.153, you can use any of 12.13.14.151:32463, 12.13.14.152:32463, 12.13.14.153:32463 in your RoboMongo connection settings.
Type LoadBalancer is usually used on cloud providers since they provide external load balancers for Kubernetes.
In line port: 27017, we specified your MongoDB port, it is also usually specified in Deployment for MongoDB.
In line nodePort: 32463, we specified the external port. There, any port from the range 30000-32767 can be posted. Or it can be skipped during the creation, in that case, Kubernetes assigns the port number automatically, and you can find it using kubectl describe service mongodb-service or kubectl get service mongodb-service -o yamlcommands.
After that, you can use any client, e.g. RoboMongo, to reach you MongoDB. You need to use the IP address of any node and the port from the nodePort line, not from the port line.
