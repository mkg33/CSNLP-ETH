Not using the all ones host address because it coincides with the broadcast address I was comfortable with, as it is a valid destination address already so when used it would be impossible to distinguish between those.
I know this is an old thread but I was researching this myself and I didn't stop at "host zero isn't used because it is the network number" because I couldn't see why that mattered. Even if it is the network number it shouldn't stop it being used as a valid address as the mechanism to determine network number (ANDing the netmask) will still work with it to determine the network number.
Early in the internet days, x.x.x.0 was used as the broadcast address for a network.  That was later changed to x.x.x.255.  I remember that there were options on SunOS to configure the broadcast either as .0 or .255 during that period.  So I guess for safety, .0 and .255 have been always a reserved numbers.
The more fully explained reason we can't use host zero is that it is also a broadcast address - although RFC1812 section 4.2.3.1 states that a router receiving packets addressed to it "SHOULD silently discard" them (their emphasis - not mine). However the same paragraph does allow those packets to be treated as a broadcast.
