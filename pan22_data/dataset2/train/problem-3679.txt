If you have lots of servers/networking gear with this feature I would look into purchasing  a serial server.  It makes it really easy to manage your servers remotely. 
Access to the devices not only requires knowledge of and access to the bastion host, but also access to the lights-out management device, most of which can be configured to have a separate authentication scheme.
Aside from this, one of the key uses is the ability to use the management interface to obtain server health remotely, and pipe this into management software. This is vital to  business's with many server where checking all these servers individually would be a nightmare.
One of the useful features of many management cards is the ability to access the console. This helps in troubleshooting remote machines that will not boot into the OS (and so load remote access services). This has saved many trips to a DC when the server has rebooted and is wanting a key press to acknowledge an issue!
You can further restrict access by applying ACL's to restrict access to the bastion host so that connections can only come from authorised management stations.
We have a 'out-of-band' management network for our iLOs. Access to it is firewalled, and only the engineers get to go on it. It's extremely useful for troubleshooting, and also for server deployments.
