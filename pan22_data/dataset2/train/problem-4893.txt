so ideally yyou should use the te2/1/3 or 2/1/4 with the 10 g SFP as the first 2 ports will not support the SFP-10-R modules.
The 1900 switch has 100-fx ports, which as the name implies, is 100 Mb.  The Gigabit fiber ports can't operate at that speed.
Verify you have fiber transmit and receive flipped on one end. If fiber A is on the left make sure fiber B is on the left at the other end. If you're not sure just try flipping one end. It'll light up if that's the issue.
Cisco 3850 Series Switch is a 10-Gbps network switch, which means you need to use 10G SFP+ optical module or under 10G optical module, such as 1G SFP. And make sure the optical modules is correctly connected with the corresponding port on the switch. Hope this would help. 
Added Fiber links between 3850's for increased performance.  I can't get data transfer through the fiber uplinks.
Try the switchport trunk nonegotiate command on the interface. I've had to do this with 3750's and 3850's in the past. 
As a "Band-Aid" I installed Fiber media convertors to connect the fiber backbone to the VLANs.  Data does pass through the convertors to the VLAN ports.
Verify it's a compatible GBIC for Cisco. (There are unofficial commands to use non-Cisco GBICs but I'll let you research that and use at your own risk)
