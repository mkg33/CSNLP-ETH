As far as placement of your modem and router, I'd suggest checking this article out: http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/wirelessproducts/qt/locate_aprouter.htm
For configuration, set your wifi to use the least busy wifi channel. If you have a lot of wireless networks in your area, this can make a big difference. Also try to use non-overlapping channels between your two devices (channels 1,6,or 11). 
If you want your two devices to broadcast the same wifi SSID (name), you should configure your ASUS to NOT provide DHCP (make your Arris provide DHCP for the entire network, or vice versa). If you do this, you should be able to roam the building without having to worry about having to switch wifi networks if you loose signal. It should be noted though, when initially connecting to your wifi network, the device will usually decide to connect to the strongest signal. However, it isn't guaranteed that the devices switches to the other access point if/when the signal gets stronger. Most of the time, the device will stay connected to the initial access point as long as possible.
