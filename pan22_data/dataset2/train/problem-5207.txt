Once you done this your pc can connect the whole day but when you turn if off sometimes you will experience the same again but I suggest to do the method that I tell you.
Now I'm searching how to maintain the signal permanently even if you turn off the pc thousand times and I dont need to reinstall that wlan.
Its all in the device manager that you need to study further. Just try the above things and you can connect again.
I also experienced the same. After 2 weeks of struggle I found out that It's like the wireless lan card is keep on expiring. Usually you can see the wlan at program at features but its not working at all. Remove and reinstall it. You should shut down and turn off the switch properly to take effect the reinstallation ( dont use restart) Once it (wlan) appears at Device Manager, you must disable the "wifi miniport adapter" which is included ( window 7) and this one makes your pc wifi signal keep on disappearing....Turn "enable" also the adhoc support 802.11 at advance setting. You must turn off also in power management the "allow the computer to turn off this device"entry.
