I am aware that some VNC server applications allow you to enter the title of an applications to share only that windows, i have not tried this sadly as i haven't had the need as of yet
If you're able to go Windows only at the server end, then modern Windows servers can do this natively with Terminal Services Remote App (or wiki link) but this is pretty much Windows clients only too. Alternatively there's Citrix running on a Windows server that does this similarly but much better and can use pretty much any modern device (even down to iPhone/iPad) as a client.
Webex claims that their system can be used in Windows, Mac, or Linux, but I haven't used it myself.  We use Citrix's gotomeeting at work, which has Mac and Windows clients and the ability to share a specific window (not application... if we're sharing a website and it opens a popup window, gotomeeting usually pauses until we close the popup or have it switch to sharing the popup window).
I am surprised that no one has mentioned X11 forwarding over SSH, yet.  I believe this would meet your needs.
VNC can't do that, you're right. However lots of other systems do such as Citrix's products but you will really struggle to find an app that will do that from an OSX 'server', fine as a client though.
Amusingly enough, VNC on Linux does something pretty close to this by default, infuriating a lot of people who are used to how VNC on Windows works.  On Linux, rather than sharing the actual desktop of whoever is logged in, Linux VNC creates a virtual desktop that is only visible to the VNC client, and only applications run in that virtual desktop are available to the client.
