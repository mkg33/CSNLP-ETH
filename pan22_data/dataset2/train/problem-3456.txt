You said your attempts have so far ended with a panic. That means the kernel is failing to access the root filesystem - and with Clonezilla, the root filesystem is in the filesystem.squashfs file which is supposed to be downloaded by the initrd once the network interface has been configured. 
I am not very familiar with udhcpd, but it appears to be a very minimal DHCP client. So it might have the following properties:
It is possible to compile a monolithic kernel that will automatically attempt to get itself an IP address using basic BOOTP/DHCP, but this is not the way it is usually done.
- after bootloader gets the kernel started, can you see another DHCP query? That would be udhcpd getting the network parameters. 
- After that, there should be a TFTP request for the filesystem.squashfs file. Is it successful or not? If not, what is the actual TFTP request sent and which pathname it maps to in the filesystem of the TFTP server?  Is that file present at the correct pathname, and is the TFTP server allowed to send it?
The modern approach is to use a bootloader (e.g. pxelinux or iPXE) which will download two files: the kernel and an initramfs/initrd file. The initramfs/initrd file can contain kernel modules (to be loaded as necessary, on detection of matching hardware) and utilities needed for initialization of critical hardware so that the boot can proceed. In the case of booting from network, this includes initialization of the network interfaces. What happens after that is determined by the combination of the code/scripts built into the initramfs/initrd file, and the boot options given to the kernel by the bootloader (most commonly using the APPEND keyword).
- it may expect the network interface to be powered up ahead of time (e.g. "ifconfig eth0 up" or "ip link set eth0 up", depending on whether the old "ifconfig" configuration command or the newer "ip" is available)
So do you know exactly what went wrong with your attempts? Have you monitored the network traffic with Wireshark or similar? 
- it may not handle the actual interface set-up after it has received the DHCP parameters: instead, it will pass them to a script, which is expected to use commands like "ifconfig", "ip" and/or "route" to set up the network interface according to the parameters received.
The problem with troubleshooting network boot is that when something goes wrong at boot time, the Linux kernel and the associated utilities often spew out so much information that the first error messages get scrolled off the screen. And usually that first error message is the most important one: it is very likely that all the subsequent errors are consequences of that first failure.
I think you may have got unnecessarily fixated to the idea of building a kernel; it is very unlikely to be the root cause of your problem. You are referring to https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=1963 which is now 7 years old information. (In full-featured Linux distributions, "ifup -a" is a common high-level command to initialize all network interfaces; in compact set-ups like Clonezilla the ifup command is usually not present.)
Have you tried Clonezilla Live, a version of Clonezilla that is explicitly intended to be PXE netbootable?
