Note that if a user at the remote end has privileged access they initiate a connection with a specific source port - including port 22. By doing that they can use this ACL to connect FROM port 22 on 10.0.0.254 to any port on 192.168.0.20. 
I'm trying to find a way to setup a bi-directional L2L IPSec tunnel, but with differing group-policy filter ACLs for both sides.
However, I do not want the remote host to be able to access my local host's TCP port 22 (SSH) because there's no requirement to do so -- there's only a requirement for my host to access the remote host's SFTP server, not vice-versa. But since these filter ACLs are bidirectional, line 1 is also permitting the remote host to access my host's SSH Server.
The documentation I'm reading doesn't seem to clear to me if this is possible; help/clarification much appreciated.
According to the docs, VPN filters are bi-directional, you always specify the remote host first (10.0.0.254), followed by the local host and (optionally) port number, as per the documentation.
This is almost certainly not your intention, but is an example of the type of security risk you are exposing yourself to with simple ACLs like these.
