Then follow steps 3 to 5 from above.  If it doesn't boot, you might have to format the partition with Windows XP on it first (you can use a portable Linux distro or BartPE to do it).
Since you mentioned PXE, and than implies a network, have you considered sharing the DVD from a machine that has a DVD drive, then connecting to the network share and using the installer that way? Trying to go the PXE route will mean spending a lot of time and effort that's worth a lot more than the $10 you'd spend on a larger USB drive.
You can typically determine if your machine can support PXE by looking at the bootable media options in you BIOS screen. The exact option to look for will vary by vendor. Holding F12 down during a boot sequence frequently works.
Alternative solution:  Follow these #1 and #2 steps instead of those above (warning: I have not tried it)
Well you can easily install Windows 7 drives  using USB drives, that is the best way thing to do if you dont have DVD drives.
I'd recommend just borrowing a suitable USB key, it will save you a lot of hassle and I'm sure you'll be able to find someone who can spare one for a couple of hours.
