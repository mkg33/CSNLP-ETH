Problem has been solved, thank you for your suggestions. Fact are gathered for each host by ios_facts module. Accessing this data via hostvars saves correct information to the file. 
When I run a playbook I am getting a correct results as long as devices what I am connecting to, have different IP address. For example, when I connect to 172.16.110.2 and 172.16.110.3 return is correct I have two row entries in created file. When I connect devices with IP 172.16.110.11 and then 172.16.110.1 it creates a file with one row entry (the one which was last connected). Play recap shows me that all devices has been connected, action redirected to localhost and changed=1. 
Lineinfile is a weird choice here. It’s a module used to add lines to a configuration file (for example) and make sure a line is there, it’s not meant for things like logging, which you seem to be doing. Since there’s a large overlap in the IP address, fair chance it matches and the line is not added since the module assumes it’s already there. I’d look for an ansible module which is better suited for logging. I only run ansible on network devices, don’t do anything like this, so I don’t have a good suggestion.
I am new in Ansible and wondering why I am getting invalid results. Here is the short script which should return an inventory informations like SN, model, SW version and name.
