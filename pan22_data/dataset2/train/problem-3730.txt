You can use Active Directory as Kerberos KDC and use HTTP SPNEGO authentication (or Kerberos if that's not available). This will negotiate the authentication using Kerberos over HTTP (so your password will be encrypted, amongst other things). Active Directory works fine against the MIT Kerberos 5 client libraries (available on Linux and OSX), and of course Active Directory works with a Windows client. The downside is that it requires extra settings on the client side (browser or command-line client, I think svn can use MIT Kerberos 5).
Alternatively, if you trust the Apache Httpd admin, you could use Active Directory as an LDAP server from there. I don't think that's possible with Digest authentication (it's more complex because you'd need the hash to be in a specific format on the LDAP side), so you'd need Basic+SSL.
I'm surprised by your slowdown factory of 15 regarding SSL, even with big files. There's always an overhead for the SSL/TLS handshake, but the overhead should be minimal after that (it becomes almost negligible with larger files in fact).
