If I use VLC to capture instead does it offer this capability? ie Can I set it to capture from my device for a certain time period and then stop? If so how?
I am currently undergoing a project converting all my parents old home movies on VHS to DVD (and also putting them on a harddrive), we have hundreds of these things and they are all around 2 hours long so naturally I want to try and make my process as painless as possible.
Sorry if this is a vague/stupid question I just don't really know how to approach this. The machine I am using is running Windows Vista if that is at all relevant.
I have device called the EzGrabber for streaming from a vcr to my computer and the software that comes with it, the software works but is very bare-bones and consists of basically a start recording and stop recording button. I would like to be able to set a timer so that I can stop recording after >2hours has passed so I don't have to be around every time I am capturing a movie.
If not is there a way to automate tasks within an application (third-party) to happen after a time period? (In this case stopping recording in VLC or the EzGrabber software) If so how?
