When I use the full bandwidth my ISP is providing, I get insanely high latency in every website, more than 1000ms.
What I want to know is, what is my ISP doing wrong? Anything in their configuration of routers or something else? Please help me out so that I can at least point them out their problem.
The solution to bufferbloat is Smart Queue Management, using algorithms like Cake and FQ-CoDel. SQM is supported by many aftermarket Linux-based open source router firmware distributions such as OpenWrt, and some vendors have started to build SQM into their factory firmware as well.
There are two widespread false myths that well-meaning but under-informed geeks often spread when this subject comes up, so let me do some myth-busting:
Run http://dslreports.com/speedtest (if it supports your country) from a desktop/laptop web browser to check your bufferbloat grade.
High latency when the link is saturated is the telltale sign of a widespread router/modem design flaw known as bufferbloat.
One turn-key solution is the IQrouter from evenroute.com, which is a decent TP-Link model preloaded with OpenWrt, with SQM set up ahead of time, and with some custom software to keep SQM tuned at all times.
I did a test on 3 of my friends' internet connection, including mine. I took a reading of latencies of google.com before starting a download and took another reading during a download. And all 3 of their latencies were very close. It didn't fluctuate that much. But mine instantly went above 1000ms and mostly stuck around 1800-3000ms. I did a traceroute and found that most of the latency gets generated in the Default Getaway of my ISP. This is a recent problem with my ISP. It was fine before. And they are simply not doing anything regarding this.
