A slightly more advanced camera does move. All entities and tiles are drawn without offset and the position from which you're rendering changes. This is very similar to the most basic camera, and you can still perform many of the same optimizations for selective rendering (only calling draw on what the camera can see), on both. It's essentially just a different way of thinking about it.
The typical way of handling this is to create a camera object. The simplest form of a camera is just a position. This simple camera defines the "center" of the current view. So you don't modify all the positions of your tiles/entities, you just subtract the camera coordinates from the positions when drawing. In this situation, the camera does not "move".
While the camera and your character will share a position most of the time, you may still want to have them as separate values, so you can, for example, stop the camera from moving when it reaches the end of the world, but allow the player to continue moving.
