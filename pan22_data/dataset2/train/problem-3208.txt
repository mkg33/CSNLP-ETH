I executed the process after entering to sub-folders. So I tried in that way too. But nothing happened. 
Look at the -r/-R and -d/-D options on the man page for screen .  Running screen -D -RR -x ... (workstuff) works for me when a detached screen is not letting me reattach.
In terminal (in OpenSuse Linux environment) the process I have suspended with "Ctrl-z". It worked well. But when I restarted the SSH Shell after an hour to check either the process completed or not and entered the command "screen -x "...." (workstuff name). I got message as "There is no screen to be attached matching "..." (workstuff name). 
I am running an MPI program with SSH secure shell. Due to Wi-Fi disconnection, my la[top looses connection with server and causes failure of running process at server. 
Do you need to see the screen output?  If not, simply run the process with an ampersand (&) at the end like so:
As per above suggested solutions, I tried to use "screen -dmSL" command with defining the "workstuff" named with another name and then the command (which is in the form - "./mpirun ......") that I have given to execute the process.
