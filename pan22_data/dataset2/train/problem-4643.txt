This article is from the Windows 2000 TechNet, but the principles and actions should still apply. It's got great troubleshooting and workflow steps to help you identify DNS resolution issues. Keep in mind, nslookup is kind've a PITA if reverse zones aren't established.
However the name can still be resolved by windows, probably using what is called NetBIOS over TCP/IP that works like an automatic DNS server system with auto server discovery on a LAN but doesn't scale well and is a bit hit and miss on it actually working.
If none of the machines on you LAN can complete a nslookup, then it's likely your local DNS can't resolve the hostname properly. It could be an issue with your DNS server, or with just the records for that host.
I would try to nslookup other local hosts, to see if the LAN DNS is functioning. You could also try to nslookup the hostname in question on a public DNS i.e. nslookup targetHost 208.67.222.222 (openDNS), though it sounds like public resolution is working fine. 
As people have been pointing out your DNS server on 192.168.1.10 is not setup correctly or is not the right DNS server.
Check the DNS Server entries on the problematic host. Chances are, it's not using the same DNS server as everything else that's working correctly.
I feel like your DNS server is not properly set up on the .10 address. My guess is that your TCP/IP stack is using multiple DNS servers and one of them has pointed to the outside world. Go back and reconfigure your .10 address to your outside DNS servers.
