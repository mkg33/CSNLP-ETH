Because the problem is likely hardware, you'll need to either test your hardware, or find someone else who did. So go search LaunchPad for your problem, and see if someone's already filed a bug report. If the status is Fix Released, you're fine. If you can't find any relevant bugs, it's probably not fixed. Figure out the video hardware you've got, as that might be a good search query.
dist-upgrades should work, and nobody should be generally recommending against doing them. I've upgraded my desktop Ubuntu install every release since the beginning. Ten times now! 
Certainly, a few were hairy. I made the mistake of trying out Automatix once to see what made it so awesome, and a few problems arose (recoverable in my case). One time the nvidia-glx package completely broke necessitating a recovery from LiveCD (this one led to the creation of -proposed). One time the upgrade failed because an artwork package conflicted with some important packages. Every time I was able to pop in a CD, chroot and fix upgrade problems.
But heres the deal: the failure you describe is hardware dependent. Surveying they general population can result in 99 percent of people claiming success, even as you observe 100 percent failure rates. I wouldn't be surprised if the same thing happened from a normal install.
