you can save yourself thousands of dollars per server by using linux (or freebsd or even opensolaris) based servers rather than windows.
Look into Small Business Server 2008 (SBS 2008).  It gives you a ton of Microsoft software for very little startup costs including Exchange, SQL Server, ISA, etc.  It also allows you to run Windows Server on three servers (a lot more if you use Hyper-V to virtualize).
or if only a few staff members need to use a windows-only app, you could still standardise on Ubuntu desktops and use VirtualBox to install Windows on their machines - greatly reducing the number of Windows and application licenses you have to buy.
Also: If you're an IT company, you can join the Microsoft Partner Program and I think their Action Pack contains a bunch of licenses to everything you need for $300/yr. 
I'm trying to figure out how to build a decent IT infrastructure for a new business on a budget and I was wondering if anyone has any tips or ideas on how to build a Windows IT infrastructure cheaply in a new business.

are there any specialised windows-only services that you need to run, or do you just need the usual services like file & print sharing, tape backup, internet gateway/firewall, web server or web proxy, email, sql database, etc?
you can save yourself hundreds of dollars per machine by using a desktop-oriented linux distribution like Ubuntu.
are there any windows-only apps that your users will need, or do you just need the usual word-processing, spreadsheets, database, email and web browsing?  and if you only need one or two windows-only apps, will they run on Linux under Wine?
If you want to build IT infrastructure on a budget the first thing to do is to think long and hard about whether you really need Windows or not, and there are two parts to that question:
