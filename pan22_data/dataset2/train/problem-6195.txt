Geared to Django installs under Cygwin, but it should be a suitable bootstrap.  Worked out pretty well for me...
For ease of use, I think the combination of Ubuntu and VirtualBox will be a good fit for you for your first foray into virtualization.
Package management is even easier under Ubuntu than Cygwin. You can select Add/Remove... from the Applications menu, then enter "python" in the search box, click the check box next to the version you want, then click the Apply Changes button to install. You can also use the Synaptic Package Manager in the System>Administration menu for more detailed package management. Or you can install packages from the command line in a terminal using apt-get (start a terminal by selecting Terminal from the Applications>Accessories menu).
This seems to be a decent tutorial on installing those under Windows XP. Here's a video tutorial for installing the Guest Additions once you get Ubuntu running.
Otherwise, I would look at ActivePython (www.activestate.com/activepython/)* if you want to stay on Windows.
Check out IronPython. Even if you don't like MS, you gotta love the way it hooks into .Net libraries but still gives you access to the standard python library. IronPython in Action is a great way to get started with IPY...lots of good examples including desktop scripting.
In addition to some of the capabilities I mentioned in a comment above, you'll be able to mount devices under the guest OS such as the host's physical CD/DVD drive (in addition to mounting ISO images), USB drives and memory sticks. You'll also have access to the host's network connection and will be able to browse the internet using Firefox (which is installed by default) or another browser that you might install.
