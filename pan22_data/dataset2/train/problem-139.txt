I know that I saw a few presentations on this at the last meeting, but the AGU's new abstract system absolutely sucks for trying to go through large numbers of abstracts and/or to browse by discipline.  (and sub discipline?  not a chance).
There might be good information from people on here, but you might also want to ask the scientific community, as there's typically talks and posters on this at the fall AGU meeting each year.  Much of it has to deal with workflow management for earth science data, which might have some stricter requirements than forecasting efforts.
The terms used to describe the field are all over the place -- I've seen it referred to as 'cyber infrastructure' (mostly an NSF thing), 'science informatics', etc.  Sorry I can't be more specific, as this isn't quite my field.  (complaining about the lack of documentation for this sort of thing, yes, but I deal with serving data well after it's been generated).
Some of the folks were using workflow management systems (eg. Kepler and Taverna), but I don't think they got into the system aspects of provenance nearly as much the grid and compute cluster folks did.  Even the earth science folks, who seemed to be taking provenance more seriously than other fields still seemed focused on data inputs more than what type of processor / OS / versions of libraries installed / etc.
