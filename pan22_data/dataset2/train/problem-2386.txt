No other way worked for me except setting the screen size explicitly following this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb-p9NOkcT8 (I used Debian, the video uses Ubuntu)
Clipboard sharing works and you can resize the screen to full-screen. Performance is sluggish but OK for general use.
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=hyperv_fb:3840x2160 (You can change 3840x2160 to whatever screen size you want)
I have settled on using XRDP to get full-screen GUI for Linux guests running on Windows 10 Hyper-V hosts.  It is functional but still not as performent as VMware Workstation.  Install xrdp and xrdp-sesman, start the services. Then you can connect from your host to the guest using Windows' RDP client.
Most current distributions should work with XRDP out of the box as installed by the package manager.  CentOS 7 requires that you have gnome-session-classic installed via yum for XRDP to work even if you are using a different DE.
If you happen to be using Vagrant, once you've install XRDP then you can use vagrant rdp to connect from the host.
