When I follow all the steps except changing the router's IP (which should be safe, since downstairs router uses 10.0.0.1 instead of 192.168.0.1), I can fix all settings and connect to the router, but can not access the internet.
This setup has been working fine for months until earlier this week. Upstairs was having problems, but downstairs is normal. I reset my (upstairs) router, a D-Link DIR-655 and attempted to reconfigure how it was before we had this problem. Now I am unable to find any settings that work. I follow guides found online: disable DHCP, change the IP of the router, save settings (since other settings to change are on a different page), wait for router to save/reboot, then navigate to other settings, but when I do try to change the other settings, I can no longer view the router's settings in my browser (neither using the new IP address not the default one). So, my only option is then to reset router again and start over.
Downstairs is our main router, connected (wired) to a PC. Various mobile devices connect here wirelessly. Upstairs, via power line adapter, is my router set up with identical SSID and password for Wi-Fi and one computer wired through its LAN.
