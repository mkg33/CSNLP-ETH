With these things in mind, you should be able to forecast the settings you need in /etc/my.cnf and for your hardware.

Forget about high-end hardware, you need to jump straight to a commodity cluster system. I'd recommend starting with 4 boxes so you can get to grips with both sharding and replication from the start. 4Gb memory (although this is where you should be flexible - adding memory is a lot easier than CPU / NICs / disk bandwidth) and dual physical cores, and mirrored local storage would probably be a sensible starting point. They should be isolated on their on 1Gb LAN segment, and jumbo frames is probably a good idea.
The maximum innodb_log_file_size is 2047M (InnoDB will not work with 2G or 2048M, you can check the MySQL source code)
People like HP, Dell, IBM and supermicro sell this kind of machine the most so there should be lots of good deals around.
Obviously you've given us very little detail to work on but if you're looking at buying your own hardware then I'd suggest that a really standard dual-CPU system, initially with a single mid-range E56xx series Xeon, either 3 x 2GB or 3 x 4GB of 1333/1066 DDR3 memory, 2 or 4 1Gbps NICs, a hardware RAID controller with a mirrored pair of either small cheapo (147-300GB) 7.2krpm SATA or 10krpm SAS boot disks then a RAID 10 array of either 4 decent quality 7.2krpm 2TB disks or 4 x 600GB 10/15krpm SAS disks. That should hit most if not all of your performance and resilience requirements plus give you a very quick and easy way to double your CPU capacity and also add a lot more memory as required, plus a reasonable set of disks too.
Assuming this is going to be used for more than just simple logging, you need a lot processor/memory - although you've given no information about how the system is likely to be used.
