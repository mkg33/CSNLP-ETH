If you want FF as defult, you can use the IE tab addon to check for windows updates. Personally I'd recommend this instead of using IE but it's up to you of course!
Lately there has been a truly odd issue that occurs after multiple users use the same workstation. We do observe the Internet Explorer icon on the user desktop has been changed to a Google icon and the icon now spawns a copy of Chrome. Efforts to replace the IE icon will work but eventually will be overwritten. 
I do not believe this is part of a vast conspiracy, however this quirky behavior has occurred on our network. We have considered that there may be an issue with the configuration of Chrome as it was installed on the original machine before the Ghost image was created. We also realize that the Google Pack is a better version ( albeit beta ) to use in a Windows domain rather than the version commonly downloaded from google.com/chrome
i have Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Google Chrome installed on the same machine, and I can use any of them without problems.
Loads of good answers, but I'll add something which may be useful. If you want to make Firefox the default, you can go to Tools, Options, Advanced. Click the "Check now" button (check if FF is the default browser) and it'll give you the default state and should offer to make it so. This should kick Chrome from being the default and you should then be able to make as defult what you want. 
As for Chrome taking over, I've never had any problems with it, and any choice to make it the default browser has been left to me. It definitely does not delete shortcuts to other browsers. If the shortcuts have disappeared by themselves, it's possible you have gotten a virus or some other malicious software installed.
We are currently working in a Windows domain with XP workstations installed through ghosted images with a custom configuration that includes Chrome.
