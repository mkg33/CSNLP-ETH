So, they're using 3DES because they have a higher preference for that weaker cipher, and you allow it to be used.  The only way to stop it from being picked by a client with dubious preferences is to remove it.
My suspicion is that it's a design choice. By choosing a less computationally intensive cipher, you use less power and therefore get more battery life, which is something consumers notice and care about in a smartphone, and in contrast, when it comes to security, as long as the end user sees that lock icon, "it's secure," and that's all they care about (if they even care that much).
This behavior is determined by the cipher list passed from the client to the server, where the client tells the server what ciphers it supports, and which priority each of those ciphers has.  Android, in particular, has made some insecure choices about the preference order of its cipher suites, preferring very insecure ciphers over secure ones that it supports, without giving any explanation as to why.
