I moved my site's database to RDS a few months ago.  At the time, I finally decided I was ready to have a dedicated database server, and during the process of setting one up on EC2, I discovered RDS.  I've been really happy with it.
This mainly depends on your database size and workload. If you don't need to have access to the binary logfiles and you have some smaller databases, you can simply run a mysqldump from a server elsewhere and store the SQL dump outside on your local harddrive, on a server harddrive or in Amazon S3. This won't give you permanent replication however, and the backup might take some time.
It sounds like read replication to a server outside of AWS is out of the question (but correct me if I'm wrong there).  Do I have any options?
The problem is this:  While I understand that Amazon is running great backups of my database, and I'm excited about that, I don't feel good about having all my eggs in one basket.  Because RDS won't give you access to the binlog, I'm not sure how/if it's possible to back up elsewhere - I'd like to keep a backup on an entirely separate service, and I'd like it to be as up to date as possible.
