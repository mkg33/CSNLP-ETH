It depends if your BIOS allows you to boot from drive B. If it does, you install Ubuntu as normal, but after the partitioning there is an advanced option allowing you to define where the boot loader is to be saved. Put in the reference for Drive B. 
Ubuntu by default will install it's own boot-loader (grub), and add any other OS's it detects to it's boot menu, there by allowing you to dual boot easily.  They don't know anything about eachother, and it won't affect the windows boot sequence in any way.  Just out of curiosity, how do you plan on booting to the other OS without a change in the boot-loader?  
If you have no problem going into the BIOS everytime, just disable the "other" drive in the BIOS and no operating system in the world will be able to "see" it.
If you want to make super-duper sure that Drive A isn't touched during the install, I'd do the following:
Basically, you need to make Drive B first in your BIOS boot loader, then configure GRUB (a small boot-loader program) to know about the windows installation on Drive A. 
"no knowledge of each other" is impossible, depending on how you define it. Something has to be aware of both OS installs. 
If your BIOS does not allow you to boot from Drive B, but the boot loader on a floppy or usb stick and boot from there instead.
Hardly worth the effort, though. It is not like Windows and Linux hate each other and try to destroy their "enemy" when they see that another OS is installed.
Adding Linux to the windows bootloader is not a mayor thing, it just means adding a bin file to C:\ and editing the bootloader configuration. There are tons of howtos on the web and there is not a lot that can go wrong if you are careful.
