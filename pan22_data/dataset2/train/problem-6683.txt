I have recently found out about Steamworks SDK and after reading through some of the documentation and information from other sources I was left with a few questions.
I found Steamworks because I was interested in how Steam handles multiplayer in games, like co-op games with the lobby creation and all.
This would be cruicial to know since adding networking late in to the development is very difficult.
To avoid port forwarding and play a 2-player game, it is best to choose the Steam P2P Network API. It uses libjingle to punch through a NAT, so port forwaring is no longer necessary. It's a bit slower than, say, a UDP socket connection, but it's still faster than you need for your case.
You can use Steamworks4j to use the Steamworks API in Java. There are also some examples of how to use Steam P2P and Lobbies. For more information, see Steam API Doc
When it comes to networking, how would I program the game to use Steamworks lobby creation? Would I just program it normally with a client server? Because normally that would require atleast one of the users to forward their ports but would the Steamworks work around that? Or do I implement the Steamworks right away?
