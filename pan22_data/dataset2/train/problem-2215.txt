Also if you have other memory than the internal, at least it should 'come up' similar to an USB-flash drive. Maybe depending on settings in the phone  
So they don't connect - my laptop does not see the phone. I used to use a Samsung, that has Kies and connected directly, before that I had a Sony Ericsson mobile that came with some mind of PC suite disks. Before that Nokia had a great program. Now zilch.
I've asked Vodafone for assistance and maybe some answer will arrive but so far it has told me to go to its online eforum that has no solution for this problem.
Both internal(Phone) and extra(Card) flash memories are accessible on e.g. Samsung Galaxy S3 and S5; just tried on Ubuntu Linux - you get access to all(?) files - so take care to not break anything.
Google Drive takes too long to upload, I felt when I tried this. Maybe I didn't do it the best way though. I simply 'shared' the images with Drive.
Connect a USB memory stick into the USB connector and, as long as it's seen, copy or move files from the phone to the stick. 
MTP, PTP, 'Mass storage', other - try switching between them SLOWLY - allow 10-20 seconds, or similar for it to settle.  
What else is there? What more do you expect? (Samsung KIES was hardly usable for SGS3, especially w.r.t. updates. Nokia and Ericsson "suites" had even less options.)
Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 comes with no install disks or PC suite like my old phones did.  The PC shows it as an Android device when connected, BUT NO drivers installed or found.
