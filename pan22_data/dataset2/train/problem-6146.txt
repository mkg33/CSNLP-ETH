Since you don't say whether you have a 1Gb or 100Mbps switch, it is hard to know. I can't find any info on the router you mention, so I am not sure if its LAN side connection is 1Gb or 100Mbps, but you might have a bottle neck there as well.  I will assume based on your comment of "I can copy at 80MBps" that the switch is 1Gb...  So your wired transfers are generally going to be much faster than the same transfers over WiFi.  (assuming they are at 1Gb and not 100Mb)
Generally the "300 Mbps max rate" is just that, the MAX rate.  Generally, the transfer rates over WiFi are well below that.  2MBps is ~20Mbps... So, that isn't too bad. (Capital "B" is not the same as lower case "b" FWIW)
Don't bother doing speed tests until you've gotten your packet loss under 1%.  Also, on a single-hop Wi-Fi network with no significant interference, your average ping round trip time should be below 3ms.
Okay, 9% packet loss is crappy. Even if yours is the only Wi-Fi link you know about in the area, it doesn't mean there's not other sources of interference in your band. Try another channel.
On a properly-working Wi-Fi link where both ends support (and are successfully using) the 300 megabit/sec data rate, your TCP throughput with a tool like IPerf should be at least 150 megabits/sec (about 18 MebiBytes/sec). The rule of thumb with Wi-Fi throughput is that a well-written app should be able to get TCP throughput of about 50-60% of the Wi-Fi signaling rate that you're getting. Note that plenty of apps aren't efficient users of TCP; filesystem protocols like SMB (Samba, Windows file sharing) don't always use TCP efficiently. So for best results, after you've fixed your packet loss problem and you're ready to do performance testing again, use IPerf first to see what your link is really capable of, before introducing the complicating factor of other software that might not be as efficient.
