SW # show port-access authenticator 10 vlan - still shows Unauthorized VLAN 200 and Authorized VLAN 150
Also, if you want it to work, you have to create all required VLANs on the switch, otherwise you'll get this kind of stuff:
So, the problem was with authorize section in my default site configuration at /etc/raddb/sites-enabled/default, it was kind of default. I don't really know what's up with that (if you, guys, know, comment on that, please), gonna do some research on that; here it is:
This would tell the switch that port 10 will use the auth-vid assigned VLAN for authenticated devices unless it gets a different value from RADIUS. Without this, it will just use the configured port value and ignore any RADIUS provided VLAN assignments.
Didn't quite get it to work with unknown VLANs in spite of the fact GVRP was enabled, aaa port-access gvrp-vlans was set and I also explicitly set unknown-vlans learn on interface 10, but oh well...nvm. 
I was not hoping any more to ever get it working and then I reconnected and... it happened, just randomly and I'm so excited now! I got assigned a VLAN dynamically:
