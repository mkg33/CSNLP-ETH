What this accomplishes is that you are preserving the source parent directory structure when copying to the specified destination. rsync is great for backing up whole swathes of files that you regularly update as thats what the algorithm is tuned for. But for simpler operations, the base Unix commands wrapped in a simple script are more than adequate. Note that this also sets the IFS bash variable that is ordinarily comprised of <space><tab><newline> although the setting probably won't be preserved upon script exit.

The files in said list are spread across many directories, have different sizes, filenames, extensions, ages, etc.
Preferably, I would like them to retain their directory structure, but only have the files that I want inside the destination directory. (the destination drive isn't big enough to simply copy everything).
Complicating factor: some of the files have the same name, but are not the same file. They can't just be moved into one folder with an overwriting or ignoring policy towards multiples.
However, this just tries to copy my root directory to the destination. Please help, how to I just copy the accursed files that I want to?
I'm assuming a Unix-like environment, so I'll write this in bash script, but the concept is more or less the same across similar scripting languages...
