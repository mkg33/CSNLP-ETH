How can I block this kind of traffic so that the router only answers DNS queries from the internal network?
The router's internal web server isn't enabled, but if it was, I know its access could be limited using the same logic:
My problem is: the router is perfectly happy to answer DNS queries when receiving them on its external interface.
If one had an outside interface G0/1 with IP 34.34.34.34.  This ACL will block requests specifically coming from outside trying to hit your outside interface, while leaving other forms of DNS traffic unaffected.
I solved this problem on my network by giving my clients dns servers in the dhcp pool options, i discovered my isp's DNS servers, then turning off the dns server on the router - no ip dns-server
I would add a comment but I cannot. The answer is to simply add an allow statement for your DNS servers that you use so if you're using Google's 8.8.8.8 then add a permit statement for udp port 53 from 8.8.8.8 above your deny statement.
I have a Cisco (877) router acting as the main gateway for a network; it has a DSL connection and performs NAT from the internal network to its external, public IP address.
