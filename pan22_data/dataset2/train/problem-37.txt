You could install more RAM. I'm not sure how much this specific laptop will take, but I'm sure Google will tell you if you put the model in. I'm not sure how much this will help, but another option would be to upgrade the GPU (I know it is a laptop.).
Despite reformatting the disk and reloading the OS you may still have a disk problem that is causing the Macbook to slow down. I have experienced slow downs like this before and the drive checked out okay using Apple's disk utility. However after replacing the HD with a new one the Mac's behaviour returned to normal. HD replacement on the Macbook you describe is very easy, only a few minutes work.
b) if you want to be super cautious, reinstall your apps, and bring your data back in piece by piece. Be careful about account names and passwords so you don’t have Privilege issues.
As stated by other users, this can be the source of slowdown. Sometime Disk Utility will tell you nothing is wrong with a disk, you replace the drive and it works perfectly, so clearly there can be bad sectors or head read issues that impede performance but don’t show up on the radar.
That said, assuming it's not a HD problem, the best upgrade you can do on that machine is increasing the RAM to 4 GB.
I’m also curious if your Macbook runs perfectly after you did a install and prior to importing back your data. 
The first step is understanding why it is so slow. What is it doing when it slows down? Is it swapping? Is it having I/O errors on the HD? Check Activity Monitor for RAM usage and Console for any significant messages. And what do you mean by "the internet doesn't work properly"? If you're a developer, you should know that "it doesn't work properly" doesn't cut it as a problem description.
I totally agree about replacing the HD. Depending on model of Macbook it can be very easy to replace the drive (see: http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/macbook_13inch_harddrive_diy.pdf)
