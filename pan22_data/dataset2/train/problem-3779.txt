I'm not quite sure what to ask, and I'm trying hard to avoid turning this into a shopping recommendation question; let me try and come up with a couple of specific questions:
What you probably want is to look for benchmarks (tomshardware.com has a good list) to compare the different video cards and there are many (including on newegg) wattage calculators, though once you settle on a video card I would read through the comments and find what people have to say about which do and don't work. I've been bitten by not having the right combination of plugs or enough +5v/+12v rails. If someone comments that a power supply works for them and that power supply is of sufficient quality/gets good reviews, I would try for that one instead of taking the chance on a cheaper power supply that might not work. 
My PC could really use a video card that's better than the on-motherboard Intel graphics adapter it shipped with, but whenever I go on Newegg to start shopping around, I get overwhelmed with options.
For not brand-new cards, it's useful to look up build-your-own-budget-computer guides.  These will often compare older high-end cards to current low end cards in terms of price and performance.   It's been a while since I build my desktop, so I can't give specific links to recent articles, but this was how I learned what I need in unraveling that question when I ran into it.
