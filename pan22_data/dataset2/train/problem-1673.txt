You need a device that supports Port Address Translation (PAT), Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP), and basic routing.  Your best bet is to get a consumer grade 'router' and test it one night and then have it on hand for if the primary device fails.
The google search indicates the UTM appears to be a firewall. While you could get say a cheap router/firewall put it on a shelf and if the UTM dies physially replace it, that seems a bad idea as that boxes are not functionally equivlant. This is a form of redundancy though a static kind, as mentioned in the comment. Net of this is that if you need the firewall function you need a duplicate physical box. MAYBE you can 'limp along' with a less expensive spare box while you wait for your replacement firewall but that is a business call. Lastly most people here will tell you that your ISP connection will fail far more often than your hardware and that is what you need to make redundant first.
Is there anyway I can connect my local network to the internet in case if my utm stops working. Thanks. 
Now what I can do if my firewall or my UTM gets damaged or stops working. What hardware or resources I need in case my utm stops working?
