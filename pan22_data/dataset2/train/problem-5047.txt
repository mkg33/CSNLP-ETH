It does not, however, support exporting Dope Sheets. The reason I am recommending the format is because the provided exporter itself is also rather lightweight, so you can easily edit it to suit your needs. 
If you don't need some more advanced engine features then alternative approach would be to use Blender's own game engine. Some games using it: Dead Cyborg, Yo Frankie!.
I am not exactly sure how does the action import work in the engines you noted. But many game engines have their own systems when it comes logic mechanics. UnityScript, HeroScript, UnrealScript and so on. You might have to export just the rigs, meshes, skelets and animations seperately. To set it up one by one inside the other engine using the internal game engine language.
I am using the InterQuake model exporter (.iqm/.iqe files) for my projects. You can find the exporter here. It's a lightweight format which doesn't get as bloated as Collada and supports Skeletal Animation, basic texturing, etc. 
As for the mesh/skeleton export. You can do using the simple Wavefront (.obj) exporter. This file is readable by most physic/3d engines. Or the Blender to FBX exporter :)
