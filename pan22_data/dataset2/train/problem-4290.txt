My "in" with the IT industry was an internship position, so I'm probably a little biased as a result. In a "former life" (5+ years ago) when I "worked for the man" I was involved in hiring interviews for IT support positions. I always counted real-world experience as being more valuable than and type of certification or academic credential.
Having taught classes in a "Microsoft Certification" program at a community college for nearly 7 years, I've met and interacted with a goodly number of people who were trying to enter the IT field, either as their first career or as a mid-life career change. My sample is, no doubt, influenced by who bothered to keep in touch with me, but those people who appeared to have the most success getting into the field were those people who were willing / able to jump into low-end support jobs, prove their worth and build their experience, and then aggressively "market" themselves into higher-skilled positions. Some of them finished their various Microsoft certs (MCSA, MCSE, MCP), but many others ended up going on to jobs w/o the certification.
There are some environments where academic credentials and certifications are essential pre-requisites because of the political environment, not because of the skills that you acquire when obtaining them. I'll never have a job in academia because I have a two-year college degree. I can write code as a contractor all I want, but I'll never get a "software engineer" position with a large corporation without my B.S. in CompSci. I'm not likely to be an IT manager, CIO, or CTO of any sizeable corporate venture without my MBA or a Masters in MIS. I'm okay with that, 'cuz I enjoy what I'm doing now and it fulfills my financial needs.
