I had this problem after I had our physical server automatically restart for updates without shutting down our hyper-v VMs. After a night of troubleshooting, I found that going into services and restarting "Active Directory Domain Services", everything went back to normal and AD was able to sync with DNS. Note that numerous restarts did not fix this until I manually restarted the service. 
I've set up a replica DC in a remote location.  It's connected to the main site through a VPN connection.  DCdiag passes on the primary DC, but I get the following error on the replica DC:
Check the DNS settings on your new domain controller, in 2003 and later, you should always point to 127.0.0.1, and then secondary to another domain controller or any other DNS server with that internal DNS zone available. You should then add a "forwarder" to the DNS service itself under the DNS MMC snap-in.
Is it giving this error just because it is not the global catalogue server, or is there some connectivity issue where it does not think there is one at all, as the error seems to imply?  If so, it seems odd, as all other tests were passed.
