Wireshark is your friend here - run it fore few minutes and I bet you will be quick to spot what's causing an issue.
I am running a small network with 20 or so hosts and a machine running Ubuntu Server 12.04LTS as the gateway.  Every few days I find that the network is frozen and that no two machines can communicate.  The problem seems to be caused by one of two Linux PC's on the network locking up.  I have been chasing the problem for a few months and here is a list of symptoms that I observe when the problem occurs:
Since the problem is tied to two machines with different hardware, but both have an Ubuntu based Linux distro I suspect a software problems.  I have searched hard for a solution to this problem but am still quite stumped.  Any suggestions?
Disconnecting the problematic machine instantly restores normal network activity, but the trouble machine must be hard reset to clear the problem.
It looks like you have some packet storm/loop. Ideally you should segment your network ;-) It could be faulty switch (oh! d-links few years ago!)
