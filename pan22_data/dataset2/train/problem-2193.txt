I've used the FOR EACH ROW construct with Triggers before, but cannot find documentation on the MySQL site that suggests or demonstrates how to use that to iterate over a result set in order to copy it to the target table. That may be more of a reflection of my inability to locate the appropriate information..
We are nearing the point where we need to be able to restructure the DB with production data, and so I want to be able to ideally move data around the database within MySQL alone. 
For example - I want to take the column contents of TABLE_1:the_value, create the column on TABLE_2 and then copy the values from TABLE_1 to TABLE_2 WHERE id_org and id_club match
I'm trying to promote the usage of a database versioning system (http://code.google.com/p/flyway/) on the project I'm currently working on - and to that end when we make changes to the database, we're propagating those changes through a series of deltas. It's still very early doors at the moment, so we've had the luxury of being able to make "destructive" deltas and re-populate the DB post-delta.
