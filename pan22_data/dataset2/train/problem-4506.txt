Ask whoever is in charge of that firewall to add your server as a firewall rule for incoming traffic on port 80 and 443 (http and https).
The ip adress can be substituted with a domain if you set its A record to point to the right ip adress. In this example, the A record would look like this: @ A = 123.45.67.89, ttl 1200.
In order for things to work correctly, you will need to ask the administrators to open a port for you to the pc that hosts the server. A website is hosted on port 80, but port 80 is usually reserved for other things and thus inaccessible. You can however ask them, to forward any public port to your local ip address followed by port 80, and it will work.
If your domain is Example.com with this a record, then going to http://Example.com:8880 would work to reach your website.
Once your network administrators opened a port for you that goes from 123.45.67.89, port 8880 to 192.168.1.90, port 80 anyone from the internet can now access your website through http://123.45.67.89:8880
I have a server running in my office because at my work we have INSANE internet speeds. However, there is a firewall that makes it so all the devices on the network will all have the public IP of the firewall. As you could imagine this prevents me or anyone else from obtaining and using a public IP to connect to the server outside of the network. I was looking into some forms of tunneling and VPN but it seems in order for that to work the pc and the server must be running the software/configuration. How do I bypass this?
For example, lets assume your public ip address is: 123.45.67.89 and the public port they allow you is 8880. Lets also assume your local ip address is: 192.168.1.90.
Or if they (likely) don't want to do that (either because they just don't want to, or those ports are already occupied): give up and search for online hosting solutions. They're pretty cheap these days.
Everyone has the public ip to access the router, and from there the port forwarding rules on the router will allow traffic to continue to your pc.
If you open a webpage to 192.168.1.90 on your own pc it will show you the website. Anyone outside of the internet will have to use 123.45.67.89 to view it. But just entering http://123.45.67.89 in the webbrowser will connect to port 80 and thus not work (or reach a different webserver).
