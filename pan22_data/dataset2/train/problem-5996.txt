You are looking for a "VGA, keyboard, mouse extender" - there are many models, with prices ranging around 50-100 USD. Some models allow one V/K/M to control more than one server, in case you need it.
Gadgets such as this - but you can find them on Amazon too (and elsewhere). Some require just an ordinary CAT5 cable to be pulled, and send everything through that. There are also (but more expensive) units that use WiFi, or any Ethernet carrier, which means you may try and run them over a PowerLine adapter using your domestic power cables as network (i.e.: you plug a PowerLine in a power outlet in the cellar, plug the extender on the PowerLine, plug the other PowerLine in a power outlet on the second floor, with the second half of the extender plugged in. The two PowerLines, if they're attached at the same electric meter, establish a 85, 100, or 200 Mbps connection [depends on models, wire quality, and radio noise in the neighbourhood]. The two extenders "see" an Ethernet connection and route video/mouse/keyboard signals through that, and Bob's your uncle.
