It turns out that in the start-up scenario, samba wants the nsswtich.conf content to have the ldap entries there prior to invocation.  Here is what I did to fix my issues:
I have a script that was starting Samba (NMBD, SMBD) as well as OpenLDAP (SLAPD).  It's an RC script that reads configuration data from a file to determine, among other things, which processes are already running or if a dependent process fails to start, etc...  Here is a snippet of the relevant part in the script.  The last line copies a version of the nsswitch.conf into place that specifies to use LDAP lookups.
In summary, it appears that how you start SMBD is just as important as when you start it.  If you start SMBD when nsswitch.conf has no LDAP entries, you get a version of smbd running linked to nss_ldap.so thinking it should only rely upon /etc/passwd (if that is all that is in the nsswitch.conf file) and changing the nsswitch.conf contents after SMBD is running has no effect.
And upon shutdown I was doing the following; notice I copy a nsswitch.conf file that has "noldap" entries in it.
