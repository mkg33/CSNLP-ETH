To me Unity is component based tools and we can set different parameters to control the behavior of the game object.
Like when I watch some tutorials, the tutors normally will just tell you "change this value to x, change that to y" without tell you why is it so.
For all kinds of game developent you need to know things like vectors, triginometry and other types of math. You can calculate everyting from how to animate how gravity effect an object, to how each particle in an exploding fireworks, should behave when they explode. All this is mathematically calculating code. The x and y, is coordinates, but you have to start with understanding that in a computer we do not use degrees but radian, and the grades go the other way than you learned in school. It goes with the clock, so when you go from 0 to 20 to 45 degrees, you go down and left, and not up. There are many thins you need to start to learn if you want to do game development. Coding Math on Youtube.com is the beste intro tutorial i know. I teaches you everything in javascript, but you should not care about the language he is using, it is just to make it easy to learn that he is using javacript, because it is running in a browser. Good luck :-) 
Is there any "scientific" method to determine the value of the parameters of the component other than trial & error (brute force)?
