After lots of digging, googling and trial and error, I've been able to get this all to work. I'm sharing my experiences here in the hope to save others the trouble.
The first step is to make sure that you have your Python properly installed. Check that which python gives back the right Python version (probably something like /usr/local/bin/python)
This will allow the build process to recognize the boost library which was installed in the first step. So close the editor, and do brew install libtorrent-rasterbar as normal.
Check if your boost is linked against the right version of Python using the following command (Change /usr/local to your Homebrew prefix where necessary). 
The two important lines here are to enable the python bindings with --enable-python-binding and the second is --with-boost-python=mt to show that it has been installed with an "mt" suffix (ref). 
Now that boost is installed properly, libtorrent-rasterbar can use them to build the Python bindings. We have to edit the formula to enable them, but also to educate the build process on where to find them.
If it points to somewhere in /System/Library/Frameworks, you need to rebuild your boost libraries and force a build from source (ref):
