One possibility is a bug in the Disk Partitioning by the Windows installer, in my experience. Over the years I've seen it either utilize the wrong sector sizes or, more commonly, not set the boot partition as active. This is assuming that the failure occurs AFTER the partitions are setup which has been my experience.
In my experience, this has been caused by one of two issues. First I'll offer solutions to a potentially broken installer (which I've experienced a few times over the years). Then I'll comment on the Installation Media's format at the end.
If at this point you're still out of luck, it is likely the installation media you are using. Since you are using a GPT USB drive, it could be conflicting with the installer's attempt to locate proper installation destinations (even with you explicitly stating yours). To remedy this, format the drive as MSDOS (good ol' FAT32) instead of GPT and try again.
