What have we missed?  Why could Site B's server not be rebooted correctly when the link happened to be down?
On viewing the information in AD on the server at Site B replication seems fine, and changes are replicated between the servers.  However, Site B seems to be totally dependant on Site A even though it appears to have a fully active separate DC that is a GC.  This is not what we want, Site B needs to operate independently of Site A should the link fail, and then sync once the link is restored.
We have quite a basic network setup in a test environment that is going to be deployed.  This is the first multi site network we have made.  We are aware that there should be more than one DC at each site, but this is not something our budget will run to, and we have some other fallback methods if needed.
Both sites are linked together, as a single domain.  Each DC is a global catalogue.  All seemed to work fine with no issues to report
The site link failed between the sites, and the server at Site B needed to be rebooted.  On reboot it said it could not contact the domain.  It would not show any AD users or computers, and no machines at Site B could join the domain.
