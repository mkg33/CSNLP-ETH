I would suggest you test a fail over now. You need to ensure that the rest of the ecosystem around the database is correctly configured for fail over. Here are the most common things to checks:
That is what should happen.  The mirror database will always be in a restoring state, as it is always taking in new transactions.  When you fail over the mirror the database which is currently active will show as restoring and the current mirror will become active.
I just successfully mirrored the same database on two of our servers. The principal database state in Management Studio is: (databasename, Principal, Syncronized). The mirror database state is (databasename, Mirror / Restoring...). What is our next step?
Yup, just test failover and failback, and make sure you're in the mirroring operating mode you want. There can be a big trade off between fault tolerance and performance with transactional safety full versus transactional safety off. You also might want to look into updating your apps' connection strings to be mirroring-aware if you want them to reconnect automatically after a failover.
