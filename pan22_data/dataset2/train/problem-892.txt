Well, my first thought would be to wake it out of hibernate, get to the password screen and then start seeing what is vulnerable through the network connection. If the actual machines network security isn't up to scratch then you could get access to a lot of the information this way.
If one can, for example, boot from an USB device or optical drive, one can use point and click tools such as Ophcrack to recover all passwords. Instructions here: USB Ophcrack | Windows Login password cracker
Vista and XP-sp3 are much less vunerable than earlier OSs which stored a simply encrypted password for LANMAN comptibility.  You can still crack easy passwords using some very large rainbow tables but it is otherwise pretty secure from tools like ophcrack.
Edit: Yes, I'm aware that you theoretically can't get back into an "encrypted hard drive" if the machine is rebooted. Whether or not that claim holds depends entirely on the software used to access the encrypted partitions. BitLocker seems to do a decent job, but many earlier implementations were basically a joke - and if you can access the machine it's trivially easy to dump the SAM database to the USB stick and perform the cracking offline.
In any case, your security would be as good as the weakest link.  You need to ensure all the latest security patches are installed promptly.  Otherwise, tools like MetaSploit can be used to test known vulnerabilities and gain user or admin access.
Obviously, if someone has physical access to the machine, all credentials stored can be considered compromised.
What kind of encryption are you using?  BitLocker?  Encrypted filesystem?  Without knowing, I can't directly answer your question.
