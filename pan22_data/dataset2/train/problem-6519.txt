Running file -s /dev/md0 doesn't indicate that GRUB is there and so I attempted to reinstall GRUB using the recovery disk. I selected the md0 disk and it appeared to install just fine.  
Running file -s /dev/md1 shows the error needs journal recovery, I'm not sure if that's related or not or how to fix that.
