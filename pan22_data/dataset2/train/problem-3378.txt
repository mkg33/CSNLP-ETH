Like the Raspberry Pi CPU , at this juncture, it appears that this company does not provide this part through any distributors.
When you go to the manufacturer site, what you are seeing are "development boards", they are pricier and usually larger than a consumer board, they are also sold in much lower quantity.
However, ASIC Markets and companies are stil small and rather new, so it is more common that they only deal directly.
Here is where I am confused. The only places where I can find prices for this chip are from the manufacturer's page linked above as ALT1160. These are starter kits and can easily cost from $70 to over $100. Unless I am missing something, I would think a reseller would sell the chip by itself. My goal is to find a relatively cheap LTE chip (in the $30 range if possible).
Of course, I could just be wrong and the chip does not get sold by itself, except in bulk. If it is sold by itself, where would I be able to find it. If not, I will have to look for cheap alternatives.
I am hearing about this low cost LTE modem designed for the Raspberry Pi. The modem is Altair's ALT1160. I hear that it costs $15 to $20 to make.
I did a check of some second market resellers and they do not even know about this chip. It is likely manufactured to order and thus can only be obtained from the MFG at this point. 
I'm sorry to say the cost you quote is for a volume design and not possible for a one-off unless you manage to scrounge some samples for free (still need a PCB)
In this particular case, the part you are looking at is an ASIC and not a general purpose part like an ADC, or microcontroller.
