Try Comodo.  We've been using it for years as a Reseller.  It's reasonable, but not the cheapest.  No problems so far.
If the site will be visted by people that are not on machines controlled by you (i.e. ones you can install the needed SSL certs to yourself), I would only recommend Thawte.  I have yet to find a device their authority is not supported on.  
We've used Digicert for a couple of years and have been happy with their support folks.  They do use a chained cert which has caused some problems for mobile browsers (the iPhone works well but not Blackberry).  We've never heard complaints from desktop users.
Per Nate's comment, Windows Mobile is the biggest group of devices that caused me headaches in the past.  Palm Treo's are also problematic, with many of the cheaper cert authorities.  
If you definitely, absolutely, HAVE to have it be guaranteed to work on all browsers, all systems, everything, you're going to want to go with a certificate from VeriSign.  They're one of the oldest SSL certificate vendors, and while they are expensive to get, finding a machine that doesn't have the root certificate installed for them is like finding a needle in a haystack.
The instructions on their site are clear and easy to use and their pricing is competitive.  I believe they have a 30 day trial so that would probably be your best way to experiment with them.
I suggest Network Solutions, and disagree with Go-Daddy, the support when I dealt with them was horrible. You get what you pay for.
