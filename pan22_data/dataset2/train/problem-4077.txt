Warning, you will need to have all of the files you stripe to in order to do your restore.  If you lose one the whole backup is useless.
Now on the other hand if you actually want to keep DB2 in place and just restore over DB1 it would look something like this:
There are several methods you can use to improve your speed.  Probably the easiest is to stripe your backup.
If so you can simply alter the name of the DB rather than deal with the time a restore takes (the file names will remain the same but that really doesn't matter in this case.)
I have 2 databases, DB1 and DB2.  DB1 has production/live data.  A script runs daily (takes about 3 hours) to fill DB2.  The goal is to restore DB1 with DB2 so that DB1 is down for as little time as possible.  I've restored databases before but never from a differently named one.  How can I do this?
In the restore you just give the db, mdb, and log different names.  And there is an option to force - I think it is called replace.  We do this all the time to create new test db.
