If the drive has less than 1,000,000,000,000 bytes the seller is dirty but there are no promises beyond that point.  Different internal designs will produce different values.  You could even get a different capacity from identical hardware if they changed the number of spare sectors on the drive.
Instead of doing the backup using dd, why not write a large file (for example dd if=/dev/zero of=tmpfile.del bs=4096 count=X) and then delete it just prior to doing a tar -czf /new/drive/backup.tgz - which will then compress the drive and fit ?    (creating the zero byte file and deleting it will make sure the space is actually compressible, regardless of what was there before, also using tar can actually be faster then dd because it writes less data - which is usually a slower process then compression, but YMMV)
Not all hard drives with the same state capacity are identical size wise, although my experience tells me that most are for newer drives.  (To mitigate problems with geometry I always used to locate the swap file at the end of the drive and recreate it - either a bit bigger or smaller so if it got corrupted during a DD it did not matter.  I havn't needed to do this for a while, and the last 2 [ different age, different model 1 TB WD hard drives had identical geometry ] )
