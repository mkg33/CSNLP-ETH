Also, in that same scenario with router that port forwards - is that forwarded port 25 traffic from the outside world considered to be coming in from a remote server (and subject to the rules of the top half of my screenshot) or is it at that point considered LAN traffic and therefore subject to the rules of the bottom half of my screenshot?  I'd expect the former scenario, but I'm asking as a sanity check.
There's a technical explanation of what "Receive connector local address bindings" are in this microsoft documentation page:
What about if I have an internet-facing router, that has a LAN address of 192.168.1.2, but forwards all port 25 traffic from the outside world to my Exchange Server?  If I don't have 192.168.1.2 specified in that Network Adapter bindings section, would my Exchange Server stop receiving emails from the outside world?
What would happen if I set the connector's adapter bind IPv4 address to only be 192.168.1.1, and my Windows 8 client machines running Outlook 2013 had ip addresses of say 192.168.1.100 thru 192.168.1.110?  Would those client windows machines be unable to send and/or receive messages with Outlook, since the port 25 receive connector is not "bound" to those IP addresses?
And I'm assuming that is describing the "same" functionality that appears in the Network Adapter Bindings section on the Receive Connector screen:
Currently, you can see from my screenshot, that this receive connector for port 25 is "bound" to all IPv4 addresses on the local network.
