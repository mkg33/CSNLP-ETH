Note that I'm not sure if your log file is using ISO8601 dates as in the example without actually researching that format, so you may not be able to use this example as-is, but it shows the basics of handling multiline logs entries where the date signifies a new entry.
But heads up: I am also using the filebeat module "nginx" which claims to handle the multiline issue itself. It doesn't. You can force it to do so by adding the above multiline settings to the module config file: /etc/filebeat/modules.d/nginx.yml
I have to enable it in filebeat itself (/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml) as described here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/master/multiline-examples.html 
I've not used ELK for a while, but you'll need to modify the config to support multiline log entries. The following is an example of using the multiline codec to merge together any lines that don't start with a date, taken from the official documentation.
There is a multiline feature in the ELK stack. But as I am using the filebeat module to postprocess the logs, I cannot just activate the multiline feature in logstash as mentioned above.
