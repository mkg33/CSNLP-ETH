There are other options, but none of them are as good as contacting your systems administrator and having the right forwarding through the firewall configured.
Most IPv4 local area networks (LANs) that are connected to the Internet today use a firewall, located at the border of the LAN and the Internet connection. This device performs Network Address Translation (NAT), translating network traffic between private IP addresses (taken from RFC1918) used on the LAN into one or more public IP addresses assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).
Here's what would typically happen when accessing your website from a device outside the LAN (e.g. your "smartphone"):
I think you mean "firewall" by "Gatekeeper" and "some server on the LAN with the 'my_computer' machine" by "master_server". You mention in a comment "I have no control over gatekeeper and probably none over master_server as well." That makes me think that you're not the systems administrator for this network, which limits your options.
