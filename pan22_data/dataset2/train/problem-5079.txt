Cloud computing is a style of computing in which dynamically scalable and virtualized resources are provided as a service
You're running an application on some servers. Somewhere. You can't exactly pinpoint where exactly these servers are. You have no idea what they could be doing otherwise. Or how many of them you are using simultaneously. You buy the computing power, but the exact hardware behind it is no longer specifiable. Then your application (or service) is running in the cloud.
Basically, cloud computing is the conveyance of registering administrations—servers, stockpiling, databases, organizing, programming, investigation and that's only the tip of the iceberg—over the Internet ("the cloud"). 
Organizations offering these computing services are called cloud providers and normally charge for distributed computing administrations in view of utilization, like how you are charged for water or power at home.
Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.
