A comment suggested kaggle.  I personally wouldn't do kaggle for the competitions but rather for the data.  I like to find relevant datasets and use models i'm toying around with as a way to learn more about them.  For example, when I have interns, I give them the zillow housing dataset and show how different generalized linear models work and how each change can improve or decrease model performance.  
I tend to recommend Applied Predictive Modeling.  It serves as a nice bridge between theory and application.  The organization of the book, which is essentially data prep, pick model, and validate is what one does in the real world (at least at a high level.)  Plus there's plenty of R examples and datasets you can try things.
In short, I suggest reading Applied Predictive Modeling, take some courses in Coursera and apply that knowledge to real datasets.  By learning and then doing, you'll be amazed at how quickly you learn and how much easier it becomes to grasp more advance techniques and applications.
As far as statistics, I think you just have to go out and learn more of it.  Basic statistics is often insufficient to do anything meaningful in the real world.  The only real way that it comes together is by learning something and then applying it to something.
