I bet it is shorting the signals for some function keys (like play, pause, volume, etc) when you press those keys. Which BIOS and windows7 in safemode might ignore so they end up processing the lower ones.
First make sure you keyboard layout is set to EN-US, this can be done from Control Panel. It's also possible that you've enabled NumLock feature accidentally, try to press Fn + NumLk keyboard shortcut to turn it off.
Next if the keyboard is still working in only BIOS and not OS, try using a Windows 10 repair disk to not only see if your keyboard works there, but attempt to run a repair that could solve the problem. 
NirSoft has a no-install utility that will show you all hotkeys that are registered on your computer:
To see if it is a hardware keyboard issue, you should go to the [Start] menu, page down to the [Windows ease of access] item, launch the [On-screen keyboard] and see if it has the same issues that your physical keyboard does.
In addition to other things that are mentioned here, I would first try draining any power from the laptop. Take the battery out and press/hold the power button a few times to make sure there is no power left in the laptop itself. 
This is definitely a drivers problem. Please reinstall the ATKPackage (For Windows 10 Upgrade) for the Asus x55c 
If you have access to linux, try to run the xev utility. I have no idea what is the equivalent on windows. It will show you the keycodes arriving from the keyboard. I bet it will show weird values together with those keys you mention.
Also, you might want to check all of the hotkeys that are in use on your system to make sure that an app hasn't hijacked some of your normal keys.
