NTFS, with NTFS-3G you can write to it using Linux and take a look at http://macntfs-3g.blogspot.com/ for your Mac.
To achieve maximal compatibility you should use mkudffs from udftools project at least in version 2.0. No special parameters are needed, everything is autodetected.
I seem to recall having done that, the problem I found is that the linux version I had mounted it read only, as the driver had not been built for r/w. It did work in windows, and I think mac.
Yeah, a good solution is hard to find. For a while I had an external drive with a fat32 partition that had drivers for win and mac, a mac partition, and a big ext3 partition. It worked, but it meant installing drivers. Neat trick was it was also bootable on a mac (fw&usb), you have to leave space and take some notes, then you can add partitions via the command line and a mac partition table as well.
Tool mkudffs since version 2.0 handle all 3 restrictions. When formatting non-removable hard disks, it creates "fake" MBR table which starts at sector 0 and spans whole disk. So UDF filesystem can be read either from first partition (needed for Microsoft Windows) or from whole disk (needed for Apple Mac OS X). See mkudffs 2.0 man page for more details.
