I've also increased the time that Offline Files checks for to see if it's connected from 5 minutes to three hours and the timeout period on the Watchguard for the VPN is set to 23 hours.
I've created a new VPN account on the Watchguard so that the VPN U/N and P/W is now the same between the two accounts in case that was causing an issue.
This sort of disconnection usually occurs because the VPN connection's Default Gateway for routing is used instead of the real LAN connection's Default Gateway. In Network places go to the VPN's properties, 
We have a client who uses a Windows 7 laptop and connects remotely to an SBS2011 network via VPN that terminates at a Watchguard device.
The issue is the clients laptop, which is a member of the domain, appears to lose it's connection every now and again. That is to say not his actual internet connection nor the VPN but the server seems to forget he's actually connected and he's prompted for a password when trying to access Outlook and when accessing shares.
This is a recent upgrade, the server was SBS2003 and the clients laptop was XP but the Watchguard has remained the same.
