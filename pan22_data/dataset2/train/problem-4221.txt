To show that this is not an isolated example, here's an argument (not entirely rigorous but possibly able to be made rigorous) for why failure to concentrate should also be true of the number of Hamiltonian cycles. The expected value of this number is clearly $(n-1)!/2^{n+1}$: each of the $(n-1)!/2$ cyclic sequences of vertices has a $1/2^n$ chance of actually being a Hamiltonian cycle. By a similar argument, the expected amount of change to this number caused by introducing a new edge would be $(n-2)!/2^{n-1}$, smaller by a linear factor. If the number of Hamiltonian cycles were strongly concentrated, most edge flips would cause an amount of change to this number that is close to its expected value. But then the $\Theta(n)$ fluctuation in the number of edges would cause a fluctuation in the number of Hamiltonian cycles that is proportional to its expected value, contradicting the assumption of strong concentration.
A simple example is the number of spanning subgraphs ($2^m$). The number of edges of a random graph fluctuates by $\pm \Theta(n)$ so the number of spanning subgraphs fluctuates by a factor of $2^{\Theta(n)}$, well away from the $(1+\epsilon)$ factor you are using in your definition of concentration.
Failure to concentrate happens for some counting ($\#\mathsf{P}$) properties, and maybe for many of them.
Other plausible candidates for failure to concentrate include the number of colorings (partitions of the vertices into independent sets), number of matchings or perfect matchings, or number of spanning trees.
