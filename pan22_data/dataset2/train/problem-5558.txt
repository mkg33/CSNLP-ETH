It sounds like the boot loader (GRUB i think) was installed in the wrong location which is likely if the original hard disk was still connected when you installed Xubuntu.
The number of jumpers vary. If you have 3 pairs of pins, one has a plastic cap on it.  The 3 settings are master,slave, and cable select.  Use a tweezers or pliers to remove the jumper and move it over.  @buttercup has an excellent picture in his answer.  If you have 5 jumpers instead of 3 use those settings.
That should be possible to do from the BIOS, I guess you are missing the menu or the keyboard shortcut to switch among the boot drives, double check carefully all of them or use the BIOS help if available. I installed hundred of PC's of that age and never found one without that option but I admit some of them haven't intuitive menus
Thus, the old drive, you need to dismount the old drive, set the jumper settings as. I assume the new drive, you don't need to do anything.
You may search for the motherboard manual on Google as well by it's part number to check the BIOS menu or even upgrade the BIOS firmware version.
Alternatively, I'm not sure if there is a boot repair feature on the Xubuntu install CD, but if you don't need the original hard drive, you could disconnect it and try re-installing again.
and follow the instructions paying close attention to the install location: sda is the first hard drive, sdb the second and so on. Ensure you are installing to sda/sdb NOT sda1/sdb1 as this installs it at the start of the partition which is used for something called a chainloader. If you don't believe you will be dual-booting another operating system down the track, allow it to install to ALL hard drives..
