Each addon in Firefox has setting which specifies which versions of Firefox it will work with (the presumption is that the author has tested their addon with the versions mentioned).  Historically, addons typically claimed compatibility with a major release of Firefox (e.g. 2.X) but then there were problems with differences between 3.0 and 3.6 so addon authors got more specific and only claimed compatibility with particular major and minor versions (e.g. 3.6.X).  A range of versions can be specified (e.g. 2.X -> 3.6.X) but an upper limit has to be given and it can't be an unreleased future version of Firefox if you want to distribute your addon via the Mozilla site.
You will occasionally see a message on the Chrome "Extensions" page saying that a particular extension needs to be updated to work with the current version of Chrome but, since updates are done automatically in the background, it's hard to catch one in this state.
Now that "major" versions of Firefox are being released every 6 to 8 weeks (we've seen versions 4.0 through 6.0 since March) addon authors just can't keep up and more and more are falling behind.
