I suspect your developer made changes / copies to the current state of the system and not the snapshot. When you deleted the snapshot, you merged it with the previous snapshot but didn't incorporate the current work.
Snapshots are 100% reliable in this scenario. I would be inclined to believe your developer has made a mistake. The snapshot doesn't deal with "files" it deals with low level disk blocks. If there was any problem with the snapshot you would have more serious errors than missing files, more likely you would get partition corruption or disk failure errors (assuming the vmdk could even be mounted).
That said, I would rather point at VMware. Are you up to date on patches and hotfixes? I have experianced some inconsistencies depending on the vmware tools and vmware esx versions. Might help to look into this.
As "20th Century Boy" wrote, snapshots are 100% percent reliable - most of the time. For example if you are running some kind of database most you could get without vss support on windows is a crashconsistant snapshot.
"Some files missing" sound like a really serious issue! Have you filed a bug about this? We do not use the snapshot functionality ourselves, but I have never heard about this happening, and I've worked with VMware product for quite some time.
