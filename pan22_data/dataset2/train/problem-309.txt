There is the problem with LCD screens. LCD unlike CRT screens use phisical pixels, while reproducing image. The actual quantity of physical pixels in LCD panel is known as "Native resolution". Because pixel have physical size here, when you set resolution, which is different with native, monitor can't just increase or reduce pixels quantity and it convert the image with different algorithms according needed resolution.
When you maximize your image with 1280x1024 resolution at 1440x990 monitor, it stretch the image and use different effects (like anti-aliasing) for fitting the image your current resolution. Also if you set the same resolution at both monitors, you won't get the quality you want, because in this case "Native resolution" will be different with actual resolution, and monitor will convert your image for fitting physical pixel size. Also all of above consider that you use raster images, because vector images (like text outside the image, f.e. in web page) have different converting algorithms, giving you the best quality in any resolution.
