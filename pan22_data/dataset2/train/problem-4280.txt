wblgers on GitHub shows a pretty easy way to setup your own 0-9 speech recognition using a Hidden Markov Model. 
Tweak and/or thin the entries of the dict file to make things go faster. By limiting the amount of words it can recognize, I made the best performance gains. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmusphinx/cmudict/master/cmudict.dict
Getting the right microphone was very key. I had great success with a 3.5mm jack omnidirectional conference microphone. (I had a less happy experience with a clip on lapel microphone that I basically had to yell at before the audio could be interpreted by the software.)
A light warning: /dev/shm is not necessarily a magic bullet-- but, you're using it for a lot of the audio purposes that pulse audio uses /dev/shm for. So, read up on /dev/shm, be smart about what you stuff in /dev/shm, ???, profit.
I have been experimenting with the Raspberry Pi and creating an offline voice recognition bot to recognize the numbers 0 through 9.  The software I am using to accomplish this task so far is SOPARE, however I have been less than successful (spotty at best results when trying to recognize numbers, just guesses random variables).  Next up is for me to try out Jasper Project, however I don't know if i'll be successful there either.  If anyone has any suggestions on what I could use, I would greatly appreciate it.
What would be ideal for me would be a voice recognition software that comes pre-programmed to recognize basic numbers (Or can learn them easily)
As above, I am using the same USB UGREEN "SOUNDCARD" as the RPi boards do not have a microphone jack or interface-- regardless of how you want to look at it.
