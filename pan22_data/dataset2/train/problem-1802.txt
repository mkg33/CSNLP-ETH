I use J. River Media Center. It's commercial, but it has everything you could ever think of. Perfect for extremely picky people like me. :)
It's GTK+ based and coded in Python, which means it can (possibly) run just about anywhere.  This is the best cross-platform solution I have found yet.  Finally! I have a player I enjoy on both linux & windows.
I use the Zune Software, not because it's really better than anything else, but because it's got a nice interface and it annoys me less than anything else I've tried on Windows.
My second choice would be Windows Media Player 12 on Windows 7, but whenever I use it I still miss some of Media Center's features.
Free, simple and light weight. It's not feature rich like most popular music players but I don't use anything else besides to play music.
I used to be a 'use whatever the default player is' type, but I have just discovered Quod Libet and I really like it.  It's main mission in life is to make tag-oriented orgainzation of your music library a breeze.  What it lacks in flashy UI, it makes up for in speed and search.  It will expose tags in you music files you never knew you had, and let you perform regular expression searches on them.
