I would like to do it this way, as it would be more transparent to me, seperating the image "collage" process from the tweening process, but i haven't found a way to dynamically create javascript image objects by combining multiple single images.
Do you think that it would be better - performance-wize - to pre-combine the multiple images into one larger image, and then feed it to the tweening algorithm?
For example let's say i have 10 preloaded image objects in my script, and i want to place them one on top of the other (the arrangement is supposed to be dynamic), and then tween it as a single "collage".
Do javascript tweening libraries like Tweenjs/GSAP etc, care about how many objects you tween concurrently (as long as in the end they move in the same direction and with same speed), or is it transparent for the fact that the hardware will move an array of pixels in the end?
You can group multiple images (createjs.Bitmap objects) using a createjs.Container, and the only performance penalty is the creation of the container object it self.
