It could potentially incur damage if there's a power surge (e.g., lightning or power transmission event). Why not just use a surge protector (or even a regular power strip) with an on/off switch? This is a pretty common configuration, and lets you turn off the power to multiple devices (monitor, USB hub, etc) with the flick of a single switch.
Sometimes I unplug my Thinkpad laptop from its AC/DC power supply adapter and keep the adapter connected to the power socket. Are there any possible negative consequences? Some ideas I was thinking about:
The overall answer is no, there is nothing wrong with leaving the power supply plugged into the wall while not in use.
There should be no problem with keeping it plugged into the socket. With modern adapters there is no need to worry about the order you plug things in (unless you are superstitious). The only problem that I could think of would be the adapter getting hot - you forgetting about it being plugged in and maybe placing things on top of the supply that could potentially cause a fire but that is pushing it. 
The other thing would be, as you mentioned, the fact that it is drawing power. However this would be such a small amount that you should not even notice it on your bill.
