If its a stock r51 (as opposed to say an r51p which might be a little better), it could be that the video card is just too old - even if DX11 is installed, it has a intel integrated graphics card with 12 mb of vram. The ATI models have 32 mb of vram, which is still just not enough by modern standards.
Check to ensure 3d acceleration is set to full under Display Properties ( Screen Resolution -> Advanced Settings, I believe).
You're just expecting too much of the old girl- I don't think the video cards support most of the newer features required of dx9 either.
You may download DirectX 9.0c from Microsoft here, but your best bet is to find its installation on the WoW DVD. This is because Microsoft may not install all the DLLs required for gaming.
Some games require DirectX 9.0c, which isn't a problem, as it can be installed on the same machine in parallel with DirectX 11.
IF you haven't updated the graphics drivers to those provided by the graphics card manufacturer ( nVidia/ATi ) , please do so. Also try updating to August 2009 edition of DirectX 9.0c
