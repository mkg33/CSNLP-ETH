There's very little information in your question.  But if you just want to virtualize, perhaps because you want to be able to service the hardware after migrating the VM to another host, or perhaps because you want to be able to back up the entire VM, or because your infrastructure is centered around virtualization, you could do this with Windows Server 2012 and Hyper-V.
Is it possible to configure a 4 socket 40 core physical server to be a single VM-Guest using the Virtual Socket and Cores per socket options?
Generally, it seems to be considered a bad idea to span VMs across NUMA boundaries (which you get as soon as you assign more cores to a VM than one socket of the physical host offers).
Still, if you really need a beefy VM like that, KVM can support 64 vCPUs, and the number goes higher with every release.
The currently released versions of Hyper-V don't support that many cores, but 2012 supports 64 virtual processors and has the ability for a VM to span NUMA nodes.  You can play with the beta today, though I wouldn't host production workloads on beta software.
If you really need all that CPU in a single machine, there's no point virtualizing. The idea behind virtualization is the fact that you have more physical resources than your OS/App can or need to use, so you put them in a VM which is more limited in resources, and then bring up additional VMs, who will share the extra resources the large physical host can provide.
