To test culling, you probably want to render to another target without the culling to see if your culling strategy is working as intended.
The model in question is the "sponza" model used in many research articles, for example viewed here, in an otherwise unrelated video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhmH1PaY9Sw
Second, rather than putting the visible objects into a collection, instead have a flag on each objects on whether or not they are visible. When drawing, skip objects with the flag set to false. 
Is this the correct approach? I don't notice any particular performance benefits, unless the view frustrum is completely outside the root model...
Assuming your view frustum culling algorithm is correct, you need to know whether or not your model is hierarchical, that is, whether the parent AABB fully contains all the children AABBs. If so, then its something like this: 
I have implemented a view frustrum culling alghorithm that produces INSIDE, OUTSIDE or PARTIAL  results for each model. The problem is I'm not sure how to apply it when building my renderqueue.
