This is a feature of gnome-terminal that everyone seems to like but me and thillai-selvan. There is a lot of documentation on how to fix it when it's not working right (that is, when a new tab is opening in the same directory as the previous tab). However, there is little information on how to disable the feature. It can't be disabled in the gnome-terminal UI or any config files as far as I can tell. So you need to break it or circumvent it.
For my use case, echo 'cd $HOME' >> ~/.bashrc is not a good solution, because in some applications I would like them to be able to open in a different directory, mainly the embedded terminal in vscode, and that line in bashrc will prevent it.
The feature is implemented by providing a PROMPT_COMMAND that records the current directory every time a prompt is generated. Current versions of gnome implement this by installing a vte script into /etc/profile.d. You should be able to remove that file (back it up so you can restore it later if you want) and disable this feature.
