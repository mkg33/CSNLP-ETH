Oh, didn't read carefully enough, sorry.  Are you sure the images are not generated dynamically as you request them?  If they are not already there, the link will be invalid, the apache log might show you that.
You can set cacti to pre-generate graphs on a regular basis and then stick them somewhere you can get at them.  This avoids the identifying-yourself-to-cacti problem.
I've tried to change the user agent to the same as my Firefox in wget, no change. I've set the referer in wget to be the cacti page, no change. What is it doing? Is there something special with http auth and wget?
I would start by checking the server logs (Apache perhaps) to see if there is any more information.  Can you show us the command with different username and pass?
From what you've described it sounds like you've applied BasicAuth over the top of Cacti's builtin authorization mechanism. So by providing --http-user you are being allowed access to the web resource, but Cacti still doesn't know who you are, so it is redirecting you to a login page.
I'm trying to wget a specific cacti graph image in order to make a daily report. We have htpasswd for the cacti website, and I've added a user for that. I'm usign wget's --http-user/password to pass it. That's working because without it, I get 403 Authorization Required back. However when I try to wget the image, I get redirected to index.php. What is it doing?
You probably want to export to local file system, then put the graphs in some location where you can wget them from.  Note that this seems to generate ALL graphs all at once which might be a significant impact on your system (depending on your system and complexity of cacti install) and make available more information than you really want to.
