But, this aside the product works wonderfully and can be successfully used internally. This alone -- if a majority of your employees use OpenOffice -- you can save money. Then only customer-interacting parties would need MS Office. 
I agree with most of the points made here, but wanted to make just a few points about/in defense of the latest version of OpenOffice.org:
We just upgraded about half of our users to OpenOffice.  We've found that OO is a fantastic substitute for users who:
As most others have mentioned, (to summarize) it can, but it isn't likely. It highly depends on your industry. 
On the whole, I've found 3.1 to be the first version of OpenOffice.org that's really convinced me it's a viable alternative in many (though certainly not all) cases to shelling out for MS.  The thing that bugs me more than anything about organizational use is the lack of AD integration; if anyone knows any tools or tricks for this I'd love to hear about it.
If your organization is seriously thinking about replacement for Microsoft Office, then you should consider other alternatives for MS Exchange and SharePoint, because they don't mix with OpenSource client applications. Also if your organization is using Active Directory, then you are losing application management by Group Policies. 
For those who switched, we gave them Thunderbird with Lightning, and they love it (more than Outlook, although we weren't using Exchange).  It would be hard to convert an entire company, but I'd suspect that in almost any company certain positions don't need the whole Office suite.
And ultimately, either way you need at least one copy of MS office if you plan on publishing .doc files. Most of the time, .doc files don't come out quite right. 
Call me a pessimist, but I would stick with Office right now if it is in the budget. If you are looking to slash some costs, you could switch over to OO but support is going to be a headache for you and your IT staff.
