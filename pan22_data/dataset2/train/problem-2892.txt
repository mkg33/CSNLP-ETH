When editing a theme, you should consider creating a new theme based off an existing theme.  This will prevent security updates from wiping out your changes.  Temporarily grant access to the wp-content/themes directory to the web server.   If the group is set correctly, you can do this with the command sudo chmod 775 wp-content/themes run from the directory containing your wp-content directory. 
You're confusing Wordpress users and system users. They're two completely different things. To grant WP the ability to write files, you need to grant that access to the user that your web application is running as. You are running CentOS, and IIRC web services run as the "nobody" user, though I cannot verify that at this moment. 
The Wordpress admin users can not modify any files that cannot be modified by the web server that is running it.  A secure site will lock down all PHP files so that they can not be modified by the web serve.  It appears you have done this.  You probably should have set the group to www  (directory may be wrong for your installation): 
I recently installed wordpress on vps. All theme files' permission are set to 644. The ownership is already given to root. But still wordpress admin can't seem to find "Update file" button in file editor unless I set permissions to 777. Isn't wordpress admin considered as root? 
Here's the script I run that sets permissions for all my Wordpress installs. I have more information in my wordpress nginx tutorial here, and the information is based on the official wordpress codex.
