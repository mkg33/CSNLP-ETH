Some will point out that this is not sysadmin related, but I disagree. Setting up development environments for programmers and providing support is a part of the job for many of us.
I'll add that the <distribution name> Unleashed series from SAMS Publishing take a good overview-to-depth appraoch.
What would be an introduction to Linux that does not presume prior non-Windows experience, but gets to the good/useful/powerful stuff? 
It's not a very specific answer, but the question wasn't very specific so I hope it will point you in the right direction. Most of us "Linux dudes" were Windows users at some point and I believe that your logical thinking and math degree will help you out. 
It where I started with Linux many moons ago, and still much of what was covered in the '96 edition is still valid. A bunch has changed/improved/etc, but those book have been a valuable resource to me many times.
I have no formal training in computers, but I'm a bright guy, and I learn reasonably quickly.  (I have a Ph.D. in math.)
