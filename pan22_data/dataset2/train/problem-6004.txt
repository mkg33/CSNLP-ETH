If it does help, you can do binary search on those auto-start programs to identify the one causing this problem.
If your desktop load with no problem in Safe Mode, that's probably some hardware or auto-start software that is causing the problem. If it doesn't even load the desktop in Safe Mode I would say I have no idea where the problem is.
If the desktop works fine in Safe Mode, you can try to restart back to your normal desktop and try disabling all auto-start programs. This can be done with msconfig usually. This page: http://netsquirrel.com/msconfig/msconfig_win7.html shows you how to use msconfig to configure auto-start programs. Simply uncheck everything that auto-starts and see if your desktop load at next boot. If that doesn't help it's probably a hardware/driver issue as is mentioned by other users.
If you don't want to reinstall and don't mind not to solve this problem elegantly, you can probably add explorer as an auto-start.
If you cannot find the problem, for example, you desktop doesn't load in Safe Mode, or it doesn't show up even if you have unchecked all auto-start programs and disconnected all additional hardware... I would say, it always solve the problem to reinstall your operating system (Windows).
If you want to troubleshoot this problem, you can first try Safe Mode. To enter the Safe Mode, press F8 on computer start-up before the Windows logo appears, and follow the instructions on the screen.
