You can make the terminal server its own domain controller, in its own domain. Let the main domain trust the TS-domain. Have the TS users authenticate against the TS-domain. Add the TS-domain users to whatever security groups that are required. That way, if your TS gets compromised, your main domain admin is not compromised, at least not necessarily.
Of if that setting up a VPN on the router is not an option, setup another server on your network that can terminate a VPN.  It sounds like you don't really need a full vpn, even a simple SSH tunnel may be enough.
We have a Windows Server 2008 Standard box running a terminal server that members of our team connect to from off-network locations via a firewall rule in our router (Linksys RV042) . For security reasons we have changed the default TS port to an unused high level port number.
What I want to do here is like adding an Apache password challenge via a htaccess file on the wp-admin directory of a wordpress install, that has it's own login. So the first authentication mechanism is via a service that doesn't run the second authentication mechanism.
We would like to add an additional layer of security that would be a username/password challenge unrelated to the terminal server and unrelated to the user's login credentials. I'm not sure this is even possible.
The Linksys RV042 router appears to support termination of VPNs.  Why not simply require your clients to establish a VPN to the router first?
