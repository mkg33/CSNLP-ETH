I've absolutely seen what you're describing in RDP sessions to Windows Server 2003 machines. I've been unable to repro the bug and I've probably only seen it 20 - 30 times (out of thousands of RDP sessions), but I've definitely seen it.
Yes I've seen it too, though rarely, and always under tense/harsh network conditions and a reconnect has always resolved it - so I've thought of it as a glitch due to too much packet loss or similar problem... but it's certainly interesting enough to further explore ^^
I'm not sure this is the fact with RDP (but it sure is with ICA) but as far as I know it the local client simulates most Win32 UI stuff like windows, borders, most text, input textboxes and so forth to speed up the display and only gets told what to draw in many cases (almost like vector graphics), and not sent an actual image for everything (because that would be very slow, like VNC ;). Hence, having a corrupted text string due to troublesome network conditions (or a bug) doesn't seem too unlikely.
I've seen this both in a window and full-screen. I've almost always used the "Low-speed broadband" "Experience" settings, so only bitmap caching and visual styles are enabled.
