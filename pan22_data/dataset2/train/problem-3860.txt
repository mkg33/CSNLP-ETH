The ubuntu install will not wipe any partitions unless you ask it to.  It's default action is to resize your existing partitions so long as there is enough free space.
My one worry is that, as I don't have a Windows install CD, the Ubuntu install might somehow affect the restore partition and leave me unable to get the hell out of Dodge if I suddenly find that my life simply cannot continue without some app/functionality that only Windows gives.
However, after tinkering with live CDs over the years and, more recently, playing with friends' netbooks, I fancy trying Ubuntu or some other "easy" Linux distro for a while to see if I can  manage without Windows.  This laptop is not my main computer and only really used for web-based stuff nowadays, but I occasionally need to use it for admin duties on my home network (RDP etc.).
My old XP ThinkPad T41 needs a reinstall to deal with Windows rot.  It has a restore partition that I have used before without issues. 
However having said that I'd always recommend taking a backup.  Once you have a live cd or usb stick you can boot from it then backup your whole hard drive using the dd command to an external usb drive.
