The source IP address is taken from the network interface. If you have different hosts (or different network namespaces on one host), you can assign a different IP on each of those interfaces (or let the OS autoconfigure a different IP using the MAC address, if you set it up to do so, and if it gets the prefix). Then applications (e.g. ping) executed on differents hosts/namespaces will use this address.
If you have a single host for this IP range, I recommend using network namespaces, or you might use infrastructure that uses network namespaces (Docker etc.).
The /112 denotes the prefix for an address. It's also a common notation for IPv4. Essentially it's telling you that the number of bits are set to identify the network. The others are free to reference hosts on that network. Consider reading up on how subnetting works (there are questions on SU and plenty of online resources).
With IPv6 it depends on your configuration. Check your ifconfig or ip or ipconfig depending on system and you should be able to see your current network configuration. It should include information about your current IPv6 address(es).
Another option is to create several network interfaces with different IP address on the same host/namespace, or assign several IPv6 addresses to the same network interface. In that case, you will have to instruct your application to bind to the IP address you want to use (e.g. ping -S ...). Not all applications can do that.
As you get a whole net with IPv6 you can either set them up in a static fashion (common for servers) or you can look into something like the IPv6 privacy extension. Which does some magic in order to help your regular client to stay a bit more private.
