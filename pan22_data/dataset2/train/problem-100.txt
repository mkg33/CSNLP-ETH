You can make separate partition (last on disk, small 4GB, shrinking first other last partition on the disk) with Windows installation files from the ISO image file (or DVD with Windows), set it up like bootable USB pendrive (active partition) and then boot right away from this partition to install the system. But this is the same as booting from external medium. So, be specific, why you can't or don't want to install from external medium.
I want to completely format my computer, I've already backed up my files and I'm ready to push "the red button". However, my father would prefer if there was a way to format the computer without using up a windows installation disk which currently can install on two more computers.
So I basically want to delete everything and start fresh without having to "reinstall windows" and use up an installation credit. This is also a home built computer so there is no factory settings button provided by a company like HP nor have I done a system restore or a system image far back enough for count as a full clean wipe. Is there a way around this?
