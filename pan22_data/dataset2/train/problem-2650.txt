The original poster is on a computer with an OS X operating system, which comes with an older version of Emacs that is pre-installed -- located at /usr/bin/emacs.  The newer pre-built version of Emacs that the original poster downloaded from https://emacsformacosx.com/ contains everything inside of a packaged folder called Emacs.app, which the OP stated was placed in the /Applications folder.  The path to the new Emacs executable is /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs.  The OP has indicated a desire to be able to type the word emacs from the terminal and have the newer version of Emacs be activated, instead of the older version.  The comment by @greg-449 underneath the question above states that the OP should look at the bash alias command to properly configure which version of Emacs is activated when typing the word emacs from the terminal.
After copying it to my Applications, I opened emacs and did M-x emacs-version. My old version was still shown (22.1.1).
Unless there are specific reasons for using a non-GUI Emacs, the OP should consider using the GUI version (which can be launched from the terminal, or from the Dock or from Finder.app).
