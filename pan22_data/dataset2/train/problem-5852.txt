Well, my situation is very similar: ISP (giving dhcp public IPv4 address) <-> modem <-> intelligent linux based router/switch/proxy/cachingDNS/ntp <-> home-PCs running linux, and if my doughter want to play a MS-Windows driven game she uses KVM-Qemu virtualised PC runnig its virtual HD in snapshot mode. Hence even she can catch a virus, by restarting the virtual machine the system is back in a fresh state. I can start any reasonable public server occasionally, either on the linux gate, either on any home machine giving it the port forwarding or reverse proxy. For more then 15 years I have gotten no serious problem (yes, harddisk faild), originaly started with one core AMD Athlon64 machine as the linux gate, about two years ago I migrated to BananaPi router (a fork of RasberyPi). 
You cannot forget, that security does not mean: "no open port", as the many disasters came form behaviour of the client PC (opening fake e-mail, malware on a web page, etc.). 
The question is: what kind of security you want to reach. On the schema you had posted there is a picture only. You did not wrote what IP address you get from ISP (public/private, fix/dhcp), what other services does provide ISP for you (proxy, dns, smtp/pop/imap, MX). What kind of OS do use your PC/servers. Do you want run your own dhcp, mail, web, file, dns or another server? 
An other important part of security is, of course, the regular back-up. It is highly recommended to save all running system disk as a disk image, and carry out a data backup with reasonable regularity.
