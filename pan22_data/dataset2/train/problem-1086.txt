Since this is your first foray, I'd almost suggest going with a fully managed hosting service - they'll be able to help out with the backend scaling. 
Based on what you have posted, you are looking at about 6 requests per second. I'd start with a single app box, a single DB box and a single storage box if you need storage. Throw load at it, see what breaks. Slowly increase the # of users, and you'll see parts of the code that you'll want to optimize, or you can add more boxes where ever the app is experiencing problems.
Azure would handle this.  See Windows Azure for details and free trial.  I don't have an Iphone version but here is an article about how to build an app like this for windows phone 7
2) How long does an average request take to complete with no load? What's your SLA on how long the requests should take?
1) Architecture - A lot of the scaling problems that you will run into are going to be defined by how you design the application now. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of the language that you are writing in, the framework that you are using and the underlying OS/Servers that you are hosting on is essential.
You could try a virtual server with Amazon (or any other cloud provider). You can start with small instance and then scale up as needed. The cost is based on instance size and bandwidth, so it is relatively easy to estimate. Windows license cost is included. I'm not sure about MSSQL, but there may be pre-built virtual appliances with it too in that case you will not need to purchase full license and will just pay per use. Hope this helps.
4) Have you segmented your application into layers which can scale separately from each other? (ie, do you have a DB layer, a App Server layer and a storage layer?)
3) How does the application handle load? At what point (request per second per server) do you see degradation?
