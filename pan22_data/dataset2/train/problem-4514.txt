I think you can even convert powerpoints to self executing files. If powerpoint doesn't allow this, there are certainly third party utilities.
I'm looking for a slideshow style application for windows that I can apply to one monitor on a multi-monitor system.  I want to simulate it being a photo frame, in rotating pictures etc.  I also need the other monitors to be unaffected, except maybe a tray icon allowing some options.
Don't think it's possible for it to happen when the PC is locked, however, sorry. You may wish to look into alternative methods of locking - perhaps just input using Autohotkey?
I found some shareware called AutoWallpaper, which seems like it might work out well for just rotating pictures every so often, but A) I'm cheap an it costs money, and B) would love to have transitions between images as well. 
This might be CPU overkill, but what about open office impress /or msoffice powerpoint? If you make the sideshow and set it to run on a particular screen with auto next slide it should work except for the "when locked part".
It seems that most slideshow screen savers have a nice look to them (google's screen saver that works by pulling in images from picasa etc is pretty cool) but I can't use it at the same time I'm actually using the PC.
I'd like it to keep working even when the PC is locked, which might make this the hardest part, and might not even be possible.
