If you create a local clone of your target machine, when the time comes it's literally only a matter of copying the files over, ensuring of course that permissions are set correctly on the target. Then do a dump of your database(s) and load them on the target. It just doesn't get much easier than that.
If you do all that you'll have a dev environment that matches the live environment in a way that you can prove it with a diff.  You also get an simple deployment workflow that makes it easy to iterate super fast, and you'll have all the groundwork in place to build matching servers and scale out when needed.
Using your shared account for dev work is probably the worst way to go, as it's unlikely to be anywhere near the same configuration as the final live server(s)e. I suggest setting up a local machine to be as close a clone of your final target configuration as possible. In regard to physical vs virtual, if virtual provides adequate performance for your needs there is no reason to go physical.
