So many people make the mistake when making ethernet cables that they ignore the COLORS and stripes on each wire.  This matters.  You need to get both PINNING and PAIRING correct.
You really need a dedicated cat5/5e/6 cable tester.  Decent cable testers can easily be in the $2k+ range depending on what type of testing you require, ie certification, crosstalk, near end, far end, alien, etc.
99% of the most common mistake take 1 & 2 as a pair, and 3 & 4 as a pair.  YOU WILL DEFINITELY HAVE PROBLEMS if you do this.  Just look at one of the cable and read off your colors.  If you have the same color wire on 3 and 4(say green and green/white), you know you've screwed up.
Another tip, when making cables make sure that when you look through the front of the connector you can see the shiny copper tips of the cable. This will tell you the individual wires are fully seated and ready for crimping.
No, generally speaking, you're not going to find applications that are worthwhile to test a cable using two PC's.
PAIRING, on the other hand make sure that PINS 1 & 2 are a pair (meaning if pin 1 is orange, pin 2 is orange/white stripe), 3 & 6, 4 & 5, and 7 & 8.
