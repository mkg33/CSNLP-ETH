What about lighttpd? Can't remember if it has commandline capabilities though. It does have a conf file for mime types if I recall.
You don't say what operating system you are using, but I would recommend IIS if you're running Windows.  The administration interface is very easy to use.
Ubuntu server can have a LAMP server up in about 5 minutes. You can configure the mime types in the /etc/apache2/mods-available/mime.conf file.
as far as mimetypes, i think it sets something up from http://docs.python.org/library/mimetypes.html
it wouldn't be hard to write a script that uses http://docs.python.org/library/mimetypes.html and mimetypes.init() or mimetypes.read_mime_types() to get the mimetype mappings you need.  You can get an example 'web server script' from http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-really-simple-http-server-python and use that framework to add your mimetype loads someplace in the script.
I would go with apache. It is free, it runs on Windows and Linux, it will run all of the mimi types you require and there is a TON of documentation out on the web for it. I have run (am running) Apache on a Windows / Linux environment that hosts a web mail client for my IMAP mail server. Works flawlessly!
