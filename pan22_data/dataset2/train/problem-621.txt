I came across this problem when I believed a certain problem was in fact equivalent to the above problem. That later turned out to be wrong, but the problem interested me nonetheless.
If you prove the above problem NP-hard, then for any $k$, if we modify the problem so that every vertex chooses $k$ vertices and every vertex is chosen exactly $k$ times, then the resulting problem is NP-hard as well: you can reduce the problem for any $k$ to the Hamiltonian Subcycle problem by 'eating up' the number of choices each vertex has by attaching certain gadgets to them.
I've developed an algorithm that sometimes finds the correct answer, but often doesn't end at all. It's based on using Lagrangian relaxation on the TSP variant of the above problem, which is simply TSP where more than one cycle is allowed (as long as the cycles are disjoint). I doubt it's possible to fix the algorithm so it works all the time, so I haven't included it in this question, though I could always do that if needed.
If we modify the problem to require $|C| = 1$, we end up with the standard Hamiltonian Cycle problem. It's easy to see that for any $k$, if we require $|C| = k$ or $|C| \leq k$, then the problem is NP-hard: given an instance for the Hamiltonian Cycle problem, we simply copy this graph $k$ times.
You might find the methods that Joe Mitchell (CS-Stony Brook) has developed for treating a wide variety of geometrical problems that generalize the TSP to be of interest. Some of these papers can be obtained at the link below:
