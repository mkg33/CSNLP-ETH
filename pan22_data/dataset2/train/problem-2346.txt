Other than that look into your personal contacts or maybe one of your customers is willing to help. 
If it's a shader issue you can make a unit test with just the shader in question to iterate on the issue faster. One might be tech-savvy enough to edit the shader themselves.
You can sometimes get previous-generation graphic cards for cheap (that often still exhibit the same problem) if you ask small computer repair store nicely for a few old, used GFX cards.
Yet another source if there is one in your area would be your local game developer meet up / dev jam session. 
They often have some left from customer upgrades that they can't sell because the cards are too old.
Maybe your local public library or school uses the GPU brand you need and let people run software off USB sticks. They may have rules against that (for good reasons); Check with the library first and don't run the game back on your computer from the USB stick: If they let anyone run any software you don't want to get any viruses back from that computer.
