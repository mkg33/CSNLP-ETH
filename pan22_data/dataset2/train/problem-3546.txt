I have a gallery with pictures. If anybody links my gallery pictures from somewhere else (remote server), a forbitten image should be shown. This basically works, but now I recognized a strange behaviour with my rewrite rule. Here is the rule:
When I invoke the page on the evil remote server, which links a picture of my gallery, the remote server gets the forbitten image which is the wanted effect, but now something strange happens: Back on my own server, when I browse in my picture gallery to the picture which has been invoked by the evil remote server, I suddendly get the forbitten image there too, even in my gallery. When I hit F5 to reload the gallery, the picture works again. But this is not acceptable.
The gallery consists of shtml pages which links the pictures with relative paths and I can browse the pictures with back and forward. This works, every picture is shown. 
What can I do? I tried to change and combine or leave the flags of the RewriteRule but nothing can help. The only acceptable solution would be to set the [F] flag. In this case the evil remote server doesn't see the forbitten image but a blank page but at least my gallery works every time. But I'd rather want the forbitten image to be working. Any ideas?
