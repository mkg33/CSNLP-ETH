which shrinks to the maximum shrinkable space. However, the partition only uses 56GB and I want to create a partition of at least under 128GB (to be able to create a VHD of it). When I shrink again, I receive the following error:
I have a physical disk with two partitions, an old OS partition (with MBR) of 296GB and a RECOVERY partition of 2048MB (a default DELL recovery partition), both are not in use. I have successfully resized the OS partition from 296GB to 174GB with the following command:
According to this post I should defrag, which I did using several tools (open source UltraDefrag seemed to do the best job). It seems that all files are on top of the disk, but how can I check that for sure? And if not, how can I manually defrag/move files, to claim the largest possible consecutive free disk space?
In my case I resolved "The specified shrink size is too big" on data disk by deleting files which had some tricky permissions (I copied those from MacOS some time ago).
GParted Live will happily resize the partition, jus tbe sure you ran a proper chkdsk /f on the drive from Windows before booting GParted Live.
(Note: I tried to create a new VHD with the CREATE VDISK command pointing to the oversized VHD for the source-parameter, but here too, the 128GB/137GiB limit prevents success, it seems. Mounting the VHD and shrinking it had exactly the same effect as doing it on the original physical disk, which is why I now try to first limit the physical partition size.)
I am a dummy. and it took me 2 days to finally shrink my C: sys volume (WINDOWS 7). the solution I found is terribly simple.
