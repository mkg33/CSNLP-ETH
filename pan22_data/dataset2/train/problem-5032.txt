PS: I also visited http://www.whatarecookies.com/cookietest.asp and http://www.arecookiesenabled.com/ and they both claim I have cookies enabled in Firefox (meanwhile updated to v37). Note they both are regular HTTP sites. In IE11 they again report both NO.
It is similar in IE11. I set the Privacy setting to max (Block All Cookies), but JSESSION cookie based HTTPS sites continue to work. The F12 / Network panel shows in the details that the cookie is sent with each request. https://www.whatismybrowser.com/are-cookies-enabled on the other hand here claims cookies are not enabled.
In Firefox v36 (Windows) I set the Privacy / History option to "Never Remember History", but they still seem to be used for HTTPS pages. For example the page https://www.whatismybrowser.com/are-cookies-enabled claims I have cookies enabled.
Edit: It turns out the "Never Remember History" option does not turn off cookies. To turn off cookies, it must be set to "Use custom settings for history" and then deselect the "Accept cookies from sites" option.
