My plan is to build this solution on top of VMware ESXi with Windows Server 2008 for our server monitoring in both sites.
In terms of database mirroring though, I certainly considered this approach but decided that peer to peer replication would provide more availability for the collection of data reading from systems going into the DB. The scenario was if one of the sites was disconnected from the outside world, I wanted the monitoring software (which uses SQL Server 2008) to still continue to collect the data from all the systems within that site still. Database mirroring wouldn't allow as only the primary database is writeable. Peer to peer replication would allow me to take advantage of load balancing, which could potentially give performance gains and not just redundancy
Iâ€™ve looked into SQL Server failover cluster (MSCS) but then since I have two different sites (Production and DR) it would be to hard or maybe impossible to implement peer to peer data content replication ?
I am looking for SQL Server database solution which can replicate data between two sites vice versa (not just one way)
