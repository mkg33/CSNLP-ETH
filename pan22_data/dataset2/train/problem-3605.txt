I've been encountering a problem connecting to my computer for months now, and finally have enough information together that hopefully someone can help me.  I'm not sure if the problem with my laptop or my router; the laptop is a early 2010 Macbook Pro running Mavericks, and the router is one from Verizon, model name MI424WR-GEN3I, firmware version 40.21.10.3.
I'm not sure if the problem is with the router or the laptop, but maybe someone has experience this problem before.  If I start a local server on port 3000 for example, I can connect to it fine at localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000.  However, trying to connect to it at the local IP address, 192.168.1.16:3000 doesn't work at all.  The port that I forwarded from the router isn't working either, and trying to connect to the same port on the external IP address doesn't pass the request through to my laptop, either.
It started out as not being able to use AirPlay from my Macbook Pro to my Apple TV -- things worked fine from my iPad, but there was always a connection error with my Macbook.  Apps that try to connect my iPad wirelessly to my Macbook over the local wifi network, like AirDisplay, all don't work.  I later realized that I couldn't VNC into my laptop.  Now, I'm trying to forward a port from my router to my laptop, and that's not working either.  I tried to ping my laptop from my router today, and none of the requests went through, so I figure that there's just something wrong with trying to connect to my laptop from the local IP address.
