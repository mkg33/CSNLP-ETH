If you have installed Raspbian using NOOBS, the filesystem will have been expanded automatically. There may be a rare occasion where this is not the case, e.g. if you have copied a smaller SD card onto a larger one. In this case, you should use this option to expand your installation to fill the whole SD card, giving you more space to use for files. You will need to reboot the Raspberry Pi to make this available. Note that there is no confirmation: selecting the option begins the partition expansion immediately.
Use the package piclone, it's installed by default on the full Raspbian image. Great way to build, tweak, clean up and backup an installation.
Snippet to Resize Root Partition : parted -m "$ROOT_DEV" u s resizepart "$ROOT_PART_NUM" "$TARGET_END"
You can choose to use the default raspi-config provided resize script by including the package in your base image, or, you may choose to create your own script to package with your image, using the same approach to do whatever other first-boot configuration you wish. 
You can't, or at least, you can't use a static image.  You could write a script to resize it dynamically depending on the size of the target medium.
A 16GB SD card with Raspbian can be striped to less than 8GB and then written to an 8GB SD card. I've got images down to 4GB and used a 4GB card to receive the backup clone. The card can then be read to an IMG file on a PC using Win32diskimager.
The official documentation recommend will be shown raspi-config on first booting into Raspbian. To open the configuration tool after this, simply run the following from the command line:
The Raspbian Approach is as follows, I would duplicate this approach. raspi-config provides a resize script that uses parted (a command line utility) to resize the filesystem on boot. This script is located in /usr/lib/raspi-config/init_resize.sh
