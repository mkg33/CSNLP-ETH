I strongly recommend you not run the computer until you've replaced the thermal paste. If you cannot wait until the AS5 arrives, get some no-name paste from any computer store - even the cheapest paste you can find, as long as it's applied properly, is better than reusing old paste, even if it's high-end stuff.
I took my computer to a hardware store (same place I've bought all the parts). There I've tested with the Arctic Silver paste on the stock cooler. It held the temperature a bit longer, but the processor was still overheating a lot (got about 85C after a minute).
Then I've tested with a new cooler (Cooler Master TX3, huge thing) and voil√†. Not the best I could've got, but was a bargain and looks like better than the stock. Seems like the old cooler was just... old. Now the temperatures are stable around 35-37C idle/45-50C moderate use.
There's your problem. Whenever you take the cooler off the CPU, you need to clean off the remnants of the thermal paste, using strong (90%+) isopropyl alcohol, and reapply new paste. Never leave the old paste there, because air bubbles will form within it, reducing heat transfer between the CPU die and the heatsink. That's why your processor is overheating.
