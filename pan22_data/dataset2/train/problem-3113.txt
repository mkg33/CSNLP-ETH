If PHP is configured properly in Apache and the client is functioning properly, the PHP script may not be specifying the proper MIME type for the content output.  The Content-type often has to be printed for the browser to understand how to handle the data.
Are you precompressing your page and then allowing mod_deflate to recompress?  The issue you're running into is that Firefox has not received Content-length: bytes from the server, and therefore treats it as a partial download.  Using live-http-headers, you'll see that it does indeed have text/html as the content type and saving the file does have the proper rendered content less a few bytes.  Chunked encoding can also cause an issue if the content is just the right number of bytes.
You might try loading your server (if its not production or if you have a test copy) with Apache Jarkarta Jmeter
The issue happens when Firefox encounters a short download, either via a timeout or connection closed issue (through sigkill, etc).
Warner's novice assumption that the content type is set incorrectly just shows that he's not dealt in high volume web traffic.  I've noticed this behavior more frequently on 2.2.14/2.2.15 to the point that we backported a few patches to 2.2.12
It takes a half hour or so to figure it out if you have never used it, but it's fairly straight forward to use. You can make hundreds of requests and see the returned information from your server, and even render the pages if you desire. This may enable you to determine correlations, be it load, random, or incorrect headers\mime issues.
