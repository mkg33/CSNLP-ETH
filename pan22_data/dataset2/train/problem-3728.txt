I am developing a PHP application on Windows with WAMP. This needs to be deployed to a UNIX web host. The application will ultimately live on its own domain, e.g. www.example.com but I am developing it on my WAMP server under localhost/app1, i.e. I have multiple applications I'm working on, each one lives in its own directory.
A. Use the same exact domain name and enable Local DNS for the website (Windows host file resolve of domain to 127.0.0.1).
My problem is that I am referring to shared resources by their absolute paths, e.g. /images/test.jpg. Their of course works fine on my production server, but when I try to use this on my local machine, it fails to load those resources because I'm running from within a "subdirectory" in WAMP, i.e. localhost/app1/, so the link to /images/test.jpg fails. It should instead be mapped to localhost/app1/images/test.jpg.
So, my question is: how should I set up my application so that I can run the same code on localhost with WAMP as well as on my production host? I realize I may have been barking up the wrong tree here and should be structuring this completely differently, so any pointers in the right direction in this regard would be most appreciated!
The certainly makes sense, since now every call to localhost/app1/ redirects to localhost/app1/, etc.
B. Use a config.inc.php file for my website which uses a variable or constant to define the domain-name as dev.example.com, and on production as www.example.com. And also define any full paths.
So I'm pretty sure this question has been asked before, but I simply cannot find the answer by Googling - feel free to point me to the right site/post to look up the answer. Apologies for my poor search-fu... :(
