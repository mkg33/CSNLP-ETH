64bit Windows comes with both, 64bit and 32bit Internet Explorer and WMPlayer is either 32bit or comes also with both flavours. In most cases this doesn't really matter much, it's just that they cannot utilize more memory than 2GB per process. 
If you have installed 64bit Windows 8.1 it will use 4GB of the memory and even if you upgraded to 8GB it would still use all of it as long as your hardware supports it. No need to reinstall Windows for that. That is of course assuming that you really do have 64bit Windows installed (I'd assume so since you can find SysWow64 folder which, AFAIK, does not exist in 32bit Windows). 
As for files from SysWow64 not appearing in task manager, this might have something to do with the fact that the folders in 64bit Windows are more or less one and the same (this is based on some odd memories I have from past, I think I edited one file for reason or another from System32 and same edit appeared in SysWow64. It's possibly symlink or junkion or some such, someone wiser may give more information on that).
