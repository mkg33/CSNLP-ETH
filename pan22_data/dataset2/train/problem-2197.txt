If you do not like PerfMon, there is also XPerf for the "hardcore" among us.  I am still trying to get through the documentation . . . eventually.
The standard Windows performance monitor application is capable of monitoring servers through the network.
You can do this with standard windows tools like Windows Performance Monitor (should be already installed on your server). You can set them up to collect data throughout the day so that you can review them for bottlenecks later on.
Check the Syskit it can connect to the server and extract info aobut the performance of all applications. The application is commercial but mention you read about it on the super user and mention me so I will tell guys to provide good discount :-) 
There are also plenty of other tools available for this purpose. I have compiled a list of windows server performance monitoring tools (40 of them) which should give you a good overview.
We have used Paessler PRTG for this and it is easy to install and configure using WMI and SNMP (Among other things) The free version will give 10 sensor and a simple update will get you 20 sensors and there is a free trial of the full product.  Supports e-mail alerts if certain conditions defined by you are met. Helped us identify issues quickly. PRTG
