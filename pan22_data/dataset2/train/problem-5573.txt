So the only laptop which is giving me trouble is the one which is (wifi) connected to the same access point.
SOLVED - The problem turned out to be that I had my "guest network" turned off.  I guess by doing this, the router defaults to a network isolation mode which prevents one wifi device from talking directly to another wifi device.  All is well now after hours of experimenting with AP settings and printer settings.
I had a similar issue where I couldn't print while wirelessly connected to the same access point that my wireless printer was connected to.  I was using two APs and the one that I was having problems with was a Linksys Smart Wi-Fi.  
my access point ( engenius ecb 300) which is located at the second floor is utp-wired to my router  which is located at the first floor.
Now somehow I can't connect from my laptop to my printer. I can ping every other device which is utp-wired to my router (raspberry pi's, pc's) but not to the printer on the same access point.
now my laptop is also in a room next to the access point at the second floor, also connected via wifi to the access point
My printer is in the room next to the access point at the second floor, connected via wifi to the access point.
