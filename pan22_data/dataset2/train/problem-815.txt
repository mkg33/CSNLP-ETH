If it is per database, could we then set up a different SharePoint site for each document library the client wants to host? This would be cumbersome of course, but I would presume that each SharePoint site would have it's own database, which would in turn give each document library a cap of roughly 10Gb. This way they could host more than 10Gb of documents total in SharePoint, but no single document library could exceed 10Gb.
SQL Express has a 10Gb database limit. Does this mean that each database (as in .mdf file) cannot exceed 10Gb or that the total combined size of all databases in a SQL instance cannot exceed 10Gb? From what I could find online it seems it's per database not per instance, but I'd like to verify this.
I'm open to other suggestions and thoughts on this subject, but primarily I would like to know if my solution above would be workable.
We have a client that would like to use SQL Server Express with SharePoint instead of forking out a minimum or $7000 for SQL Standard. I know SQL Standard is the best option here, but the price tag is a big barrier to entry for this client.
