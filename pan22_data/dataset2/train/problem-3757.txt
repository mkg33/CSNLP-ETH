For anyone still encountering this problem, I've found that using WICD instead of the default NetworkManager tends to be more reliable. I sometimes had NetworkManager continuously trying but failing to get a connection to my router (for no reason I could think of, other devices connected just fine), while WICD didn't seem to have a problem doing that. I haven't updated for a couple of distro's, though, so perhaps this has been fixed in more recent versions of NetworkManager.
In my experience, almost all of the network problems was caused by NetworkManager: can you try to remove it, configure manually your connections and then try again to start/stop the wifi? If it works, just purge Network Manager.
On my Eee PC 701, the alternate installer left behind a hard-configured /etc/network/interfaces, which prevented NetworkManager from automatically configuring the interface.
The first thing I do on a new *buntu/Debian install is get rid of the stock networking utility and install WICD...
I can confirm that WICD (in Ubuntu community repos: add community/universe repos in sources then apt-get install wicd) does recover from sleep and hibernate with Wireless Networking working more often than not on my machine. --But, it is not 100%, thus my visit to this web page. Pertinent details: Kubuntu 12.04 64-bit, Intel Core2 Duo, Intel 3945ABG.
Sounds like a problem with the wifi module. A rmmod followed by a modprobe of the relevant module should fix it, but you may need to shut down NetworkManager first in order to be able to remove the module. Don't forget to report this issue in Launchpad.
