Are you getting good online backups? My guess is that you're not, and as a result you're seeing delete items piling up instead of being cleaned up. That would be consistent with the lack of any decrease in size that you saw with the offline defragmentation.
Once it gets the online maintenance completed, the event log will tell you how much space the offline one will recover.
Look for Event ID 1221 in your Application Event Log. This will tell you how much free 'white space' is in your Exchange DB.
Check that no backup is trying to run during the maintenance periods set. You may have to leave an extended period and disable backups on say a weekend to get a full runthrough if it hasn't happened before.
You can force deleted item retention to delete items even if the Information Store hasn't had a good online backup, but I'd recommend fixing your backups first if that turns out to be the culprit. If you want to try it, untick the "Do not permanently delete mailboxes and items until the store has been backed up" on the "Limits" tab of the Mailbox Store's properties.
If the online maintenance isn't running (not seeing the event log is a sign it isn't) then there will be no space marked for deletion by the offline defrag. 
How are you backing up? I'm wondering if your backup software isn't setting the correct flags for Exchange to run post backup maintenance.
