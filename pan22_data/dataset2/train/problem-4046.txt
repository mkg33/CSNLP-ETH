If you're determined to kill their existing AD, I would look at migrating them into your existing domain, just with proper planning for the OUs.
The second option requires at least an additional domain controller (preferably two) for the new domain, because your existing one(s) can not provide domain services for two domains at the same time. Howewer, it is very rarely required to create an additional domain: a proper OU planning and administration delegation can definitely be enough for your needs.
That said, if you really need to migrate their users and computers into your own Active Directory, you have two choices here, too:
If you're asking if it's possible to have a single server act as a domain controller for two AD domains, then.. no
You have basically two options here: keep their domain alive and create a trust relationship between it and your own, in order to let the two domains share users and resources, or migrate their users into your Active Directory and get rid of their domain altogether.
If the number of users/computers is high and Exchange is involved, you should try avoiding a domain migration, or hire someone who really knows what he's doing.
A single Domain Controller cannot provide directory services for more than one domain. You will need at least one additional domain controller. It can be physical or virtual, but it has to exist separately.
Depending on the resources of the server, you could look at installing the Hyper-V role and create a new virtual DC for the new domain. 
I'd also ask why you're wanting to use a separate domain under the same Forest.  Microsoft generally encourages you to accomplish what you want in terms of resource segregation, etc. though OUs and Group Policy.
is there a way to add a second domain to an Active Directory installation? We are buying one of our partner companies, and want to migrate their users into our AD into a new domain. Buying another Windows Server to create a new DC is not an option.
