I've come across some Firefox about:config tweaks on the internet which claim that making those changes will speed up Firefox. Those tweaks are:
It may be safe but I'm not sure if it's right. I'm thinking about the max-connections-per-server, read http://kb.mozillazine.org/Network.http.max-connections-per-server. "It is, however, considered poor etiquette to make too many connections to a server and may lead to you being banned from that server."
Yes, it is. That configures your browser to make more connections to a webserver to download bits of the page in parallel - which a broadband connection handles fine. Dial up, not so much.
These settings probably won't make an noticable change, but they will make things more difficult for the server you're connecting to. Most tips for speeding up Firefox are either a bad idea or don't do anything. The only one I've found that does anything is turning off ipv6 (if your ISP doesn't support it), but I don't know if it's still needed on new versions of Firefox.
I have found that, generally, using a local caching name server, a local caching proxy (such as squid or polipo), and adblock+noscript has a far greater improvement in perceived performance on my overall daily browsing habits than specific Firefox or network stack tweaks.
