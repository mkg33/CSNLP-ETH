You may have luck with something like Ninite on the image launched at start up, although it doesn't look like they have Adobe products on the free version.
It should be simple enough to create the batch file, but I'm having some trouble finding a link to the latest versions of these apps that will always work.
What I'd rather do is use a batch file in the imaging process which downloads the latest versions of these apps and installs those instead.
I have to assume I'm not the first person to try doing this but I haven't been able to find much in the way of resources for what I'm trying to do.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?
We use a deployment tool when we image new systems and up to now we have always downloaded the latest versions of Firefox, Flash, Acrobat, etc, saved them on a server and then pointed to them during the imaging.  The problem with this is that those applications get out of date fairly quickly which means that after we image a brand new system it's running out of date software.
I assume that link will always have the latest stable version of FF available for download, but the problem is that the version number is part of the installer filename, so I don't have a simple way to create a batch file to download the installer because it will have a different filename for each version.
