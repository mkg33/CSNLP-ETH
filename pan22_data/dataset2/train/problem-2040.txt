I highly recommend using the netdiag /q command which reduced the level of output to only warnings and failures.
Can't say that I have a huge amount of experience with W2K AD domains, but if this was W2K3 then my first port of call would be the netdiag command. This will do some basic tests of your configuration including DNS.
I am having issues migrating my current Active Directory objects to my new Domain using ADMT. I have gone to a lot of resources to resolve this issue and they seem to point to DNS. Is there a tool or command or something that can validate my DNS configuration is functioning correctly? The DNS server is a Win server 2000 and is the primary Domain Controller.
Does your new domain run WIndows Server 2008 R2? In that case you can use the built-in AD Best Practices Analyzer tool (find it under the AD role in Server Manager) to report on non-standard configuration.
It's whole function is to hep you identify problems with your DNS infrastructure, and they have a specific module for AD DNS too.
Otherwise, you should go through ALL your DNS configuration, and try to draw it up on a piece of paper. Try to do nslookup's both ways, and put down your results on paper, the problem should materialize itself.. :) (some variant of "reverse-sudoku-solving".. :))
