If you choose to install Debian, then partitioning your hard drive will be the one of the "hardest" parts of the installation. If you're going to run this machine in a production environment you can tell Debian to partition your set up automatically and then do changes that fit your needs.
If you are using that 3TB disk on a 64 bit system (OS and hardware) installing any operating system should be straight forward.
If you are installing your 3TB hard drive on a system that is 32 bit and not 64 bit you will get in trouble with anything bigger than about 2.2TB since you can not address more than that. (2^32) * 512 is the maximum where 2 is for binary, 32 is the number of bits your system can address and 512 being the sector size (bits per sector). I have seen newer hard drives having bigger sectors, in which case you can install larger disks than 2.2TB.
I have not installed the Ubuntu server edition in a while but I suspect, since Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian, the installation process will be is pretty similar.
The documentation you refer to says 64 bit, so if you make sure that you install a 64 bit operating system as well, this should be pretty straight forward.
