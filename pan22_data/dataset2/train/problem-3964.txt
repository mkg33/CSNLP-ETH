If you are just documenting the emails, you could make a Word document and drag each email into the document where it will appear as an icon labeled with the email's subject. You can also add text/captions in the Word file to group or explain the emails, or group/arrange them in some logical order (for example, under headings like 'Phase I of Project', 'Phase II', etc.). When you send the Word document to the recipient, they can click on an icon and that email will open up in their Outlook. 
4: Copy the file BulkMailFromCharles.dbx from your Outlook Express system folder, usually found under 'C:\Documents and Settings....' to i.e. C:\TEMP
After reading your answers none of them hit the spot for me..... so I added both accounts as IMAP accounts to Outlook.
I have a collection of emails detailing work I have done for a recent project and I need to send all of these emails to someone.  What would be the best way to do this using Outlook?  Should I create the email then just add each email individually as an attachment, or is there a better way of grouping all of the emails together into a single attachment?
12: - Copy or move C:\TEMP\BulkMailFromCharles.dbx to the OE system folder, usually found under 'C:\Documents and Settings....'
10: - Copy any single file from any other folder, i.e. 'Inbox' to the new folder 'BulkMailFromCharles'
This approach would only be appealing if the number of emails was reasonable (my tolerance would be <50) and there was a benefit to the recipient in organizing them.
This can be achieved in Outlook Express if the recipient is willing to assist you a little. You should consider this solution only if you have substantial number of emails you want to forward.
