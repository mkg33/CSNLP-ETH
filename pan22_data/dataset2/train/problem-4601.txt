If you're looking for something a bit cheaper, try the Linksys (I guess it's Cisco now officially) SPA-941. I have a dozen or so of these deployed and they're rock-solid. They don't have the solid physical feel that the polycoms do, but the functionality is solid.
Assuming you can find a good price for them. The Snom phones are pretty good, mass deployment support, http admin interface and a whole bunch of little touches. Things like SIP logs on the phone and packet capturing if you really need to get in deep when trouble shooting.
I've had great luck with Polycom phones. I've used the IP450 extensively in conjunction with our asterisk server, and have never had a single problem. I've also used the IP4000 conference phone in the past, and it's performed very well.
I've also been happy with Polycom. The SoundPoint IP 321/331 is good for a 2-line phone, and the SoundPoint IP 450 for 3 lines. Both are reasonably priced and will last a long time.
We've used snom for years and they are very good. One nice feature is that they also support Microsoft Office Communications if you ever need to go there in the future!
