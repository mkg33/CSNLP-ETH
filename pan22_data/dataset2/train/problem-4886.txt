You can use OpenVPN to create an Ethernet tunnel. Just use the example configuration file of OpenVPN with these changes:
Depending on your exact needs and resources, you may look into DMVPN. It is a hub-and-spoke VPN technology that uses (m)GRE over IPSec and can use NHRP to allow dynamic creation of spoke-to-spoke tunnels. The mGRE would allow all of your different sites to use a single "overlay" subnet to route traffic between, and if you have devices you can put at each spoke location that support NHRP, they can dynamically build a tunnel from one site to another, which reduces the overall latency and load on the hub device. One of the biggest benefits of using DMVPN is the simplicity of the configuration. Once you have the hub setup for GRE, IPSec, and NHRP, the spoke config is all you have to do from then on, as the hub will dynamically react to having additional spokes.
Basically it is just a standard OpenVPN Ethernet tunnel configuration and there should be a lot of guides about it on the Internet.
