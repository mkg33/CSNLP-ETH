I looekd at Process Explorer from sysinternals, but I don't know how I would run this overnight and still have the information I want.
When the process starts hitting high load, simply mouse over the "green" area and it will tell you the .exe file.
Any network-wide AV scans scheduled to run overnight?  Backups?  Anything else?  These are normally good first places to look.
Problem: We have nagios configured on a Windows XP machine - it alerts high CPU usage almost every night and I am having difficulty tracking down the offending process(es).
you could always run perfmon and capture a log file to look at the next day. Capture all the process data and you will see what the CPU usage is
Create a batch file or other type of script to be run when Nagious triggers the alert. Then, using pslist or similar, see what's running at that time. My gut feeling is that it will be an automated process, such as backups, AV scan, defrag, etc.
I'm interested in finding a tool that will show me what processes are eating my CPU cycles overnight.
