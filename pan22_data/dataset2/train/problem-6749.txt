I am hoping that I would be able to log into this via the VPN because every now and then that DHCP device has a bad morning, and needs to be restarted. (I'm also looking into this issue, but someone else handles that, management separation gone mad!) It's a remote client, so it would be a lot easier for me to connect to these systems which seem to self configure, to use that as a pivot via ssh tunnels to get to other remote devices to continue to manage them, while out main route is fixed.
If you are seeing the fe80 address, this is the link local address. It's used for network discovery and other administrative functions, not to run services on. Every IPv6 interface has one.  
But I'm a bit lost as to where the configuration on my CentOS box is. (I am also on google researching this, but I like server fault! :) )
The "correct" way to this, assuming you don't have a ipv6 connection from your provider, is to get a ipv6-in-ipv4 from http://tunnelbroker.net and have a computer setup on your network as a ipv6 gateway/firewall. It's easy to do, however, this will give every ipv6 ready device on your network a direct public available IP address. If you don't get your firewall right, bad things will happen. 
I noticed that some of my Centos boxes have IP6 enabled, and seem to have addresses. I have no problem with this, but I would like to get a handle on it, and even connect to them using IP6. This would really help if for any reason DHCP has a hiccup.
I run a dual stack network like this at home and I can provide the shell scripts I have written if you want to go this route.
It sounds like you are not the uber-admin at your network, and since doing something like screwing up the firewall settings can expose every host on your network to the Internet, I would make sure you have permission first.
