I have same problem with an 16GB SD card of Samsung. After trying all the software solutions available on internet i moved onto hardware issues and figured out there is very small crack on the SD card that can not be observed easily. i observed it with flashlight.
I was configuring and running 2016-02-09-raspbian-jessie-lite on my Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+. Everything was fine and I used to shut it down using 
Its cause was the SD slot of raspberry pi. I put the PI in my backpack where he received some kind of force on it that resulted in crack. After this crack the SD Card shows on the windows disk Management as 13MB RAW Disk and noting else.
Now I am not able to delete or format the partition. I already tried to format/delete the card using:
I doubt it's your pi. It seems to me that you're just trying to do something with the partitions in diskpart. So instead,  use diskpart and do this:
But there are circumstances where I also had to pull the plug. After that the Raspberry did not boot anymore. No LED blinked and I only got a black screen. So I took the SD card and checked it on my PC. Windows was only able to recognize 31 MB RAW partition:  
I had a similar issue some time ago with a brand new SD Card, which failed after one use. The Card was replaced under warranty.
THEN format the card by using the computer management tool. Right click the disk you want to format (in this case your SD card). Select format. Format the SD card as FAT or FAT32. 
I can understand that the filesystem may break on a SD card when pulling the plug, but not breaking it completely!
