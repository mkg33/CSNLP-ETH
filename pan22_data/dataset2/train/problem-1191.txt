2) You could be bottlenecking something other than the drives with the SSDs, when the rotational media would bottleneck at the drive.  This bottleneck could be resulting in the performance difference.  E.g. network bottlenecks can affect the strangest things, especially when you add NFS or the like.  If you're tooling the RAID card, maybe it just flakes.
I have a database running on a RAID5 array of SSDs. Could this be killing its performance? When I do many inserts in a row, the entire computer starts blocking up. Even things like firefox start glitching. On my much less powerful computer with a traditional hard drive, the inserts w/ the same database version, schema, and data run smoothly. Could this be the reason, or might it be some other factor?
3) You might want to check the I/O scheduler, to make sure they match between the two machines, as they can affect performance.
1) RAID5 might not be the best bet for a database.  You might try mirroring + striping for redundancy and small file performance.
If not (you have a hardware raid controller), do you have a battery backup installed and write cache enabled?
4) Is the SSD database system performing database queries on par with the other, rotational media system, or better, or worse?
