Others might be using only IPv6 addresses ::1 (localhost) or :: (all interfaces). Try http://[::1]:8080/ in this case.
it sounds like your server may not be running on the ip and port you're expecting.  what is output when you run the following in a terminal?
Some applications decide to bind to only a single interface - 192.168.13.37, for example, if that is the address assigned to eth0 or such - instead of using 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces.
I've had this happen before -- using http://computername.local/ worked for me, but I'm unsure why it would be different than just using a name in a host file.
i'm not going to answer your question directly, but offer an alternative solution: use virtualhostx to manage the local DNS.  See also if MAMP is not a good solution for your local development needs (if that's what you're after).
you should see a line corresponding to your server.  if no line appears, then your server may be running on a different port.
What's your DNS? some DNS providers like OpenDNS depends on your settings might prevent you from going somewhere, so to test it completely remove DNS and make sure you have no proxy configured as well
