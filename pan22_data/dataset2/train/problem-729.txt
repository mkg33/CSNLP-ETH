I've searched this issue extensively online, and the 'new' epiphany web browser was/is supposedly the answer. I've tried 'testing' file format compatibility over at html5test.com, but haven't been able to play any of the 'compatible' files on any of the 'compatible' browsers (I've tried both .mp4 and .webm [both local files and URL-linked] on Midori, epiphany, iceweasel, etc.). The best result I've had has been in playing a ~10Mb local .webm file in iceweasel, which was able to manage ~1 frame of the video every ~3-4 seconds. I've increased the allocation of memory to the GPU, which hasn't offered any real improvement.
My web-based application utilises HTML5 for various dynamic elements (img, video, etc). I'm hoping to be able to use RPi's for system deployment, but I can't seem to find a suitable mix of browser/file format which allows for HTML5 video playback.
For each browser I then navigate to http://html5test.com and check the rating, and play a YouTube video. It's still very choppy. 
Note: Make sure you have Chromium-browser version 45. I tried with version 50, but chromium wouldn't open properly. 
I just wanted to note that I've been researching this topic as well and found some 'hacky' solutions. I've tested several methods to enable smooth playback in the browser using HTML5. 
I'm starting to think that the RPi just isn't up to the task of playing HTML5 video under Raspbian? Would installing one of the Ubuntu OS options for the RPi offer any benefit?
And finally, I used the glshim library to open chromium-browser with partial hardware acceleration. See the guide here.
