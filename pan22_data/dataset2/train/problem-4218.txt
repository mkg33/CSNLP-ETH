I found the best way to do it is to copy the db from one computer to another. navigate to /users/your name/appdata/roaming/ditto/ditto.db and copy "ditto.db" 
the path may be different dependinbg on your OS, but the point is you can copy the database, including whatever hot keys you have programed. 
I'm using Ditto Clipboard Manager and wish to share the clipboard on multiple machines on my home network. I've heard that you can do this but haven't found any help on it.
As for syncing automatically, there is the friends tab in options but I don't really think it helps. You can specify the database location though, so maybe setting that as the same network location for all machines could work?
I understand you can make the computers to sync ditto if they are on the same network, but I have not been able to get that to work. 
Bring up the list (Ctrl + ' or whatever). Right click and export. Save file and transfer to other machine. You can then import by right clicking on the notification icon. 
I managed to do this by sharing the folder where the database file is on the local network, the pointing the database to the correct location in Ditto's settings. It's working like a charm.
I changed the database location to a folder on my synced google drive, and did the same on several other machines. It works most of the time, but sometimes the sync on google drive crashes into the ditto app and corrupts the database. Make sure you keep a backup.
