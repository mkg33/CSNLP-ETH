You can also set the computer to use the external monitor as the primary monitor by plugging it in and then under arrangement in the display settings, drag the little white bar onto the external display.  Once you have done this you can either ignore or make use of the laptop display as a secondary monitor, or if it bothers you turn down the backlight until it goes off.
I had the same issue. I'm just trying SwitchResX and I think it solves the problem. Running it for the first time though so I'm not sure yet.
I think you can start it up and as it is starting up close the lid and it will detect the external monitor as the primary.
While I agree that this limitation of the OS is annoying, Mac laptops are designed to be usable while closed without encountering any heat issues.
I think the only easy solution is to just use mirrored mode, although that will limit the choices of resolutions you can use on the external.
OS X will remember that you want the external display to be the primary display, and all you have to do then is turn down/off the laptop display.  Not automatic, but it is close and free.
