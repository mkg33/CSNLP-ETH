I am running Windows Server 2008 enterprise in my HOME network inside of vmware workstation.  I am running this on my home network to setup a PPTP VPN connection at home.  I have correctly setup everything I needed to make it work, including opening all the ports, 1723 and 43 (GRE).  I am able to connect just fine, but when I connect I dont have internet unless I uncheck use remote gateway.  The thing is, I want to use the remote gateway to route all my traffic through that connection.  Can someone tell me why this isnt working and how to get it to work.  When I have remote gateway checked, and I do an ipconfig I dont get a remote gateway for the VPN connection, its 0.0.0.0 when id assume if connected properly should be 192.168.1.254 (my ATT Router).
It is difficult to advise something without clean understanding of the network scheme. But I think you just need to enable NAT on server's external interface in order to make it work.
Also, if I cant get the remote gateway issue to work, and I have to uncheck that box to get internet, does this mean my VPN session is no longer encrypted? I am fully aware the PPTP VPN is the weakest VPN encryption out there but still having that extra layer of security when im on an unsecure wifi connection makes me feel a bit better.  Thank you for all your help in advance.
