If you can log on to this device via its IP, it may have a function where it can turn a port on the bridge into a "monitor" port - i.e. all traffic that goes through it is replicated.  You can then connect something that captures traffic to this port.
An Ethernet switch/hub is technically a type of bridge, but usually the term "bridge" is used when the media types are different - i.e. you have copper Ethernet on one side and optical on the other - or wired Ethernet on one side and wireless Ethernet on the other.
Switches/hubs/bridges do not care or know anything about IP addresses.  The IP of the bridge is likely really an IP to a management interface and is distinct from any forwarding function the bridge is doing.
For an Ethernet bridge, i.e. a switch/hub: Ethernet frames that come in on one port is either A) replicated to all ports (hub style) or B) replicated to a single port where the bridge has learned the MAC address - if it has not seen the MAC address before, A happens.  Hubs only do A. switches do B if possible.
If it functions more like a switch, where it will only forward to specific ports that it has learned where specific MAC addresses respond, this won't work.
In the days of hubs this was easy, just connect a device that can capture traffic (i.e. PC running Wireshark) to one of the ports - all traffic is replicated on all ports so anything can sniff all traffic running through it.  If your bridge device functions this way it may still be possible.
