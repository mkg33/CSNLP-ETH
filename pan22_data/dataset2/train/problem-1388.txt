With option three you can get certificates that are valid longer but it requires you having your own CA or using a public one.
The second option is to actually trust the self-signed certificate. You have to start the Remote Desktop Connection as elevated administrator, then click the View certificate button, and on the next page the Install Certificate... button. Select Local Machine and Browse.... Use the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store and finish the import process.
The first option is what most people do and it is perfectly fine to do that. It doesn't install the certificate or trust it completely but it remembers to trust this certificate for a RDP connection only and only to the computer with the used host name.
Using this option any user on the computer can RDP into the remote machine without seeing the dialog, but you now added a new CA to your computer which is usually not the best idea and should be avoided. If someone hacks the remote computer, he could get hold of that certificate and use your trust in it for other purposes. The self-signed RDP certificate is for Server Authentication only, it can not be used to sign other certificates, but you never know.
When enabling RDP on the remote computer Windows creates this self-signed certificate automatically, but it is usually only valid for six months, so after six months you have to repeat either option one or two.
I still want to use the self signed certificate for verification. I just want my laptop to trust the self-signed cert.
This exception is for your current user only, another user on the same machine has to do the same thing.
Does "Don't ask me again for connections to this computer" do this?, or does this just check the name and bypass checking the certificate at all?
