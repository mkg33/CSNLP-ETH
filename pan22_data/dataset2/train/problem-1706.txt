You should be able to do this with an Ubiquiti Rocket. You need to put it in Repeater mode and enter the existing Wi-Fi network and password.
If this is not an option, you can use WIFI, but it reduces the available WIFI spectrum and slows things down for everybody.   There are a few ways to do this - but the key thing to know is that - as a rule - a WIFI modem either acts as an AP or an AP client but not both.   A common work-around if you don't use 802.11ac gear is to reserve the 5 gig band for communication between routers and 2.4 gig band for clients.  
If I am not mistaken you could even plug a DHCP router with the Wan wire to the rocket and create your own wired network.
Expanding on the last paragraph, the easiest way is often to configure an AP Client on one device, then connect its LAN interface to the WAN interface of your preferred router.
Ideally you want some kind of non-wifi connectivity from the main router.  It depends a lot on the cabling, but very often using Ethernet over Power adapters on each end can replace a WIFI drop.   
The problem with this setup is bandwidth is cut in half by every hop through WiFi and latency will be increased so you may not get the best speed or browsing experience.
