There's always a small risk of fire, but UL rated equipment is at least tested and found to meet a decent (minimal) level of risk.  Wisest course of action is to only have them on when you really need them on.  If that means 24/7, don't worry about it too much though.
I know many of you run machines at home 24/7 (servers, maybe even desktops) that run on standard consumer grade hardware/PSUs.  Is this safe? Is there even a remote risk of fire hazard?  I'm curious to know what (if any) anecdotes you all have on this matter.
Look for power supplies that are built to specifications set forth by Underwriters Laboratories (UL).
Leaving a computer on 24/7 has been considered somewhat normal for at least a decade. I wouldn't worry about it.
(As an anectode, when I had a PC power supply give (after about 14 months) up and brought it to the dealer and asked if they normally die that quick, he said "those (meaning the specific brand) at least survive the first year.  power supplies and hard drives are like tyres on your car, they are consumed by being used.")
I'm sure they are fire safe.  They may give up more quickly than server grad power supplies though, so if you're running it 24/7 try to get one with two or three years warranty.
