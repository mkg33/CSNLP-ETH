The default Gateway should read 192.168.1.1 - The same as your "Wireless LAN Adapter Wireless Connection" setting. That is the address of the router.
If linux can't access the router, we can assume the problem is hardware-based. Test as many of the following as possible:
This process should step you through the remaining possibilities. With every part of the chain tested, there is no possibility of the problem remaining after proper implementation of this process, unless you happen to be operating in an unusually high radiation or electromagnetic field.
I had a similar problem with my linksys router and even a factory reset wouldn't work.  Weirdly, a factory reset followed by plugging the router into my network (LAN) but not plugging it in to the power outlet brought it back:
If you don't get anything back, and you've already tried resetting the router, then try booting a linux liveCD on the PC and accessing your router via browser on the linux environment over ethernet. If that works then we can assume the issues lies with your network configuration on the Windows 10 machine - something like a proxy setting, protocol setting, or driver is causing issues. Troubleshoot those manually or reset to factory defaults.
