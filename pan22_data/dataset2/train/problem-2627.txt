If you can't afford to risk it, then consider restoring your server from a backup, or if it's a virtual machine make a clone of it, and test resetting the password.
If your system encrypts users home directories it is possible you could be in for a bad time if you then forget the new password.
What are the implications of changing the root password? Is there anything that will be affected? I'm using a private shared SSH key - I assume I do not need to change this as it is not tied to the root account password.
If you log in as root by using an ssh key, then you don't need the password. I have multiple servers on which I have changed the root password to be a random string of characters which is not recorded anywhere.
Keys that are already authenticated through ~root/.ssh/authorized_keys will keep working after the root password has been changed. And if you always authenticate using a key, there is no need to know the password.
Of course, it might be easy to create systems where the root password is stored somewhere for some purpose, but I would consider this bad design to begin with. 
I won't say there are no implications on your system, as I have no idea what strange things your might have done, but I've never had any on mine. After all, it's just a password. 
Standard practice is to not give root access to services like ssh, and instead have users sudo for privilege, this means you can track who logged in with the escalated privileges.
