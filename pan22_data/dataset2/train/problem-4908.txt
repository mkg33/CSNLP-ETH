IDS is different from IPS (intrusion protection system). Why the requirement for IDS, do you plan on reporting attacks or building firewalls to stop dirty network traffic?
Snort with an interface like BASE or ACID use a lot of CPU cycles, RAM and SQL space (Physical storage). If your dealing with a production level environment IDS must be setup correctly or it becomes pointless very quickly.
If you run snort on your proxy server, databases and logs are not maintained on a weekly basis, sooner rather than later your proxy server is going to hang from lack of resources.
So say you have a genuine interest in IDS, You will require a serious server depending on your traffic though-put to support both the Squid + Snort + Apache + MySQL + PHP WebGUI.
A more desirable option would be to setup a dedicated machine and dedicated monitoring NIC connected to a mirror port on your main switch.
Squid and other proxys can be configured to only transfer clean traffic... There is allot of packets of dirty data floating around on the internet, allot of them can be ignored.
