How about: https://medium.com/a-swift-misadventure/backing-up-your-raspberry-pi-sd-card-on-mac-the-simple-way-398a630f899c ? Found your question when checking something with etcher.io and my machine doesn't have enough free space for me to clone the sd i'm looking to at the moment but i've used this and verified it works to make an iso image that etcher will recognize but i haven't booted on pi again yet. Seems like a likely answer option though :) and i'd definitely agree this way would be easier for 80% of folks using pi with mac
If you are using OS X with the dd command, use /dev/rdiskX instead of /dev/diskX and also bs=16m instead of bs=1m it should speed things up a lot.
Disk utility actually clones the whole disk not just the "boot" partition and compresses it on the fly, which saves a LOT of time. Etcher is able to expand the image correctly and flash it. That means that the flashing procedure can take longer than the creation of the image, because Etcher flashes everything including the expanded non-data bits.
And besides, how hard could it be to type dd if=/dev/sdd of=/home/user/desktop/sdcard.img on a terminal?
Since Linux can read Raspbian's ext4 filesystem, there's probably a better way to back it up on Linux, maybe with some of tools that clonezilla uses.
Any disk utility that's not file system specific (raw backup) should do it. I think Disk Utility does it.
