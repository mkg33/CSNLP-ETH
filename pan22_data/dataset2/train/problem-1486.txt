The formulas that you define are the game design for your game.  You can specify whatever it is you want it to be. 
But if you want an example to work from, there are a lot of pages of people doing things like deconstructing the internal formulas in World of Warcraft.  Like this one, for example: http://www.wowwiki.com/Hit
You would probably do something like define a "base" hit rate based on your level compared to the enemy's level.  Maybe have weapon expertise play a role (if that's a stat in your game).  That kind of thing.
Ive been developing an RPG for sometime, and its far enough now where I need to get some formulas down for attacking and whatnot. What Im looking to understand is a basic hit and miss formula based on dexterity or another stat. If someone can give me a basic framework to modify and extend, or helpful pointers, Id be appreciative.
Here is a page with an equation to determine attack skill for Everquest. You may wish to follow the links on that page to other parts of the hit/miss/damage formulas. The formula has gotten very complicated over the years as the developers have added items that give bonuses to many of the secondary stats.
