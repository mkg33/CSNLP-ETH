I don't need to cache anything, as we cache objects in IIS, and that is why I need to specifically send traffic from 1.2.3.4 to 1.2.3.104 and 1.2.3.5 to 1.2.3.105, etc.
I want to create a new Backup IIS Server, which would have web sites and in this example have IP addresses of 1.2.3.204 - 1.2.3.214).  I would want to Manually fail over traffic to this backup server.  I will eventually configure ALL of my IIS servers to use this one backup server, which I will use for running updates on my web servers, and this is why I only want to use it as a Manual failover server.
I have multiple IIS web servers, each running multiple web sites each with their own IP address.  Each IIS "Web Site" through programming and host headers runs hundreds of web sites.  I want to insert a reverse proxy server for each web server that I have.  
The Reverse Proxy would have about 10 defined Listen IP addresses (1.2.3.4 - 1.2.3.14), each forwarding traffic to its own corresponding IIS site (1.2.3.104 - 1.2.3.114).
I know I saw somewhere there was a 'command line' to failover to a backup server, but I can't find what product it was, but I thought it was nginx.
Reverse Proxy to Accept all traffic on a given IP address (1.2.3.4), and pass traffic to IIS site (1.2.3.104) - This I can accomplish in nginx, or varnish.
