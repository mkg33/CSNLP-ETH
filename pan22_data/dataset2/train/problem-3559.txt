Furthermore this is indirectly confirmed by the information within Your Default VPC and Subnets, see Deleting Your Default VPC in particular:
I recall reading somewhere that they might add respective self-service it later on, but can't find it again and vague announcements like this are rather unusual for AWS anyway, so I might be wrong (and wouldn't hold my breath either way).

As of June 2018 (might have been available earlier) you can create a (new) default VPC by using Actions --> Create Default VPC
