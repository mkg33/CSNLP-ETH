As it seems, Windows compresses the NTFS compressed folders with the lowest compression ratio possible. While this maybe good for increasing speed and decreasing CPU load, for the files that are accessed rarely (backup folders) it would be more sensible to have the possibility to increase the compression ratio. Are there some parameters that may be tweaked to achieve this?
1 Folders aren't actually compressed: their compression attribute only gives a default compression state to new files and subfolders.
Ontop of that, there is a program that can mount 7z and rar archives as a virtual drive: http://www.winarchiver.com/virtual-drive.htm
I would advise to use an archiver such as 7-zip or Winrar for this purpose. With Winrar, it is even possible to access a file that is inside an archiver. Do note that it will first extract the entire archive before it can access the file, and it will update the archive with modifications when you close and save to the file. This can make the entire process slow, but given that it is a backup that should be okay.
You can increase compression ratio by 3rd-party apps. The prime example is zipmagic.co  I've used it on my laptop for a year without any problem. But notice that using NTFS or Zipmagic compression needs SSD hard drive because compression will make your drive totally fragmented and make it useless! If you have SSD drive, so go ahead and enjoy! 
Files and folders1 are compressed and decompressed by passing a FSCTL_SET_COMPRESSION control code and a compression state to the DeviceIoControl API function. The compression state can be one of the following:
