Back when I still used apache, I learned a trick from a coworker. He piped the global access log through an awk script. The awk script in turn would then take care creating the different logfiles.
I feel your pain, as a web developer I have probably over 200 vhosts in my local dev - I personally don't care about the logs & log them all to the main /var/log/apache... 
Another options. Don't split them in httpd.conf. Instead, log everything to your main Access Log, and then split them later with a program like split-logfile. This helps to simplify your log configuration.
Maybe have a look at mod_macro. This has a more general approach, but I guess that this could help you otherwise as well. 
Make sure /usr/local/bin/apacheawklogpipe is executable. All you would need to take care of with this script, is create a directory in /var/log/httpd/access that corresponds to the virtualhostname. I had a script that would create a virtualhost config and create the log directories.
Is there anyway to make Apache automatically split up the logs instead of having to specify them every time?
Whenever we create new Virtual Hosts on our dev servers, we always have to manually specify separate access and error logs:
However what I did do was to write a shell script to add/manage all my vhosts - all you need to do is to tweak it to write logs to wherever you like...
