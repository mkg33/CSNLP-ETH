Too my understanding then the EFI system partition should be a Fat32 partition, there is no such partition. Looking inside these partitions then in the first partition I see the following content:
With the following as directories: ACERBOOT, BOOT, D2D, EFI, FACTORY, RyTools, SOURCES, System Volume Information
So I am wondering how is this machine supposed to be able to boot? It can only boot UEFI, but doesn't have a Fat32 partition with the EFI directory in it, and the disk has the MBR partition scheme, not GPT.
The computer has Win7 on it and I have tried to boot of both Win7 and Win10 installations disks and tried to fix the bootup but both fail, the Win7 says it is not compatible (I guess it tries to fix a MBR boot) and the Win10 just says it failed.
I have a PackardBell EasyNote TV43CM that has booted up fine up until now. Most of the time the firmware says that it failed to boot up from either the hard drive or the DVD drive but once in a while I do get a windows boot and then it says that windows did not shut down properly last time and gives the usual options to fix that but all of them fail and reboots the machine and then back to the same loop of failing to boot up from the drives.
Looking in the firmware (InsydeH20 rev 3.7) I see that it is UEFI boot only, doesn't offer me to enable legacy boot or anything of the sort, when I go into the boot tab of the firmware all I can do is rearrange the boot order, nothing else. I have also tried to boot from USB that contains both legacy and UEFI booting mechanism and only the UEFI boots.
