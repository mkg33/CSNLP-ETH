If so, you could enter a reservation inside your DHCP-Server for the MAC-Address of your Server - please note that is always better to assign a static IP-Address (especially when the DHCP-Server is running on the same device, as the DHCP-Role is started a way after the networking).
Open the IIS-Manager and navigate to the site you want to bind a different IP-Address to and do a right click. Now choose "Bindings". You can now either edit the existing entry and change the IP or add a new entry.
RAS: As far as I know you cannot change IP Bindings on Routing and RAS - if you have more than one network adapter you can choose the used adapter instead (which would "change" the IP used).
Please note that you have to add a second IP-Adress to your network adapter (in case you don't have more than one network adapter connect with an IP)
Whenever I turn on my Server all the local IP addresses (in the form 10.0.0.X) of RADIUS Server and IIS Server changes or sometimes port is assigned to SVCHost process of Windows. I am a beginner in networking field. Somehow I was able to make this technology work but only problem is changing IP addresses. I have to visit to the client each day for configuring the IPs.
