just go to the C:\ProgramData\Skype{FC965A47-4839-40CA-B618-18F486F042C6} and rename file Skype.msi to SkypeSetup_7.30.0.103.msi  and run installer agin 
The solution was pretty simple, you just have to rename the file Skype.msi to the name that is mentioned in the error popup message. In your case, it has to be renamed to SkypeSetup_6.1.0.129.msi. Then retry updating/reinstalling Skype. Mine got updated successfully!
Goto Roaming folder (type %appdata% in RUN terminal and hit enter). backup folder skype and delete then delete it
I had the same issue with Skype's version number 7.30.0.103 and was trying to update it since a couple of hours. I checked this page and few more pages before getting into action.
I found better solution, then uninstalling Skype first, here: http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-desktop-client/How-to-update-Skype-without-using-any-Skype-installer/m-p/707359
I.e. just extract EXE file from package and put it in place. Although I didn't find MSI distribution for current Skype, but I found MSI in that erroneous GUID folder I mentioned. 
Delete any Skype entry from windows registry (type regedit in RUN terminal, click find in Edit menu and search for keyword skype )
Remove everything about Skype , mainly the location you are getting in that error window. Uninstall skype and delete all foot prints which were left in your system.I think one of them stopping you from installation.
