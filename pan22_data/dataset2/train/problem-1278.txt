You can take a look into OpenLDAP, or another directory services solution, but I have yet to find an 'all in one' solution such as ActiveDirectory - there always seems to be pieces, such as GPOs, which you need to sort out yourself.
As Kyle said http://likewise.com is best but there is other product bit similer http://www.centrixsoftware.com/workspace/product-data-sheet.html 
If you're looking for something that runs on Linux there are a couple of directory servers out there.  The closest thing to Active Directory is probably the Mandriva Directory Server.  RedHat also has their own directory server which does some of the same things.
I second all the recommendations for directory servers. As far as group policy stuff, it depends on your desktop. If you're using the Gnome desktop it's possible to set policies globally through the use of Gconf by placing XML files in to /etc/gconf. The way to do this across all your systems is to use some kind of configuration management tool (Puppet, Bcfg2, CFEngine etc). The tool will also take care of any other system configuration files you need to dictate policy.
