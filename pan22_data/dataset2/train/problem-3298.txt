As of January 14, 2011, the latest version is 285.62. You can download it directly from NVIDIA, and it should work. You may have selected the wrong GPU. Also as of when you posted this question, those drivers were VERY out of date (199.xx was long gone).
Make sure the Intel integrated card is disabled in BIOS, as I assume you dont want to use it.  In Internet Exporer, go to Nvidia.com and go to the drivers page and manually download (or use the automated detection) to download the latest Nvidia driver.
With a little elbow grease, you can try out laptopvideo2go.com's driver 'scanner' to see if they have a modified nVidia driver that will work for you.  Or you can try some of the listed 'generic' modification versions that work with many models.
This might be a bit late, but this is the solution to the problem. You don't have to edit any file, just install and it works. I think the trick is in using a switchable driver.
You are basically forced to depend on Dell (or whomever the manufacturer is) for those mobile versions of the nVidia cards, especially if they are the Optimus hybrid type setups with the Intel video.   See similar requests from nVidia's forums, Here and Here.
