I doubt you could run 200 simultaneous users off a single computer (or you'd need a ver powerful - and costly - computer); however, 20 computers and the 10-user extender can get you right there, to 200 "workstations" served by 20 computers x 10 terminals/computer. Even with the "extender" devices, this will still come cheaper than buying, setting up and supporting 200 individual computers.
I was about to suggest Userful's latest product - http://www2.userful.com/products/userful-multiseat-linux
On Linux the X server is intended just for situations like these. I have seen devices like this in action, up to 8 terminals connected from 1 PC. I've found a simple guide for ubuntu here but the configuration could vary depending on the distribution you want to use. Google for multiseat and the name of your OS.
Note that the product seems to be somewhat integrated with (Ubuntu) Linux; the office suite could be LibreOffice instead of MSOffice, etc. From the description, I'm not sure if your business case actually requires Windows, MS Word, MS Excel etc., or not.
Large organizations which need uniform configurations use centrally managed software systems such as Zenworks.
In all of these situations you really need an IT guy for this :) Don't know how critical the ability to use the computers is for the company, but it could be a lot cheaper to hire someone to do this for you.
Also maybe it is better to get a couple of PCs with only networking functionality, then you could let those machines boot any OS with PXE (see this guide by hak5) or let them connect to an external X-server.
