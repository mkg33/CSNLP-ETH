This information is exposed to anyone with access to your media.  This is really what you're exposing with the option to encrypt used space only, with the outside chance that an attacker who gets periodic access to the media can perform clever analysis on the media to determine useful metadata (e.g. how much you changed, and when) about the contents.
It isn't clear.  If this is a rotational drive, and if there are no bad sectors, then quite possibly this information is gone with the outside chance that the NSA or their counterparts can retrieve the media and do some hardcore analysis of the magnetic domains of the drive.  Otherwise, there is possibly some data preserved that could be recovered by less ... extreme ... adversaries.
This information is probably as safe as the Bitlocker keys and the least secure account password on the computer make it.
There is no question that encrypting the whole drive is more secure.  If you are protecting credit card numbers, you're done.  If you are protecting your diary from the NSA, you probably want to go a little farther; they are serious Nosy Nancys.
Encrypting the whole media could help (only because overwriting with random data is likely to improve the efficacy of the overwriting with zeros), but won't hit the fundamental issues with bad sectors or portions of the SSD that are resting due to wear leveling.
