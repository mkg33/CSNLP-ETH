I did a “Memory Transaction Throughput” test with “Sisoft Sandra” on Servers and PCs and figured out that our PCs do a much better job than the servers . the minimum PC result was 5.4MTPS (on a core2 duo E7400), the maximum server result was 3MTPS  (on a HP Proliant DL380P with Xeon E5-2650).
Since this is a messaging application, and you're using HP ProLiant servers, I'd treat this as a low-latency configuration... If this is a easily-reproducible test, can you try the following?
The external server sends more than 1500 “messages” per second, but our storage rate is almost 500 msg/s for the local server ( the windows service and database are on a single VM with Xeon E5520 and 16 GBs of RAM on a HP G7 Server/ windows server 2012).
I did the test on multiple PCs (core2 duo and core i5) and Servers (HP G7 and G8, VM and physical servers), the result was the same:  all PCs get messages in a way better rate than our servers.
I tend to conclude that there’s something wrong with Xeon processors, but that would be a strange conclusion since there are dozens of Xeon DB Servers around the world.
We have a windows service which gets data from an external server and stores them on a local DB (SQL server 2012).
