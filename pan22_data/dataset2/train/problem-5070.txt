The Guest network operates on a different IP address range (192.168.33.x).  This allows your guests to connect to the Internet without becoming a part of your private network. 
Once the Valet or Linksys Wireless-N Router has been successfully set up with the Cisco Connect software, another wireless network is created separately for guests.
When guests connect to the Guest network, they can connect to the Internet but will not have access to computers and devices which are connected to your Valet or Linksys Wireless-N Router.  The Guest network is a virtual network within your private network.
NOTE:  The Guest network will show up unsecured but once your guests access the Internet a prompt for a password will appear so you will not have to worry about people connecting/leeching off your internet. 
Guess Access is a feature of Cisco Connect and the Linksys E4200 Maximum Performance Wireless-N router that creates a separate wireless network from your local network.  The guest network is different from your private wireless network and will NOT be available if you choose to set up your Valet or Linksys Wireless-N Router using the web-based setup page.  This is very convenient especially if you always have guests in your home who would like to access the Internet.
