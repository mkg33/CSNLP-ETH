Alright, so I used this program (forget the name, but it's the first one on the software center under the search 'dock') to get a dock, and since I had the dock I didn't want the launcher.  I tried a couple methods that apparently don't work on 12.04, then somehow I right clicked on this help widget that I on my desktop while trying to remove the icon from the dock and I saw 'Disable Unity' or something like that.  Since I just got Ubuntu today I didn't know that it also meant that menu at the top.  I tried restarting to fix it, but all it did was remove the dock, and now I can't open any programs except the system settings (from changing desktop BG) and the terminal.
Are there any commands I could use to try to fix this?  Thanks, and sorry if I didn't explain this too well, but I really don't know what the hell happened.
