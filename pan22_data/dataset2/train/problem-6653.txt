First: having two DHCP servers in a subnet is not going to cause problems no matter what, that's a very misleading statement. What will cause issues is two DHCP servers which are offering the same pool of addresses. You can have two servers offering different ranges of IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1-100 on one and .101-200 on a second) within the same subnet without causing any issues at all. In fact, if you want to have redundant DHCP in your network, this is a recommended/best practice way to do it.
You wouldn't ordinarily have 2 DHCP servers on the same subnet. That's asking for big problems. You would have one DHCP server that handles both tasks.
When you are booting clonezilla, it's default configuration will only accept DHCP responses from the server that it booted from.  Did you check to make sure that both your DHCP servers are configured with different names?
Why do you need 2 DHCP servers, why can you not use 1? Theres really no reason for 2 and they will cause issues no matter how many times you tweak it.  I think you have a misconception about DHCP ,your issue, and solution... 
Second, here's some instructions from Microsoft which may get someone a little closer if they happen to have a similar issue:
I think the trick is that you need to add the "authoritative" command to the top of the DHCP configuration on the Clonezilla machine but not on the PFSense box. That way if Clonezilla offers the client a DHCP address the client will accept that one first, otherwise it will fail back to the PFSense offer.  YMMV
I've never done it, but you can have two DHCP servers that both make offers to a client.  It is up to the client to pick one of the offers
