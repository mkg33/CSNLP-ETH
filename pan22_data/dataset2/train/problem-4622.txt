I have yet to find out if it does what it believe it says though. (my first attempt failed but possibly because pebkac)
This documentation shows you the menu, and what you'll want to do is click 'color to alpha' where you can enter the color code (get it with the eyedrop tool) that you want to send to alpha (transparent)
Since youre dealing with image manipulation for applications I would also recommend it because it just generally has more functions and better support than Paint, and its free.
In Windows8 I just found a Home->Select->TransparentSelection which's tooltip says "Make the background colour in the selection transparent or opaque".
Solved this by copying mspaint.exe to xppaint.exe on an xp computer. Then copied xppaint to a Windows 7 computer. When transparency is required, use xppaint. Many features in Win 7's Paint are better, but not this one.
It allows you to set any color you want to transparent so you can just fill the background of the image with some radical green or pink or something that doesnt show up anywhere in your star and then set that color to transparent.
