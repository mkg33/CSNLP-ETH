I would recommend using a parallel setup for testing each application, but once satisfied with testing I would probably use Detach/Attach: How to move SQL Server databases to a new location by using Detach and Attach functions in SQL Server
If you have a few dollars to spend, like 300.00 or so, check out idera admin toolset. An excellent piece of software. I used it on a recent project. It moved the databases and any relating objects, including users. It was worth it. In 3 clicks I moved all my databases. I still use it to move databases back and forth. I believe they have a trial version. Also you get many other tools, like moving users or objects across databases etc.
setting up new infrastructure & doing a cut-over means less down-time but requires more work.  As discussed, logshipping for a server 'cut-over' is the quickest way to do this, especially if you have big databases.
Running in parallel risks data changing between when you made the copy & updating the copy accordingly.  Updating applications to point to a new hostname can cause grief as well.
SQL Server  & Windows will be ok if you p2v but you'll need to stop SQL Server services before you start the p2v. Windows SID's ect will all remain unchanged, what windows wont like is the physical & the virtual servers being connected to the same network.
From my experience p2v is an excellent & fast option, but not ideal if you want to minimize down time.  I'd use it only when existing servers are not a mess & virtualizing is only for hardware rationalization. (i.e. your not renaming the box, putting it in a new AD ect.)
