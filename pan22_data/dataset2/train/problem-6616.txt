Per tlhIngan's answer, Bluetooth is probably the worst of those options for this application. Limited range and limited clients will likely lead to frustration. 
A typical Bluetooth setup is limited to 7 clients, so in case you are wanting to expand your project at some point in the future to control multiple light switches, ZigBee and WiFi would allow you to control an entire house, not Bluetooth.
That leaves ZigBee. It is designed to be low-cost, low-power and easy to integrate. That's what I'd pick for a project like this.
Most areas, both residential, commercial and industrial are oversaturated in the 2.4 GHz band of WiFi, meaning your system may suffer from interference if you go with WiFi. 5 GHz isn't always an option supported by the hardware for these projects.
I'd argue for WiFi. While ZigBee's cheap, it's not quite as cheap as the ESP8266 WiFi module, which you can pick up for around Â£1/unit. The ESP-01 modules are tiny, low power, and easily programmable using either Arduino code or javascript. WiFi saturation is unlikely to impact performance for this application, given the miniscule amounts of data being sent back and forth.
