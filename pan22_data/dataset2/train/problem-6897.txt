On my Apache2 system I found that a lot of visitors only wanted to pillage my carefully-compiled collection of Smileys/emoticons (seriously!), so I decided to use a randomly-generated symlink to the directory path that would be picked up as an Apache2 variable, and it was practically impossible to share links.
Place it into /var/www/cgi-bin, and check http://domain.com/cgi-bin/env.cgi, you will see the belows:
So, every 30 minutes, cron ran a perl script that would rewrite the .htaccess file and include a SetEnv as you can see below: 
Then, at the top of my PHP pages I'd read the variable like so, and later in the page there'd be that variable used to build a path to the apprpropriate smiley:
On RedHat with Apache 2.4.x compiled from source with --prefix=/usr --enable-layout=RedHat the envvars file is located at /usr/sbin/envvars.  I can confirm that setting the appropriate PATH in that file makes it so Apache and PHP are aware of it.  
NB: For Mac OSX 10.11 (EL Capitan) or higher, you need to run command csrutil disable in Terminal after rebooting and hitting CMD+R and then you will be able to edit this file.
I used the same approach as Stefan Lasiewski to determine that.  For Apache 2.4.12, the /usr/sbin/envvars file is sourced on line 49 of /usr/sbin/apachectl.
