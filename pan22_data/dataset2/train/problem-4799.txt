Our line is number 97, telnet to the loopback address and port 2000+our line. If our loopback had the IP 192.168.100.200 the command would be telnet 192.168.100.200 2097 in this example.
We use this feature for initial config of switches. Hold the mode button for 10 seconds and the switch will revert to factory defaults where the VLAN1-interface is a DHCP client.
You mentioned that the switch is hooked up to a router, if they are physically near each other you can use the following nifty trick to access the console port in a pinch:
You need a cisco console cable with RJ45 connectors on both ends. You will use that to connect the CON port of the device you want to login to (device A) with the AUX port of a device we you have access to (device B, e.g. the router). 
If you are going to be working with network gear you will definitely want a serial port, it is the only guaranteed way to access a device console regardless of it's state or config. Take ewwhite's advice and get yourself an USB-to-serial adapter.
When it comes to 2950's and DHCP client, I'm not sure if all ios version support it. It's a pretty old piece of kit. To find out what IOS version you are running, connect to the console and do a show version. No console cable say? Well, I guess you better go out and buy one. ;)
Device B has to have a loopback address and it must be up. Now we have to find out which port we are going to have to telnet to. Do a show line from the enable mode, the output should look something like this:
I've used this trick a few times in the past when I had to remotely access the CON port of a device when the person on-site didn't have the right cable or laptop.
You can use DHCP option 66 and 67 to configure the switch by pointing it to a TFTP server with a config file.
