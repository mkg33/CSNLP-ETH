Depending on what your actual needs are, you might want to check out Nagios (http://www.nagios.org/).
AlertFox: http://www.alertfox.com - It's newer, and a little bit rough around the edges still in terms of its user interface, but much cheaper and reliable. They also do transaction monitoring (they make the iMacros extension for Firefox).
AlertSite: http://www.alertsite.com - this is the best external monitoring service I've used, but they can get expensive. They have a nice transaction monitoring service called DejaClick. You record a "macro" of actions using a FireFox extension and upload it to AlertSite, and they run these macros at regular intervals. It's nice for e-commerce sites, to test an entire checkout flow - or any site that needs to check an entire process.
In case anyone is still looking at this, and you happen to be looking for just HTTP monitoring (as I was), I found that http://monitorius.com has a very nice package that is more affordable than those listed above that do more than just simple HTTP monitoring.
