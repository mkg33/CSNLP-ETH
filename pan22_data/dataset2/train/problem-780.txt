Also check your resolver file as well and delete the ssl directory in both areas then restart the sync process.  Obviously you know the puppetca --list command to check to see if a certificate needs to be signed.  You may also try to turn off your firewall and see if that allows the connection.  Check out the /etc/hosts to make sure its all there.
Make sure that the server's certificate matches this name.  You can have a different certificate name from the actual machine's hostname.
From the client, you should then be able to run puppet agent --test without problems, assuming, of course, that puppetmaster.example.com is in DNS and reachable.
Make sure your client can resolve "puppet". Forward and reverse DNS entries are important. As a quick test, add an entry to /etc/hosts with your puppet master's IP and name and try again.

Are you setting the name of the server anywhere in your configuration?  In the [master] block in your /etc/puppet/puppet.conf on the Puppetmaster you should have your ca_name and your certname set to something like the following:
