With IPv4, ISP's rarely, if ever, assigned a static IP to a consumer except for maybe AT&T and a few local carriers unless you registered as a business account with them. I understand with the limited address space why this was done.
With IPv6, it is unlikely any residential ISP will go to the bother of providing static prefixes. It makes for a routing mess, and takes a lot more effort in account management.
However, with IPv6, it's estimated every person can theoretically own over a million IP's each. For those in the ISP business, will residential users be able to request a block of IP's once IPv6 becomes more mainstream? I'm not sure what the equivalent subnet of a /24 on IPv4 is with IPv6 but I would think it would be reasonable to assign that many if requested.
Many residential ISPs offer "static address" as an (expensive) up-sell. It may be hard to find, but it's usually there. In the era of DSL and cablemodems, the always-on nature of the technology makes address scarcity a moot point -- the customer will always require an address. Providing a static, unchanging address is a means to extract more money.
Reason I ask is, IPv6 no longer supports NAT like IPv4. With the amount of IoT devices, mobile devices, etc, I have easily consumed 83 IPv4 addresses on my private network. If the ISP continues to only assign one IP, how will that affect the future of Internet connectivity for homes?
