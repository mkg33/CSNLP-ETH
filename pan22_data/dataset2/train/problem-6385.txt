this would differ from serializable where you would expect to wait for the previous insert to complete and commit or rollback before determining whether to notify the user that no rows were found.
Now, what about that caveat "this view will not necessarily always be consistent with some serial (one at a time) execution of concurrent transactions of the same level"? I think (I'm not sure) that means that it means that the snapshot "from the outside" (fixed at the start of the transaction) can eventually include rows from other  transactions but fail to include some other rows from that same transaction. 
Now, suppose we insert batch and details records in different transactions.  Session 1 inserts a batch and starts to insert details but before it finishes, session 2 starts up.  Session 2 gets to see the batch heading info, but does not wait on the commit on details to inform the user that no records are found.  Now if your batch and details are entirely in the same transaction then this never is a problem.
Phantom reads (be sure to not confuse this with non-repeatable reads) are possible in "Repeatable read" isolation level... in principle. But Postgresql de-facto behaviour when you select "Repeatable read" is stronger than the standard, (almost a "Serializable" isolation), so that, as a matter of fact you won't have phantom reads. Docs:
