I'd like to get autostart working so that if my hardware goes down, the mail vm (or similar) will come up on boot.
Proxmox is a free standalone vm server product similar to XenServer or ESXi based on KVM: https://www.proxmox.com
For the auto-start part you could use a small shell script for monitoring the physical hardware from the virtual machine and if it goes down, take over the IP addresses and what other resources you need for your mail to work. Or use Heartbeat, though I haven't used it in that kind of physical-virtual mixed environment, so I don't know if it might cause any problems.
The free version of ESXi will also allow you to auto start guests (along with all the other fine suggestions mentioned already).
I'm looking at creating a few VM's for our small company to be able to move mail/client services/development etc, and have hit a few dead ends when it comes to infrastructure on VM's (for free).
The free version has less features than the paid version as you would expect, but it's pretty complete and works well. 
This may seem "cheap", but if it's the case that there's nothing free for this, I just won't virualize important services. It'd be nice, but it's not important.
If I understand correctly you want your VMs to boot automatically when the physical server starts. If this is the case then Citrix XenServer does exactly this. There's an option called "Auto-start server on boot".
