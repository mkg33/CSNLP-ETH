It corresponds to an outbound stream (ie caught by an earlier ESTABLISHED,RELATED rule) or is to a known port on a known system - in which case it should be allowed or rejected before it reaches eth1.  THE RULE AS WRITTEN DEALS WITH TRAFFIC FROM THE WORLD BEFORE IT GETS TO THE LAN SIDE OF THE FIREWALL.
I never came along the case where I had to think about eth1 with respect to eth0 and the forward chain BUT this morning as in 99.99% (it seems) of the cases it just routes the packets towards the machines that are behind eth1.
I believe you are asking the wrong question. eth1 interface is not part of eth0_input, and eth0_output is not part of eth0_forward - although they may be related in your configuration
You will most likely find that eth0_forward chain has been used to control what servers & ports are exposed to the Internet, ie traffic originating from eth0 will be traffic from the world, and should only be allowed if -
I have a machine that has two interfaces, eth0 and eth1, eth0 facing the INTERNET and eth1 facing DMZ.
