Full disclosure - I did do something not exactly approved - I interrupted the installation process and added a junction at the C:\Users directory to point it to U:\Users (U: is my second drive).  I used robocopy to copy the installed DefaultUser and Public directories over to U:\Users.
I have created 3 different accounts: a local user ($dave) set up as an administrator account, a login through my Windows Account, and a Domain login (HQ\dave).  The local administrator account and the Windows account both seem to to work correctly.
The domain user is unable to access any AppStore apps, including the app store itself, and it is unable to Change PC Settings:  Clicking that choice under settings causes it to bring up a royal blue screen with nothing on it except the mouse pointer.  There are only 5 tiles shown - Desktop, IE, File Explorer, App Store, and Sky Drive.  App Store and Sky Drive  don't work. (I wanted to connect the Domain user to the Windows account, but since that is done through the Change PC Settings menu, and I can't get to that, then I can't do  that.)
The other symptom (possibly related, possibly not) is that, even though the machine is joined to the domain and I'm logged in as a Domain User with access rights to other shares on  the network, any attempt to access a network file on one of the other machines asks for my network credentials.  (This is blocking me from getting Outlook working because the mail file is on another machine, and it doesn't ask for credentials, it just fails.)  I can open the network shares in the Explorer, but if I actually try to access a file, then it asks for credentials.  I don't understand that one.
I have google'd a lot of articles on these subjects looking for a solution, and have not found anything applicable.  I would be most appreciative of help from anybody that has seen and solved this problem.
