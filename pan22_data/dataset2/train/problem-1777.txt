For those of you (like me) who have an AMD system with an SB8xx or SB9xx controller (and possibly other models as well), try this guide: http://www.wikihow.com/Enable-RAID-or-AHCI-without-Reinstalling-Windows-(for-AMD-SB85-or-SB8XX-Controllers)
Windows 7 will look for missing drivers (raid) and find those into your fresh install and finally install those (instead of getting BSOD) from your fresh install. Cannot be easier than that :)
I found a really tricky way to install Raid drivers into a already Windows 7 system with AHCI as default settings. Firstly have a spare hard drive that you will use to install a fresh copy of Windows 7 on it (but with RAID option set in the BIOS important!). Disconnect your main Windows 7 from your system before to install a fresh copy of Windows 7 on the spare hard drive. Now that you have done your fresh installation. Reconnect your main Windows 7 and let the RAID option set in the BIOS. Reboot your machine but force jump into BIOS to select which drive your main Windows 7 is on and choose to boot it now!
3) Run program InfToReg.. Open inf file of your RAID drivers in this program and save .reg file. Copy inf and sys files (select checkbox and specify correct path to target offline Windows). Or you can copy inf and sys files manually.
I have successfully converted a pre-existing Windows 7 IDE installation to a RAID 0 configuration. It was actually not that difficult. I read hundreds of posts on multiple forums and was never able to find a solution, so I figured it out myself. Below are the steps to accomplish the task. Note: If your current OS hard drive will be used in the RAID array, you must first clone your operating system partition to a hard drive that will not be used in the RAID array.
