For instance, if a player can choose between 4 colors/symbols for 6 spots there are 4*4*4*4*4*4 or 4^6=4096 possible combinations. 4 colors/symbols for 20 spots is 4^20=1,099,511,627,776. With over a trillion possible combinations, that means the probability of a player guessing the 20 spot on the first try is worse than winning most lotteries.
Hopefully that should be a good start to help you find some of the difficulty information you are looking for.
Games are about balance IMHO, the problem I have about this question is your giving an already strong position more advantages without considering strengthening the weaker position.
In a game like Mastermind, each try eliminates possibilities (in Prob & Stats terms, tries are not "independent", unlike a game like "guess the coin flip"), improving the probabilities as the game continues. The more a player knows about the code from feedback (symbols locking, symbol match counts, and other feedback), the fewer combinations the player has remaining to check and the better the probability on the next check.
The more options you give the defender naturally the harder it becomes to crack (because of permutation). But what about the attacker, competition in favor of a position is never good as it undermines the basic principle of fair play (equal opportunity).
