On Mac on the other hand, I find myself using Firefox almost exclusively since it's got all the GreaseMonkey goodies and it takes much less CPU than Firefox, which translates to cooler and quieter notebook.
I use Safari on Windows about 30-40% of the time (the rest being Firefox).  Safari has Apple's font rendering which makes the text look better and more correct from the typography's point of view.  See, for example Joel's article on the subject.  I find it being significantly easier on the eyes, and I choose Safari for lengthy articles.
Well, Webkit (the rendering engine behind Safari) is really fast and supports the latest standards. I would use Google Chrome though as it shares a large part of its codebase (including Webkit) with Safari but it is more suitable for Windows. Safari looks really out of place in a Windows environment in my opinion.
I certainly didn't like it at all. One of the main reasons is that, it really doesn't fit. This might be because I use Mac OS and Windows and it just feels awkward. Furthermore, the performance, I'd dare to compare it to IE but of course, a li'l better (I hate IE).
One reason why I prefer Safari over Chrome in Windows is because it syncs my bookmarks over MobileMe.
Safari will not provide any compatibility gains next to Firefox or IE. It is also far less stable than either of those Windows systems. Personally I see no reason to use Safari on Windows, except where you may prefer its interface.
