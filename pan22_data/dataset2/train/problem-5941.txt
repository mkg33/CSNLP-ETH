I would prefer at least an extension for Windows Explorer, but the closest one I have found is Ext2Fsd, which is a system driver for ext2/3, but almost everywhere I've read, it is practically useless in the majority of situations for anything ext4-related. Is there anything that could possibly be found to help my situation?
I have looked all over the place for a decent solution to this dilemma, including exhaustive Google searches, and I have not found anything useful at all. I don't want a separate, independent program to look into my Ubuntu installation for files, but the only things I have found either have limited support for ext4 or none at all. It only recognizes as a separate partition on my HDD in all utilities I have found, up to and including partition managers, which are unable to even recognize the partition type (not even improperly as ext3, which is common).
(Background: I went from Windows 7 only to a Windows 7/Ubuntu dual boot in the last few months, but it is not very fun to have all my Windows stuff accessible with Ubuntu, while having an impossible iron curtain vice versa.)
