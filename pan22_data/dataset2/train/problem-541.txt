You are recommended to buy Mikrotik's module to install into Mikrotik, and HPE's module to install into HPE. Mikrotik is usually able to use any modules, but it is not guaranteed; HPE in general would only work with HPE branded module.
What you have to be sure is that: your both modules from different vendors should have same speed rating (1Gbps or 100Mbps), same optical wavelength (1550 nm or 1310 or so), same fiber designation (single mode or multi mode; also same core size, 9/120, 50/125 and so on). You also have to find a compartible patch cord. Mikrotik modules usually have dual LC connectors, so one side of your patch cord will be two LCs. What is on other side depends on HPE's module, we have used HPE's modules with dual LC (but didn't connected them to Mikrotik via fiber, though).
Is it enough for wavelength and mode, like 850nm multi-mode, to be the same for compatibility or should I verify any other parameters? 
I can easily find compatibility table of HPE SFP modules and switches, of Mikrotik SFP modules and switches, but nothing about cross-brand compatibility. Is cross-brand compatibility a thing?
Can I connect a Mikrotik Router (hEX S, for instance) to HP/Aruba switch (J9776A, for instance) via SPF? What modules should I use?
