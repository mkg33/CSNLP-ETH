Definitely a location of the backup file problem, I've had the problem before and it was down to the fact I didn't have access to the file where the database backup was located, or where the database files were going to be restored to.
This is due to permission error i.e., SQL server doesn't have access to the backup file. It doesn't have anything to do with user permissions of backup file in Windows machines. This can be due to many reasons. For instance, if you copied the backup file from another computer, your computer may block the file due to security reasons. It can be fixed in windows 7 by selecting the property of the backup file and clicking the unblock button in it.

If the folder listed in the error message does not represent the same instance where you're trying to restore, it's unlikely the service has access to the folder. Try moving the .bak file to the current instance's data or log folder, where SQL Server will certainly have adequate permissions. 
I has this error trying to restore a .bak file to a new server when I had forgotten to specify a name for the new database it was going to create
In my work I made backup of database and I receive file .bak. Now I would like restore this database in my machine. But I get the following error:
Sounds like a permissions error is being masked. You have to remember that the user that needs access to the folder where the backup resides (and where you restore the backup, if using WITH MOVE explicitly) is the SQL Server service account, not regular users.
