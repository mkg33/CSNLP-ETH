I have personally not seen OSX on VirtualBox, but have seen it on a variety of VMware Products, Anyway, for this sort of thing, your best source for information is OSx86 Project.
In order to replace the features you'd expect from guest additions, you can use VNC (which does support clipboard sync) and SMB (for sharing folders). Here's a detailed walkthrough on how to set this up.
VirtualBox runs Mac OS X perfectly fine nowadays, but you need great hardware to do so smoothly (2016 Dell XPS 13 is not quite enough to run it without micro-lags). There are no guest additions available though, so clipboard sync and shared folders are not supported. Mouse Integration works just fine though!
As to the licensing issues involved, OS X Server is the only version of OS X licensed to run under virtualization.
This is not an easy thing to do and the legality is not clear - although, I think it is generally accepted that by doing this, you are breaking the Apple EULA which states that Apple software can only be installed on Apple Hardware.
