When I hit a test page (any of my test pages) I have on this server in my browser, it does work and will even set a session variable and dump the session scope.  However, the next page I try to hit reports an error:
Following the instructions I've found at https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/using/docker-images-coldfusion.html and https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/blob/master/staging/storage/redis/redis-master.yaml, modified as I was getting errors with straight copy/paste, I've come up with the following yaml file:
We are considering moving our ColdFusion servers to AKS, and have been messing around with a test deployment to see how things work.  To handle scaling of the CF servers we would like to setup a Redis pod to handle session management for the CF cluster.
I would normally check the CF logs at this point, but I don't know how to access them within a pod.  In any case, it looks to me like ColdFusion is crashing, likely because of some incorrect settings in the yaml when setting up Redis as a session datastore (since I just cobbled this yaml together via trial and error). 
What is the correct way to define a Redis container within the yaml and have ColdFusion use it as a session datastore?
 Unfortunately, searching Google for "kubernetes yaml redis coldfusion" returns a staggering 7 results.
