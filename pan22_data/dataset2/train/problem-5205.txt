The project crawl the http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html, and get all the stable chromium binaries.
Don't forget the slash at the end. For example, the current "dev release", at the point of this writing is 113143, and can be found at: http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?path=Win/113143/
In the same way, you can use this website to get the latest stable version of Chromium for Windows, Android, Mac and Linux, from the official repository : 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bugazelle/chromium-all-old-stable-versions/master/chromium.stable.json
If you prefer to use only latest stable Chromium release (or latest good Chromium build, for Windows users), check this website: http://chromium.woolyss.com/ The site is auto-updated each day.
http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?path=Win/ + version_number + /
As of December 2013, the best source for Chromium binaries you might actually want to use -- as in, ones that aren't potentially very unstable (trunk) -- is http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel
As stated by Diago, you can download binary releases via the chromium-browser-snapshots repository. Combine this with a quick check of which version_number you need at omahaproxy, and you get a nice direct link to your desired "stable release" without accessing the slow snapshot lister website.
