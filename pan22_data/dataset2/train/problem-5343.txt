Note that the files are all different and almost never modified, and usage is mostly adding files, so data volume is today 3TB growing all the time at around +15GB/day.
We never tried big commercial solutions, except R1Soft CDP since it was provided as an optional service by the datacented hosting our servers.
We tried R1Soft CDP backup, which is block level backup, and it proved good and efficient for all our other servers, but systematically fails on the server with 3 terabytes and gazillions of files. That is already more than 2 months that the engineers of R1Soft and datacenter are playing a hot ball game... and still no backup except regular rsync
Bacula is another popular one, and it sure has the coolest slogan of them all. And it even does not use rsync! :-)
Please do not reply rsync. Basic unix tools are not enough, rsync does not keep history, rdiff-backup miserably fails from time to time and screw the history. Moreover these are all file based backup, which put a lot of IOwait just to browse directories and query stat(). But i guess, except R1Soft CDP, there is no way around that.
Which backup tool or solution would you use to backup terabytes and lots of files on a production linux server ?
EMC Networker has an option called SnapImage that should increase backup speed for your kind of data.
or, if you want more control; just hack up a short bash script to do the same thing: one cp -al, a few mv and rsync.
Try BackupPC. For me it works very well with couple of terabytes of data and tens of millions of files (some 100 000 - 500 000 of those changing daily). OK, BackupPC does use rsync and is file based, so that might be a show-stopper for you.
