I have been load testing different configurations of hardware and using a Dell R610 w/ 4SSD in RAID 0, 24GB ram and 2 L5640 (2.26Ghz w/12MB L3). 
And this one from HP:http://smile.amazon.com/HP-NC364T-Gigabit-Server-Adptr/dp/B000P0NX3G/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1421347044&sr=1-2
Price isn't a huge concern considering the importance of the device, but I do like staying with name brands when possible (which is the less expensive option in this case). 
I was able to get great performance out of the RAID and the 4 bonded network controllers but while streaming to 2400 simultaneous connections using 500 different video files the CPU would max out, which would interrupt the media streaming when we reached around 2.5Gb out.
The big thing I noticed is that the StarTech has 4 controllers, while the HP only has 2, so I assume that perhaps the max output of the HP would actually be limited to 2Gb, but could do that over any 2 ports or combination of ports, where the StarTech could potentially do all 4 ports maxing out at 1Gb? 
I tried upgrading the CPU and RAM to 72GB ram and an X5675 processor but the R610 threw an error on bootup "power required exceeds psu wattage" so I am going to go back and play with the HP DL180 but it only has 2 1Gb network adapters, which we are already able to max out so am thinking of getting a 4 port 1Gb NIC card.
The datacenter I am putting it at doesn't have 10Gb connections, but I can get additional 1Gb ports connected for $50/each so it seems like a decent win to have the option of having 6 if needed.
Just checking to see if there are other things I need to be thinking about such as on board RAM buffers and such.
