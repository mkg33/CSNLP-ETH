Installation wise, its just a simple wget from the site downloads page and then launching ./bin/server.sh
Unless you have a need for many concurrent users or processes writing to the database at the same time I would recommend sqlite. It is file based so you don't need a server running, and each project can use its own database file (unless they need to share data). If you use a database abstraction layer you can move to mysql or postgres without too much trouble in the future.
Better late than never, when trying to figure out an answer for the same question myself I found this https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb - pure Node.js database, will run on every Node (I hope) and it's NoSQL.
It's NOSQL too and so far my experience of it is like having a database of JS objects that are linked together in a graph network. Best thing is I can use good old SQL queries to retrieve all the JS objects I want, those are linked to them, etc etc. 
What project are you trying to do? The database should be selected with the project in mind. I've run MySql paired with memcached with great results.
