This is from my personal experience with my browser rpg's. I am by no means a qualified database admin, and have simply found the above to work well for my needs based on experience.
I do this after every 'season' and purge the previous seasons data from the database. Keeps everything in tiptop shape, and also makes it really easy to edit the database structure between seasons, as there is no data in there to worry about conflicts. Only concern is the code changes that might be necessary.
First, do a full database backup. After you do the backup, I also recommend you load that backup back into mysql and verify it isn't corrupt. Assuming it's not, put it in a directory that is part of your regular file backups. After that, simply delete the data from the database you don't need. Or selectively copy only the data in tables that are required to start another 'season'.
As for past users wanting to view data, simply make a few 'top 100' static lists for previous years. Top 100 lists have worked for me in the past, although nowadays I just do Top 10 of specific categories.
