I have an OpenVPN server which authenticates to an Active Directory and asks therefore each user for a username and passphrase.
You shouldn't do that, because once your single key is compromised for any reason (stolen laptop, trojan, employee leaving the company, etc.), you will need to give each user a new one, most likely resulting in more time spent than you saved initially by creating only one.
On top of that it also requires each user to have a client certificate and client key (+ server ca.crt).
First off, I agree with Ingmar Hupp, you don't want to be passing around one single key for a bunch of users.  It's really not part of a good security strategy.  Additionally, as he mentions, setting up a CA and signing/revoking keys using easy-rsa is quite easy, and IMO worth the additional "manpower" (if you will) to setup / maintain keys properly, instead of passing a single one around.  
If you want to avoid the complexities of creating a CA and signing (and revoking) client certificates (although with the easy-rsa script it really isn't that hard), OpenVPN also supports static keys (generated with openvpn --genkey) that are very straightforward to handle (although they will also be used for encryption, instead of TLS).
Is that the correct way under these conditions? Or should the client certificate and key be created in a special way?
I would like that each user must login with their AD username and passphrase and that all clients shares the same client certificate and client key.
The reason I want a shared client certificate and key is for ease of management and it protects the network from someone brute forcing a password.
