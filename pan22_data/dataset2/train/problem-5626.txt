You can fix this by creating a link in your Cygwin home. The links can be created through Windows command shell. These commands should be run as administrator:
It seems like VirtualBox expected current directory to be ${HOME} when it was started. (Or perhaps it is a feature to allow run independent set of VirtualBox instances.)
I just upgraded VirtualBox for my Windows 7 host (to version 4.3.12r93733), running the installer program from another directory (using cygwin terminal) and let the installer start VirtualBox for me. I got worried as I saw my VirtualBox virtual machines having disappeared. When choosing "machine | Add" from the menu, I saw that the directory was not my $HOME directory but the directory where I run the installer (cygwin home directory). VirtualBox also had created .VirtualBox directory there.
Open Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager and under Machine -> Add, point to each virtual machine file (.xml or .vbox) open and it will restore the machine back to the Manager dropdown list.

I solved it (windows host) by double-clicking on the .vbox file of my old guest machine. Simple as that.
When I quit VirtualBox and run it from the start menu I saw all my virtual machine definitions appear like expected, just like described in ${HOME}/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml.
