Install cygwin on your windows machine and install both emacs and vim. Read about them and try using them. Whichever you prefer is the right choice for you.
I suggest installing Ubuntu under VirtualBox, then trying both vi & emacs. If you prefer one over the other, use that. But overall, it wouldn't hurt to know enough of both to open, edit, and save a file, without destroying it or your keyboard in the process.
Vi is a better option, because it's part of the unix standard, so any unix machine you ever use, should have it installed. This includes Linux, Solaris, BSD etc. It's worth learning the basics of it, just for that reason.
Well, you'd be better off at this point picking a Linux distro than an editor, because in all likelihood, your BASH book assumes you're using Linux.
I started off using emacs and then switched to vim. It is all personal. The issue can actually become a heated debate amount the right/wrong people.
Text editors usually support VIM keybindings more commonly than they do emacs.  Learn vi once, use it over and over again.
VI[M] is standard across all systems while the installation for Emacs will vary depending on any number of settings.
There are plenty of arguments for the merits of each online - a lot of it just comes down to personal taste.
