The goal of system-autodeath is to take a machine off the network, every day until someone does something about it.
You should check your vm date it's ok by running date on your shell, maybe a bad date is causing your deathdate to happen earlier than expected.
As a matter of fact, I'm unable to find the blog post referenced by Glen Turner, except for the autodie tool for Perl, which seems to serve a completely different purpose. I'm also unable to find out if it is something coming up from the UNIX world or is an idea born just some years ago.
Anyway, this does have it's purpose, a very limited and specialized purpose, but still a purpose. In a bug report it is made very clear the system-autodeath never was in the default installation. If this ended up on your machine, you might have installed this by accident with another package (the folks at Fedora most likely would love to know that a package depends on this), or someone else was so kind to install it for you.
Regarding how you got it setup I've no idea, you should add what are you using for virtualization and from where got your fedora template.
This is actually very useful if you want to enforce updates. In a maintained network (f.e. a corporate network) it might be desirable to have the ability to enforce updates, and if the system is not updated to take it off the network for security reasons. So with every update the autodeath-date is pushed into the future, if there are no updates (for whatever reason) the machine is taken off the network until a sysadmin looks at it.
The implementation in Fedora seems to be from Seth Vidal, discussed in the Fedora Development Mailing List.
