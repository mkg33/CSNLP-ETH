I am expecting very heavy traffic, with possibly thousands of tcp connections open at one time. This would require that the router has good hardware.
Why am I posting this? Actually because I was really surprised with what you can have for $50. I have a linux box configured as a gateway in the office. Well, to be honest, it can be replaced with my home router. I mean if you don't need 2 WAN ports with load-balancing, or snort installed, or 100mbit traffic, those cheap home routers with open-source firmware can easily handle it.
I don't know which one to chooose, because this information is usually not given on the router specs.
I have D-Link DIR-320 ($50) with dd-wrt installed. It can handle 50mbit torrent traffic with 2000 simultaneous connection (4096 max allowed, never seen reached). dd-wrt (just as other alternative open-source firmware) supports QoS per service, per netmask, per MAC, per Ethernet port. Can't remember when I last made a reset. I have blackouts from time to time  though.
It handles all requirements very nicely for me. Problem is with the pathetic CPU this has.... it will give in with 10mbit voip traffic (Small packets). HTTP, EMAIL etc can go a lot higher.
For something like 10mbit, 20-30 if you have large packets - look at MIKROTIK (http://www.mikrotik.com). The 450G is a nice little piece I Just put into use here.
