As an AMD Opteron fan boy, I'd have to say you should go with the Intel Xeon for SQL Server OLAP type duties. Istanbul 2425HE is an awesome 6-core processor and the energy savings are phenomenal in comparison to Intel's X5550 but OLAP is processor, I/O intensive activity. I'd have to say the Intel Xeon would be the better bet in terms of database/OLAP performance.
The 2425HE has 6-cores vs. the Xeon's 4-cores w/hyperthreading, the big issue/caveat is hyperthreading and OLAP. I'd argue that 6-cores is better than 4 since hyperthreading performance can be highly unpredictable in certain situations, but I believe for Xeons and OLAP, hyperthreading is just fine, according to Anandtech (link).
If its an OLTP server, and you are actually worried that it's going to CPU bottleneck maybe the app's really not an OLTP app.  The way I spec out an OLTP server (in general) is:
If  this was for a file/email/web/AD/etc. server, I'd have to say the Opteron is better buy in terms of price/performance ratio (and energy), but your case clearly calls for as much muscle with no regard to energy savings. No one likes waiting for ETL/OLAP type operations, reports n' stuff.
I'd probably go with the X5550, since it will give you a total of 8 threads, versus 6. You're using only one processor, so the X5550 might not be the most efficient processor choice; if you can, try to grab up an X3460.
