When dealing with network slowness issues I usually start with the piece of hardware that acts as the gateway to the internet for the other devices on the network, which is typically the router.  I'd reboot both the router and the modem and see if the issues persist.  If they do then I'd take the router out of the equation by hooking one of the PCs directly to the modem and see if the throughput is still the same.  If it is, you know the issue resides on the ISP's end, so you'll have to get on the phone to them (and probably be as tenacious as a terrier on a rat in order to get them to properly check into the issue).
Are you running torrents? Excessive upload bandwidth usage or a high number of connections can wreak hell on your latency and down bandwidth.
I would start by getting a current baseline for your connection's actual throughput.  Try disconnecting the router and connecting a computer directly to the ISP's modem.  Verify that the connection is indeed working as expected, and providing the throughput you recall.
If the problem is indeed with the ISP or their modem, you will have saved yourself a lot of unnecessary trouble.
