So I bought a new stick of RAM online and I kick it on today with the new one in, aaaaand... no video out, but still USB power. So I clear the CMOS and try multiple combinations of all 3 sticks (which the new stick is different brand but the exact same specs including voltage, timing, speed, everything.)
So I think it's the power supply and I go out and buy a new one and replace it. Still does the same thing.
So I take it back and put the old one back in, this time I replace the Mobo. Now the problem changes from endless restarting to no video and no USB power. Which is strange. Well usually strange problems = RAM problems. 
Alright, so I have a computer which randomly one day had no display when I came in. So I turned it off and back on, and it just kept restarting on me. Turn off, turn on, turn off, turn on.
Either stick 3 is bad, I suppose it could be the power supply but I unplugged the dvd drive just to use less power and still nothing was working. Then I tried unplugging the HDD too, and still nothing, tried all 3 sticks, and all combinations of the sticks as well.
So I switch out the RAM sticks one at a time, one of them triggers USB power while the other doesn't, but no video out, so I switched to internal graphics card instead, and bam it works. So my external graphics card doesn't seem to be working either.
