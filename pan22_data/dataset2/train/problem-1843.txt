What you will need is a .NET decompiler such as Telerik JustDecompile. (Any other decompiler will do, probably, but this is what I use)
SQL SERVER (through Management Studio) offers quite a few standard reports, but I don't see how you could change the reports. I don't even see an option for extracting/obtaining the SQL Code behind it. 
Now, within JustDecompile, you can expand the tree view on the left until you see the "Resources" available, most of which are the "Standard Reports".
(Source: that's how I wrote the Performance Dashboard Reports chapter in the book SQL Server 2008 Internals and Troubleshooting.)
Once that (or another decompiler) is installed, all you need to do is locate the assembly Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Reports.dll on your client (usually located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\120\Tools\Binn\ManagementStudio\Extensions\Application).
Note: You can rename the report to .RDL so that Report Builder recognises it if you want, that's fine.
Is there any way to achieve this? Specifically, I am more interested in security reports (although it'd be nice to get code for all of them).
