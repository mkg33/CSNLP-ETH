You could connect the modem to one computer via USB, then connect the two computers together via Ethernet. Have the first computer 'share' the connection with the second. I believe in windows it's called "Internet Connection Sharing" (ICS)
While what you are asking to do is not reasonably possible, a solution for your problem may be to connect one laptop to the router with an ethernet wire and set up an AdHoc wifi network to share the connection to the second laptop.
To do what you want you would need to connect the modem to a USB host (an AVR, ARM or a bigger uC) and then write the drivers for your ADSL modem (this pretty much rules out anything not Linux based). If you do this then you can add (at least 2) Ethernet ports (probably with a switch chip) and then just route stuff around.
I have a router[1] which i use to connect to inter, it has one Ethernet and one USB port. I have two laptops running windows 7 so they are not able to the USB as the driver is not available. Thus I am able to use only one laptop with Internet at a time. I was thinking if there is a way to convert the USB port into Ethernet or any other way to go about making the other connection usable.
I do not believe there is an easier way to do what you want (apart from just buying a normal router).
