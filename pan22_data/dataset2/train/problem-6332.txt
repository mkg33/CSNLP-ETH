For one, the geometry pipeline needs to be as simple as possible and just push geometry to the GPU with quite basic LOD management on it.
I did a presentation at Siggraph 2007 titled Terrain Rendering in Frostbite using Procedural Shader Splatting which goes into some detail of how we handle both the geometry LOD and the general texture and shading of the terrain. We use a combination of semi-procedural shaders in multiple layers. This is also covered in some more detail in the course notes for the talk (pdf).
You should definitely check out the Halo Wars GDC presentation, "The Terrain of Next-Gen." It discusses using full vector field displacement instead of simple height field displacement.
The last time I checked in on terrain rendering, ROAM was the new hotness.  Yes, that was a long time ago.  I liked ROAM a lot, though, because it was extremely simple to program, and gave pretty decent results.  I imagine that the technology has improved quite a bit now.  What are the most popular methods for terrain rendering these days?
For something a little less revolutionary, maybe check into geometry clipmaps. There's a good article in GPU Gems 2 here.
There are more modern techniques that fully utilize today's GPUs by sending only height and color textures to the GPU and building the terrain geometry via shaders (see Bruneton and Neyret 2008), but be warned that while this is fast, it also means you don't have terrain geometry on the CPU for physics and simulation. There's also a modern technique that dynamically switches between rasterization and ray casting depending on what is most efficient (see Dick ea 2010).
As an alternative to geometry clipmapping, chunked LOD is a commonly used technique that efficiently feeds the graphics pipeline and is not patented like geometry clipmapping. It is probably used in most modern virtual globes.
