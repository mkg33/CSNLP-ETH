This was bugging me too. After some intense searching I found a partial answer: http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/hidden-outlook-reminders-t3972914.html
Why a stand alone exe application just for this purpose? Well I had the the big red box embeded in the VBA, but that solution was full of problem (I believe it is because I have to use hwnd and other unusual system property to keep the big red box on top) . So to make things simpler why not a basic EXE that do one thing. You can use free tools from microsoft (Visual studio Community 2015 is free).
As of Version 1803 (February 2018), the "Show reminders on top of other windows" option is now available.  It does not appear to be enabled by default.
I found an addin called ShowReminders (http://www.sagelamp.com/pages/showreminders.aspx), which brings the reminders window to the top. It even works when you minimize the reminder window. 
I tried to test it and found that it was inconsistent; one time it stayed hidden behind what I was working on, and another time it popped up front. In both cases there was an icon on the task bar that looked different from Outlook itself, so there was at least a chance that I would notice it.
There is no way.  Our company tried escalating it to Microsoft directly.  One thing people do here is assign it a more obnoxious sound, to help notice it.  But Microsoft has told us it is by design.
