Many options to configure. Visist the web page: www.dd-wrt.com to verify what is the version number of you router, and install the correct version of dd-wrt. 
Without seeing the admin section of the router's management software it is hard to tell. The irony is that you can definitely do it with the WRT54G using a custom firmware for the router such as DD-WRT http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index or Tomato http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato Lifehacker and Howtogeek have good tutorials on how to do this. I'm not sure if that would be an option given the D-Link is unreliable.
The frimware DD-WRT is the best alternative to the wrt54g because this (dd-wrt) add to the router the capabilities as repeater, repeater-bridge, bridge, bridge-repeater router, and AP.
I purchased a D-Link DGL-4500 to replace my aging WRT54G around a year ago, only to find it nowhere near as reliable. It's been collecting dust since.
I'm wondering if there is a way to use it as a wireless bridge so I can connect it to my home network and then use it's ethernet ports to provide network access to several devices.
