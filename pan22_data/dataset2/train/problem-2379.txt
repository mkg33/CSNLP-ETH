You either need something that can do deep-packet inspection, and identify Skype traffic within the packet to use as "block" criteria, or you need to know what external host(s) to simply block access to. I'm not that familiar with the Skype architecture, I'm not sure if it has to go through a central server for any purpose. If it doesn't, then you can't do it the second way.
Since you're using MS ISA Server I'd recommend installing the firewall client on each machine (deploy via AD if possible).  You can then block on a per-process basis.
C) Use your DNS server to intentionally poison requests to skype.com and their associated servers so you prevent skype from connecting.
D) Use software auditing programs and periodically get a report that will tell you who has skype installed and, through company policy, remind them that it's a firing offense if they repeatedly install software on company computers.
How to block SKYPE when it's using port 80 & 443 in a network. ( better if I can do it by using ISA 2006 and without disabling web) I know if users can't install skype they wont be able to use it. So without that?
