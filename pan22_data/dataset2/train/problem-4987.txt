If it's a one-off job I'd try to get someone on-site to set it up locally (didn't HP reinstate settings when they swapped out the part? they always do for us). I'd then work on a very small linux bootable ISO with the linux version of hponcfg installed so you can boot into that and do what you like.
If you have used the HP version of EXSi, then the HP drivers are automatically installed and you should able to see various additional hardware listed in the Hardware Tab.
3) Edit the XML with desired parameters (login credentials, IP address, Subnet Mask, DNS Name, DHCP Enable/Disable & Domain Name)
You're not going to be able to do this via ESXi - it doesn't support third party applications that can do this type of thing. At a minimum you will have to enable iLO and give it an ip-address by physically doing so at the machine initially. 
This basically works the same as HPONCFG, except you are able to specify iLO interface addresses. If you are wanting to update batches of iLO interfaces, then I've made some powershell scripts for that.

ESXi is IPMI aware and does support remote management via WBEM which can talk to the embedded hardware management components (BMC\iLO etc) so it may be possible to do this via something like HP SIM but I've never seen an example. 
I was used to configure HP iLO from Windows OS using hponcnfg, but how it can be done when operating system is ESXi 4.1 without phisically connect to the iLO port (aka remotely)?
