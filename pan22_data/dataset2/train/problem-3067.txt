-r mounts the drive read-only (to avoid any further damage to data) and -t hfsplus tells it you're mounting a HFS+ partition.  (hfsplus didn't show up in the man page or with man -? â€“ I spent at least half an hour figuring that one out.)
I ultimately did use TRK, which does support HFS+.  I had to do a fair amount of Googling to get mounting to work, but I ended up with this:
I personally use 2 types.  "R-Studio" which recovers any type of file system, runs on windows, or BackTrack bootable linux cd. Have tried many many others, but these 2 will always stay in my kit.
You could try using PhotoRec, which is free, open source, and has some similar capabilities.  It's on the Knoppix Live CD along with TestDisk.

+1 to Alex - agreed you should get an external harddrive to perform the deposit point next time. I think your just adding extra complications to the recovery actions that you probably dont need.
Taking the drive out of the laptop, using a 2.5 ata connector, bought from any computer parts store and placing it in a desktop pc or an external harddrive case, then run your recovery software of choice. Ask a friend for loan of pc or laptop if you dont have a spare computer to work with.
