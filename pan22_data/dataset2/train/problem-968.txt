Your script is missing a proper shebang at the beginning of the first line. It should be #!/bin/bash.
I have spent the day setting up custom twitter notification on nagios. Everything seems to be in place and the notifications seems to be triggered but the script is not called. 
How do I go about debugging this? I have looked into the nagios debug logs and the command seems to be executed. But as far as I can tell something is going wrong since the file is never created. This has been cue for many rage filled rants about nagios this evening but that has not solved the problem either (and it is probably my fault anyway).
We also have custom slack notifications in place in the admin group and these work fine if I manually trigger a notification, but not the new twitter notifications. 
Additionally, it's almost a certainly that the nagios user doesn't have write permission in /etc/nagios3 (I'm guessing Ubuntu package?). Scripts really don't belong there either, but that's beside the point.
the file CALLED is never created although the notifications panel of nagios reports that user1 has been notified
