To check iSCSI, use iscsi initiator show and iscsi session show. If you see anything, figure out what it belongs to and remove its access.
For iSCSI, the only initiators are our ESX farm, which no longer has any client disks on this device - there were some datastores and RDMs that have been migrated or turned off. But that does leave the possibility of something still using NFS from within a client. 
I'm working on retiring a failing NetApp cluster. It offers iCSCI, NFS, and CIFS volumes to the network. For CIFS, we're fairly under control there. It's a limited set of shares, and there's recent "last modified" filestamps in only a couple of locations.
However, how can I be sure that nothing else is using the storage - alternatively, how can I find what else is attached to it?
To check NFS, if it's v3 and you don't have sessions, you could use nfsstat to check stats- that allows you to zero your stats and check which hosts are using NFS, if at all.
What does 'sysstat -x' say, if that's essentially zero across the board (I'd try it a few times over a few minutes) then it's clear.
