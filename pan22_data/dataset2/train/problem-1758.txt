Not much to go on, but this does seem like a classic symptom of an rdbss.sys locking bug.  I would start by ensuring that rdbss.sys and the client redirector (mrxsmbxx.sys) components are at the recommended versions.   
I have this issue where approximately once a year, one of my images in my asp.net web app becomes locked. By locked I mean you can't read/write/delete it, and if you try to, your remote machine crashes.
It then causes my worker processes to not release the related page, filling the worker process memory quickly. They try to recycle sometimes, but then multiple ones are left open and the ram quickly runs out as multiple w3wps are hitting 4-5 gb. I'm guessing the old stale w3wps are not able to be deleted because they are referencing the locked image.
This has happened twice now, and the file is undeletable, I mean absolutely undeletable. Tried force deleting, tried removing all holds/locks on the file using some utilities, tried deleting from a mac. If you try to delete from windows explorer on a remote machine, your entire explorer freezes and there is nothing you can do except hard-reset the machine.
