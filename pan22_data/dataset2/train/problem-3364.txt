Otherwise, the IT email server admins or your IT support staff should be able to help with recovery and best understand your system setup to assist accordingly. I know with Exchange and various configurations, client deleted items are easily recoverable but it depends.
You can try to search all email folders of this mailbox and/or other mailboxes attached to the MAPI clients of any people's computers that have access to this mailbox and maybe they can be found elsewhere and then moved back.
I'd be surprised if that error specifically caused any emails to be deleted. Typically this occurs due to the items being deleted from the mailbox on the server or folder where they reside, but still showing in the MAPI client view. So when you go to manipulate from the view, they cannot be found and thus this error. 
Recovery depends on many factors such as backups, email server purge/retention policy of deleted items, and I'm sure many other things. 
These emails likely got inadvertently deleted or moved by someone with access but the email server logs if applicable will give a clue from which IP address they were removed, etc.
So the emails could have been "deleted" or "moved" and your view wasn't refreshed and then you got the error when you went to manipulate from there.
