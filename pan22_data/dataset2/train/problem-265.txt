I have heard anecdotal evidence where people have said that the 4948 is superior to the 3750 & 3560 for iSCSI applications but I haven't personally seen any evidence of this. Network World have quite a few real world tests of switches if you haven't already come across those;
In terms of performance I just think of a 3750 as being a 3560 with the ability to stack. There isn't much to chose between a 4948 and a 3750 either. It boils down to which features you need to use rather than being able to say X is better than Y.
Taking the Cisco 45xx series (just because I grabbed that page first), you can have four different supervisor engines with substantially different performance between the SupV10 and the Sup7E.  The Cisco website will have full details on each chassis (and all supported modules), which you can peruse at your leisure.
I would agree with voretaq that the performance of the modular switches really depends on the modules installed. Generally they are demonstrably better than their 1U cousins though.
It's really hard to give a comparison of performance based on a chassis - To use a car analogy it's like saying you have a Mustang but not telling us the horsepower of what is under the hood.  The modules you install in each chassis will substantially impact the performance you see.
