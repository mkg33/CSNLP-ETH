Let's take CWDM as an example, a typical 8-channel CWDM system offers 8 times the amount of bandwidth that can be achieved using a SONET/SDH system, for a given transmission line speed and using the same optical fibers. For more, please have a look at this blog. 
Yes, one fiber can be used to transmit and receive signals. Have you heard of the WDM technology? This technology can multiplexe a number of optical carrier signals onto a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths of laser light. There are two common types of the WDM technologyâ€”CWDM and DWDM. 
Normally, you would use a separate fibre for transmit and receive, so two fibres for bi-directional transmission.  You can purchase BiDi transceivers, which allow you to use a single fibre for both transit and receive.  These transceivers use Wave Division Multiplexing and modulate the transmit and receive onto different wavelengths so that they do not interfere which each-other.  An example of this would be Cisco SFP-10G-BXD-I or SFP-10G-BXU-I transceivers, which both allow for 10GBASE over a single strand of fibre.
