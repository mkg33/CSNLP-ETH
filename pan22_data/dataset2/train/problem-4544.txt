There might be some restrictions on some of the domains. .org should be restricted to non-commercial organisations (like charities, for example), so you might not be able to get them all.
What will your users expect to enter? Are they likely to type "domain.info" instead of "domain.com"?
In my experience domain names are often registered by domain squatters when you release them. I've seen the oddest names being registered by domain squatters after the original registration expired and were released because the administrative contact messed up (or the contact details were wrong). I don't know where the squatters get their information, but it seems they know.
So: when registering multiple domains, make sure you can afford to maintain them. If not, then let sleeping dogs lie.
However, you should get all you can afford. You don't want someone buying one you don't own with the aim of redirecting traffic away from your site.
They're so cheap, so I usually add the ".net". I wouldn't bother with anything other than the "big three" .com, .net and .org.
If you have registered multiple domains (with only the TLD differing), it would be good to redirect those requests to your main domain.  If you have multiple domains, duplicating content, then you may receive the Google penalty for duplicated content.   If you have a redirect on it, you will direct all that nice page rank to your main domain.
Considering it only costs about $8.00 to squat on a domain, why not?  If you think the site is going to be very successful, I would definitely do it, and I would also get *yourdomainname***sucks**.com before someone else who wants to mess with you does.
