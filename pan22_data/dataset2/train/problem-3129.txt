The update in specific updated the programs found at /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ - specifically ARDAgent.app
ARDAgent goes hand in hand with Apple Remote Desktop which is used to help manage multiple Macs either through controlling (ala VNC), copying files, installing packages, restarting, etc. For most people it's a non-issue. For businesses or other places that use Apple Remote Desktop the new version brings some very nice bug fixes. (I'll never log myself out again trying to log off a remote computer again!)
UPDATE: For what it's worth, I just ran Software Update on my own MacBook and saw the update you're referring to.  Here's the link to Apple Support's article describing the update.  In fact, it mentions:
The update you're referring to probably updated unseen client-side support built into OS X.  For desktops that aren't being managed by Apple Remote Desktop, I would guess the update is innocuous.
If you're talking about the Apple Remote Desktop app, assuming it was installed and purchased, info can be found here. 
To take advantage of the functionality you've just seen updated, you probably need "Apple Remote Desktop", which seems to be an enterprise remote management tool like Microsoft's Systems Management Server, but for OSX.
