If it's running on a P4, I'd assume it's not on server hardware. If your hardware isn't on the HCL, I would fully expect to see performance issues. 
For large/new systems (many cores, x64, more than 4 GB) Windows Server 2008 (R2) is the best choice.
Windows Server 2008 is defintiely more resource hungry than 2003; a base setup sits idly using about 400 MB of memory, while the same base setup with Windows 2003 uses less than 100. A DC/DNS/DHCP (standard infrastructure roles) uses about 600 MB, and again, to do the same with Windows 2003 less than 200 are enough. This is especially painful in virtual test environments, where you're going to use 600 MB of valuable RAM only to create a DC.
Personally I've dealt with both 2003 and 2008 and not seen any noticable difference in application performance.  This is based on systems that are not using 100% of their memory and are using clean installs instead of upgrades - I don't trust upgrade installations for my home PC, so I certainly don't trust it for production servers.   If you are short on RAM then 2008 will use a bit more which will cause problem.  2008 also requires more disk space than 2003- not an issue in most environments, but something to be aware of.
That said, Windows Server 2008 actually improves performances, if you have adequate resources; it scales a lot better than its predecessor.
For small/old systems (few cores, x86, less than 4 GB) Windows Server 2003 is still the best solution, unless of course you actually need 2008 features.
