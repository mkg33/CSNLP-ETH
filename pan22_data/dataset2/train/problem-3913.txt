I would not consider using Vista with SSD's.  Vista was not optimized for use with SSD's (nor was XP) and has some serious performance bottlenecks.  You would be better off with SSD's on Windows 7 which has shown to have significant SSD perofrmance improvements.
This is a good source for SSD optimization tips.  While the product-specific information is obviously only applicable to OCZ's products, there are a lot of Windows SSD optimization tips on this forum that would be applicable to any SSD.  http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=186
As you're talking about your system and applications drive, then reliability shouldn't be a concern, right?
There are a number of optimizations you can use to reduce the amount of disk writes that Windows performs.
Generally SSDs (while flaky in performance some times) have a much more reliable mode of operation - and can warn you when it starts to break down. Of course, interface electronics and other stuff can suddenly stop working, as always. And as noted in other answers, performance may degrade with wear - replace them in time.
You have no important data on it, if it breaks - just replace the drive(s) and restore the system from the last system backup. Easy, fast and shouldn't cost you more than an hour or so.
SSD's may be susceptible to static electical disturbance.  As long as you don't care if you lose everything (say you have good backups and can restore from an image) then RAID0 is fine and should give a nice boost, though i've never seen any benchmarks to confirm this with SSD's.
I'd never use standard spinning-disk HDDs in RAID-0 for data I cared about, but you may find that SSDs actually have a longer lifespan in RAID-0 because the number of writes going to each drive is reduced.
