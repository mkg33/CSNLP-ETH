There is definitely a hardware problem, hence the knee-jerk "mainboard" diagnosis.  As has been suggested, your best bet is to strip the system down as much as possible and test.  Then add back one component at a time to see where it starts to fall down.
First, I'd recommend downloading the ultimate boot CD - it has a broad variety of diagnostics that could come in handy.
I hope your unit is still under warranty, but from what you write it doesn't sound like it.  Replacement motherboards seem to run $300 and up, less for a "refurb".  If you try a refurb mainboard, you might be able to get credit by sending the guy who fixes them your old one to work on.
You may be better off ringing a replacement / spare parts company and finding a replacement motherboard or even just getting a different second hand laptop off of eBay.
From what you've said so far, it sounds like either a problem with the HD controller (integrated in the mainboard) or a RAM problem.  You might want to run a RAM test overnight to see if it turns up any problems.
It really depends what the problem is - there is no harm in opening it up and re soldering parts if you find anything obvious such as a burnt out capacitor... but it won't be easy.
If the computer turns on, shows lights, stays on, but hangs, I'd say it could be fixed by resetting the bios/cmos. But shutting down immediately doesn't sound good. We'll need more info to possibly help.
