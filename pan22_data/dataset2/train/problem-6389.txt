I recently did a Fresh Install of Windows 10 about a week ago now, all was fine up until last night where my internet started randomly disconnecting every 2 minutes and then it eventually spanned out to every 20 minutes, this went on for the rest of the night.
My friend said he had the same problem with windows 10 when he freshly Installed it but fixed it by installing Windows 8 and then Upgrading to Windows 10, so I did that this morning at around 10am, its now 9:50 and I my PC disconnected for the first time at 9:30 and then again 10 minutes later, both times were for around 2 minutes.
I have looked everywhere for a solution and it seems everyone that has this problem can't find one, my Power Settings are fine and other devices on my network do not Disconnect, I haven't installed anything recently and if so it would be resolved with the fresh install I did today. This literally started happening randomly.
I then tried to install the driver that came with my motherboard which still resulted in the same outcome and also downloaded the newest up to date driver from broadcoms website which still ended up with the same outcome.
I tried to see if it was just my computer so I ssh'd to another computer on my network and started pinging google while also doing so on my PC, it took 20 minutes for my PC to drop out for 2 seconds while the other computer kept pinging google fine.
