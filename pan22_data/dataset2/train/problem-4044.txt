After building and installing php, you need to restart Apache for it to load the new version of the library.
You should probably remove the old packages, before using a new version - to avoid confusion between which version is the one in use.
When building from source, I rarely provide my own prefix, since the default prefixes with /usr/local or whatever usually make it very easy to distinct that this is a manually compiled package.  This is also earlier in path, so if you have manually compiled something that the package manager also provides - the manually compiled program will be the one preferred unless a full path is specified.  If I do provide a prefix, it's probably /opt.
If the version provided by Ubuntu is still in use by Apache, a php-page like this should give you the build options:
+ a symlink to these files placed in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled.  Apache will also in turn load all the files in mods-enabled.  If the install script does not create these config files for you, you need to do this manually.
