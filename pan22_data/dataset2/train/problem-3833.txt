This update uses Exchange Web Services to talk to you Exchange servers, instead of the old (and horrific) webdav way of doing this. Webdav required some tweaking on your servers, which could be bothersome. The EWS update installes on top of your Entourage installation and makes everything a blast. The updated Exchange support in snow leopard also uses EWS. Use one of the two. It will make your life easier.
However, be aware that the minimum version of Exchange Server 2007 supported is Service Pack 1 Update Rollup 4, which was released in July 2008. (From http://www.apple.com/macosx/specs.html).
If you're using Entourage for mac I would HEAVILY recommend the newly released update for Entourage - web services edition. You'll find it here: http://www.microsoft.com/mac/itpros/entourage-ews.mspx
If you have Exchange 2007, you can use MacOS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) for most of the features that you have in Entourage.
Also, you will want to make sure you have a proper SSL cert so you don't get SSL cert validty errors on the Mac client (ie: don't use the default SSL cert...), etc.
Going forward, Office 2010 for Mac will include Outlook, not Entourage.  This will presumably have full support, just as Outlook for Windows does.  Until that time, as others have said, 10.6 (Snow Leopard) will likely be your best choice.  Especially considering the very modest price.
The Snow Leopard support is pretty good. It doesn't support delegation, access to other mailboxes, etc. But it's great for everything else, and I have an assistant for the rest :)
