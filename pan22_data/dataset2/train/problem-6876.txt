Incidentally, this goes for deleting any non-system file that is in use and cannot be deleted on Windowsâ€”not just fonts.

I found another way to do this ... and it's actually Microsoft's Font utility which we are using to delete the font, it turns out, that is using the font we are trying to delete!
then right-click and choose Delete. If you are running 64-bit, you might need to delete the same from this location:
I wanted to delete the font without using any programs. I accidentally selected another item (folder) when I pressed delete, lo and behold it worked! I just restored the folder in the recycle bin and finally got rid of the pesky font.
