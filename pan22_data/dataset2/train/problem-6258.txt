Might want to look at a cloud antivirus solution. McAfee offers one. Trend Micro also offers one. I'm sure there are many many more. I'm not sure of any AVs that run their console on Linux.
We have a customer trying to replace all Windows Servers with Linux. Problem he has only Windows clients. We are able to migrate most of the server apps. But the antivirus suites he has and all alternative we can think off needs Windows Server. Is there a way to run multi user Antivirus suites for the network to run off a Linux Server, ie the clients need to access the server
Have a look at samba-vscan and clamuko. Both these provide integration between samba and various AV scanning engines.
You can try to run the antivirus admin interface into wine, but this implies the installation of a graphical environment (KDE, GNOME, etc) on your linux server.
If the person purchased say licenses for Symantec SEP suite then on the SEP Disc 2(I think) is an installer for Linux based systems . Poke around his current suite of products and see what you find.
Note that as others have mentioned, clamav is a free virus scanning package. IME, it can be a little slower than some of the commercial engines, but is at least as good, and in some cases better at indetifying viruses and not flagging false positives (jag7720 - I've found sophos has a rather high false positive rate). It's perhaps weaker than some products for repairing files - but these are all very much moving targets.
You've not said what the servers/clients actually do. Most commonly, this kind of setup uses SMB type file-serving. While there are lots of AV software available for Linux, you probably need something which integrates with the file serving software (most likely Samba) if you want on-access scanning.
