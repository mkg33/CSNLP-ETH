So, I recently discovered the LOC record type for DNS, which allows you to identify a location for the related server. 
The appropriate RFC - RFC 1876 A Means for Expressing Location Information in the Domain Name System has "EXPERIMENTAL" as its status.
It appears that the usage has some ambiguitiy and could identify the server location, the location of the business premises of the people using or running the server, the location of the targetted end users or just about anywhere.
So my question is... What is the point then? Sure it could be intended for "whatever the server admin wants", but surely when this record type was conceived, it must have had a specific reason for being. Otherwise, it just wouldn't have got pushed into the DNS specs.
At first this seemed like it would be great for location related SEO, tag your business location and surely this would add extra weight to your geographical end user targetting (of your website for example). However, it seems that Google have said they don't use this for SEO purposes.
