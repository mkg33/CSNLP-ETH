Most of my development is done in specialized IDEs (XCode, Unity or Eclipse) these days, so I don't usually miss EMACS. Then again, I never managed to use EMACS as my OS, just as a text editor. :-)
So I can copy and paste into emacs (ie. I cmd+c on chrome and C-y on emacs to paste and viceversa C-w cmd+v)
One tip, if you're using spaces, is to change the switch between windows to be something other than ctrl-arrow, because every time you try and do wordwise tab in emacs it will take you to a different window which gets a little wearing after a while.
I got them from the guy from emacs rocks github I think. That way I get to use Â´ and other option characters as in any other application and also have a more familiar placement of the Meta Key (I have capslock as ctrl btw)
Fonts support is a bit limited with carbon emacs, which I haven't yet got round to having a fight with it about.
After years of using EMACS on various UNIXes, Linux, FreeBSD, OS/2 and Windows, I finally stopped... I've been using Smultron instead. I found the Cocoa version of EMACS didn't really integrate that well with Mac OS, and didn't "feel" like normal EMACS for me.
Note that you need to have bazaar installed. Alternatively, you can install it from the git mirror with --use-git-head
I use iTerm2 combined with Kieran Healy's Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences +  a alias in my .bash_profileto utilize the newest version of emacs for Mac OSX; alias emacs='/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -nw'
Personally use carbon emacs 'cos it's the one that hasn't been adulterated with annoying tabs and looks the most like the original one. http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CarbonEmacsPackage
This is an older thread, but I came across it when I was looking to see if there were new developments in OSX emacs distributions.  If you are using homebrew, you can install the latest version of cocoa emacs with:
