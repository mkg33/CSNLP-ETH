If any experts DO have other 'best practices' I'd love to hear them however, but scouring the blogs and online resources for the past several years, I haven't seen much in data corruption and a simple 'shutdown/restart'.  
If you want to help ensure a smooth shutdown or failover, you can run a checkpoint, make sure you are running DBCC CHECKDB often (at least enough times to be able to recover corrupt data from a backup), and check that any external dependencies are taken care of such as mirroring.
Perhaps having external tools directly touching the MDF/NDF/LDF files could cause issues, such as trying to 'move' the files in between shut downs or having some software try to lock the files during shut down.  I've seen Windows Clustering screw up when a disk hosting DB files is full, but not specifically cause 'db corruption'.
Not exactly when it comes to shutting down and preventing DB corruption.  MS SQL Server is a very mature product and the odds of causing a corruption issue by a simple 'shutdown' would be a edge scenario.  You're much more likely to cause corruption by not running CHECK DB or having checksum validation set on your DB.
