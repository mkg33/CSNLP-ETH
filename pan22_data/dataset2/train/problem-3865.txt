This may not be applicable to the OP, as their client is running on a windows XP corporate domain, but I had similar issues under OSX/Unix, encountering 2003 errors when the SSH tunnel was clearly configured correctly. Turned out it was an idiosyncrasy of the MySQL Query Browser:
There can be so many reasons why this problem occurs, so I'll try to contribute with a few suggested solutions based on the information you provided. Remember that these suggestions are shots in the dark, since there is absolutely no way to diagnostic this problem without having access to the server. With that said I'll start listing:
Remember to restart the mysql daemon each time you alter the configuration file. This error message is a little misleading, so I this helps you!
I'd always thought they were completely synonymous. Once I'd made the adjustment all worked as expected - hope this helps someone.
If you use Windows XP, then go to network adapter properties, uninstall "Microsoft TCP/IP version 6", restart your computer. 
I may have found a solution to this problem. When connecting to the MySQL server, do not save the credentials and information in MySQL Query Browser. Instead, retype them each time when signing in. This works for me for every computer in the domain.
I can't answer your question but can say I have had the same experience once before an a Win XP machine. In that instance it Query Browser wouldn't connect to MySQL server on any machine, including a local instance. As a result, I now use a third party product called MySQL-Front. It's not free, but for me at least it was well worth the price.
