There is a trade body Moca which has this page with a number of ethernet to coax bridges on it. I think this is what you want. However most of them don't look like they are retail products at the moment.
There's another alternative that I'm surprised nobody else has mentioned: just install WiFi.  If you need multiple connections in one room, you can save on wireless adapters and configure a router running DD-WRT (or your favorite open router firmware) to bridge your wired and wireless networks.
The only option I have seen is a product call TVNet from Coaxsys, but it looks like the product and the company no longer exist.  These essentially created an Ethernet transceiver and used some sort of proprietary protocol to communicate over coaxial cable.
The cable companies more quite high bandwidth internet activity over 75 ohm coax using only part of the available bandwidth. SO the hardware for this has got to be available, and a standard cable modem is one half of it (and I own two of the things, how about you?). You might even be able to configure several in a peer-to-peer mode with fixed IP address. 
In some houses, it's not easy to run new cable.  If that's the case, you can tape the end of your network cable and the end of a rope to the end of the coax in your wiring closet, then pull on the other end of the coax until the network cable and rope are through.  To pull the coax back into place, retape just the rope to the coax then go back to the wiring closet and pull until the coax is back.  Note that you may or may not have perfect success with this, depending on whether the holes for the cable are big enough to accommodate both coax and network cable, so it might be best to try it first in a room where you'll never need coax (just in case you can't pull the coax back through from the room to the wiring closet).
