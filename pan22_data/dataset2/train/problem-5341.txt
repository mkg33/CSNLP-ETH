Thanks everyone for teaching me a few things. I tried almost everyone's solution and I feel kind of embarrassed. I uninstalled the packages that I was working and installed postfix. With very little work I had something going.
You will still require a valid SMTP server to be used with ssmtp. Once you configure ssmtp to talk to the up-stream SMTP server, it will relay all your email through that server. This will usually be your ISP server or 3rd party SMTP server.
What I'm looking for should be relatively easy. All I want to do is setup something VERY small for Ubuntu that will allow me to use the mail() function in PHP from my web server (/var/www/). I don't want anything complex. I have a noreply@mybusiness.com type of email setup so if it is necessary, I can use that as a reply-to address. But I just want the ability to send mail, NOT receive any at my web server. Thanks
If you're just sending out mail, you might be able to give nullmailer a try, it's in the Ubuntu extras repository on Jaunty (aptitude "show" output):
Postfix is pretty nice. it installs nicely from repositories, and it has a clean config in only two files.
By the way, I've tried exim4 (btw, which setting should I pick, if it's possible to do what i want?), and I've tried ssmtp, but have had no luck with ssmtp. Thanks.
