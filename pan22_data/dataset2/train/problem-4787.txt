I would check to see if Auto_Close is enabled on your databases. When it is enabled, your database will shutdown and free it's resources once the last user exits the connection. When a new user comes to use the database, it reopens. If your databases are running checkdb every time a database opens then this could be your problem.
There does not appear to be any additional jobs that run except for a syspolicy_purge_history job that I believe is an automatically created job by SQL.
I had a similar circunstance of strange DBCC CHECKDBs running when I had nothing scheduled.  Some minor digging lead me to one of our server engineers who had been instructed to backup the databases (these were Sharepoint dbs) with Symantec.  Just prior to his backups, the Symantec tool was configured to run DBCC CHECKDB.  In this case Symantec stayed connected so Activity Monitor helped me figure this out.  
I just fixed 3 databases by disabling Auto Close and Auto Shrink to get rid of those "Starting up database ..." and "CHECKDB" messages every 5 minutes
I have a nightly full backup that runs as well as a 2 hourly transaction log back. The full Backup also shrinks and checks the integrity of the database when it runs.
