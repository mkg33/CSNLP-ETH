If it's ALL Oracle linked servers for that instance then my first thought would be that something changed on the Oracle provider for that particular SQL instance.  Start by verifying the Provider configuration between the broken instance and an instance in which the Oracle linked servers are working.
All of a sudden, on a SQL Server 2005 instance, all the Linked Servers to Oracle stopped working. All other instances can connect to the linked servers without a problem using identical configurations.
If you have older Oracle ODAC drivers (e.g. 10.2.0.1), they have been known to have issues with occasional corrupted links.  
The error is different gibberish characters every time I test the connection. (Squares and unreadable characters). I am using the Oracle ODAC 10 client on the SQL Server.  Any ideas on how to fix this other than restarting the instance?
However, a more permanent fix would be to update your Oracle ODAC to at least 10.2.0.2 -- or better yet, use the latest 11g provider (they're backwards compatible with 10g).
