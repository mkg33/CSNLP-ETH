The server is running a Developer edition of SQL2012(sp1), latest MySQL, a wordpress site via IIS(which becomes unresponsive), a .Net site(which seems to work), a simple php site and a mail server(SmarterMail by SmarterTools).
Then benchmark your machine to test it against peak moments and see if  you have enough resources to cope with that influx.
At apparently random intervals the server becomes unresponsive in that I cant access certain websites it hosts - yet others seem to work. I also cant RDP in to the box, nor can I interact with it via the providers VPS Management console. 
While there may be different issues, (check your logs as MDMarra suggests), 1 CPU and 2 GB ram when is WAY too few resources. Especially since you are running already at 1.8 GB (which probably means the other 200 MB is reserved for the operating system). If I were you I'd increase your resources by at least adding another 2 GB of memory and maybe an extra cpu. 
Ive asked my providers about this and they say they want paying $100ph to investigate regardless of whos fault it is. 
So, what can I do from my end of things to try and find out as much as possible about the source of the issue? Please bare in mind that this is the first server Ive had, so whilst Im really keen to learn how to do things properly, I'd really appreciate pointers and help going in the right direction....
