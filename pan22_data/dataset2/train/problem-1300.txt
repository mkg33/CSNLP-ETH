Although Chrome is "useable" for the fonts, it looks thin and washed out where it renders diagonal lines especially.  IE renders much better but IE is a slower browser and so it FireFox.
I noticed that I had installed Clear Type Tuning in the Control Panel and tried unchecking "Enable Font Smoothing" in the advanced tab.  After restarting Chrome. it was ok, even after turning Font Smoothing on again.
Chrome does not render web fonts well at the moment. There are several bugs on their issue tracker for this. Please star any relevant to you them to give them more attention.
I had this problem so severely in Windows XP SP3 that it rendered Chrome unusable for all intents and purposes.
Do you have GPU Acceleration enabled in Google Chrome? Type about:flags and look for GPU Accelerated Canvas 2D, Disable it if enabled. Fonts on some sites appear really jagged when I browsed with the acceleration enabled.
Within Google Chrome click on the Wrench > Options > Under the Hood > [next to Web Content] click Customize Fonts.
