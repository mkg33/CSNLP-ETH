Your server on 188.165.34.72 (r29901.ovh.net) is running BIND 9.5.1-P2.1 - it answers a query for dig @ip version.bind ch txt as expected with that response string.
although I may be digging up an old thread, I'm doing so because this is one of the most relevant results while doing a google search for "query status refused".  
I had exactly the same problem (dig status NOERROR locally, dig status REFUSED from the outside), and the solution was changing the match-clients from "localhost" (which is the default for bind install) to "any" (later I may find out what the exact ip of my domain name provider is and restrict it to that specific ip for security reasons). Also, I changed the view name from local_something to default. The name really doesn't matter.
That was really the issue with this "dig status refused" business. Right after I changed the match-clients parameter, my dig @12.34.56.78 mydomain.com queries started to resolve with NOERROR status, and the domain name provider (godaddy) immediately cached the nameserver record. Since my zone files were already properly configured, the domain name instantly became visible on the internet.
In my particular case, I found that I had to include allow-query { any; }; in each zone definition in named.conf.
However the IP address you quoted above returns a NOTIMPL error, even though there's nothing in your quoted config file about the *.bind pseudo-records and BIND requires explicit configuration to disable them.
Just at a quick glance it appears to me that it's not configured to listen to the rest of the world due to listen-on { 127.0.0.1; };. You'll need to add the appropriate IP address in there.
