To monitor a specific computer, regardless of where the monitoring console is run, click Select counters from computer, and specify a computer name or IP address.
If you are using asp.net authentication and if you want to see the results thru your site you can use the following code in c# from your site code:
I don't think you can get the individual users at the server level, but you can user perfmon counters to get counts of how many active connections there are.
See Evan's answer. Also netstat | find ":http" will show you which hosts connected in the last minute or so (whatever the TIME_WAIT interval is).
Having said that, assuming you're requiring authentication to the site, you could use the site's log file to see who has recently been accessing pages. If you're not requiring authentication, you're just going to see client IP addresses.
You have an understanding issue with the HTTP protocol. It's not like, say, FTP, where the client computer is keeping a persistent connection open to the server computer while the user is "browsing". Connections from clients are transient.
If actually you need to know who accessed this server in the last 10 or 1 minutes, you can always take a look at Security event log to check logon events. But that's only a rough estimate.
