Instead of pointing all of the DNS records at the IP address if the server I used a CNAME entry to point them at an A entry for the IP adress... if that doesn't make sense take a look at this:
I'm doing a big reshuffle of our websites and hosting, moving about 10 domains to a new server. In doing so I had to make some changes to the DNS, pointing all of the domains at the new server. 
Hopefully you'll see what I'm trying to do, to keep things tidy I have set a single A record to the servers IP address, and used CNAME records to point all of the other domains to it. This means if the IP has to change I only have to change it once, it also means I can easily tell where each record is pointing to, as some point to server2.mycompany.com and server3.mycompany.com etc.
Question, despite being nice and readable, is there a reason I shouldn't be using CNAME to point to another DNS record. I believe @ is for the domain itself (i.e. domain1.com). It seemed that setting @ to a CNAME messed around with our email, but are there any rules as to when I should be using it?
CNAME are often avoided for performance reasons : it forces the client to ask a second question to the DNS server, leading to higher latency for the client and more load on the DNS server.
Now we had a problem with our email this morning, whereby a recipient email server could not authenticate our mail server, email was rejected. I changed the @ record on our mail.domain1.com domain from CNAME server1.mycompany.com to the IP 12.34.56.78 and the email was sent successfully.
