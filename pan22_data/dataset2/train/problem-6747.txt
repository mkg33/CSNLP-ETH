I've setup an Amazon EC2 Instance, using the Ubuntu 12.04 AMI (ubuntu/images/ebs/ubuntu-precise-12.04-amd64-server-20120424 (ami-a29943cb)), and I'd like to get Webmin working (so I can setup a DNS).
Create a simple user with password having sudo permissions as shown below. You can login to webmin using this user.
Create a webmin user password like so: /usr/libexec/webmin/changepass.pl /etc/webmin root YOURPASSWORD. Then you can login as "root" with the password you set without adding a system-wide password to your machine root user.
I've tried creating users manually and I can't login as those users (even via SSH), so I think it might be a permission thing provided by the AMI.
Andrew Smith is correct, but has an unnecessary step in his suggestion. You don't actually need to login to ssh with a password for Webmin to work; ssh and Webmin are unrelated services. Simply set a password for your root, or sudo ALL capable user, and that will be the way you login to Webmin.
The problem is that the EC2 instance only has 1 user "ubuntu", which can only login using SSH keys -- not a password!
Setup password for root with "passwd root" and login as it over SSL. If you want to host website you might try virtualmin.
After following the installation instructions on Webmin's site, the installer says I can login with any username/pass of a user who has superuser access.
