I have selected a Dual Xeon Quad-Core 2.4 Ghz with 12 GB RAM, 10Gbps Ethernet, and eight 2TB hard drives to be run in RAID 10. With all of that I'm almost over budget and I still did not add a card to pick up the video.
Make sure you get a proper workstation/server class motherboard because you will want to be shuffling around a lot of data.  You will need the higher bandwidth of PCI-X or multiple PCI-E 2.0 slots.
It depends on how many streams you need to capture / how many clients are reading the streams. But the main bottleneck will be disk I/O. How much video do you need to keep offline? At HD rates, your 8Tb is going to fill up surprisingly quickly.
For PD, just a webserver and a scripting language (PHP or Perl being the obvious candidates). For RTSP, you need a RTSP sserver - Darwin is an obvious choice. Bother require a client program - but that can be a flash player, alternatively, there is increasing support for HTML5 video. See this page for a description of video formats.
For live video feeds, RTSP is probably the way to go - but for on-demand video, progressive download has a lot of advantages (there are lots of free flash players for PD).
I apologize for the big questions, but I have never done video streaming before and need some pointers.
My school is setting up a professional television studio that is going to be recording a 1080p stream into a server I am expected to design with a $5000 budget. I do not know what format the video will be coming to me in, all I know is that they want to stream both live and prerecorded. However, I am not sure where to start.
Maybe. There are several options for RTSP described here. NB if you want to maintain a low-res archive, then ffmpeg also converts formats. What do you expect users to watch video with?
