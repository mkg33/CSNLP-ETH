Someone told me one day : "Dress for the job level you're trying to reach", and it must be one of the best advice I've ever heard in my professional life.
Linux sys admins have a bad reputation for dress code and I have to agree.  All the great ones I have know have always been a little lacking in wardrobe.  But really smart and really cool people.
I don't have a dress code. Basically I roll out of bed and throw the first thing I see on. This has ranged from pants with holes in them (ok i just didn't notice the holes until i've gotten to work) and t-shirts (although I avoid any of my "controversal" shirts ) all the way to khaki's and a polo. My office is right next to the division president's so no i don't change. When I'm at the corporate offices the dress code is pretty much the same, the "C" levels do at most business casual although they have been known to come in in jeans and t-shirts fairly regularly as well. 
The old adage "the clothes make the man" still carries weight as far as I'm concerned. For me it's khakis or chinos with a button shirt or polo. Others in my office wear jeans and t-shirts but for me it's about presenting a certain image to my co-workers and customers. I feel it's my job to present an attitude of confidence, reliability, and professionalism to those that I run across during the work day and the first step in doing that is through my appearance. It really is true that people make judgements about you based on how you look. If you look like the plumber I'm not going to feel good about you touching my network.
Depends on the country and local culture. When working in Ireland, I had to wear trousers (not jeans) and a collared shirt, while in Israel, it's all jeans/tshirt or even shorts+sandals everywhere.
