They are in the same network, although, they cannot see their port 22 unless you add an Inbound rule in their security group for Network 10.10.10.0/24 (or hosts 10.10.10.5, 10.10.10.6).
Regarding your question, do I need a firewall (e.g. IPTables) in my EC2 instance apart from my security groups? The answer depends on how much time do you want to spend configuring security and what you need, having both is more secure and they can complement each other, IPTables (or any other firewall) allows you to log posible atacks and even you can add dynamic rules, however, if what you are looking for is just block some ports, I'd only go with security groups configuration... You should check on this
AWS security groups is like a firewall for EC2 instance, and AFAIK (and tested) 2 machines within the same VPC cannot see ports in their internal network unless you change your security groups policy.
When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to the instance. Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC could be assigned to a different set of security group
