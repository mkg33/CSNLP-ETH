It seems to me that these messages are not even getting to our servers at all. But, this is only impacting one user(that I am aware of) and not all the time. Some messages get through without any problem, others just disappear. 
Where else can I look to try to figure out where these messages are going/getting captured? Are there additional logs that I can enable either within GFI or Exchange that might shed some light on this?
I have checked the Exchange System Manager and there is no record of the sender at all during this time period. No record of the message getting captured by the spam software (GFI Mail Essentials). The sender does not receive an NDR or any other indication that the message didn't arrive. 
The senders are not related at all. One is in another country, one uses AOL, one uses a corporate Exchange server locally. I can't seem to find a pattern.
I have a user that occasionally does not receive emails from outside our organization. It does not seem to matter whether the other person is replying to an initial email or sending a new message.
