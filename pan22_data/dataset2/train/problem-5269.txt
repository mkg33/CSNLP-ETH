When I first started analysis services everything was fine. The sql server app and analysis services app both worked ok. After a reboot, the sql server app didn't work right. It would connect to the database, but when i listed the databases (using query analyzer or the application) it would list out the analysis services databases, not the sql server databases. It was like the analysis services server had replaced the sql server. Sql management studio could see both servers just fine so I know the sql server was running. Then, I stopped analysis services, restarted sql server and started analysis services again and both apps worked again. What concept am I missing? Are analysis services and sql server waiting on the same port?
I have been tasked with getting analysis services running on a machine that has sql server 2005 on it. I should say that I'm primarily a developer not an admin so bear with me. Also, i am not the developer who wrote the analysis services code (not sure why i'm the one stuck with this:) ). Anyway, it seems that analysis services and sql server interfere with each other. 
I'm sure a DBA will provide a better answer, but I'm wondering if your issue has to do with having to connect to a specific SQL Instance (named vs. default) for Analysis services, or even a port #
It is possible that you don't have the service starting in automatic. Take a look at the Surface Area Configuration for Features tool.
IS this part of a vendor application? Some applications will create a couple of databases then abstract them into cubes in Analysis server on the same machine - SAP BPC does this
If you are using SSMS to connect, it allows for you to connect to the Database Engine or the SSAS instance. Many times I have connected to the wrong instance using SSMS simply by clicking through a couple of screens too quickly.
