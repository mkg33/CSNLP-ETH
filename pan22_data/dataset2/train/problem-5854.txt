This last rule catching all of /shop is clobbering every rule that's targeting something under /shop.  I'm not completely sure how the evaluation/priority is handled for Redirect, but RedirectMatch may be a better fit for your needs (or, at least, should be used for that last rule).
I've read about problems with query strings, but that's not the case here. I also saw when assembling this list of redirects that if the new path ended in "/" that it would cause it to get a similar result of what it's getting with the redirects above. For example, clicking http://www.wallcandyarts.com/shop/product.cfm/chalkboard-wall-panels will give you a "mashed" URL, and I don't know why. Any thoughts?
I've got a list of over 100 redirects, nearly all of which seem to be working except for two. I'm using the common format for a htaccess 301 redirect:
This is my first foray into anything this heavy with htaccess that didn't involve simply copy/paste, so forgive my ignorance here. Hoping to learn a lot. 
First, you should limit all of that code to your httpd.conf file, not htaccess. More of a security threat, since people can download it freely and use it against you. As for the failed redirects... do the destination pages not exist EXACTLY as quoted in the rules?
Are the others working for you?  I've tried a handful, and each one that I've tried under /shop has thrown my browser under wall-decals.html.
Near as I can tell, there's nothing wrong this one. The ones I'm having problems with are these two:
http://wallcandyarts.com/shop/product.cfm/seasons-designer-pillows becomes http://wallcandyarts.com/wall-decals.html/product.cfm/seasons-designer-pillows.
UPDATE: Here is the entire htaccess. A lot of stuff that was there prior to me adding 301 directs. The code I added starts at line 181.
