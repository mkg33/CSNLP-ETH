The second Wifi Router should basically pick up the signal from the main wifi router. I would then use the LAN port to connect (with a wire) to the TV decoder. In other words have my secondary Wifi Router act as an access point, which will enable me to use a wired LAN connection to the decoder.
Can someone please advise on how to use my second Wifi Router to connect to the main Wifi Router (and thus the Internet).
When I check my network connections, I see the LAN connection too but it says 'Not connected to the internet' while the Wifi (main router) shows connected.
Problem: Connecting a TV decoder via Internet. It doesn't have inbuilt wifi so wired LAN is the only option. I bought a second Wifi Router so I could use its LAN port to create a wired internet connection to my decoder.
Connected the second Wifi Router to my laptop via the LAN ports. Access 192.168.1.1 and went into my second router. 1) SSID set to the same one as the main Wifi Router 2) Tried disabling DHCP and enabling DHCP (with the DNS and default gateway configured the same as the main router).
