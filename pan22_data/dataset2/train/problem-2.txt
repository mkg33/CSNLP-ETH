None of the suggested key combinations bring me out of hyperv fullscreen mode. However, I found a two key sequence workaround. Pressing ctrl+alt+left-arrow causes the notebook to rotate display -90 degrees and releasing fullscreen mode. Quickly follow with ctrl+alt+up-arrow to restore normal mode. You are now out of fullscreen mode.
You don't have the remote desktop tab at the top of the screen for the 2nd RDP session?  I have one for the parent session, which slides up, revealing the 2nd tab, from which I can 'restore down' to a smaller window.

CTRL-ALT-Left Arrow, releases the pointer from the full screen client environment. Immediately after, pressing the Windows key brings forth the taskbar and the start menu of the host.
I've found that it works with CTRL-ALT-BREAK/PAUSE using the CTRL-ALT on the RIGHT HAND side of the keyboard, but not the left hand side!
Best solution - this is easily justification for a larger screen, wherein you can run a non-fullscreen session comfortably.  ;)
The VM in full screen tab at the top of the RDP session, you need to drag the RDP one to either side, thus revealing the VM tab underneath it.  Then you minimize the VM & you're out of full screen...  Silly Microsoft stuff...
