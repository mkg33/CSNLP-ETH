I'm not a sysadmin, but I use a Windows 2003 server at work fairly often for testing purposes, and I'm always annoyed by the limitations of the standard Windows console terminal.  
Well if you're after a better command line, you could use powershell instead.  It gives you a lot of power, including the functionality of the .NET framework at the command line
Is there some "industry standard" tool that I don't know about, to replace this terminal with a more fully-featured one?  What is the best 3rd party Windows console, if any?  Are there any good free/open source tools for this?
When I first set up a machine I always enable QuickEdit mode and make the buffer and window sizes much bigger - it makes working with the prompt much nice.
I checked out Powershell previously but found it suffered from many of the same annoyances as the bog standard cmd window.
QuickEdit mode lets you copy and past in an xterm like way by just selecting with the left mouse and copying with the right mouse (if nothing is selected right mouse will paste).
To turn on QuickEdit mode right click on the menu bar (or left click on the icon on the menu bar) and go to properties.
Powershell is the first option. If you're coming over from the *nix side of the house, consider cygwin.
