The 32-/64-bitness should not affect general performance much. I'd just the 64-bit version just because it's more future-proof.
64-bit also allows for the use of the 64-bit CPU registers and 64-bit CPU instructions, which might increase performance.
Now for you, there is one additional criteria that you mentioned -- battery charge consumption.  How much of a difference have you noticed?  Is it only a few minutes or something far more significant such as more than 20?  If it is significant, then this is definitely an additional factor worthy of consideration.
So for your Laptop there is no real need to use a 64bit OS. If you'd like to update your RAM to 4, 8 or even 16 GB you need a 64bit OS to really use the RAM.
The only situation where 32-bit is better is when you're so strapped for memory that the size difference of pointers matters, and if that is an issue, then you should probably be buying more memory, because the system would be slow regardless of what OS it would be running.
If the processor can support a 64-bit OS, and you don't need to run any applications that are incompatible with a 64-bit OS, then 64-bit is usually preferred because the system will often yield better overall performance.
Actually, a 32 bit operating system can use up to 3.89g of RAM. Windows XP has an internal issue, which can not allocate more than 1.95g of RAM to a single process. 
If your using a laptop with only 2g of RAM, you will be better off using windows xp 32-bit, unless your looking to upgrade you memory to 4g or more. 
In 32-bit Windows, due to how Windows manages memory, applications can't use more than 2GB each (including paging file space).
I don't think there is a reason for the same OS in 32bit and 64bit to consume different amounts of power (at least not measureable). Also performance is usually equal (besides what I said about RAM usage).
