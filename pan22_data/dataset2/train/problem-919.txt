The only really reliable way to copy files over RDP that I have relied on, almost every time is using the \tsclient\c (or whatever drive you want) method. It does not work in a CMD window, but it works in an explorer window. To use it in a CMD session or script, launch it inside FAR manager or something similar. 
When I connect from my work machines which runs XP to my home machine that runs Vista 64, my local folder opens and immediately closes.  If I open it again, it works fine.  This happens every time.  I don't know if you have a similar quirk, but I thought I throw it out there.
It's a long shot but... Run a disk check on your laptop. I've seen some odd behavior occur when there are file system errors, even if they don't otherwise make themselves obvious. It should only take a few minutes to run and certainly won't do any harm.
One thing to think about, although I am not sure if it affects it or not, is does the account you log into your terminal server session, have access to the local disks on the client machine? I am sure a year or two ago that was an issue for us.
You say "local resouces linking are allowed for TS sessions". Just to check, you do mean in Terminal Services Configuration, in the RDP-Tcp connection properties, on the "Client Settings" tab the "Drive mapping" tick box is unticked?
