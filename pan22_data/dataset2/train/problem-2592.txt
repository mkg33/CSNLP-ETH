When we hit shift+F10, we can see that the clients are pulling IPs from DHCP and are pinging the server just fine.  It just doesn't want to run.  The event logs show that it asks 10 or so times before it craps out.
Odd issue -- we started with WDS running on Windows 2012, properly configured and verified working on our older test machines.  The machine boots up, reads the boot image off of the USB drive, and brings us to the 'Choose your language' page, then prompts for credentials before showing the list of available images.
We then moved to our computer labs, where the machines are a little newer.  This time, it boots, pulls an IP, and then gets to the generic "WdsClient: There was a problem initializing wds mode".  We checked the server logs, and it seems to be failing because there is no boot image available for "x86uefi" architecture.  The thing is, we're using an x64 WinPE image to start a Windows 7 x64 boot image, and trying to deploy Windows 7 x64.  We don't want x86uefi, but can't seem to find a way to force it to ask for that.
Background info: we're running on a network where we don't control DNS or DHCP, but we run a domain within it.  We are trying to use WDS with a discovery image pointing to our WDS server.
