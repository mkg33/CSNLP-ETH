I expect this has to do with caching, but the amount of time and data, and the lack of error messages, has surprised me. This is not an SSD.
The reason I am investigating this is because the same system is reported to "forget" file system changes after rebooting (such as renaming a folder, rebooting, and finding the folder having the old name); or behaving weirdly after renaming objects (such as renaming a folder and soon after copying it, which is reported to have failed). Both issues are congruent with write-cache malfunctions, but we were unable to reproduce them.
I will have access to said computer in the coming days, so answers do not have to remain hypothetical.
Is this generally expected? I know read-caching exists, but are the numbers expected (several minutes, several 100 MB, several dozen subfolders, ...)? Could this be the result of unwanted software or some system setting?
A Windows-10 system that I have seen myself (through TeamViewer) has a removable hard drive and some 300 GB of data in it. It seems to be NTFS formatted (I forgot to check, but at least Windows 10 shows that all files are compressed). The device can be "safely removed"; however, if one removes the HDD "unsafely", data on the drive can still be accessed. This is not surprising in itself, as I would expected the Windows explorer to do some kind of caching of at least the folder structure. BUT:
