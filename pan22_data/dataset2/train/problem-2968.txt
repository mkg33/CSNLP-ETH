Curiously, there is someone who argued that machine learning is uniquely fit among computer science topics to teach to high school students, because supposedly it is one of the few subfields where basic math can get you to understand enough to appreciate the important challenges. I disagree with this claim -- basic algorithms (say for searching, sorting) can be presented as puzzles, and you can very quickly get to very simple to state but fundamental open problems like "can multiplication be done with essentially the same number of operations as addition", or sorting integers in linear time, or factoring (I assume the concept of primes numbers would not be new to the select group of high school students?). On the other hand, a lot of machine learning would be hard to grasp without a good level of experience with statistics and probability theory. Nevertheless, he has some ideas what material to present to students.
In addition to these, I would think one can attempt to sketch some of the more high-level ideas of learning theory: 
Another suggestion is to introduce circuits and attempt some sketch of Shannon's lower bound. Depends how comfortable students are with counting. If this is too heavy, it might still help to do the argument while having the students take the counting of circuits itself on faith. I think the idea of "most problems require large circuits because there are too many problems and too few small circuits" will be striking. This idea is important and pervasive in complexity.
