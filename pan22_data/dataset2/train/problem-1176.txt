I'm looking for an alternative to pfSense (2) that can be virtualized in VMWare ESXi. I've experienced several problems with pfSense to date and I feel like it is not a totally finished or polished product. Whenever anything goes wrong (IP address conflict, squid misconfiguration, etc) the whole thing goes berserk and it takes a reboot or at least 5 - 10 minutes to fix itself. In many cases even resetting state tables does not help and only serves to compound the issue.
Without this setting, and the promiscious mode, I saw lots of weird behavior similar to what you're describing. Check on that and see if it can help you.
The answer to this is most likely: don't do that. Whatever it was you were doing to break pfSense, figure out what is was and don't do that any more.
For whatever reason, traffic was not able to sync otherwise. My environment has 2 NICs in active/standby. 
While there are a few pfSense folks here on Serverfault, I'd recommend taking specific questions to the pfSense mailing list. The project founders and many of the core devs are active on the list, along with a much larger group of active pfsense users than we have here.
In my experience, in order to get pfSense config sync/pfsync going, you need to have a) promiscious mode enabled on the port-group, and vswitch and b) set the flag in 
Please provide any recommendations for either a) guidance on getting pfSense stable, or b) other virtualizable firewall appliances.
I've worked with a plethora of linux and BSD-based router distributions, and pfSense is by far the most stable and flexible one of the bunch.
I think part of the problem is that I probably really suck at pfSense, being new and all, but I've never had this many problems with a firewall appliance and this is coming from a background of using Checkpoint and Linksys and even the occasional D-Link. Of course we run all of our stuff off Cisco ASA at the moment (physical hosts, at least) and I wish I could just run ASA in VMWare but sadly that is not possible.
