Just to make all this independent from your knowledge of those variable values, and a little bit more complex, you can create a function (Store) to create an alias (ReStore) to go back, whatever was the initial situation.
The commands bind and shopt are so cosy that among the few options they present, there is one (-p for the first and -v for the second) that give the output in a format  usable, almost directly, to restore them:
The commands bind and shopt are built in of the shell. It means that to ask the manual for their use you need to use help instead of man.
On my system to complete a command (e.g. to navigate with cd) it is enough to give the bind 'set completion-ignore-case on' to enable the ignore case, even when nocaseglob is off.
Even this can be written in the configuration file for your shell (see above). Each time with Store you freeze the actual situation and with ReStore you re-establish the last one freezed.
Note that the \ has to be the last character of the line to split the command in a more readable format on two lines. 
You can put this alias with the other of your configuration shell (typically in ~/.bash_aliases  or ~/.bashrc) and use when you want. Problem is that those are blind, they will not see the actual situation of your shell.
The nocaseglob on is needed for the pathname expansion.  It exists even the nocasematch for the patterns. help bash to read more...
Once you know the starting value you can create a couple of alias to go in the Ignore More (IgnoreGo) and to come out (IgnoreExit) from it:
