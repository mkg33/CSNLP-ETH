If you just type in http://mydomain.com (i.e. hitting the default port 80), you will probably get your router's homepage.  Thus, when you are trying to view on port 81, your requests are trying to come from the router on port 81, which (as you would suspect) has nothing running to serve these requests, so breaks.
When you're testing locally, are you sure the URL is specified properly?  Internet Explorer will give a less-than-useful error if you don't specify the URL properly.  Specifically,
You might check the advanced network settings (or firewall settings) on your router configuration and make sure loopback connections aren't being blocked.
Will not. Many users have grown accustomed to entering the domain name without the preceding http:// because normally the browser will add that, but if a port number is specified, IE will not automatically add the http://.
If this is the case, the suggestions to add to the hosts file would work around this issue, but they're not addressing the core problem.
The vast majority of SOHO routers (so basically anything suppied free with your connection, or you bought for less then ~ Â£200 / $250) isn't going to cope too well at all with a DNS entry resolving back to their external IP address.
It's possible that your router is denying loopback connections. Since other people can connect to the specified host at port 81, it's possible that when you try to connect, the connection gets translated to the outside on the router then the router refuses to translate it back into the internal network (for your home server).
Edit your hosts file (c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts - you will need to run Notepad as Admistrator if you have UAC enabled), and drop in a new line
