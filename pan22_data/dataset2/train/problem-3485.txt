In addition to the answers provided by @Kin you also can restore the database under a different name or onto a different server. This could be a quick and dirty solution if you are looking to do just a one time data retrieval. 
No. You dont even know which changes were his unless you recorded it wih triggers etc. - for sql that would be useless information, outside what the logging is supposed to handle.

Note this is very limited as it will just give you info related to who did what e.g. Who dropped the table, etc.
Once you can capture the original values you can then perform an update to revert the users changes effectively rolling back his change.
