I didn't seem to get Ubuntu installed on the thing. The menus were very "dos-like" and when I tried "try before installing", only a black screen showed up. Same problem with opensuse eventually...
I even went to msconfig in Windows 8 and only Windows 8 is listed. It seems that OpenSUSE (LOCAL) isn't even showing in any place except each and every time when I boot my computer.
It's my company's laptop and I only use it at work so I don't have a lot of time to mess around with it besides working with it, so I hope there's a quick fix (not something like "reinstall windows 8"...). And I was going to do a dualboot because I need a linux server environment to test out stuff.
The problem is that I double-clicked on the OpenSUSE iso image and saw the graphical interface/installer. It said I should restart the computer.
I also tried bootrec /rebuildbdc and with no luck... the waiting screen (5 seconds, 30 seconds or 5 minute waiting options) is still there.
BUT... the problem is that after getting that black screen with OpenSUSE, it's still showing up at boot time 100% of the time! The interface looks Windows 8 styled (light blue background, squary UI) and has the options Windows 8 and OpenSUSE (LOCAL).
