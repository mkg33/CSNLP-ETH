Feels similar to Notepad++, supports ctrl+c, ctrl+z and so on, plugins, commands, even mouse pointer selection and integrates into the OS clipboard.
An entirely different solution, which might work depending on your setup is to use a Windows text editor with the ability to edit files remotely.  Notepad++, for example, has an FTP plugin, and several Windows IDE's have such functionality.  The advantage is that you don't have to install anything on the web host, and you can edit in a full GUI.
I did a search for the same thing recently.  There are several (see JumpingPA's list, plus, 'joe').  Joe or jed are good choices for a no-nonsense simple editor that does more than nano. Diakonos is under active development, and is aiming at users exactly like yourself, but has higher than normal dependencies (Ruby), which not everyone would be able to install on their hosts. 
Have you tried nano? The shortcuts are a bit different, but it's more "Windows"-y like vi and emacs.
NEdit is a multi-purpose text editor for X Window System that is available on all major Unix and Linux systems. Users of Windows based text editors should find NEdit a familiar and comfortable environment.
