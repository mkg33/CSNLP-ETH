We have had good luck with digitliti  We get daily reports of what got backed up and they're rock solid reliable.  The even send warnings when there might be an interruption of service for their maintenance work. 
I recommend Iron Mountain ... it is quite reliable.  You should have no availability issues and get the info that you need from them.
I have heard a lot of good things about Backup My Info, http://www.backupmyinfo.com/, while I do not work for them so this is not a marketing pitch they are very competitive and offer a great service.  I highly recommend checking it out.
I had a client having miserable luck with Mozy Pro. Backups were constantly failing / getting disconnected.
They have a few differnt flavors available: an online backup product, and a version that integrates within BackupExec. This allows BackExec to connect to and use the SPN storage directly as a distination for backups that are fully managed from within BackExec.
Be aware that they are more expensive than Mozy or Carbonite, but I imagine that the corporate data is more important than Joe Consumer's pictures.
That being said, I've had good luck with the LogMeIn Backup solution. Use their client, but you use your own storage. So if you have a couple sites or locations (or an office and a colo) with some extra storage at each you can easily and cheaply do offsite backups over the wire.
