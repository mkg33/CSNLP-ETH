I was having the same problem and tried all of the above before I realized that the message has to be scaled to 100% BEFORE you paste in the image.  
I had tried pasting an image and tried CTRL-Scroll-wheel to try to find the right zoom level, but that didn't work. So I triekd scroll up/down a notch before pasting until I got the right zoom level for the image to be pasted in clearly.  What a wacky problem.  Thanks for the hints and hope this additional hint helps someone else out.  Outlook 2007.    
I've had better luck pasting in a high resolution image (say 300pdi) and reducing its size if necessary. Outlook will still lower the resolution (and quality) even if you don't, but the final result is sharper than inserting the image at the resolution/size you want it.
I have been using Outlook 2007 for over a year with no image problems.  Around September 1st, images that I paste into messages are enlarged in the messages.
Something mysteriously changed and I cannot figure it out.  I googled this to death without any success (others have the problem but there is no solution).  This is driving me nuts because I snap screenshots all day long ("a picture is worth a thousand words").
If Outlook is using Word as the editor check that you have not inadvertently set zoom to larger than 100%. If you have, it will continue to use that size.
Paul-Sebastian is correct. Change the Windows screen DPI setting. Rigt-click on the screen. Select 'personalize'. Click on 'Display', then select 'smaller 100%' and click on 'Apply'. Log-off windows and log back on. Now image pastes correctly into Outlook.
