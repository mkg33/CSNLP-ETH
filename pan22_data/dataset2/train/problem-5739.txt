No. Browsers do not remember Incognito mode tabs at all â€“ that's the whole point. Their state is not saved on disk, and as soon as the browser process exits for any reason (whether you quit it or whether the system shuts down) all information is lost.
Windows 10 has a nasty habit of recovering opened apps so be sure it has shut down completely. If not, unplug for at least 10 minutes or long press the power button until it shuts down.       
I would not use incognito to hide information that could be damning or illegal in your country. Or anything somebody would be motivated enough to pay to have done. 
The data "should" be deleted as long as the PC is really shut down or all browser windows are closed. Technically the technician could see some of what you were doing, but it would take time and effort he would be unlikely to spend without good cause and pay.
Tabs will be closed on startup and nobody will see it, however, the cache won't be cleared. It shouldn't be visible to the person fixing it or your parents, unless he or they decide to ferret in your computer's cache and manages to decode them.
