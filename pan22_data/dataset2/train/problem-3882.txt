I wasn't able to rectify the problem I was having. Eventually, I gave in and rebuilt the OS from the ground up. The dd then worked as expected, regardless of block-size or RW speeds.
It begins to boot, but always stalls and dies. It appears by the output that it is unable to mount the ext4 filesystem: the main os. I get error messages like so:
One note, if anyone runs into this problem, the troublesome OS was Raspbian Wheezy on top of NOOBs. The second time around I axed NOOBs as it was one more thing that could go wrong. I'm not sure if that was the root of the issue or not, but this time it worked.
I am having issues cloning one MicroSD to another using my Mac. I have been working on this for days and have tried several things, all with the same end result. 
Second, I put my new MicroSD into a USB adapter and plug that into my Mac. I do another diskutil list and determine the disk location. For arguments sake, let's say it was found in /dev/disk3.
Third, I unmount both disks using the following commands: sudo diskutil unmountDrive /dev/disk2, sudo diskutil unmountDrive /dev/disk3.
First, I put my good MicroSD into a USB adapter and plug that into my Mac. Then I do a diskutil list and determine the disk location. For arguments sake, let's say it was found in /dev/disk2.
