Adding stuff in to a unity project in itself does not increase the size of a build unless those new package resources are used in your selected set of scenes.
... after selecting your desired set of scenes and the build platform you want to build for you can start the build by clicking the appropriate button.
I'm developing a GoogleVR (formerly Google Cardboard) application and need to import the GoogleVR SDK. While I only expect to use some of the items available in the Unity package, I'd like to import them all at once and save potential headaches later when I can't find something I might need. However I'm worried that including everything in the project may affect the build size, which would be troublesome on a mobile application. 
The unity build process only builds stuff in the included set of scenes that you add through the build configuration dialog ...
It does increase build size. I am not 100% sure, but unless unity has "smart building" and ignore scripts and objects not used in your application, it will increase the size for sure
