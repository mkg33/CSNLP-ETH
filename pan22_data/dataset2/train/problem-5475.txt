If you're running google analytics on your website, that will get converted into a click count for traffic from a web search, additionally it came from the search result, not from an ad, and possibly other information. These folks have done extensive reverse engineering on what these query parameters represent if you want to do a deep dive into decoding what information google passes in these query strings.
