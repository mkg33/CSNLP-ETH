As an additional benefit, it also reduces the amount of data written to the SSD when applications repeatedly write to the same blocks, as confirmed by storage benchmarks that continuously write to a small file that fits within the RAPID Mode cache. In most situations, the endurance and performance gained is minimal, but certain workstation applications can see a noticeable benefit.
So... I've had RAPID Mode enabled on my main laptop for more than a year now and have never had a crash that is directly traceable to the RAPID Mode driver.
The most significant trade-off, however, lies in the very fact that RAPID Mode works by delaying writes to disk for a few seconds, holding the in-flight data in memory. This can result in data loss in the event the system crashes during a write. While the RAPID Mode driver honors requests to flush the buffer to disk, the risk is still there, so you probably won't want to use it on systems containing mission-critical data.
The performance impact of RAPID Mode is not particularly noticeable in most situations. However, a few applications that are unusually I/O-intensive, e.g. the new DOOM, which reads huge amounts of texture data from disk while loading, benefited significantly from RAPID; Task Manager reported I/O speeds well in excess of 2 GB/s, which is far beyond what the SATA interface allows.
