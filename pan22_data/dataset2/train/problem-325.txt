Upon doing some research it states that my Terminal Services have been out of licensing for 120 days. This is where I get confused. NEVER have I had a licensing server running on any of my machines. All the RDC connections to work stations and Domain Controllers work without a problem; it seems to be just these 2 servers. It was working earlier this week and this just randomly started happening. 
If you're getting an RDS licensing error then it means that you have the RDS role installed on one or more servers. You do not need the RDS role to be installed in order to connect via RDP to manage the servers. If your intention is to connect to the servers via RDP to manage them then remove the RDS role and the licensing errors will go away.
I have a unique server setup and before you say anything, yes I know RDC isn't the best way to remote to a server but these are the constraints I have to deal with. Anyway I have a network of 4 servers 2 being used as domain controllers. Recently I am getting an error from 2 of the servers that are not domain controllers when I remote to them: 
Servers are running Windows Server 2008 R2 and is just for databases etc. Is there a way to get my RDC back without installing a Licensing Server since I didn't have one before and things were working or doing the Registry Stop gap of resetting the 120 days? 
As Jacob mentioned in his answer, you can connect up to two simultaneous sessions to manage the server via RDP without the need of the RDS role or an RDS License Server.
