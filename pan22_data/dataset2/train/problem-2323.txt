Then, change the command def to run the plugin through sudo. Oh, and be sure to make sure 'requiretty' isn't set (also via visudo), or it will fail.
I am using the check_postgres.pl plugin for Nagios. I am trying to monitor how long since the last checkpoint has been run using the check_postgres_checkpoint option. When I run  the command from CLI  as root I am getting the output but I am not able to get the output in the Nagios web interface. The error which it shows is,
It is trying to access the pg_control file in the 'global' directory present beneath the data directory which has only read access to the postgres user. 
Alternatively, you could make a new group containing nagios + postgres, and make /opt/PostgreSQL/9.1/data owned by postgres:postnag (or whatever), but you'd need to make sure that all new files are also group 'postnag' (via chmod g+s, for example). This is a much more complicated solution, but doesn't involve sudo (some people seem to dislike using sudo like this...?).
This can be solved by granting sudo right for nagios user to execute this plugin without requiring a password.
