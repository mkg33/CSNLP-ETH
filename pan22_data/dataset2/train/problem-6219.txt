You'll probably want to look at upgrading from SQL 2005 to something newer.  Microsoft is about to release the third major version after that.
Why the need to only have the data that the users in the second site write only available in the second site?  If the application is only used (or mostly used) from the second site, why not just move the application to the second site and have anyone who needs to access it from the first site simply connect to the server in the second site?
If you are having performance problems because of the users accessing the website you'll probably need to increase the network speed at both sites so that it can handle the network traffic of all the data replication which you'll have to deal with.
For the file replication you'll want to look at DFS.  If that isn't going to work because of your AD setup you'll want to look at robocopy using the /sync option.  DFS has nothing to do with security, it's a data replication solution.  To use DFS it does require that you have a single AD forest between the two sites.  This is normal for a multi-site company.
