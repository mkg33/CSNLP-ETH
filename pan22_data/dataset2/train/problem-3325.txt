Anyway, using Bonjour the port is a 'Internet Port' in the windows printer properties referring to port 631 (CUPS), rather than LPR on 515 - perhaps you aren't using the IPP protocol.  I understand CUPS supports LPR but just sayin'
After successfully adding the printer in windows 7, I get the following error message when trying to print something:
Printing a test page via CUPS does not work either. The funny thing is, I can print documents from my iPhone 4 without a problem, so it is possible to use the OKI C3200 as a network printer.Now, I am not really sure if this problem is because I am missing something with the CUPS configuration or if the cause lays somewhere completely different, so if a moderator thinks this topic is wrong here, feel free to edit/move/delete it.Maybe someone else encountered this error message and knows how to do fix this?
Something I've noticed here with a C3200N is that nothing will print from windows until I've logged into the printer one time.  
I'm trying to use my Raspberry Pi (raspberrypi 3.10.25+) as an print server gateway to my OKI C3200.I have successfully installed CUPS 1.5.3 and my printer was detected immediately, so the installation/setup was not a problem.This is how it looks like now (it is in German though):
I can't comment, but I will add that, rather than use Samba I have had the most success with using the Bonjour Printer Wizard Bonjour Print Services on my Windows machines to print to a RPi based CUPS server (DYMO LabelWriter 400 and Kyocera FS-1010).  Also Bonjour is great for hostname resolution when the pi is headless.
