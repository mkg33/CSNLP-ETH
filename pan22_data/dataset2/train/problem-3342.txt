The last dialog is intended to set default program for all files of given extension; therefore, the Always use this app to open … checkbox would be superfluous here.
The easiest way to solve this problem is to use the "FileTypesMan" free tool, choose the file associations that are producing this problem and right click on "Open File Type in RegEdit", then just DELETE the keys and try using "Open with" again - the "always use this app to open .xxx files" should be restored when you use "Open with" again. Obviously this works with any kind of files! 
My recent Windows 10 install was also missing the "Always use this app..." checkbox. I got "Always use this app..." back somehow:
It's not an exact answer to the question, but I was able to re-set the application used for media/image files by using the windows key and searching for "choose default apps" -- this pops up the "choose default apps" app (yes, I know...) and from there you can set what program (VLC, IrfanView, etc) is used for media files... 
I think one or more of these programs reset a Windows 10 registry flag that enables/disables "Always use this app..."
or Context -> Properties (General tab) -> Change… button or (the same) Change program… button in Control Panel\ … \Set Associations:
