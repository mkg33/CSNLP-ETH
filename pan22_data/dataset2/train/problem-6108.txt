It is most almost entirely sure a hardward problem a physical problem, your cd drive needs a repair or you need a new one. If you didnt mess with the BIOS settings before the problem started, is almost sure that there is something broken with the physical unit, and no a reinstall won't help.
If you don't move your laptop that much or you don't want to open your laptop get a usb drive, they are pretty cheap these days.
If neither Windows nor Ubuntu are letting you mount discs, then that points to a hardware issue.  I doubt reformatting and reinstalling would work.  Chances are that the cdrom drive does not show in Device Manager, then the connection is not secure.  Since you've already removed and re-installed it, that would suggest an issue with the drive itself.
I would double-check to make sure it's not listed in the Device Manager.  If it isn't there, then you may need to buy a new drive. Before you do that though, take out the drive, and take a picture of the connector and post it here so someone can determine if it's a standard connector or proprietary.  Then someone can tell you what to look for.
You might want to try to unplug it and plug it in again, and blowing some air with a vaccum cleaner or a can of compressed air, or an air compressor if you happen to have one, but most probably you will need to get a new one, since repairs are usually not worth the money.
