I had this problem with PS CS5 and CS6. Nothing fixed the problem, resets, restores, reinstall etc., until I discovered a problem with my USB default printer. Windows for some reason had failed to recognize it correctly, despite it having been used happily for years (an update was probably the culprit). I reinstalled the printer and bingo, Photoshop started working again.
Remember to turn OpenGL back on after you update your display driver, or you'll be without the OpenGL-specific features.
As an aside, I had problems with Word and printers a while back - Word wouldn't start if there was a disconnected networked default printer. I looks like PS is equally as sensitive to default printers. Check out your printers before messing with PS.

Try re-installing the application, it should resolve your problem. The correct way to do this is uninstalling Photoshop, reset the computer and then installing Photoshop again. Also check the "Run as administrator" in the properties menu, that seems to resolve a lot of problems as well, especially in Windows Vista/7/8.
