"Dynamic" Excel file doesn't really mean anything. If the file had been created by some third party program, the programmer must not have used the correct extension for the file format.
I ignored the warning and opened it anyways, and it opened fine. Looked just like any other spreadsheet. I opened the file in a regular text editor and it was an HTML file using some custom XML namespace
However, it tells me that the file I'm trying to open is in a different format than specified by the extension.
I downloaded a file with a .xls extension. I thought it was a regular excel spreadsheet file so I opened it using Excel 2007.
The file is an .xlsx file, the standard format for Excel 2007 and later, verified by the xml format. The file has an extension of .xls, which is the extension for Excel 2003 and earlier. Thus the error about the file extension not matching the file format.
Anyways I was wondering if there was a proper way to name the files so that excel doesn't complain that the file format is different from the file extension?
