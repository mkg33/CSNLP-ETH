If you've got Windows Vista or Windows 7 you could select use the Run as Administrator option in Compatibility Mode. 
The only solution is maybe to create a virtual machine for Spotify, where anyone could have administrator rights without running a risk. You can freely download ready-made Linux VMs, and this article explains how to install Spotify on Linux.
Spotify consists of a single .exe file, which can be run from anywhere, like the desktop.  It does write to %APPDATA% once run, so it is not portable as such, but there is no need to have it in Program Files.
So if you just have the most up to date spotify.exe somewhere on the network, you can distribute shortcuts pointing to it for your users, or you can just email them the .exe in a .zip file.
Apparently it's the official position of Spotify to allow only the latest version. This is probably because copyright concerns require the immediately blocking of any new hacks of their software.
