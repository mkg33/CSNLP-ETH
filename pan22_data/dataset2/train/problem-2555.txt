The 5th question that pops up will ask if you want to make a dynamic or fixed hard drive. It will then show the following screen where you can choose the size. 
how frustrating... but it has been pleasure because I joined a community of bright people on superuser. 
The default for linux vm's is only 8gb. I'd recommend increasing it to 80. It is a pain to make this change after the VM is already running. It is best to throw it away, and create a new VM. 
If you leave it as default (25 GB ). it works ... the issue is if you chose a number other than 25 GB by typing .. it won't create the HDD. 
Dynamic and fixed? Unless I'm mistaken, you have to choose one or the other. A dynamically expanding disk will report to the guest OS whatever size you told it to, and will expand, as needed, up to that size on the host device. A fixed sized vdi or vhd will report to the guest os the size that you told it to, and actually take up that much space on your host drive. The advantage of a fixed disk is that performance might be a little faster. I don't know of any scenarios where a vhd/vdi will be both dynamic and fixed.
