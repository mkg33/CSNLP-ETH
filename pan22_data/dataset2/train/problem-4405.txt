Based on the problem I'm stuck on right now.. I have a sprite sheet thats 9 images 2 rows, 5 columns, with an empty space at the end of the second row.  All of which is one single running animation.
Each time through the game loop, if the run key is pressed, before you move the sprite, you call animateRun().  You could simplfy the above by using a setAnimation and changing animateRun to just an general animate function.  When the run key isn't pressed that time through the game loop, call animateReset().
You keep a animation step variable that tells you where you are in the animation.  When running stops, the step goes back to 0.
Create an arrays for each direction of running index.  So, if there is one direction the player can move, all the player can do is either run or not run. You have a single array.
One problem I've always had is getting my head around animating sprite-sheets, not just in Android but other platforms as well.
Say the that your animation requires 3 poses: both feet down, left leg up, right leg up.  You place them in an array as indexes 0,1,2 respectively.
Then your run_annimation array would be [0,1,0,2] because you want the player to breifly have both legs down when switching feet.
