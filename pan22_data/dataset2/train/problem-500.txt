I have a post-receive hook that runs on a central git repository set up with gitolite to trigger a git pull on a staging server.  It seems to work properly, but throws a "command not found" error when it is run.  I am trying to track down the source of the error, but have not had any luck.  Running the same commands manually does not produce an error.
The command that does the git pull on the staging server is in the ssh user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file and is:
As you can see the post-receive script gets to the echo "Done!" line and when I look on the staging server the git pull has been successfully run, but there's still that nagging error message.
This is the actual output from removing a file from my local repo, committing it locally, and pushing it to the central git repo:
The error changes depending on what was done in the commit that is being pushed to the central repository.  For instance, if 'git rm ' was committed and pushed to the central repo the error message will be "remote: hooks/post-receive: line 16: Removed: command not found" and if 'git add ' was committed and pushed to the central repo the error message will be "remote: hooks/post-receive: line 16: Merge: command not found".  In either case the 'git pull' run on the staging server works correctly despite the error message.
Any suggestions on where to look for the source of the error message would be greatly appreciated.  I'm tempted to redirect stderr to /dev/null but would prefer to know what the problem is.
