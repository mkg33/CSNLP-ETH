Linux installations are specific to a processor type. An amd64ยน installation will only work on an amd64 processor. An ix86 installation will only work on an i386 processor (but all amd64 processors are ix86-compatible). A powerpc installation will only work on a powerpc processor. And so on.
Beyond that, unless the installation has been tweaked in a way that's irrelevant to ~99% of Linux users, there's only one setting that might depend on the hardware: many systems need a specific video driver to take advantage of their graphics card. If the system on the drive is configured to use a driver for the wrong graphics card, or not to use a driver that the graphics card requires, the driver may be ignored, and the GUI may not appear (you'll just get a text mode login prompt).
For my portable Arch Linux installation I made sure to, in the boot loader, address the disk by UUID (instead of /dev/sdX) so it would always find the correct disk when trying to boot in a different machine with different numbers/arrangements of disks.
