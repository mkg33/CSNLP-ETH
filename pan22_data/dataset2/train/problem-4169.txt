Note: I did not use the Bootcamp Assistant at all in this process mainly because I could not see the point of backing up my entire hard drive and then repartitionng it when I already had a perfectly good partition. Once I had erased the previous contents of the Bootcamp drive using Disk Utility, I used the Windows install CD and treated the Bootcamp partition like any hard drive on which I wanted to install Windows. I did then install the Apple drivers as mentioned above.  
I had a huge problem recently with Windows 7 on Bootcamp on my 2009 MacBook Pro running OS 10.7.5. During a routine update WIndows completely stopped working, could not repair itself, could not boot the computer and was not amenable to repair by a Windows repair tool that I had.  
I had to use a Microsoft oem version of WIndows 7 because I couldn't find my original retail Windows 7 disk. Don't use an oem version from HP or Dell, etc. because they will only install on a PC of that brand. Don't use an oem disk at all if you can help it because the license is good only for the hard drive it is originally installed on or possibly another identical hard drive.
So I eventually reinstalled it on the original partition using an install disc with Windows 7 oem from Microsoft.
