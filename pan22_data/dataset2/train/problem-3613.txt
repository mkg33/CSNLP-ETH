This may, or may not, give you something to start with. Not knowing the make of router in use, it's hard to tell :)
This is the config used for an ADSL router that has been allocated a bunch of public IP addresses. These addresses are then NAT'ed 1:1 to an address within the 10.0.0.0/16 range on the wireless interface
Once that is done you can configure NAT on router so that requests for IP 10.1.1.2 get forwarded to internal IP of the server. 
Assuming you are given 10.1.1.0/28 by your ISP, (used 0 to save calculation overhead :)) with gateway as 10.1.1.1 and broadcast 10.1.1.15 and netmask as 255.255.255.240. You can give IP address 10.1.1.2 (the first available IP to router) and set default route of router to the gateway, that is 10.1.1.1. This would allow router to access internet. Trying pinging IPs like 4.2.2.2 from router and you should be able to see response. 
Otherwise you would set up the router just as a gateway and either set up DHCP to assign those addresses out or set up internal static IP's on the machines with the router as the gateway.
I would recommend you keep NAT going for security reasons, and then if you need to forward outside traffic, set up a pinhole through NAT. Your router should let you map IP's to inside NAT addresses if you need multiple services (like RDP) going to multiple clients.
