Important footnote: though FreeFileSync is Open Source and is licensed under the GPL, it comes bundled with OpenCandy PUP/PUA, so either install it with the network connection disabled or make sure you uncheck the crapware installation offer. Also, you can just unpack the installer using 7zip or PeaZip and just run it without installation.
You'd need to run this bit of powershell each time you start the machine, a start up item or scheduled task to launch it would do.
I would recommend using FreeFileSync to keep that file synchronized. FreeFileSync has a side tool called RealtimeSync that triggers a synchronization task each time it detects a change in a given folder. You only have to create a synchronization task for that file and then run RealtimeSync with that task and it will be 'automagically' copied each time is modified.
First of all go and grab FileSystemWatcher from here : https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Powershell-FileSystemWatche-dfd7084b
Each time I change a file, I need to go and manually copy it to another folder, so that the updated version would exist there. I know about mklink, but that's not feasible in my case. 
Is there a way to hook a bat file to save event of a file in Windows? Because if that's possible, I can create a bat file to copy the file automatically. If not, what other options I might have, excluding mklink.
