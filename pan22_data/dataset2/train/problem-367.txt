Is there a possiblity that someone is doing a large amount of after-hours printing on it? There's almost certainly a page counter on it so it wouldn't be hard to detect any unathorized usage that is using up all that ink.
We left ours on for 3-4 years we had it.  We no longer use the printer as the hardware failed after it's warranty.  
we had a xerox phaser (dry ink) printer and left it on for years.  The neat thing about the Xerox Phasers is that they would learn usage patterns.  For example, if I came into the office early, I would notice the printer coming out of sleep mode around the time we would normally begin using the unit.  If I came in at my normal time, I would notice the printer already warmed up and ready.  
Leaving a printer on shouldn't burn any ink at all (unless it's printing, obviously). If you're only printing once a week it's probably worth the power savings to turn it off completely. Most printers burn 20 to 50 cents per day in electricity while in standby (sometimes much more).
