I have an Osepp Uno R3 Plus.  Although it's an Uno, it uses the FTDI chip, so installing the FTDI driver was what it needed.
There is something fishy with how the Due interacts with OSX. You can get it to work by pressing the erase button between sketch downloads:
I've manage to see /dev/tty.usbserial-* after installing above mentioned FTDI driver http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm. This is on MacOS 10.8.5, Arduino IDE 1.0.5, and Arduino Mega with ARMEGA1289 16AU 0849 chip. 
Many sources that come up in Google searches say that you don't need to install the FTDI drivers for newer Arduinos (Since the Uno or Mega). If you have an Arduino Mega this may lead you to believe you don't need them. However, some older revisions of the Arduino Mega do in fact need these drivers, so if you don't see the device in /dev/tty.usbmodemXXXX try installing the FTDI drivers.
I just went through this on my OS X 10.8 machine. I did in fact need to install the drivers you mentioned for my Arduino Nano but not for my Uno 3. A quick re-launch of the Arduino IDE caused the Nano to show up in the list.
