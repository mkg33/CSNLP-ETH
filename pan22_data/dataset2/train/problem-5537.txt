I doubt that there is a single answer to this "Linux" hosts offer a very broad range of services as do "Windows" hosts. Then you have the Apache(on windows or linux) v IIS discussion then SQL server v MySQL v Oracle (The second two on windows or linux...).
I think you need to specify your requirements/ needs / desires as precisely as you can. Eg if you think you are going to need a lot of support, look for a hosting package that offers it irrespective of the OS.
This is a huge advantage for hosting because it enables a great deal of flexible and automatable control over large distances or a poor connection.
When making your comparison, perhaps consider the application first. In other words, what is it that you're trying to host? There are a lot of tried-and-true combinations out there for various kinds of hosted applications.
Anyway, tell us what you can about what your application is, and chances are a lot of people will be able to lend some more technical advice.
For example, PHP & MySQL websites almost always use Apache in my experience. On a lot of Linux systems, this just works. (Making it fast and secure isn't always trivial, but it's easy to get working!)
