I know on my Gentoo box, the following line in /etc/pam.d/su allows users in the wheel group to su without a password:
I created an AD group called LinuxAdmins and I'd like to have a way for people in that group to either be able to su on certain Linux servers without the root password or sudo on those machines using their own passwords. 
The way openSUSE configures AD, it sets the username with the domain prefixed. So my username would be MYDOMAN\djsumdog. If I try adding either of the following lines to the sudoers file, I still can't sudo with my user. I keep getting "MYDOMAIN\djsumdog is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported." I've tried both single and double slashes for the user and group names.
I'm using openSUSE 11.4 which has Active Directory configuration built-in to Yast (which does all the pam_winbind, Kerberos, nss, Samba-client stuff for you) and I can successfully authenticate against my AD domain. 
...and saw that my group was actually MYDOMAIN\linuxadmins, all lower case. I then added the following to my sudo configuration:
I know sudo with the user's password is more secure, but I would happy if I could get either su or sudo working by validating the user against his or her AD group.
But this doesn't seem to work in openSUSE (even with local users), much less AD users. I tried using the pam_winbind.so module as well:
But I don't think that will work as the require_membership_of parameter seems to be for the primary authentication against the entire machine.
