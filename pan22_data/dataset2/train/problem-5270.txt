Because different operating systems (Windows, UNIX, VAX) use different line ending methods for simple text files.
etc etc ... In short, it is to ensure that text representations in one encoding got converted properly when transferred to hosts using a different encoding.
The reason for this mode though is because not all software on all systems will correctly handle EOL's that aren't the exact proper type of EOL (for instance, alot of Windows software will only handle "\r\n" properly and will balk something horrible on "\n").
ASCII mode is used so that the software can automatically change EOL characters to the proper values for the client/server depending on if you are uploading/downloading. If you are uploading to the same type of system as you are using, there is no difference in these modes.
Windows (DOS) uses a CR/LF pair, UNIX uses only one of them.  ASCII mode converts CRLF pairs and BIN mode doesn't.
ASCII mode had its place back in the day when character and EOL encoding was a real problem, but I would like to see ftp clients remove or perhaps just hide this option today. Nowdays it's mostly just EOL conventions that get messed up between systems, but I've found most decent text editors don't care anymore anyway. So in order to avoid corrupting binary files (or even some text based ones), I recommend just using binary mode for everything.
