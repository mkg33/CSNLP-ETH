To counter this a modern BIOS contains rudimentary USB drivers which are enabled if you turn on legacy USB support. 
Unless special care is taken  USB devices do not work before the OS is loaded and drivers are initialised. (Specifically the USB stack/drivers).
Lastly, if you do have access to a second computer, try a live CD. If it works with the OS on the live CD then you know the hardware is fine. (In other words, despite no new drivers you still have a software problem).
What is most likely happening is that you power on the computer. The basic BIOS USB routines give you some control, resulting in a working mouse, keyboard and basic USB-boot capability.
Try booting the computer without any USB devices at all. If it does not crash add them back one by one. If a single device keeps crashing your computer test it on another PC. It might just be broken somehow.. If the computer only boots with no USB devices at all then try booting it and logging in via a remote session (e.g. use RDP, VNC etc, depending on what was installed).
This means, -again unless special care is taken- that you can not use an USB based keyboard or mouse before the OS load. Which is not useful is you need to change something in the BIOS.
