Basically its a check for lines you find acceptable and can be ignored and only sends you the ones you did not tell logcheck to ignore beforehand.
./logxray   localhost:emailing   /apps/logxray   autonda   /var/log/messages   60m   'kernel|error|panic|fail'   'timed out'   1   2   -show   error_check   jdoe@example.com
We monitor our serverlogs from (+300 system) with beaver as logshipper, logstash as indexer and elasticsearch as backend.
I spent a couple of days searching ("log management solutions"), I discovered just the tools I was looking for. The following 3 tools are Cloud based logging tools, are easy to setup and configure. They ship system logs and custom logs to their servers, store them, let you search and setup email/webhook alerts for regex patterns.
With regards to logrobot.com, there's now a free version of it that does exactly what you need and it can be downloaded here:
./logxray    localhost    /apps/logxray       autoblz      /var/log  60m   ‘panic|error’   ‘.’    1   1   directory_error_watch   -ndfoundn
Basically you should not (at least not only) read the logs on the same host but instead use some sort of logserver which would get all the logs of the servers centralised.
