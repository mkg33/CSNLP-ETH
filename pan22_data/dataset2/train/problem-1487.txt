The shared printers are still not showing up. I can run test prints on each of the printers from the server which works perfectly. The workstation however, don't.
I am trying to deploy three printers on our network. I have added the role of Print and Document Services to our Domain Controller and then added the printers.
To install the drivers for XP you have to go to "\printeserver\Printers and Faxes" from an XP/srv2003 machine (32bit), click on the Server Properties box on your left in the Printer Tasks area. Select teh Drivers tab then Add.
I think one problem that you might find is that you cant add XP drivers in the Server 2008 R2 console.
I added a new GPO to each of the OU's and called it Network Print (Ground/First Floor). I selected the option to apply the GPO to the computers rather than the users.
The server is Windows Server 2008 R2 and the workstations are all Windows XP Professional with Group Policy Preferences extension installed.
You haven't mentioned adding pushprinterconnections.exe to run in your Printer GPOs.  You will need this to push printers to XP machines.  You can get the file from Windows 2003 R2 Admin Tools by downloading pmcmgmt.exe and extracting it on an XP machine.  Add this file to the GPOs in the Computer Configuration> Windows Settings> Srcripts(Startup/Shutdown).
