I set SSH to run on a different port to 21 to minimise the number of random attacks that I was getting a day - most trying the username root with random passwords on port 21. I'd stop the root user being allowed to log in via ssh, this will help stop that happening.
Kavoom! is also pretty good (it's very fast, almost like "being there" over our LAN). And very easy to use and setup.  The previous version I had crashed occasionally, requiring  a hard reboot, which was annoying. And I didn't get any response on a support email. So, YMMV. Cost is $30- $40 or so.  Free trial.
I used Dyndns.com to guarantee the IP address of my computer, which I set up using my router. I then forwarded the relevant ports to that PC.
You could try logmein.com. It's free,web/java based and saves you having to configure ports on your firewall for RDP or VNC as it tunnels through via HTTP.
It also supports WOL (Wake up on Lan), if you can get your computer and router working to use this first. So you can sleep/hibernate your PC and it will wake it up when you connect. The non-free versions allow you to use it for file transfer and a few other features that are geared towards businesses.
I used Ubuntu running openssh server with a long passphrase, before moving to key based auth and disallowed password entry.
