I had very bad issues with Store that does not want to open as well as some apps. I literally tried everything that I could find on internet, all suggestions. Nothings happens, I was very disappointed. Then I just found option to turn on developer mode (Start->Settings->Update and securities->for developers->choose developer mode over there). And I wouldn’t believe… Store is working. Then I chose “Downloads and updates” in the store -> it shows store update, I click on it and store update itself. Then I disable ‘developer mode’ And store still keep working ;) YAY!
Step 2 enter command with new file path  PS C:>Add-AppxPackage -register "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsStore_2015.8.25.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode
For Windows 10, although the above did not work, this was very helpful in getting to following solution for me to restore WindowsStore which just blinked and did not open since Windows 10 was installed as upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro. 
If file path not recognized then here are some tips (and where I went wrong) first check that you have a space between "Program" and "Files" in the command line, second check that you have two underscores before "8wekyb3...." and one underscore between "WindowsStore" and "2015" and space before and after "-register".  Good luck, this was two weeks of effort but now Windows Store fully functional.     
C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\ to see that the file had a new updated version of Windows Store.  As of August 29th, I had "Microsoft.WindowsStore_2015.8.25.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe" as latest version and still had the separate earlier version with name "...2015.8.3.0._x64"   
I removed a lot of metro apps but kept ms-store with MSMG toolkit before I install windows 10 x86 on a very old laptop. Unfortunately, MS Store does not work after installation.
Then I right click Start icon select Command Prompt (Admin) at prompt type "powershell" without quotes and  hit enter then did following:
After multiple attempts, I managed to get Store open by enabling Developer mode (as suggested by one of the posters here) and running the command "Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}" in Powershell. Not sure if is exactly the solution since I've tried different steps suggested by different users in different forums (including uninstalling Store separately) but hey, I am not complaining!
