This doesn't "lock" the email, but by removing the check, the messages go into your outbox to wait until the next scheduled send/receive session rather than being sent immediately. In the event you send before you are done editing, you can simply go into the outbox and open the email you were working on. 
This way, if you accidentally send, you can go and reopen it from your outbox, and it won't be sent.
Add some invalid character to the email address of the recipient until you're done editing.  Like two consecutive at (@) signs.
There is an option in to "not send immediately". It is located from the File tab, then select options. Choose Advance and scroll down about half way. There under Send and receive you will see a check box for "Send immediately when connected" (this is checked by default). 
Type "zzz" (or something else that won't resolve to a valid email address) into the CC or BCC field. Outlook won't let you send the email until all the email addresses are resolved.
Delete (or don't type) anybody's name or email address in the To: or Cc: fields.  Then you can't send it until you enter that info.
