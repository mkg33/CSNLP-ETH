Take time to tune I/O on both /var/spool/postfix and /var/log. Best practice for busy postfix servers is to separate the two across different spindles, and to make sure that asynchronous logging is enabled. prefix the logfile name for your mail log with a dash on Linux.
A million messages a day is about 11 per second, assuming throughput is constant. Postfix by itself should be able to handle at least an order of magnitude greater than that on entry-level server hardware. So I suspect you have more than just postfix running, or very unevenly distributed throughput peaks.
Your situation certainly looks like a heavily I/O-bound server. This is to be expected with an MTA, which needs to make lots of small writes to guarantee that it won't lose mail.
Some people recommend noatime mount options for the postfix spool. This is potentially unwise, due to the way postfix depends on file system semantics. See for example http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/postfix/2006-01/1916.html.
If you're using amavisd-new, make sure its work area is on a tmpfs filesystem. We usually put it on /tmp/vscan/. This is safe, since amavisd-new doesn't return an end-of-data response until the downstream (post-filter) hop has accepted the message.
