In addition to securing server as Sven points out, one of the best things to do (especially if ssh is therej ust for you, the admin) is just change sshd port away from default 22.
Not only is it simple (especially when you put new port in your ~/.ssh/config so you don't have to type it everytime) and it will stop 99% of those automated scans so you won't even see them, but it will also help somewhat even if some 0-day ssh vulnerability is discovered to give you more time, or you key is leaked etc.
Unfortuntately, this is absolutely normal and something every SSH server experiences. Welcome to the internet. 
This happens a few times every minute, and has been going on for a long time without me knowing about it. 
As long as you properly secure your server (e.g. keep it updated, allow only key-based login, disable root SSH access), this shouldn't be a problem, but you can limit this even further with something like fail2ban and other approaches like IP whitelisting, changing ports and stuff like that where possible and appropriate. 
By coincidence I looked at my servers ssh log (/var/log/auth.log) and I noticed that someone is constantly trying to gain access:
