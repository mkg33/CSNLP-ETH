I would put your VM images on a seperate spindle. Having them on a seperate disk with a large cache is likely to yield a much larger performance boost than which filesystem you use.
..and you may already be aware of this. Ubuntu doesnt natively read NTFS.  This requires the installation of a separate package, which is very simple, but I have noticed that performance on the NTFS partition, when read by Ubuntu, is noticeably slow.
I want to have 2 partitions - one for Ubuntu, the main operating system, and the other for virtual machine images, as I want to run virtual machines of Windows and MacOS through VirtualBox.
For host based VMs, it doesn't really matter. You'll want to use something that easily works with larger files though, so stay away from file systems like reiserfs which handles smaller files faster than larger ones. Most of my linux installs go with jfs for journaling speed and B+ Tree. See wiki link
You should NOT use FAT32 - FAT32 has a limit of 4 GB in file size (Technically, 4 GB - 2 bytes if I'm not mistaken).
Given that a corruption in a VM image could be catastrophic, I would be looking at robustness of filesystem over performance. Is it likely to survive a power failure, for example? So (to use the examples you've cited) I would certainly use NTFS over FAT32, regardless of performance characteristics, simply because it is a journaling filesystem and therefore much more fault tolerant.
