Your best bet is to go with a VPS service where you own the whole (virtual) machine. Many web hosts have both a shared option and a VPS option, so you can go with the shared service (and live with the limits) until your site gets popular. By the time your site is popular enough to need 50,000 files you will hopefully have a revenue stream in place that'll cover the cost of a VPS service (at least!)
If you know of any such website hosting services, please post a reply ( a link to the same will be appreciated ). 
For my PHP & mySQL based application, I am trying to buy website hosting from a host who does not have a limit on the number of files I carry in my hosting account. Almost all the websites have a common limit of 50,000 files (some websites call it 50,000 nodes). The rest(to the extent of my search) are not even close. I have gone through the various websites, Googled lot of information, have spoken with the customer service of the hosting companies and they said that they have a limit of 50,000 files and that's why they call it the LIMIT. 
Now I have my application, which is a kind of social networking website, where people can upload various files of varying file size. So say if 50,000 users were to join the website and upload 1 file each, the limit of 50,000 will be reached very easily and my 50,001 customer will start facing file upload problems (& so will my account). So I would like to know if there's any website hosting services that do NOT levy such restrictions. In summary, I need the following options:
