If you want disable the process check the command "ntsysv" as root in a terminal and the autostart applications in your desktop preferences.
It should only run for short periods - if it is failing to complete then it suggests there is some sort of problem with your yum configuration such that it is hanging trying to update the status of one of the repositories or something.
I don't remember if the name is "packagekitd". I also don't remember if in the last versions of fedora PK is a daemon or only a user process.
For your problem with the internet connection and the download of packages, check the plugin fastestmirror for yum. The configuration is very simple. Also use the presto plugin.
That is PackageKit attempting to update the yum database so that it can show you a desktop icon when there are updates to apply.
The "PackageKit" process will only start if your computer is idle. With this in mind we should just log out of Linux and log back in. We should, then, immediately open a terminal window and run yum before the system can go idle.
