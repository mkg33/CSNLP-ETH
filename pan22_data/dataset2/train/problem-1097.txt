If I check the permissions on the folder contents using the command below then I get the results shown.
However for some reason after rebuilding my Pi this approach does not work any more. The problem appears to be that despite granting all permissions as above, the www-data user still cannot access the file. To test this I run the following as the Pi user
So if the file /home/pi/robotAI/static/sqlite/robotAI.sqlite is owned by the www-data group, and has permissions of rwx at the group level then why cant I access it or see it as www-data? I have rebooted several times.
Looks like the directory that you try to list only has 771 permissions (user and group can read/write, others can't), and its group is pi. Try the chmod/chown without the -R flag to set the permissions of the directory itself.
I am running Debian Jessie with pixel. I have a file located at /home/pi/robotAI/static/sqlite/robotAI.sqlite which I need NGINX to access. NGINX runs as www-data and normally when I run the following everything is fine
and I get a display of the content of the folder. However if I run the following command to test as www-data then I get permission denied.
