I have had varying experience when it comes to usb-to-com adapters, but best so far is the one from Aten (UC232A). It has good support and generally works painlessly. You can find it at http://www.aten-usa.com/?support_df&Item=UC232A and they are pretty cheap. 
A Gigware one from radio shack has worked well for me for connecting to the console port of Cisco routers and various switches.
I tend to use the cheapest ones I can get off ebay and assume a 5 percent crap rate. I throwaway the crap and am generally happy. I never use the driver I get with the adaptor. Most just work, if they don't I get the driver off the chip manufacturer's website (which is normally ftdi).The only problems I have are that they are never full voltage (keep the rs232 side under eight feet and you won't notice) and sometimes you will get a batch with identical serial numbers (which is only a problem if you don't have a way to differentiate them like path and need to keep straight different equipment plugged into a bunch of identical ones).
I bought a $10 cable years ago, works with XP, Vista, Win7, and FreeBSD 7.0+ without installing drivers.
If you're running an OS from the last 5-ish years then almost all the USB-Serial cables work without messing around with them (you might have to mess with the Com Port settings, depends on your OS and application).
