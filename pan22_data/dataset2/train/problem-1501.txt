Is it really needed... If your new laptop is better than what you have, you could be keeping an oldest hard disk (slower, tiny, error prone, etc).
It depends.  I've had some luck doing that.  A lot of it depends on how similar the systems are.  For instance, there is no way you could take a drive from an AMD-based machine and put it in an Intel-based machine.  Also, if it's 64-bit windows and the new proc doesn't support 64-bit, etc.  You could always try it. AFAIK it won't hurt, it just won't boot.  I would suggest doing it for a long-term solution regardless.  
I've also heard that hardware swapping should be easily possible with Windows 7, worst that can happen is that you have to reinstall anyway...second worse is that you have to re-verify the copy because the hardware has changed.
Recomendation: What you can do is to use something like: AcronisÂ® Migrate Easy or something similar, to migrate your windows to the new hardware.
You can try using sysprep to clear any machine specific settings from your installation image.  This should make it automatically try to install all the new drivers (or prompt as needed) when booting up on the new hardware configuration.  Sysprep ships in-box on Vista and newer, under \Windows\System32\sysprep.
