Or you could go back to origin system, mount the iso file and double click setup.exe to try your fortune. But this mean usually does not work.
I have the ISO of Windows 10 Pro downloaded with the Media Creation Tool. Is it possible to use this ISO to install the Home edition of Windows 10?
Attention: if you are to reinstall current version, you can not downgrade win10 and keep your application and file at mean time. For example, you want to downgrade from pro to home, you cannot keep your system partition. If you want a clean reinstall, you can delete your system partition and choose the blank it left to proceed. 
Simply mount the iso file and copy all things to a FAT-32 flash disk. Then boot from this disk, you shall have the chance to choose which edition to install. 
If it is possible, are they any extra hoops I need to run through? With Windows 7 and 8, you needed to used the Ei.cfg removal tool. Is this still needed with Windows 10 and does the same tool still work?
It is possible, but you need to put the iso onto a usb disk. (4GB or more, I reccomend 8GB just in case)
Now download the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool and install it, afterwards open it and select the ISO file, click USB then let it do its job.
