I think its quite normal for the seek time to be the major bottleneck in lots of operations. Thats way SSD's are as cool as they are. =)
So you tried defragmenting your hard drive and it didn't work, but I know and application that does more than defragmenting. It also optimized you hard drive in a diffrent way and it improved my seek time from 19.98 ms to 18.03 ms. The name of the app is Auslogics Disk Defrag found at http://download.cnet.com/Auslogics-Disk-Defrag/3000-2094_4-10567503.html
Once you've installed it, select your hard drive, click the arrow next to "Defrag" and click on "Defrag & Optimize". It may take a while depending on how big or how bad your hard drive is. If that doesn't help you seek time then it might be an issue with your hard drive and you should replace it.
Some of the newer Western Digital black series drives are much better at seek times under heavy loads, due to 64mb onboard cache and dual onboard processors. But as Jens said, its hard to beat a SSD.
I am having some performance issues on my PC that I've been trying to diagnose.  I installed Moo0 SystemMonitor and it seems that HDD Seek is bottlenecking my machine quite a bit.  Is this normal?  Is there ways to optimize this to increase performance?  I'm making an assumption that my Sophos On-access scanning is negatively impacting HDD Seek.
One thing to try is the disable the acoustic management of your drive. How this can be done is dependent on your drive's manufacturer. Do a google search for that.
