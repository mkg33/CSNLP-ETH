Create a system restore point before starting. You could also use Autoruns as your tool, since it can save the current configuration on a text file and restore it later.
I would suspect incorrect/bad drivers, flawed BIOS, or outright failing hardware in that order.  It's very, very unlikely that this is a problem with Vista itself.  Interrupts of the sort showing up in Process Explorer are the result of programs having non-fatal errors or deadlocked conditions while running in real mode.  At the top of my list would be Sony's drivers for the swichplate buttons (those above the keyboard) and the keyboard special functions.  Having worked with Sony's software before, I can honestly say that it's total crap.
Take a look at the Windows Performance Toolkit: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pigscanfly/archive/2009/08/06/stack-walking-in-xperf.aspx
Go to Device Manager, expand IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers, double-click your hard disk controller, and to to the second tab (I think it was called "advanced"). Is DMA turned on?
Answer my own question so I can close this out.  The precise cause of the problem is unclear, but I can prevent it by keeping the "radio" turned on, even when operating off of cable.
