It's not that cmd.exe or the tree program "remember" where a file/directory is, it's that Windows (the lower level disk/IO drivers) or the physical disk itself might put that file table info (or the file(s) themselves) in a cache that makes it slightly faster to access it on the next go round, so when you run a command (like del or copy) or even go to open the file in something like Media Player or Notepad, Windows and the disk don't have to do as much work to access the specific location being requested.
It can depend on certain factors (like disk type for example) and results may vary, but if there's a caching mechanism in place, then there's a good chance that subsequent access to a file can be faster.
This isn't necessarily true for all types of disks though, like a USB/SSD drive or a mapped network drive, which work very differently than a spinning disk drive; that is to say that running C:> tree and then running notepad "C:\some\file.txt" might see you have the file open slightly faster due to the way the disk access works getting to file.txt on the phsyical disk vs. if you ran X:> tree (where X is a mapped network drive) and then did notepad "X:\some\file.txt", you'd probably see file.txt get accessed at the same "speed" regardless (since it's over the network).
