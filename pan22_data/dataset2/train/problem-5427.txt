I have since moved to Zimbra for my email needs. It has a very nice web interface, calendaring, instant messaging, iphone/crackberry integration - it ticks a lot of 'enterprise groupware' buzzword boxes. 
In a mixed OS environment (namely Windows, OSX and Linux), which is your preferred Email client when using imap, but also requiring Calander support? Preferrably, one client for all platforms.
Opera Mail (it is built into the browser) treated me very well and it didn't hang when polling seven or so large imap accounts, unlike Thunderbird.
Another vote for thunderbird and lightening but (if you don't mind using Google) add to that the link text and then you can sync to multiple computers and you have a web interface for when you're not on your home/work computer.
Although I develop on multiple platforms, I tend to gravitate towards one platform for communications anyway.
GMail and GCal would be the obvious answer to me.  It also means that I can access it from my mobile devices too.
If I wanted a single native app then Thunderbird and Sunbird across all platforms, however, I don't have a problem in switching clients, so I tend to use the native for each platform, i.e. Outlook in Windows, Mail.app on OSX (I don't use Linux at the moment, so not aware of what is the native mail app on there).  Same goes for calendar.
Novell Evolution is becoming more and more of an viable alternative for Windows and Linux. OS X Mail.app seems to work great in a group environment, especially since it supports CalDAV and will support Exchange out-of-box from Snow Leopard.
