I have just installed and configured a ASA 5505 firewall (basic license) which has 3 VLANs (outside, trusted, untrusted) and the configuration is really basic. 
You're going about this correctly. I guess the reasoning for this error is that if your DNS server is dynamically configured there's a chance it could lose that IP address and break DNS for the rest of your clients. I would put a static IP on the DNS server and just change the DHCP range to exclude 10.5.1.2.
We have an internal server connected to trusted with a static ip of 10.5.1.2. That server runs a Bind DNS instance. The server also runs 2 VPS instances. To make it easy to access the VPS instances they are given a domain name and the DNS instance is used to supply computers of the network with the ip for those VPS instances. 
However that did not work. Do I need to reserve that ip so that it's not in the DHCP pool? Or am I going at this totally wrong altogether?
I tried to add the internal server as the primary DNS server and Googles public slave DNS (8.8.4.4) as secondary:
