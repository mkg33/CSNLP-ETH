Date arithmetic works with addition and subtraction and this can create scoped numeric representations of this for your purposes.  Slope is easy enough (no modifications there since you are subtracting dates first).  The intercept is more interesting.  The question is at what date x = 0 is at.  If you subtract that date from x1, then you will get a numeric result that you can use for your multiplication factor.
For example, the expression cond_date - TO_DATE('1970-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') will give you the number of days since 1 Jan. 1970.
I think you can convert each date value to a number of time units -- days, hours, seconds etc. according to your precision requirement -- since some base date, similar to the Unix epoch. This will allow you to manipulate them as regular numbers.
Slope is a numeric concept.  It does not make sense to have a slope with time unless you already have a unit for it.  Fortunately we have date arithmetic in Oracle that can help you out.  To do this you need to convert to a numeric quantity as you have noted.
