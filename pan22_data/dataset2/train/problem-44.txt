I'm using acronis drive monitor, and it detected a high risk event on my hard disk. What should I do?
The answer is in your post, read Everything below "User Action"  As to what caused it, its hard to say, too many things can cause file system corruption, chkdsk /r will check for bad sectors on the hard drive, if it finds them it will attempt to repair or replace them, if this happens you should consider replacing the hard drive soon. After chkdsk is done you can find a log of what chkdsk did in Event Viewer
Is it true that the hard disk can lose data when I get this errors? What other solutions can I do to fix this one, aside from this:
If you are getting those errors though it would kind of suggest that either the file system is corrupt and needs repairing with chkdsk, or if that doesn't fix it and you consistently get these errors then the part of the hard drive where the transaction log is stored is damaged and the drive might need to be replaced
Have you tried doing what it says at the bottom, the "Click Start, click Run, then type cmd..." part in order to run chkdsk and try to repair the disk?
