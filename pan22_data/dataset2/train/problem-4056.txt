Is backing up as simple as copying the fonts to another (backup) folder through drag and drop? Will my fonts just install into a fresh Windows install by copying them back to the Fonts folder?
I'm using a lot of custom fonts for design purposes and I'd like to backup those fonts. If I go to the Fonts folder in Windows Explorer, it seems to load some sort of special font management window.
Because of the special format of the fonts folder when you open it in Windows, you may find it easier to use a different file manager, particularly if you want to zip them all. What I did is I opened the 7-Zip File Manager and browsed to %WINDIR%\fonts. I then selected all of the font files (Ctrl+A), and chose File > Add to Archive to create a ZIP file with all the fonts. You can also use Copy To on the File menu to copy all the fonts to a backup folder.
Furthermore, is there a way to only backup the fonts I installed myself? (I.e., not the fonts that are installed on Windows by default.)
to check if the font is installed with windows or custom installed, try to use the datestamp (e.g. dir /od in command prompt)
In the past, my downloaded fonts were able to be saved on a flash drive, so I'm assuming you could do the same in your case, via drag and drop: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Move-and-copy-files-using-drag-and-drop
When you go to restore the fonts later, you should make sure to install them properly. Unzip the file of fonts, then select them all (in Windows Explorer), then right-click and choose Install.
