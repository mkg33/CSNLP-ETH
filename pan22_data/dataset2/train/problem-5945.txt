From the other side of this process, it's up to the teacher to decide whether to tell the rest of the class about the presentation. Personally I wouldn't tell the class (that keeps it a "surprise"). 
After learning the material, the gifted student should make a presentation (depending on the field or material chosen, perhaps an example\demonstration would be useful). Here the teacher should make it quite clear that the rest of the class are not as immersed in the material (if at all), and so the presentation should present the key points. 
Although "gifted" is broad, it has been made far too clear that potential (implied by the student being gifted) is not enough. They need intrinsic motivation. This is fairly straightforward: The only way to make such an activity work is to get the student to be enthusiastic about some field of their choosing. 
If the student seems interested, one should proceed with explaining that research is a necessary part of the activity. From this point the student should be fairly independent, and the teacher should only be checking in from time to time. (obviously a deadline should be set...)
From a presentation such as that, the rest of the class get the basics and core ideas of the material and the gifted student learns a very, very important skill: presenting something they are fully immersed in to people who have no knowledge in the subfield. They learn how to remove unneeded details and keep only the points that don't require a whole lot of other details. 
Many gifted students have ADD\ADHD (Correlation, and not causality), which means that sitting with them to get them started is no easy task. But it can be done by appealing to their strengths. If they have shown special affinity or liking of some field or subject, or have been "always interested in ...", then one should start by suggesting that field or subject.
