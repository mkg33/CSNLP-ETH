Your ISP wants it both ways. They reserve the right to have your IP address change dynamically (as new customers are added or their network is reconfigured). They also don't want to give you a static IP. And they don't want to support manually changing your IP due to it being a hassle for them. 
Of course they can - well, not the first level support guys you are speaking to - but they don't want to.
Why would they want to have people banned from whatever forum calling them the whole day to get their IP changed? Also what would they do with all the IP addresses banned all over the place?
As for it being blocked, they don't know for a fact that you did not get banned from a forum, or blocked from a website for doing things you shouldn't. It really is up to you to find a way to contact any sites that are blocking you and attempt to get the ban released.
Yes, it could be true. From the standpoint that the impact of forcing the entire network to re-lease its IPs could outweigh the benefit of fixing your issues.
My ISP is using dynamic IP addresses, now I have problems with my IP (it seems to be blocked somewhere) and want it to be changed. My ISP says to me that they can't assign a new IP for me, can that be true? I have powered off my cable modem for over 10 hours but when I turn it on I get the same IP address.
You might be able to use a proxy (something like TOR) to access the site but probably better to contact the site owner and resolve what got you banned.
