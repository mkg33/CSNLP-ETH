Have you checked to see if you are having problems connecting, or if it is actually having a problem resolving the hostname? Check your network settings, and you can use nslookup to check to see if your Desktop is able to resolve the hostname (for example, s2.wordpress.com). 
Personally I would look at the browser, its settings, add ins, etc. If it is IE, is the version the same on both PC's? Have you tried Firefox? If so, how about some of the add-ins that can help you to troubleshoot issues. Y-Slow, tweak network, etc.
If you do not want to try alternate browsers, maybe try to see how a program like wget works for pulling down the site? If it works fine, it is most likely something in your browser settings somewhere. If not, lower into your IP stack, maybe anti virus or anti spyware settings gone bad. Adblock software? 
After a lot of debugging I finally figured it out. The MTU of my backend host was too large. Weird that this was only an issue with certain hosts.
Since one works and the other doesn't - I am betting that the desktop is not configured properly. Unless you have some sort of other problem in your DHCP/Linux server, but without knowing details it is impossible to say.
