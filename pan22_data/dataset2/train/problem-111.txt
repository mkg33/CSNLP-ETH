you will need to look at each patch, hotfix & cumulative update, read it's installation instructions & look for the files it tells you to replace & do a checksum on them to determine if they have been patched or not. 
One or more of the cumulative updates has you update the CFIDE files as well, hopefully, the last admin kept the backup.
As Shane said "It'd be less effort to just re-apply all the patches." - true, and false. You will get all kinds of weird problems if you don't return your installation to an un-patched state first. The crappy thing about it is "there is no good and/or easy way to determine what patches are installed" 
ColdFusion security updates usually take the form of "plop these newer files on top of the old versions" - to check, you'd probably need to do size or hash comparisons of the new/old versions of the files.
Adobe's advice on hotfixes is "if you are experiencing this problem ... then apply this patch" if not - don't, all security patches should be installed.
Some of the updates will touch overlapping files, but only if that file needed to be updated multiple times - if a file's touched multiple times, then only apply the newer update, but they aren't necessarily aggregate.
Good luck, I've been down this road myself & it really sucks trying to figure out what is/needs to be installed...
