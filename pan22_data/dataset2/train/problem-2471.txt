Open Automator from the Applications folder and choose the Service template. Specify Service receives no input in any application at the top. Then define your workflow however you want, either by using the Get Specified Finder Items and Open Finder Items actions, the Run AppleScript action, or the Run Shell Script action, and save the workflow as "Mount My Encrypted Disk Image" or whatever. It'll be automatically added to the services menu.
To assign a keystroke to this service, go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Services, and assign a keyboard shortcut to "Mount My Encrypted Disk Image," which should appear under General.
Wow, my first answer was actually completely wrong about OS X—I actually discovered this today, but a large part of the improvements to automation that Apple made for 10.6 make it possible to accomplish this through the use of services.
There is 3rd party software that can accomplish this. I personally use Keyboard Maestro (the last version they released that was free—still works in 10.6!) but that is now shareware. QuickSilver seems to be another alternative; that's free but has some significant extra functionality—not sure how much of that you could turn off. Butler is a cheaper alternative to Keyboard Maestro.
OS X cannot do this on its own. You can define custom keyboard shortcuts, but only for existing menu items in any application.
