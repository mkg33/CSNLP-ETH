A better option, IMO, would be to just not allow your freelancers to have access to the main repositories. They can send the changesets to your main developers who then massage the patches and put them in the repository themselves.
If you need to just fix an existing problem, see "Can I change the username on a mercurial changeset" on stackoverflow.
You can enforce the usernames at the server side, at push time. I.e. for your freelancers it might be feasible to only let them push changes that contain some pre-approved username (this can somewhat restrict other nice features of Mercurial, i.e. that people can share their changes with each other before pushing). You might also just have a complete list of pre-approved usernames on the central server.
As djc mentioned, you can use a pretxnchangegroup hook. The documentation for enforcing commit policy on your central repo is found on the EnsureCommitPolicy wiki page in the Mercurial docs.
This may create other problems since the users won't discover the issue until they try to push back up to the "main" repository which has the hook installed. In this case they would have to strip all the revisions from their repo and re-apply them with a new username.
