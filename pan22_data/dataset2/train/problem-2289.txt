The scope of user rights granted to each group is as their names imply: Domain Admins have administrator rights in the domain, including on all workstations and servers in the domain (domain scope). Local Administrators have administrator rights on the workstation or server where they exist but have no rights in the domain or on other workstations or servers (local scope).
When you join a workstation or server to a domain, the Domain Admins group is added to the local Administrators group and the Domain Users group is added to the local Users group. The only instances where this would not be the case would be if you were to use the Restricted Groups function in a GPO to alter the group membership of these groups or if you manually alter the membership of these groups.
The domain admins group should automatically be a member of the local administrators group on any given domain member, unless it has been explicity removed. Non-domain-admins can be added to the local administrators group on any domain member.
