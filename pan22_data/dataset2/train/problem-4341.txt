The short answer is that you need to add a file to the boot folder of your SD card, and call it "ssh" (the filename is extension-less, mind you).
I came across this question while faced with the same error/problem. I've found something that works for me, so I'll update the answers. 
I looked online, but I couldn't find a solution for windows (but there are a lot for Linux). I tried making sure I had the right IP address by trying to ping the Pi (and I can). I read other posts saying the error is caused by the server blocking the connection, but I am not sure how I would go about fixing that. The only thing I can see that looks strange in the command line to me is that there is no default gateway set up for Ethernet. However, I thought that I would need access to the Pi in order to change that.
Try typing sudo raspi-config, then go to interfaces and enable ssh. I had the same problem until I enabled ssh in interfaces. Hope this helps :)
I took that IP and entered it under "Hostname(or IP address)" in PuTTy. I gave the name a session, pressed save and open. Now, I am getting the following error:
The Nov 2017 version of Rasbian already includes SSH server and client. However by default SSH is disabled. In order to enable it use
"Connection refused" generally means the sshd daemon isn't running, and/or isn't listening on port 22.  
I have a laptop with Windows 8.1 on it, and I have connected it to the Pi using an Ethernet cable. I want to SSH in to the Pi, so I have installed PuTTy.
I went to the windows command line and typed in ipconfig and looked under Ethernet adapter Ethernet > Autoconfiguration Ipv4 Address to find the ip address of the Pi. 
I think you might have the wrong IP: "ipconfig" on Windows gives you the Windows IP address: you want the Raspberry Pi address.
