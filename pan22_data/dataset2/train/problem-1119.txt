You may want to test how the device(s) authentication attempts behave when not using the "Always Up To Date" functionality.  If a device is configured to poll every five minutes instead of using Always Up To Date, and that does not incur the rate of authentication failures that triggers account lockout, this may be a viable workaround. 
Apple posted a technote on this problem promising better experience with devices on iOS7: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4583
I've been challenged by this question as well. As a serious option I'm considering certificate based ActiveSync authentication. Together with the EAS policy to demand a password code for unlocking the mobile device this should count as two-factor authentication (something you have: certificate on your mobile device, something you know: password code for your mobile device).
This seems to be a device problem with the iPhone trying too often using the old, meanwhile incorrect, password.
