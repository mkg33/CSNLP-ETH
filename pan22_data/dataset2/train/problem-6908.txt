It is possible that there is a bug with your hardware, but that would not be my most likely guess.  Since the hardware is old, I would guess a hardware problem.
After trying all the related fixed, I eventually went to plug a monitor in to possibly work on graphics problem that many people seem to blame for this... before long the problem occurred again and I went to plug in a keyboard directly to the server. At that moment I realised the connection had become active again... Now, I have left the keyboard attached for about 12 hours and I have had no problems so far... Any ideas on why a lack of keyboard could give this effect?
A bit of a blind one, should've worked it out far sooner... but just in case anyone else is set up the same, I also get, or believed I had the same problem... but my solution seems a lot simpler than expected.
In my experience display drivers are a common cause of this.  You might want to consider moving to the standard vga driver for a bit to see if the problem goes away.
I would run memtest86 to see if there are any memory issues.  It could be a heat problem too, but then I would think you wouldn't have been able to get it installed.
Anyway, I know it likely shouldn't be here, but I though someone may have tried all fixes remotely like myself and would benefit from this.
I usually keep my server without any attached peripherals, no keyboard, screen or anything... with 9.04 that seemed absolutely fine. Or course I connect and managed it therefore over ssh but after 10 minutes or so, after the upgrade to 9.10, all woudl appear to freeze, even singing a ping to the server would come back without response...
Oh, I missed the part about the upgrade, so probably not hardware fault if it was working before.  I would tail -f /var/log/messages and see if you can catch anything before it locks up.
