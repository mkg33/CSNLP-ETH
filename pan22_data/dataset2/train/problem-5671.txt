How about RDP or VNC client from linux - for example Remmina (you can define screen res. color deep, even windows credentials) or krdc
In case the 'Interactive services detection' dialog still appears, the service must be disabled beforehand and then re-enabled:
For some reason, winexe's '--interactive=1' does not behave like psexec's '-i' option. With winexe, the user will still have to accept an 'Interactive service detection' dialog.
I'd just install a SSH server and SSH in, but figure that might be an "out of the box" way to get it done without the need to install a single bit of software on the Windows pc...
You said you don't want to install cygwin, but are you willing to install anything else on the Windows computer?  You could install a SSH server on the Windows computer, or install the telnet server feature (not very secure, would advise against unless the computer is securely firewalled).
Another option would be something more of a kludge.  Then post a blank batch file somewhere, say a samba share on your linux computer, with read/write access.  Then create a task on the Windows 7 computer that executes another batch file every 5 minutes.  In said script, have the first line download your blank script to the Windows 7 computer and the second line call that batch file as script calling another script.  Normally this file is blank, so when the task runs it downloads a blank script, then calls that script (which does nothing), then exits.  When you want to "run a command", just change your script to have said command as the first line and a second line that clobbers the (normally blank) script on the share, overwriting it with a blank file (to prevent your command from being executed a second time).
