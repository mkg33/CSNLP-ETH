And it also fails for names with more first names or more last names. You really should store them separately. You should also split your input form into specific parts, like title, first name, last name. This way you can handle the possible spaces correctly.
Probably best for StackOverflow, but there is no easy way in general.  You can have a list of allowable prefixes and suffixes to make your algorithm better.  But consider ...
There's no foolproof way to do it, even ignoring titles and suffixes and stuff. Consider the following two names:
This works for names in the format "First Last", but it doesn't work when there is extra information such as "Mr. First Last".
Now when you import the text file into excel as space delimited then it will automatically put all names (first, second, third, fourth, fifth) into different columns.
I have a column which contains a list of names, I want two other columns to contain functions which extract the first and last name. So far I have this
You should extend your sheet with "first name" etc. columns, and try to convert automatically as much names as possible, then examine the results and apply corrections as needed, by hand. After this work your data will be much more easy to use and extend.
I had the same problem. No matter how many names you have for a person you can have them in separate fields very easily. I copied all the names from excel to notepad. Then I imported that text file into excel and while importing i selected the option delimited and then i selected the space delimited.
