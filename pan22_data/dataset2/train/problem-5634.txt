Run Command Prompt, type ipconfig and look at the output - you will see list of network adapters and their IP addresses - all of these addresses are your "local IPs". 
When you install VPN software, usually it creates new virtual network adapter, and assign new IP from some range (5.5.x.x in your case) every time when you connect. 
I am using a VPN service. After recently installing a program that monitors ports, I noticed that whenever I am using my VPN, my local IP address changes. I am aware that the external IP should change from my internet provider's IP to the VPN's IP. That is what is supposed to happen and normal. What I didn't expect was for my local IP to be changed. Is this normal? Or am I using a bad VPN company? Note, my local IP address (127.0.0.1) changes to one of these IPs: 5.5.146.91, 5.5.42.100, 5.5.58.136.
Read all of that. Internal address changing is part of the process. There is probably another network adapter.
It is part of the game. The VPN server often provides local IP addresses for its clients and sometimes let them connect each other just like in a local network. Even the DNS servers are also changed by most VPNs to bypass ISP's ban on some websites/services by means of DNS.
