Are they any ways we can stretch the sql server express database, perhaps by using multiple databases?
From what I understand this uses sql server express 2008r2 which has a 10GB size limit. I am under the impression that full sharepoint can store file content outside of the database but that with our version they are stored in the database and am worried we will run out of space and suddenly our staff will not be able to work any more.
I was hoping for a way to do this via the web app but it seems pretty simple from the stsadm command line eg. you can run this to get a list of database sizes:
by the looks our database is still quite a bit off the max size - the above site details how to use multiple databases so we should be fine.
We have had a consultant set up a sharepoint 2010 server for us to use for document management. I believe it is just on the basic (free) sharepoint that comes with windows server.
How can we monitor the size of the database so we can predict when we might need to upgrade to full sql-server?
