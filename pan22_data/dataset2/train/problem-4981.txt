If the error coming back is "invalid credentials", it is likely to be something about the way the login username string is being passed.
Just a shot in the dark here, but are you trying the hostname or the ip address when using using RDP? 
You already said you tried domain\username, but what about just the username forcing a blank domain (this is done putting a backward slash before the username like this: \myuser)?
Can you confirm that ALL Windows machines consistently failed to login to your Win2k8 server via RDP?
For good measure, try replicating the appropriate network configs from the Mac to your 7 machine and see if RDP works at that point. 
I've had many issues with RDP in the past simply because I'd not configured/updated the network adapter on my machine to account for the appropriate network and dns configurations.
I found the problem, it was password. Password has contained some special symbols so when I typed them over Cord they were identical how I typed but when I typed over windows remote desktop, some of symbols or multiple symbols were false. Now I changed password to password without special symbols and everything is ok. Thank you all for help. 
Are they all in the same domain? If not, confirm you're not using the wrong domain/computer specification in the login field (e.g. "domain\user" or "computer\user").
I have had a similar issue a while back. Ended up being that, although I was only putting in login in CoRD's dialog, it was actually sending the down-level login name (domain\login) to the server.
