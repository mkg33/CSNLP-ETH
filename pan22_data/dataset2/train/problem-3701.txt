It is also worth looking at Trac (http://trac.edgewall.org/), which is essentially an integrated SCM & Project management tool. It comes with a wiki, issue tracker and can also integrate with a variety of version control systems.
Although it's a pain in the backside I'd stick with MS Project as you're familiar with it and it's 'the default' for most people in the way MS Excel/Word/PowerPoint is so you'll be able to deal with other people's files easily. Whether it's the best fit for you is a different matter but I'd suggest that even if it's not just the familiarity and interoperability would tip it towards MS Project for me.
Try Trac, Unfuddle or RedMine. All three are project management apps (or services) that integrate TIGHTLY with Version Control, that way you can set deadlines and assign tasks, as well as provide a much safer way to integrate their changes into the project.
Since this is for managing software projects, you may want to try Lighthouse. Full featured, yet easy to get started with and use.
It's been a while since I looked at the demo, but FogBugz (from StackOverflow/ServerFault co-founder Joel Spolsky) is worth considering.  
If that's not gonna fit the bill, give BaseCamp a try. 37Signals originally developed it to manage their design business.
