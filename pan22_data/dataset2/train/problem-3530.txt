I've randomly ran into this before with Firefox. If you get Firebug, you can go to the Net tab, right click the script that is still loading, and select "Stop loading". This will get around the issue.
Try some other sites that references this JQuery library. Just Google the URL, you'll find enough examples.
Is Firebug the only extension you had loaded? What about NoScript or Adblock? Try starting Firefox in "safe mode" and accessing the Google URL you were trying before.
Could you enter the "culprit link" (that every 2nd web 2.0 site uses) in your Fx address bar and load it manually?
There are some severe Firefox performance issues with some of the Google API's available from ajax.googleapis.com. One, of many, examples is slow or missing characters when typing into Google's own search bar.
The Firefox extension Decentraleyes, created in 2015, replaces CDN resources with local ones. Never tried it myself but looks promising according to the reviews.
I used Adblock Plus to block access to all the Ajax API's from Google'a "http://ajax.googleapis.com/*. This fixed many Firefox Web performance
Have you tried it with a new, clean profile? Addons sometimes work against eachother (NoScript vs. ABP problem...)
The down side is that some web newer sites may require the Ajax API's to appear or function properly.
