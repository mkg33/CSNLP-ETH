I would advice against a wildcard/catch all.  That would allow anyone to point their domain to your server and load up your application.
One word of warning, though. If you're using SSL, then name-based virtual hosts don't work, and you'll need a different IP address for each SSL site.
Yes, you want Apache name-based virtual hosting, and there are many references available to help you get it set up. You can set up virtual hosts for each domain name you want to host, on the same IP address, with different configurations for each domain. You can also set up a default which will be used for domain names that don't have specific virtual hosts defined.
Now as far as I can understand we will need to create a "VirtualHost" in apache to handle this. Can we create a wildcard virtualhost that catches all the domains?
You would use VirtualHost if you wanted to point different domains to different content on the same IP.
If you configure Apache to serve requests for an IP, all requests to that IP will serve the same content.  The domains will be irrelevant to Apache.
I am not an expert with Apache at all. So please forgive if this comes out to be a silly question. Any detailed help would be great.
