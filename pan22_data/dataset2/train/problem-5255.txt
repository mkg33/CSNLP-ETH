You don't want to start that type of stuff as a user, so I recommend that you follow the other advice in this question. 
The best thing to do is to make sure you're starting the services via init scripts. See for example:
If you installed your services using a Ubuntu package manager (apt-get, Synaptic, etc.) the proper startup scripts should have been installed. See the answer by mibus for additional information.
You can check your runlevel using the runlevel command. The last character it prints should be "2" or higher. You can create the /etc/inittab file if it doesn't exist. The line controlling the default runlevel should be as indicated in Convicts answer.
But if you want to do a little test, before you do a permanent solution you could use the disown command. 
Normally, those services would run in the background, starting before the first login, and continuing after the user logs out. Ubuntu Desktop is really Ubuntu Server plus X and Gnome :)
Unless you are starting the daemons as a user and the daemons attach them self to the users standard out/in, they should be running in the background not being bothered who is logged in or not. So what did you actually do that doesn't make the daemons run in background?
Am running Ubuntu8.10 Desktop.. as a server.  When I logoff the machine all the services eg apache, ssh etc.... stop.
