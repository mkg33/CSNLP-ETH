I had this issue on Windows 7. I was finally able to turn it off by setting the service Intel(R) HD Graphics Control Panel Service to Manual and restarting.
The problem is that this "module" which is represented with the C:\Windows\system32\igfxHK.exe file is started after each reboot.
In the Options and Support tab, at the top, is a check-box for enabling/disabling hot key functionality. Try that.
I have tried using Autoruns to disable it but when I do a search for "igfxHK" there, it yields no results. What are some other ways I can try to disable this EXE from starting up with Windows?
I have a laptop with Intel GPU and their software is currently faulty in that it globally registers certain keyboard hotkeys and won't let them go. The way to kill them is to kill the igfxHK Module:
Right-click on desktop and select Graphics Properties. This should open up the Intel Control Panel, select Advanced if the option is offered.
I found igfxCUIService1.0.0.0 in autoruns, where CUI is common user interface.  On a hunch, I disabled that.  Hotkeys are now fine on reboot.  So far I haven't noticed any negative consequences.
