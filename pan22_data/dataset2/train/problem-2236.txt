*Note: I'm using "zombie" in a colloquial sense. "Zombie" processes are real things in OS terms, but I am not certain of what state these processes are in.
Kill the setup.exe process in the task manager and then try rerunning it. Sometimes you get a "zombie"* process that's launched but for whatever reason bugs out and doesn't load correctly, preventing a new one from starting, and doesn't go away by itself.
It might be worth a shot to check if all system files are correct. Hit windows key + R, type 'cmd'. Then in the newly opened dos venster type 'sfc /scannow'.
Are you sure that computer can run other installers, and that the problem is not windows installer itself?
Run Process Monitor. Filter for setup.exe. Compare what happens when it terminates with an example that works correctly.
If you have administrator authority, right click on the setup and choose properties. It might be set to read-only, if so, uncheck the "read-only" box and click apply, then okay. It might also be blocked for some reason, if so check the "unblock" box and click apply, then okay.
Also, sometimes you can extract the setup files from certain installers. Then you will get a new setup file that doesn't have the preferences (silent, no interaction) set to it, as the parent installer has. Check if you can extract files from the installer with an unzip tool like WinRar or Universal Extractor.
