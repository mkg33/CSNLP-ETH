If Dreamhost won't (or can't) fix it, transfer your domain to a registrar that has more competent staff.
This indicates that something is wrong with Dreamhost's process. When you update your nameservers with them, they are supposed to send this update to *.gtld-servers.net, the DNS servers which serve the .net top level domain. This doesn't appear to be happening.
The domain darkfission.net has nameservers ns2.he.net, ns3.he.net, ns4.he.net, and ns5.he.net in the whois record. But the nameservers for net. aren't returning these NS records (as they should) or anything else about your domain.
I have two domains that refuse to accept changes to the name server records.  One domain has had this problem for 6 months and the other just did this today.  I use DreamHost as my domain registrar and I am trying to set Hurricane Electric as my name server.  When I go to set the name servers for these domains, I get no problems from the DreamHost panel, but even after days I am unable to detect any progress on setting the name servers.  It acts like the domain isn't registered when I query for records about it.  The two domains are colorpick.in and darkfission.net.  I set the name servers to ns2.he.net ns3.he.net ns4.he.net and ns5.he.net.  Could anyone give me any advice?
