I am trying to make html5 games to be played on the browser(not offline apps), and I am trying to support the maximum number of platforms, hence I need to know what dimension should I use for the game canvas so that it works in the most number of places.
Google collects data on the average size of the browser window people use when visiting their website:
i used ImpactJS, a game engine that automatically resizes a game to a required dimension, taking into account retina displays from the iPhone4. The coordinate systems are not screwed this way.
As far as I have quickly read you can also use a viewport tag to get more precise control of this process. It's not something I have experience with, but it seems worth looking into.
I think this question cannot be answered with a number for the and for the height. There are just too much different display formats. I think that the discussion of the games dimensions should be based on the game. What I mean is: Tetris in landscape format might not be that cool as in portrait. I prefer setting an fix aspect ratio, which always can be scaled safely into the available space. 
iPhones (and most smartphones I believe) automatically scale web pages to fit the width of the device, thus you can actually make your game in a different scale and as long as the page isn't too tall relative to its width it will automatically fit on the screen.
Also is there anyway to "scale" a large game to fit in the tiny size of iphone(around 320x356px I think). By "scale" I don't mean to actually resize just the canvas, as because that can mess up the coordinate based calculations, and for a large number of objects, re-positioning based on canvas size can be a real hassle.
As you can see 98% of the people browsing have a window size of at least 800x400 so I suppose that is a good start. Of course if you think your game will be played mostly on phones the statistics may be slightly different since these statistics are desktop+mobile.
