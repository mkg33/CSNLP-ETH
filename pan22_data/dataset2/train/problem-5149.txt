Replacing Devices in a Storage Pool I guess this is the recommended solution, the easiest way to find out how well this works on FreeBSD is probably to give it a try.
Adding drives on the fly is as easy as typing "zpool add mypool da7", new drive is usable right after this; you also can add whole bunch of drives in stripe, mirror, raidz(improved raid-5) or raidz2(improved raid-6)
Add as in expand a striped pool? Just add a drive to the pool, that's about it. Consider the implications of your next question thou.
Drives of different sizes can be placed in pool but can't be used in mirror/stripe/raid(if i recall correctly, only smallest hdd space will be usable then)
You will save yourself the hassle of all the framework and get a relatively nice to use GUI for free with it.
You could use it as a stripe and tell ZFS to keep n copies of a file. So you could use the full storage availability you have and still get decent redundancy
I see no reason why you'd want to, I'd think the Snapshot support is only mature enough in OpenSolaris so that you can switch back to an older version and boot that (buth that's actually just wild guessing).
