I am looking for a linux distro in which KDE is the first-class desktop environment.  Which linux distributions primarily target KDE?
In answer to the question of which of the distributions support KDE, all of them do (this is, after all, Linux!). Even redhat comes with a KDE version. 
However, the bigger question of which ones create a beautiful polished version using KDE, the answer is none. At least, not on the level that Ubuntu has gone to with Gnome in the latest incarnation of the OS.
I too have been disappointed with Kubuntu as I use a laptop with ubuntu, and the lack of xsplash, integration features, "whole package" that you get with kubuntu is annoying.
I'm not sure if this is still the case, but Mandriva (formerly Mandrake) used to come with KDE configured as the default window manager.
http://chakra-project.org/ - "project created by a bunch of people who like Arch Linux and the K Desktop Environment."
OpenSuse is your best bet for the best looking, best integrated, but it's not as polished as ubuntu. The general annoyance of moving to RPMs from debian has put me off, that and the huge amount of customisation I've done to my kubuntu to make it work as I want.
This post from TuxRadar, entitled Get the best KDE Linux distro, has a good group review of 8 KDE-based distributions.  OpenSUSE is their overall winner.
