Looking at the ROC graphs I conclude that 2x64 network is superior in all classes compared to the other two, but from the tables and considering F1 statistics, I prefer 3x32 network as it has better performance in most of classes. The AUC statsitics is almost always 1 for all classes except class 4 in network 3x32, which doesn't make sense to me considering the high range of precision and recall values that I get (also the class 4 has zero precision and recall in all models). In short, I find F1 statistics much more clear than ROC and I can not relate these two concepts together but I think there should be a unified explanation.
I have three neural net models that I am running on the same dataset (of 7 classes) and calculate their class performance and also ROC curves. The firs tmodel is a 4-layer model with 8 neurons in each layer, the second one is a 3-layer network of 32 nodes each, and the last one is a two-layer network of 64 nodes each. The class statistics and ROC curves for each network is shown below:
