Cyberwurx has pretty good hardware and better prices. Their support was always great (I am a former customer).  
I currently pay $170 for my Quad Server. The transfer is unmonitored but the speed is really slow. Can you recommend me a couple of better alternatives, preferably with no setup fee?
In the UK, I briefly had a server with Tagadab (but don't get the wrong idea, it was only brief because I decided to host in the U.S. instead).  My experience was brief, but they did everything they said they would do (including near-instant setup), the server was very fast, transfer speeds were excellent, and they offer a terrific try-before-you-buy (the first week costs Â£1, literally). They claim "unlimited" data transfer.
I don't have any experience with these following links but ran across them the other day: KoHvs claim to offer unlimited transfer (with speed restrictions, but reasonable ones). HiDefServers offers 100Mbit/sec up to 25TB for $179 (so close!).
Here's the sales page for a host I used to work for as a sysadmin. They don't have anything that isn't fast: NatNet Dedicated Servers
I use ServerLoft - got a quad core xeon with 4G RAM and 2x250Gb SATA Raid1 for $120 per month (including a Win2008 license - would be $20 less per month with linux).  
Your 5-10TB/month at less than $170 requirement (in your comment on adric's answer) will be a challenge.
