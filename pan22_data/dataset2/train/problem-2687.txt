A few, I came across were :- TFID, Clustering, Decision trees, Sequence Analysis and maybe Regression.
I was wondering after I'm done with the data extraction and cleaning work, what data analytics related algorithms I might be able to apply on my play store apps data to analyze it and find patterns in it, predict the links amongst the data and do other predictions and data analysis on it? 
I am basically trying to collect all possible information related to a particular app, like it's type/genre and sub-genre, ratings, size, number of downloads, if it's paid/unpaid, and other possible information regarding the apps, wherever possible.
So, I am doing a small self project on data analytics. I am collecting the android apps data from the play store sites by web scraping.
So, please review the above ones and suggest any new algorithms, which might be useful to me for my project. Some specific algorithms under the above mentioned broad algorithm(if there are, which might be useful for this project ) please suggest them.
