This would make SpamAssassin ignore the Received headers when using the Bayesian-filtering. Personally I'm not really in favor of this as it restricts your Bayesian-filter what it sees and what I can use to determine if something is ham or spam.
About turning on autolearning is something you may want to reconsider. In most cases it will pollute your database as more ham and spam messages will be wrongly marked. If you want train your database with the latest ham and spam messages it may be wise to set up both a ham and spam account that receive trustworthy messages that can be marked as ham or spam and learn those every X hours/minutes. But this a more difficult setup that requires some time before it correctly works.
When you relearn SpamAssassin that a message should be spam it should flip the message over from ham to spam or spam to ham. The problem is that SpamAssassin learns about the message on your relay host, but when it is forwarded to your Exchange server the headers have changes since an addition Received line was added. You could give it a try by adding the following to your SpamAssassin configuration:
