A registry entry can also be used instead of gpedit.msc to disable creating the Zone.Identifier NTFS Alternate Data Stream for downloaded files, which can cause permission issues:
I am speculating but perhaps because the host system is serving files that obviously are not on the target Windows 7 machine, that each file is considered a download from the internet.  Thus the problem is not in the file, but rather the download zone.  Can you investigate adding the host linux machine to the trusted zone?
I only recommend the above one if it is really annoying you as file security like this is a very good feature of Windows.
Maybe you can also go to the file's Properties tab and press the Unblock button to permanently unblock the file. This will delete the zone information from NTFS Alternate Data Stream of the file.

Alternativly, if you have Group Policy Editor / Gpedit.msc, you can navigate to  User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Attachment Manager
