It is technically correct that a Domain Controller will broadcast NetBIOS Name Service traffic to the network broadcast address advertising itself as a Domain Controller for it's domain, but this in no way has any bearing on what computers "see" or have available to them when a user is logging on. A computer that is not joined to a domain will not "see" any domains available when a user logs on. A computer that is joined to a domain will only "see" the domain to which it is joined, or any domains trusted by it's own domain.
Maybe what you're really after is how to disable Network discovery so that computer(s) aren't visible in the network. If so, have a read here:
If you want to "hide" anything on a network, you need to put a firewall between whatever it is that you're hiding and whom you're hiding it from. So - move your AD servers onto their own subnet and VLAN and then institute firewall rules to only allow that traffic which you require.
You might "see" other domains and workgroups in Network Neighborhood/My Network Places but those domains aren't "advertised" to computers as potential "targets" to log onto. A computer can only "see" and logon to a domain of which it is a member (or a domain trusted by it's own domain).
I would like to have a stand-alone Active Directory deployment within an open network in a way that it isn't visible as a logon option or a workgroup to other, non-joined computers.  The plan so far was to:
