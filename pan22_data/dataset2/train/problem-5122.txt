My other observation is that attackers are very smart, and the work/payoff reward calculation is tilting against direct intrusion over the network and in favor of just leaving a USB stick on a desk and waiting for someone to find it and plug it into their (legitimate, on the authorized LAN) PC.  Yikes.
If the current state of the interface is up, the script would shutdown this interface when it goes down.
Use a VPN internally and treat the section of the network outside secure areas the same way you would treat the internet.
Then, the user calls to verify his identity and the "no shut" is applied on verification and demand.
Shut down unused ports and enable port security on the others. Anyway if someone is able to clone an existing MAC address, there is no way to stop him. 
This is somewhat orthogonal to the OP's intent, but I have found that being very restrictive on wired ports while at the same time creating and opening up a guest wifi AP eliminates all the casual accidents (e.g. a visitor plugging in) and at the same time makes the company environment more welcoming to visitors.  So you get two benefits for the price of one, or, putting it another way, you can deliver a benefit to your management while getting a security benefit as a side effect.
If your only requirement is to just block users (intruders), you can simply write a couple of lines of EEM script.
