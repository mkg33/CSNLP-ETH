Specifically with regards to running Ubuntu applications in Windows, you may find the SSH + X11 forwarding does what you want. It is nearly exactly the same thing as Microsoft remote apps. You may also find that Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) provides an equivalently nice experience.
Running Virtual Box in seamless mode is probably the closest you can get. It tries to hide the fact that some of the apps you have open are running on the VM while others are running natively. You still need to install the apps in the virtual machine.
Unfortunately this kind of seamless running is logistically impossible. Because apps are basically given free reign over the computer when run Windows (or Virtualbox, for that matter) has NO idea where the application will write or make changes. In effect, you'd be copying the entire OS, just to be sure that nothing is dropped or lost! If you want to simulate XP conditions on W7, I'd suggest compatibility mode.
If the application doesn't need any fancy registry settings/etc. to run you could probably share the application directory from the host disk to the guest and then run it from there but that will only work if the application can support being run without being "installed".
This is not possible without installing the application in your second environment. Even in the Remote Apps / RDP example you cite, the apps are actually installed on the server and RDP is pulling a lot of visual strings to make it seem like the app is running locally. Its all visual masquerades. The apps are installed remotely and execute remotely.
