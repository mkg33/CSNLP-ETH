After following every guide on the net and doing my tests I've found this solution (for windows 10 but you can try it). Download Default Program Editor, choose "File Types Settings" and then on the bottom "Change an extension's file type". Select pdf and choose "Add a new file type". Add a quick description (like "PDF file format") and choose your icon. Finally press "Save file Type", or click the little arrow on its side and choose Save to .reg file to see what's gonna change in your registry (remember to use it if you do this). 
It's going to create a new class with your icon and associate the pdf extension with it. At this point It COULD work already (refresh windows icons before going on). I don't know why it still didn't work for me (it wasn't associating the class correctly), so I had to download Types and do it manually. Start it, find PDF and double click on it. Check "classes" if it isn't already and choose the previously created class (DPE should have named it pdf_auto_file). At this point it should work. I guess I could track the changes made by Types and create a .reg file working without these 2 software but... not today ;D
