Then I thought I will give my Windows PE bootdisk a try, which I've created a while ago. No result, only the same empty en-US folder is present there as well.
You should be able to copy the Sysprep folder from another installation so long as the Edition, Architecture, and Service Pack are the same.
The sysprep.exe file is simply missing on my Windows 7 64bit machine. I tried to find it on another computer, but it wasn't found there either. I can't understand it, because on a lot of forums and even in the official articles there are a lot of references to this tool.
It sounds as though these files are missing from your original installation media. Is the original installation media from Microsoft or an OEM?
Please if anyone knows what's happening, point me to the right direction. I need to clone my system and I'm stuck right at the first step...
The Sysprep folder under System32 is where Sysprep is located, at the very least it should contain Sysprep.exe.
I've checked system, system32, sysWOW64 folders, and even made a full search with Total Commander. I only found a sysprep folder in the system32 folder, but inside was only an en-US subfolder, which was empty.
