The term 'cpu' for referring to a computer system bothers me, but I CAN believe I've used it before.
Talking to an end user(QA/Dev): pick one, or use the one they last used. End User, customer site(usually not very tech-savvy): computer.
I use "box" and "machine" when just talking in everyday speech.  If I'm presenting or talking to a group or management then I'll use more appropriate terms "PC", "Server", "Workstation", "Client", etc. based on the scenario of the discussion.
for some reason I always call them a 'machine' - don't know why but it's the engine of the whole thing right, seems to fit. You might want to consider making this a community wiki.
Talking to myself or a fellow sysadmin: If it's a server and I'm in the datacenter(customer site), I'll usually call it a machine(Internal QA/Dev: server). If I'm logged in, I'll usually call it a system. If I'm not, a box. If I'm referring to this particular system among many, a host.
I have always referred to it as the computer. I don't consider peripherals like keyboards and monitors to be part of the computer. Very often I will be more specific as to the type of computer, desktop, tower, laptop, and so on. The only usage that bugs me is that a number of people I work with have started referring to their desktop or towers as hard drives.
