My daughter got a tingle from the audio output on her Pi. I tested it with a meter and it was only 5V so I'm surprised she could feel it, but she did.
You can see a large slot on the PCB (below text L-4765) that provides electrical and physical isolation between the primary and secondary sides of the power supply. No tracks or electrical connections are routed across the slot.
Usually most power adapter usually used to drive Pi are SMPS. Below is a picture of proper SMPS isolation:
Is it possible? Probably. It is an electronic device and problems can happen, especially if you are mucking around with the GPIO. However it should never happen and I would be shocked to hear of it. The purpose of the raspberry pi is to be child friendly!
New cheap manufacturers can cut corners and don't adhere to standards and hence may not isolate the primary and secondary sides properly. The primary side is connected to Live AC voltages.
For those who said it's not possible to receive a shock off the Raspberry Pi - you are wrong. I got quite a nasty jolt from the capacitor next to the micro-USB power input. The device was unplugged at the time. This was a concern as I have a pacemaker fitted, but fortunately the charge is nowhere near enough to cause any problems there.
The Pi still functioned after with no noticeable issues. Perhaps different individual boards are more susceptible to delivering shocks than others.
