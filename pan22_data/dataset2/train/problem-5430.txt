I tried to remotely log on the domain controller with a wyse thin client (linux v6) using rdp.  On the domain controller, I already allowed the remote desktop, enter the Domain Admin  group, which an  admin user is part of it, as a member of the Remote Desktop Group Users and also grant the “Remote Desktop Group Users” the right “allow to remotely log on by terminal services” at the locally level (Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment)  as well as under the Domain-Controller group policy -> Computer Configuration,->Administrative Templates, ->Windows Components->Terminal Services, “enabled”  Allow users to connect remotely using Terminal Services setting.
