You seem to have identified all available options and have tried the convenient ones (didn't know there were keyboards with boot buttons seems odd). I can't see any solution other than taking it apart and bridging the pins / doing what ever is necessary. You may want to check your manual. It may have some tips. These aren't long term solutions however and sending it is seems much better considering you don't want to go through the hassle every time you want to start your computer.
Not sure about your laptop.. but my Acer has a couple of hotkeys on the keyboard like one to go direct to Email and one direct to the Web both have the effect of turning on the laptop.. 
Depending on the exact specs of your computer you MAY be able to switch it on through an Ethernet cable using Wake-On-Lan functionality triggered from another computer or device on the same LAN.   ) I wish my HP Folio had that feature !   Other then that or opening the drive you probably can't.  I doubt a power button on a keyboard would work for you - I suspect its only designed to work from certain partial sleep states - If the computer is powered down, there is no power to the USB port or monitoring it, so no ability to receive the trigger.
I was able to start my ThinkPad X220, having the keyboard broken, by removing battery, AC, and BIOS battery. After that, i just plug in the AC power and it starts. Bios battery is located under the touch-pad. You can use an external USB keyboard after that.
A few machines have an "alternative" power button to boot directly into a special setup mode.  You might be able to get some traction if you have one of these buttons.  You should advise if thats the case.
