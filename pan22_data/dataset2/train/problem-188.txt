My system completely freeze after a random time. I don't know when this happens but on average every hours. The mouse doesn't move at all. Strangely the "restart" button on my computer doesn't work too. I have to push 7 seconds on the power button.
Then, I thought it was a problem due to my distribution (archlinux). So I completely reinstall my system from scratch with Fedora 15. The problem was not resolved.
How can I resolve the problem ? Can you specify me where I can provide more information to focus to the problem ?
Have you tried Ubuntu? My (debianized) computer randomly hangs when resuming after a suspend. Ubuntu solved this issue and let me investigate on my problem excluding hardware failures.
Note: In the link there is a different key sequence. I prefer the REISUB one, as I would terminate the running procs before starting the disk sync.
At first I thought it was a problem due to my installation. I completely reinstall my system from scratch (archlinux) and the problem was not resolved.
