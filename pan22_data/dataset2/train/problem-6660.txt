i think standing the hard drives on their sides might contributed to their failure of working properly because in most cases, hard drives are mounted lying flat in their computer cases.
You should probably update your Ubuntu install. A couple of months (years?) ago, a bug was found which causes increased hard drive wear and tear in Ubuntu installs.
If you do have power surges, many cheap power strips will only work once - and there's usually no indication that they're no longer protecting.
You can check if they've been overheated by looking at the S.M.A.R.T. values.  Grounding the case isn't necessary as many hot swap carriers are plastic and not grounded.  Grounding through the SATA cable should be sufficient.  Having them firmly mounted MAY help with vibration issues.  The head does not touch the platter, but rides slightly above and impact on the platter can cause tiny particles to be disrupted which eventually can result in head crashes.
A good UPS might help - some of the higher-end ones actually generate power from the batteries, and are continuously recharging, providing completely isolated power.  The only drawback is that they can be noisy.
