Native VHD boot, in case if anyone doesn't know, is the way to boot your computer right to the VHD file without having to boot the hosting OS first. Another words, once it boots, no middle layer laying in between, and it uses full hardware capacity, including multimedia devices.
With that said, there are many instances where thin clients are an advantage over fat clients but you'd have to weigh that up for yourself. Just don't be fooled by the marketing guys (I have seen too many sites which were gaga over thin client one week only to rip out their winterms & replace them with fat clients the next).
Winterm thin clients really look & work like a fat client from the user's perspective. The problem with responsiveness only arises if you have too many for your server platform to deal with. Don't expect a magic result after switching to thin client. You'll ultimately still have to have the processor grunt & memory somewhere. Abstracting your processing away from the desktop doesn't make its requirements go away.
If your users never take their computers away (ie if they're not laptops), then thin terminals will do fine. Actually might be great, with centralized administration and versioning. Rolling out new images couldn't be easier.
