You could also try hard coding the IP address as something like 192.168.1.42, other network settings (Netmask, DHCP, etc.) should be same as Win7 laptop. Unfortunately, I don't know how to hard code IPs on Vista. If it still doesn't work after hardcoding the IP, it could still be the key, but beyond that I'm out of options to try.
In XP you can delete the wireless connection (not the wireless network adapter, but merely the "wireless network" as seen in the available networks) and then reconnect to it, allowing you to re-enter the key. I'm sure you can do something similar in Vista, so you should try that to ensure the key doesn't have a typo.
The reason for these two things could be any number of network related issues, from the wifi key not being correct, to a problem with the DHCP functionality of the Vista machine.
"Obtain an IP address automatically" and "Obtain DNS server address automatically" in the TCP/IPv4 properties screen.
Connect the Vista machine directly to the network via CAT5 cable, if it works fine, then probably a problem within the wifi network connection on the laptop. If it doesn't work, then more likely a problem with the DHCP functionality of the laptop (which could still be wifi key related).
You can try assigning a static IP. It does not help troubleshoot your issue but may allow you to access the internet on the Windows Vista Laptop.
A 169 IP indicates that the Vista machine isn't receiving a valid IP response from the router. The reason for this can be varied, but boil down to:
