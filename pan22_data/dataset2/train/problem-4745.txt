Also, Caetgory-6 and Category 6-a should be installed by professional installers as it is highly doubtful that you have the expertise or (very expensive) test equipment to determine that the installed cable passes the category test suite. You can use all the correct category parts, but most important to passing the tests is the actual installation, and even many experienced installers have difficulties with Category-6 and Category-6a cabling.
FYI, cable categories are defined by ANSI/TIA/EIA, which only defines UTP. Many cable many manufacturers cannot meet the category specification without adding a shield, and incorrect use of the shielded cable will prevent it from passing the category test suite.
There are documents that explain things for you. For example, Shielded and unshielded twisted-pair cable revisited:
You simply cannot mix shielded and unshielded parts in a link. The shield only works if it continuous end-to-end  and properly grounded on both ends. The actual wires in shielded cabling cannot meet specifications without working shielding. Having unshielded connectors means that the shielding is broken on the link, and it is not properly grounded. Improperly grounded links with shielded cable cannot meet the required cable specifications.
