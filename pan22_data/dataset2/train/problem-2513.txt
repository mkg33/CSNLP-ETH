It does the same thing (sticks "disk" resident data into RAM for fast access), but it has a pile of heuristics, and just-in-time optimizations for choose exactly what should be accelerated. There will be special cases when you can know better than the OS, but most of the time you should leave well enough alone.
I'd have to say that they're not in use much anymore because of software bloat and mass storage growth have far outstripped RAM.  It used to be that machines would have more RAM available than storage (example, my old XT with 640K RAM and a 360K disk drive).  That made it a no-brainer to make a 384K ramdisk, copy your app onto it and run off of it (still leaving an adequate, for most apps of the day, 256K of RAM).  Contrast with systems nowadays that come with a 1TB drive, but only have 1GB of RAM...
As its name suggests, it's frequently used for /tmp, because that folder only contains files that don't need to persist on reboot.
You will already get most/all of the performance benefit of a ramdisk in normal operation by just letting the memory be used as cache. Disk writes can happen in the background where the latency isn't such a big deal, assuming you have enough cache.
One really good fundamental reason why mem disks aren't very common: you're better off using the memory as disk cache.
Those were in large part crutches to make up for the deficiencies of crippled operating systems, and a full service OS doesn't need them.
