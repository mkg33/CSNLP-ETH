You have 12GB of unused memory â€” set for example pm.max_children = 500. Maybe even higher - depending how much RAM is needed to generate an average request. Observe RAM usage and tune number on children accordingly.
I'm noticing a very slow response time, lots of 502 errors, plus... I have tons of errors like these in my nginx log:
I don't even really know how to find the problem either. When I look through slow log it's just a lot of random stuff probably because everything is going slow... not just one thing.
Some monitoring and graphing tool would be useful to pinpoint the location of bottleneck. We use http://munin-monitoring.org/  Munin grabs stats from most of known services plus system metrics and it works almost out-of-the-box on modern distros. 
I think pm.max_children = 100 is way too small for 60k concurrent visitors. Even if a visitor clicks a link only once in a minute on average then you'd need to generate 1000 page views in a second (60000/60).
You are using 8 nginx worker_processes 8 when you only have 4 cores? I'd suggest using 3 and then allowing the remaining cpu core for other machine tasks.
I don't know if some of these are too high or low, I've tried to tweak it to the best of my ability...
