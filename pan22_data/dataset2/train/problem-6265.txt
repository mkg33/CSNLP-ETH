If you however do not have a boot options selector, you might be able to prioritize the USB when it is connected through the bios SETUP menu, then find the boot settings and move USB to the top, now every time a USB is plugged in, it will load on boot
Try that your hardware is supported by the OS you try to install. there is some problems occur when your hardware is not supported. happened to me when i try to install win 7 to acer laptop. It only supports OS win 8 and later
I have an old Pc that runs Windows XP. I would like to install windows 10 or 7 but i cant boot any of them from a usb. I usually get :boot failure reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device.
I tried to boot with the same usb on another pc and it works fine.I have also checked my Bios(ambios version 3.31a) settings and they seem alright.
This has nothing to do with Windows XP. When the computer starts up, try F8 or F12 or whatever button allows to access boot options, then select USB
