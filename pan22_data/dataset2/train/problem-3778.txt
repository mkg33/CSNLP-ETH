I was able to put the final pass/fail-checking script in a separate action in Toad's Automation Designer, with a separate output file. The first several scripts for each test write to one file, and the last step of each test writes to a second file. The second file does have one set of PL/SQL complete and commit lines per test, but not all the create/insert/drop.
I'm using PL/SQL to test a calculation program that runs as a database procedure. My script inserts test records, runs the calculation procedure on them, creates tables of expected results, and compares expected to actual results. (I drop/create the test objects and expected results tables on each test run to make it quick and easy to run all tests at once when moving from dev to test environments.) Currently I have an action in Toad's Automation Designer to run the scripts for all tests, with 'set serveroutput on' and the output going to a file where I check whether any tests failed.
Here's a workaround that gave me what I wanted without addressing my question. Documenting it here in case it's useful to someone.
Groom the script output to show only lines sent via dbms_output relating to pass/fail status of the test steps. I can't find the right search terms to get a lead on this. Is it possible?
In PL/SQL for Oracle running in Toad, can I suppress script output except for certain lines I want to see? e.g. I don't want create table, insert record, drop table. I do want my own dbms_output.put_line messages.
