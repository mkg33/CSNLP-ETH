and the software above just eats them up and looks great. Also like sam holders answer, you can install all sorts of add ons for youtube, web browsers (kylo is great for big screens) and it all works perfectly with a media center remote.
I would like answer to be set of Interface, plugins and codecs (and anything else is needed) You recommend me to install. Also, anything else you think is important is more than welcome.
(edit: sorry, windows isn't free, but the rest is. windows7 would be nice if you can use that over windows xp media centre edition)
I checked a lot of HTPC forums, and still not sure about what Interface, plugin, codec combination to install.
which is simply awesome, as it finds all your tv show/movie metadata for you and displays it beautifully. you don't even have to rename files (but some organisation helps!)
the main benefit of this is that it keeps the codecs clean, and doesn't install loads of stuff you don't need. The other main advantage is that you can manage all your codecs from a single screen:
MythTV is also pretty good. And also free. MythDora is a good pre-configured installation; I used it happily for a couple of years. It's better with video that with audio; the UI for selecting music is surprisingly poor.
