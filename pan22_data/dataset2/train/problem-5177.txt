Connect them both to the same switch or AP and give them both an IP in the same subnet. Usually this is the default on SoHo devices like your Dlink, so unless you manually set static IPs in different subnets and give two IP ranger to the intenret network on the Dlink this should already work.
Then it gets weird to join to networks the regular way. So i recommend joining through the network adapters page. Right click on the built in adapter- Connect To - (Main Wifi) and Right click on the built in adapter- Connect To - (FileSharingWifi) 
One final option is to connect the two computers by cable, usually crossover, and set your IPs so that they have the same subnet mask and the last octet (.xx) is different from each other. 
Note: If one is connected wirelessly and one is wired, then a router of some sort or switch with an AP combo would be nescessary.
SO, basically, with the one built in adapter, you cant. You can either connect to one network or the other. The internet sharing option that you ruled out would have meant only having to add one wireless adapter, but as the question stands a laptop with just one adapter can only connect to one network at a time. 
By adding files to your public folder which can be accessed by another computer connected to the ad-hoc network. Or sharing user files to the network.
Next select one of the computers and enable a shared folder. Make sure it is either writable for everyone (not recommended security wise), or add a username and password. Then connect to it from the other computer using the \\othercomputername\share syntax.
You're basically asking how can I connect to my Filesharing network (from the windows 8 machine) AND be connected to the regular internet at the same time.
