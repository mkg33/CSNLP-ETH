DNS is a fundamental service for your clients and servers to carry out their functions. In the event a host fails, you are stuck waiting the 60 to 300 seconds for HA to recover that VM, assuming it comes up safe. If your clients are patient people who can wait for this recovery? You might be okay.
I would have two DNS servers before bothering with say two DHCP servers or two mailbox hosts. If you're running Active Directory to manage this network then two domain controllers, each running on a separate virtual host is a MUST.
Same question would apply to mail server - if I have these running as VMs with failover / HA do I need to run a secondary / backup for either? 
However - you need to be aware that failover / HA will only protect against host failures - not Operating System / Application level failures. It's key that you take into account the different failure modes and the different ways to protect. 
For example, HA will also require shared storage - this in itself could become a single point of failure for your server.
