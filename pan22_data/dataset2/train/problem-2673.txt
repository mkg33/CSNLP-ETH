I would definitely go with a small NAS device, which confers a RAID 0, place 2 x 1 Tb drives in it (WD or some brand ones) and ready for backup and your safe too.
For my personal use, I use DropBox. This allows me to keep my designated folders synced everywhere, between my home machines, my work machine, and my school PC. The monthly pricing structure isn't terrible for larger amounts of space, but I find my 2GB limit on the freebie more than enough for what I use it for.  The nice part is, it allows you to work with the files while offline, and the folder will auto sync next time you are connected to the internet, in the background.
As to brand, I don't think there's any specific recommendation. Just get one you like, and remember that all harddisk will fail, it's only a question of when.
I believe the only reasonable option is a portable harddrive. They are relatively cheap, small, fast, and universally compatible (USB mass storage connection). Just get one that is big enough for you; 1 TB sounds about right, and is a common size.
Personally,i don't devices for my backups but i use a backup software installed on my computer called Safecopy backup.They offer a 3GB trial version which one can use as a test before upgrading to a paid account and above the services are just fine for me and they are also cost effective.
