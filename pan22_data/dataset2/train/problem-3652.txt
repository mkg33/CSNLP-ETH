I will use glusterfs with replication running directly on the nodes (not in kubernetes) and mount volumes to the pods using 
Should I install the MongoDB as ReplicaSet directly on the nodes as well or run one MongoDB instance for each project inside a corresponding pod using glusterfs for replicated storage and backup?
When we add more nodes to the cluster or the application needs more database instances for better scaling I will provide a replicated volume for each db instance and connect the databases using a ReplicaSet.
As a requirement the lost of one (worker-) node should allow running the lost pods on other nodes without the loss of data.
Next steps are migrating our company projects to the cluster. As we use MongoDB and ElasticSearch and want to host multiple projects within the cluster, I am not sure how to handle the persistance correctly.
So my intended solution is to run the databases for each project in a seperate pod/container. With our 3 nodes cluster I will replicate the database volume but only run one instance of the database at a time. This way the failover and starting the db container on another node should not be a problem at all. 
How should I preserve the database data among multiple nodes? Even replication (MongoDB ReplicaSet e.q.) needs a persistant storage for each pod.
