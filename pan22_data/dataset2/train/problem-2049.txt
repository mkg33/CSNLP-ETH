As an aside, this is why I give prospective hires an excel test. It's a great way to see if they have general problem solving skills as well as specific excel formula/format knowledge.
Does anyone know how I can lookup the values in one row in sheet 2 (see tables below) and compare this with all rows in sheet 1? 
Since it is a test a down and dirty solution for the first part would be to use COUNTIF then use a special display to get true/false.
If any of the cell values in one row in sheet 2 equal the values in any of the rows in sheet 1 then I would like to return the values 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' for each cell that is being compared. 
Additionally and perhaps most importantly I want to create a separate column which returns either TRUE if all of the values in one row within sheet 2 equal ALL of the values in any row in sheet 1 or else FALSE. Please note however, that the number of rows in sheet 2 is 200 and the number of rows in sheet 1 is 400. Therefore, the formula will need to search all 400 rows in sheet 1 to check if any of the rows (and all values contained within) in sheet 2 can be found in the 400 rows before determining whether to return TRUE or FALSE.
For the second part use a helper column and concatenate the columns, then use a similar formula to above.
