From the NVIDIA Control Panel I changed the Output Dynamic Range from "Limited" to "Full" and this fixed it for me (screenshot below). 
The LCD flatscreen is completely washed out, as if someone had turned the brightness way past max and turned the contrast down too. Black-on-white text is poorly readable, and grey-on-white literally invisible. This means that most icons and toolbars are barely to be seen.
I have Windows 10. Go to control panel, system security and settings. Then type HD Graphics in the search box. Click on Intel HD Graphics. This will bring up your Intel Graphics Control Panel. Choose Display, then click the tab for color. Adjust brightness, contrast and Gamma to your liking. Hope this helped
Using the installed nVidia software, I've managed to turn the gamma down to 0.50 (from 1.00) and that helped make buttons and grey text readable, but it also means that dark tones are all black. This is less of a problem, but still wrong.
I have an ASUS VE278H 27" backlit LED monitor and NVIDIA GeForce 1060 running with Windows 10, and I noticed this issue recurred after some recent Windows updates, which I'm guessing reset the display settings to their defaults.
I went into my Nvidia settings and changed from application controlled to Nvidia set. I don't know what application was controlling it, but that solved the problem. The screen was immediately better.
GPU is nVidia GeForce 7650GS. Monitor is a 17" Fujitsu-Siemens ScaleoView L17. Computer is running Win7 with appropriate display driver and no color-correction profile, gamma, or anything different than a stock Windows installation.
Search for "Color settings" on your Taskbar ->Colors->scroll down-> High Contrast settings->Choose filter->Deuteranopia. Sorted
