I've got a MacBook Pro (with Touch bar) and a previous generation MacBook Pro (without the Touch bar)  I'm getting ready to update from OS X 10.12.6 to 10.14.
I'd like to take my time setting up the new OS X 10.14 without having to be without my current laptop while doing so.  Is there anything that would cause this not to work due to the hardware difference between the two laptops?  I would be turning Full Disk Encryption on.
I've never done this with laptops, only ever Mac Pros with removable drives, however, the lovely thing about Macs is that you can take the drive from one, just drop it in another & so long as the OS was released after that Mac was released it will just work.
Your only issue is if one machine is too new for the OS you are trying to 'carry' (like trying to boot a 2018 from Lion ;) otherwise there ought to be zero issues.
Theoretically, this is also true if you use something like SuperDuper to 'carry' the drive over. I use Carbon Copy Cloner, but as far as I'm aware they are to all intents & purposes the same thing.
