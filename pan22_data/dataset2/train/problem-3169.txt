This doesn't work. You can't just magically (and transparently) share memory and CPU resources between distinct computing node (or laptops in this case). Clusters typically work such that you have one or more director where users schedule tasks to be performed. The director then dispatches these tasks to the actual computing nodes where they are performed. Task execution is done on a node independent from all the others. Once the task is finished, the director node is notified and the result is delivered back to the user.
Concluding: This doesn't work. Better invest some money in more RAM or even build or buy a new Dektop PC. You can get vast amounts of CPU power and memory for a few hundred bucks today.
Note that this is a batch system, so you enter a task and get the result back some time later, This is vastly different to interactive computing you do on your laptop like browsing the web. If nothing else, the latency of accessing the resources of the other node will kill your experience.
