The only imaginable solution would be a virtual NIC that all sessions run through. Its traffic would need to be bridged to the physical NIC. That way you could work around the IP and MAC address restrictions.
For the server side this could be worked around with a single LAA MAC that is assigned to both wi-fi and Ethernet NICs. Sending a frame out from the client after switching NICs would update the switches to the new port. (Both wired and wireless connections would need to use the same segment.)
For the client side this is much harder. You'd need to somehow hand over the open sessions from one NIC to the other which most probably isn't possible with any OS.
Possibly there's a VPN solution out there that could accomplish this. A VPN (or other) tunnel could additionally solve the problem with needing to bridge the wired and the wireless network - the underlying, physical connection would have little importance.
I don't think there is a way. Both on the client and on the server side, sessions are tied to the client's IP address. This in turn is tied to the client NIC's MAC address which is likely to change when switching hardware (from wireless to wired or vice versa). So, we've got two essential requirements: neither IP address nor MAC address must change.
