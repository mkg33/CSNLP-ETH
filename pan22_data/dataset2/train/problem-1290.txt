ZeroShell can perform as a router, firewall, RADIUS server, wireless access point, VPN, and more. It includes QoS, hotspot, and Internet load-balancing and fail-over features. It also supports VLAN tagging, multiple SSIDs, and Windows Active Directory.
It provides the main LAN services for small-to-medium-sized networks, similar to the commercial solution RouterOS. It's offered on a Linux LiveCD, so it doesn't have to be installed. It just needs a small drive to save the configuration.
As it's free and runs from a liveCD, you can try it without much effort. Here is a good starting tutorial provided by LinuxPlanet. 
My building offers wifi to its residents.  It is not managed by IT professionals.  I would like to use this internet source some of the time, but would like to be protected from machines on that network as well as protected in general.  Consider that I have a spare machine with a PCI wireless adapter, a switch and a few machines connected to the switch.  Is it feasible to configure the spare machine such that it connects to the building wifi and serves the few machines connected to the switch?  Does this cause a NAT issue.  Is this something that could be configured with PF Sense, pf in Open BSD, or something similar?  I am a novice-intermediate user.  I have not configured or managed a firewall before, but I've been using Linux exclusively for a couple of years.  So long as the above is possible, I could probably figure it out.
