then I sometimes get my network performance back for a matter of a few seconds to less than a couple of minutes.
I have a Windows 7 64-bit machine that is losing up to 20% of IP packets on both adapters - wireless & LAN. Browser traffic appears to be affected the most, but it is happening to all protocols.
If the problem doesn't occur under Ubunutu then its a Windows issue and my advice would be to nuke the OS  from orbit and redeploy the system.
I have ran accross this kind of issue before, the first thing to figure out is if the problem is being caused by a Hardware issue or by a Software issue. My method of choice for this test is to run a copy of Ubuntu Live from the CD (Where it loads Linux to a RAM Disk) and test the ability to browse the internet and ping other IP's.
This problem has been occurring for a couple of months and is getting worse. The computer used to work just fine.
(Obviously, Ubuntu is just my choice - you could run any Live CD version of linux or even WinPE if you have the right image).
liveCD is a great test, but the problem might be a bug in the windows driver or the NIC's firmware, so make sure these are up to date. The next step is inserting a NIC with different chipset, before you try nuke & pave :-)
If I ping from my faulty machine to any machine on the LAN (wired or wirelessly), including the router/gateway and internet sites, I get up to 20% packet loss.
