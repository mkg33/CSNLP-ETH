Anyone aware of an Open Source or Commercial product that takes advantage of the readily available web APIs, some simple touch screen PCs, and builds a product that is more like skinning an AJAX web app, and ideally more cost effective than the proprietary panels?
The rooms each have Tandberg Edge or MXP video units, I'm not looking at PC-based solutions like Skype or iChat.
The classic way to do this would be to plunk down huge money for an AMX or Crestron panel.  This does have some advantages, and I am considering that approach, but in my initial investigation, that looks expensive, inflexible, and proprietary.
On the other hand, the Tandberg video units I'm looking to control are  very thorough XML API (PDF), so some of the integration magic that Crestron and AMX consider to be a value add, I could reproduce at mashup speeds.
I'm looking to improve the user experience in our video conference rooms, by simplifying the things users do all the time (setting up a call, muting and unmuting, panning and zooming between a few room-appropriate presets) and totally taking away the functions that we don't use or that are more likely to ruin the experience (changing the brightness of the TV, using the VNC presenter mode).
