I'm not sure when exactly graphics adapters started including a ROM in addition to the display hardware, but video ROM/video BIOS refers to this.  (lspci -vvv will tell you the size and even address of the ROM but most if not all video BIOSes disable access after initialization.)  Back when hard drive controllers were on an ISA card in the MFM/RLL days, it had a ROM that extended the BIOS to allow booting from it, as well as a low level format utility.  Other types of cards that commonly have option ROMs were SCSI controller cards and RAID cards.  Even if the hardware is onboard, it may still function as though it has an option ROM in this way.
You are also likely at the mercy of any utilities your graphics card maker provides to update the video ROM, unfortunately.
The original BIOS scanned the upper 384K area in the first 1MB of memory (and remember back then we are talking 256MB was considered a huge, expensive system) for "option ROMs" - if any were found during the BIOS initialization, the BIOS would temporarily hand control to the option ROM which could then do whatever initialization it needed.
Your BIOS probably doesn't support a picture at full maximum resolution to save space in the flash chip.
