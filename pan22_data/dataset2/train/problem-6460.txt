The reputation of said emails is 9.9/10 according to mail-tester.com (DKIM, etc. are already enabled), and we're talking mainly about transactional emails here, so I don't think the problem comes from the quality of the email.
We have several users that complain about not receiving only some of the emails our webservers send through AWS Simple Email Service. Most of those users not receiving emails are users with hotmail.fr email addresses. 
We are currently using AWS SES without dedicated IP addresses (I'm in the process of collecting info whether using dedicated IP addresses could be a good solution).
If you could help me shed some lights on this 250 SMTP code OR if you've veer had any experience with debugging users not receiving emails, I would gladly take the help.
I am still in the process of figuring out how I can contact Microsoft/hotmail regarding this (I'm trying to find the appropriate contact form but is seems I cannot find the appropriate catrgory). In the meantime I'm also trying to find some stuff regarding this famous 250 SMTP code, but is feels like it's quite similar to a 202 Accepted HTTP code in a sense that the delivery actually worked, yet our users still don't receive the messages)
