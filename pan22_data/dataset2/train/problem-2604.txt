You can create local user account(an give share\ntfs permissions) on the  "share server"  with same  name & password  as account used on your "test server"  for running app accessing shares.
It is always going to prompt until you do one of two things. Both acomplish the same task of caching the credentials (which ironically in this case do not matter but still need to be present). 
The other option is the make the password on the stand alone server exactly the same as it is on the identical named user on the domain.
Have you run through this article (below) in detail? It's not so much a list of steps, as a detailed top-bottom for how this functionality happens.
If the username you are using the login with exists on the server but has a different password it will always prompt for the password no matter what guest and anonymous settings you have created.
One is to map the drive and make the mapping persistent. The other is to open up credential manager directly and add a login (any login) for the server you are connecting to. Credential Manager is accessed from the users control panel item or directly at "Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Credential Manager".
Have you tried explicitly adding the computer account, i.e. computername$ to have permissions on the share and via NTFS? Obviously, this wouldn't work with non-domain joined machines.
