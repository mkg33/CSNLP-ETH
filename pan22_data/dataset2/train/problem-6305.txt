The router's external ip is different than that of my bedroom machine's. (Hence they aren't on the same LAN) However, both the router and my bedroom machine are on the same subnet (the entire apartment complex is on the same subnet). 
Talk to the person who set it up. If they have different external IP's it is possible that they are doing BINAT. However my best guess is they block all incoming ports like HTTP/SSH and only allow traffic to come in if it was initiated by a packet to go out.
I host a website out of my server which is connected to the living room router, so I wish to be able to develop my site from my bedroom machine. The problem is, I cannot ssh into my server. I tried browsing to my website both using the url and the external ip of my router, no good. Pinging the router's external ip does not work either. 
Now that of course precludes any mistake you could have done. Since your hosting multiple machines behind your living room I am guessing you NAT? If so did you enable port forwarding to a specific machine. Also is your router's firewall set up properly.
It's also quite possible that the network provider is using "private VLANs" (essentially allowing only communication between access port and trunk port(s), not between access ports within the VLAN).
I live in an apartment which provides the internet connection (isp: webpass). In one wall socket, I plugged in a router, which serves all my machines in the living room. In my bedroom I have another machine plugged directly into the wall.
Is there anything I can do to circumvent this problem, or is this something that can only be changed by requesting the apartment to modify on their end. 
Without knowing what subnet mask you are using, it's impossible (for us) to say if they're on the same subnet or not. They may be in the same "class C" network, but that (unfortunately) says nothing about the actual subnets involved.
