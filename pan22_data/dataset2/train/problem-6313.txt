It is possible for corruption to spread, so be prepared! Your system and user databases should be backed up frequently with CHECKSUM and the databases be configured with the Page Verify setting set to CHECKSUM. 
Running this regularly is extremely important in an effort to detect data corruption. If availability is important, you should consider running this daily. It is possible for backups to contain corrupted data as well. This can easily go unnoticed if the corrupted page(s) isn't accessed. Corruption can occur due to several factors including: storage configurations, power faults, poor cache, etc. 
If there comes a time where a corrupted page existed, and no good back up is available, in general, what are the consequences can occur? Nothing? Corruption will spread?
The best scenario is to have backups and to run CHECKDB frequently enough that you have the last good backup 
As for corruption spreading, if I found corruption, I would be investigating if there were any issues with the disk subsystem. If so I would expect that it would be happening again and would look into getting that fixed.
On my understanding, regular run of DBCC CHECKDB is a best practice in order to check integrity of the database.
Tn this scenario, before we fixed the corruption, SELECT * FROM Department would error, whereas after running the fix it would work.
Steve Stedman also has an excellent Weekly Database Corruption Challenge if you wish to attempt repairs. 
lets say the corruption occured on the page that holds the DepartmentId 2 record in the Departments table, that record will be removed from the database and John is now in a department that doesn't exist (referential integrity is broken)
