Finally, right-click on "Microsoft Word" in the start bar, and make sure that "Always on top" is deselected.
I did this with whatever the newest update version for windows 10 was or is for me at 2:56AM Eastern time. 1/5/2018 . I'm 13 right now so anybody older than me who couldn't figure it out should feel ashamed. Just kidding. Forgot to mention that this works for all windows having this problem.
I closed both Outlook and Word and started the Task Manager.  There was still a Winword.exe process listed under the Processes tab.  I killed that duplicate process and restarted Outlook and Word and now Word was behaving correctly.
I had this same problem with Word in Office 2010 and after looking at the link to Matt Fleming's site in bdoserror's answer to this problem, was able to use the solution in the comment there.
I have experienced this "always-on-top" window problem as a side effect of an MS task (PowerPoint, Excel, Word) not closing down properly when exiting the application. The fix that has always worked for me (Windows 7 Prof. 64) was to kill the residual process(es) using the Task Manager.    
This problem happened to me once. Unless you want to download a shady program from a site filled with viruses this is the only way. I figured out that you can fix it with Task Manager. Don't worry you don't have to delete anything or get super techy. If you have something important on the window that is always on front, then you need to save it. Open Task Manager by pressing ctrl + alt +del if you didn't know how. Who doesn't though? End the window that is giving you trouble and re-open it. Go down to the start page or windows button at the bottom left hand screen and open notepad. Using Task Manager click the button to the left of Notepad. It should look like the greater than sign ( > ). One you click it there should be only one option (Untitled - Notepad). Right click it and then choose bring to front. This should fix your problem
