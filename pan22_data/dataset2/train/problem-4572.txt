Windows Update is a service so once you command it to do something it will proceed in doing so regardless in which way you commanded it to run and in which way you close the UI you have used.
So, while you can find the application in the Task Manager (to see if it does something) as well as in tools like Process Monitor (from SysInternals, lets you see and filter all the I/O events happening on a system) it will probably not do that much in general when it is in the background. It should also be noted that there's only a certain limit of background Metro tasks that can keep running as to not consume much memory, after opening a few the oldest used ones will save their state and close.
Not entirely sure what you mean by this, but I'll attempt to first explain what happens when a Metro application goes into the background: It suspends; so, it's no longer actively running most of the time unless the application were to have a background task (!= service) which will most likely keep running or might run on a scheduled basic.
But let's say you want to monitor a Metro app while it's running and you want to keep it running, you can do this by placing the app on the side of your screen such that it shows next to your desktop.
