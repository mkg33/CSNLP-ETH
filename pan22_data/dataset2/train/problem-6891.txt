To try to find out about a given IP address, the usual way is to start with the "whois" tools of a registry such as RIPE.
Welcome to Network Engineering!  It is doubtful that you will be able to identify the person who did this.  You may get some hints that allow you to speculate, but it's not very likely you will find anything definite.
The problem is even if the source computer is found it will most likely just be a compromised machine. Tracing an attack back through the web of compromised machines to the individual that did it is very difficult even for a well-resourced law enforcement agency and basically impossible for normal people.
Be aware that a miscreant is likely to be in another country, and indeed may have covered their tracks in any number of ways: that is to say, the address you have might be the address of another victim of the miscreants.
In addition to the good, direct answers to your question, there's a lession to be learned here - or actually two:
For example, if the address belongs to your internal network, that would be a good hint that the person is in your organization.  You might be able to identify the particular computer.
If you have his IP address try locating his location or WHOIS IP from http://whatismyip.live and contact the respective ISP. 
You can (and probablly should) report the incident to the abuse contact of the IP block owner, but they may not do anything about it. 
But if the address is a public address, your chances decrease considerably.  You might be able to tell what country and perhaps what city the person was in, but not much more than that.
