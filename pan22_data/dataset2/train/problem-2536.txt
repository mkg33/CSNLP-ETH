Do you have continuous sound metering, do you put meters in from time to time, or do you just put up with it?
I play drums myself, so I have very nice ear protection. I brought those on the second day, and I noticed a very big difference in my condition at the end of the day. On the first day, I was a wreck. The constant noise, even though you don't really notice it after a while, really wears you out physically. With the earplugs everything is so much more relaxed.
Even though a server room isn't unbearably loud, it's noticeable at least. I've spent a few days in our server room at the datacenter a while (=2 years) ago because everything went very bad when one of the juniors hooked up an insecure windows server into the domain (woopeee, reinstall the domain :/).
If you go to 4:05 in this video of Google's "Shipping Contaier" data center, you'll see that the technician wears ear protection similar to what you'd find on a gun range or the guys helping to park airplanes. I think it's a good idea that doesn't hurt.
I've never been in a server room that was unbearably loud, even with several hundreds of servers.  If yours is, the room may be too small.  I would consider some sound deadening over the walls and ceiling.
I can really recommend buying a set of earplugs with a separate filter, something like these. You don't want el-cheapo earplugs, because you'll have to replace them too often. Getting a set of these with interchangeable filters works for more than just the datacenter. At a music concert for instance, or when you have to go to other noisy (maybe louder) environments.
I would highly recommend having a professional sound test undertaken in order to confirm the noise exposure level. Depending upon the results appropriate action can then be taken.http://soundmonitor.co.uk
