Really your best bet is to use the AnyConnect client.  It's my understanding that Cisco is moving away from the fat client and it's notoriously buggy on Vista.
I've run into this issue so often - as Joseph says, it's fixed as of 5.0.03.0530 (stupid versioning, Cisco!), and I am currently running 5.0.04.0300 with no problems.
On my personal laptop, whenever I ran into that issue, all I would have to do to fix it was disable and re-enable the wireless adapter.
I have come across the very same problem when I first installed my Cisco VPN client on my Vista box at home. I followed every step that I found on google search but nothing worked. Then I just restart everything - machine & router. I then uninstalled the client and reinstalled. It worked that time. It's crazy but that was all that I needed to do. ;-)
This problem has been fixed in Cisco VPN Client 5.0.03.0530.  I would recommend using 5.0.04.0300 or the new version 5.0.05.0290.
