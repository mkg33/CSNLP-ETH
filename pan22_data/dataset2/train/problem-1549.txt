If you want your original key binding back, you can set it up in Compiz, if that's what you use, with the Commands plugin.
Note that in modern Ubuntus running Unity, you'll want to change the keybinding that opens the unity launcher (done by installing compizconfig-settings-manager, running ccsm, going to the Unity plugin under desktop, and changing its launcher keybinding).
I bound Control-F1 to open Terminal on GNOME in the keyboard shortcuts preferences. It was the shortcut key I used for xterm on Window Maker ages ago, so muscle memory prevailed.
If you don't use Compiz, then you can do what I do and use xbindkeys. Make sure you install xbindkeys-config rather than try to edit the config file by hand.
The bug with not being able to use the Windows key on Ubuntu is a known issue.  Have a look at Bug 12153 for more details and a workaround.
Then you need to install xbindkeys (e.g. sudo apt-get install xbindkeys) and add it to your startup applications via System->Preferences->Startup.
