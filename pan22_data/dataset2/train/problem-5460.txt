I've used Soekris boxes before. My home router is one, mostly because it comes with 5 network interfaces. 
  There are a number of netbooks that would work for this.  And as a bonus you can use it for other things as well.
Basically, it's an ARM processor with 512MB of RAM, some flash memory, a USB port, a NIC. All built into a powerplug(!). Hence the name. 
If it's limited budget you want, you want the Sheevaplug. Mine has just been delivered a few hours ago and I can't wait to get home and start checking it out.
There's a whole host of System on a Chip boards that you could use if you really wanted a small environment to play with.
also have a look at pcengines alix... e.g. the 3d3... 500mhz amd, 256mb ram, 5W google for "alix 3d3"
One thing to consider when you're first starting in embedded work is to remember you're not on a multicore, multi-gigabytes-of-RAM machine.    If you're really set on making a small fileserver, I'd go with a miniITX formfactor motherboard and a smallish case, and stay away from the 'embedded' form factors.     
At a previous job, I used PC104 systems for various tasks-- very tiny, the ones we had were well-supported under Linux, and if you look long enough, you can find one with the appropriate mix of interface/memory/flash storage that you need.
There's a whole lot of Linux distributions that run on the ARM architecture. Debian, for instance, has a complete ARM port. It's a bit different that IA32, but it'll do the jobs you mentioned just fine.
if you want it really tiny, you could go for a foxboard: http://foxlx.acmesystems.it/ it's very lightweight. 200mhz and 2W power consumption. it can do webcam-streaming to internet and has gpios. very "solder friendly"
