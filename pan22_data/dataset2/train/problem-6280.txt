In our case, it was the motherboard watchdog which had a bad temperature sensor.  The sensor kept insisting that the motherboard was overheating, so it shut the OS, and therefore the computer, down.  The shutdown logs looked similar to yours, like someone had come along and run the 'shutdown' command somewhere.  When first powered on, the computer would run for 20 minutes or so before shutting down, but if you were persistant it would start the shutdown process almost before the OS boot was finished.
Go into your motherboard management (BMC, IPMI, iLO, whatever) and check to see if there are any "events" in the logs.
Have you checked with any users that have access to this host? See if one of them is shutting down the computer?
I don't see anything in your logs prior to switching to runlevel 0, so it sounds to me like the OS thinks it's being told to shut down correctly (ie. by a power button press)
Check /root/.bash_history, /home/*/.bash_history and other similar files to see if one of them shows a shutdown message.
I would guess power button as well, but it's possible that something else is causing it. Is this machine connected to a UPS?  Are there any other people who have root access on the machine? Can you check lastlog to see if anyone else was connected when it was shutdown? What services is this machine running, and are there any published vulnerabilities on these services?
I'd expect some sort of error message to explain why it was shutdown. You could see who was logged on to it at the time it was shutdown with "last". It could be that the server is overheating and shutting down to protect itself. I'm not sure what process would do that on CentOS. As far as the power button is concerned, there should be a log about that, but you could try stopping acpid and see if it still shuts down. That would rule out any ACPI events.
