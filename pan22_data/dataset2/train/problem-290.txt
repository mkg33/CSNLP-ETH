I know this is left field but do a memory check on the machine.  I've had issues like this because the ram was buggered and it was causing the computation to fail.
Also with microsoft support, if you prove they screwed up, they waive the fee.  If you have a disc from microsoft saying web server 2008, a key which they themselves say is legit AND you can get them to the installer where it declines it they will waive the fee and provide a new key for you.
You should be able to install Windows 2008 completely bypassing the license key (just click next) to get you going.  Once you have Windows up and running, try entering the key by right clicking My Computer/Properties.  If you still have no joy, I would call the Microsoft licensing activation number rather than the general product support number.  The relevant phone numbers are here:
I have installed Windows web server a few times, but I copied and pasted my serial key from technet and have not had these problems you speak of, but I have them all the time when installing office when I am at a client.
(idiot answer) I would try again, especially check for B and 8 as I am always having problems with them.
(smart answer) If you are 100% sure and it is a error, take it back to newegg as a faulty good and tell them to test it, then purchase another for yourself.
Also the keys can be very fiddly when it comes to the edition they're for.  If the key is for a specific windows SKU it wont install if you use the wrong disc or the wrong edition of the disc (eg using a windows XP key with an XP SP2 disk will not work).
Make sure the date on your computer isn't way off.  I've had trouble with either the key or activation (can't remember which one) and had to adjust mine.
