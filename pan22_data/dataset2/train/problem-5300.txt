It's not quite how I'd design a SQL UI, but it's reasonable and open source. And it now builds on win32!
Query Express is only 100kb and doesn't require an install.  It works with ms sql, oracle and other oledb.
Redgate just recently released a really cool (free) plugin to SSMS called SQL Server Search, currently in Beta.  It does a keyword search for any object in your database or server, and is fast.
I would like to add to the list SQL Everywhere by Atlantis Interactive - even its free edition is very helpful for both database developers and administrators. I liked the most the object search feature and the intellisense, code snippets suport. The tool is very customizable, too.
Instead of listing them all here, here is a link which contains a lot of free tools and other resources (SQL Server Management Studio Add-ins; SQL injection tools; Administration; best practices, analysis, health and performance, Database Publishing to hosted servers, Update and Migration; SQL Server Analysis Services; SQL Server Integration Services; SQL Server 2005 BI Development Studio (BIDS); Code formatting ...):
There's a really cool story behind the development of this tool.  Robert Chipperfield blogged about it.  Great read.
