For my internal Network, i'd like to set up IPv6 with ULAs assigned with DHCPv6, a bit like with IPv4s RFC1918 private addresses:
The only problem you might run into is that not all clients support DHCPv6 (notorious one is Android) so those clients will only get a global address through SLAAC, so its communication to ULA addresses will go through the router.
another solution would be to scratch the assignment of global addresses to the clients at all and use only ULAs, DHCPv6 and NPTv6.
My initial thought was to assign the ULAs with DHCPv6 from a server on the network (i have a DNS/DHCP-server already doing the same in the IPv4-World), and the global address with the RA of the router.
At the same time, i still want my clients to have a global addresses (with privacy extensions) which they should use for external communication.
especially the configuration of DNS and DHCPv6 are the points where i have to rely on the ULAs as far as i know, since i can't create stateful dhcp-configurations or DNS reverse-Zones based on a dynamically assigned prefix from my ISP
