Based on the symptoms, it may be caused by Windows' TCP autotuning (TCP Window Size auto negotiation) or chimney offload (offloading workload to network adapter) technology not working as intended (maybe because one end, or some old network equipment in-between doesn't support TCP Autotuning typically)
From another computer with same or other windows version (windows 2012 server by example), same result.
Transfer with cygwin from windows computer on another VLAN using SCP (ssh) : transfer rate is 47-53 Mb/s for both type of file
Wireshark show that slow transfer A is done with SMB2 protocol and normal transfer B is done with NetBios/NBSS protocol
Each time, zip file or iso file have normal transfer rate. When data file, fake file created by dd, have low transfer rate.
Unfortunately, it works normaly now without anybody to tell us what happen between when it dont and now.
And because my tests show SCP (SSH) the transfer rate is normal (same for all files types) I oriented my search to the top protocols of the OSI model
This transfert rate is permanent for type of file. That mean, if you try from another time at different days and hours, you will get the same result.
Transfer with winscp from windows computer on another VLAN : transfer rate is 26 Mb/s for both type of file
One client get a strange behaviour : From a windows 7, by opening explorer.exe and transfering one file of 1Gb (zip, iso, data, created with dd command, etc ...) from a LAN share (see configuration below) using UNC path you can have 2 differents behaviors depending of the file.
Transfer with cygwin from windows computer on another VLAN using mount point : transfer rate is 7-10 Mb/s for A and 55 Mb/s for B
The share : It's an IBM Spectrum Scale (new GPFS name) shared by NSD server with NFS and SMB enable on a specific VLAN server
