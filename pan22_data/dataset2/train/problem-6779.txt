This broke a lot of older applications.  To allow older application to continue using Administrator only folders, Windows created a virtual store to keep altered files in.  Take a look in:  
After much wrestling I found that I had to take ownership of the entire folder before I could change the permissions to allow the Administrators group Full Accessâ€”which, in my opinion, it should rightly have.
The Program Files folder is protected by Administrator rights.  In Windows XP and earlier, most people ran as Administrator all of the time.  Many programs assumed this was the case and did all their work in the Program Files folder.
I had a similar problem, shortly after moving to Windows 7 (from XP) I was trying to unzip a file inside C:\Program Files and it kept giving me an Access Denied error.
In order to take ownership of a folder: right-click on the folder and go to Properties, then click on the Security tab, then click Advanced, then the Owner tab, and click Edit. Check "Replace owner on subcontainers and objects", then select the new owner (e.g., the "Administrators" group), then say OK.
You'll find your files there.  You can also use Explorer by opening the folder and pressing the Compatability files button at the top of the window.
