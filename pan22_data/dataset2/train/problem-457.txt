I doubt this is possible with a default install but I'm wondering if there is any add-ons or some other magic that could make this work?
The answer to this depends on exactly what you're monitoring. There are plugins that can handle multi-homed hosts (the stock check_icmp, for example), but if you're checking any services, or using SNMP/NRPE/whatever, you need to get fancier.
in my environment to execute checks against multi-homed servers.  Some servers have multiple interfaces in multiple VLANs (for traffic segmentation).  Only one interface is in DNS, so using hostnames in the Nagios config wasn't applicable to me.  I originally started with multiple host definitions with separate IPs (host-a, host-a-vlan1) but that proved cumbersome.  
You could cobble together something using check_multi, maintain two parallel configurations that are all children of the two different WAN connections, or look into adaptive monitoring.
In our office we have dual WAN setup, if our cable connection drops we still get connectivity via our T1. The only issue is that our office network is no longer available on the same IP so all Nagios check go critical because they can't connect.
Configure a primary and backup VPN tunnel between your offsite Nagios server and your office LAN. Let Nagios check services using the private IP address of each, using whichever VPN tunnel is available. Configure a dependency on the VPN endpoint so that service checks go "unknown" and not "critical" if both VPN links go down.
I modified the check_multiaddr slightly to throw a CRITICAL if any of the interfaces is down because the default (OK as long as one interface is up) didn't meet my scenario.
What'd be awesome is if I could have Nagios try IP 1 by default but if for some reason its failing on that IP try IP 2. 
With a little bit of work (or a lot, if your system is large), you could put every check inside a wrapper check script that tests the service in question on both possible addresses.
