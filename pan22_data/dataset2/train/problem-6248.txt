I have seen systems that will not reliably recognize the RAM in the system.  If this happens and results in no RAM... well, I would expect more booting to occur than you describe, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.
If you have a multimeter, you can try measuring the voltages on various other pins, you're looking for a tolerance of Â±5%. You might want to also read the PWR_OK signal output on pin 8 (grey cable)
It smells like a failed PSU to me. Assuming the PE850 uses an ATX compatible PSU and not a bespoke unit, you can test this by disconnecting the PSU from the mainboard and all devices, then shorting out pins 15 (black wire) and pin 16 (green wire) using a short piece of wire on the main ATX connector.
What that tells me is that there is something that is true immediately after the system shuts down that is not true 1-24 hours after shutdown.  Also, that fact only matters when the system is booting.
The amber SI-LED can point to 2 problems: your fans OR your power-supply. I know that you said that your server gets power, but at boot it probably doesn't consume the full power-capacity which is why it probably shuts down/ go to blinking lights.
The other test I suggest is to boot the system to full operational status, and then immediately shut down (no more than 5 minutes on) and see if the system will restart successfully.
