The APs and WLC software know when they have different SSIDs that interference needs to be avoided and will adjust accordingly. just create a different group for your guest APs and their SSID and implement more restrictive policies on that group to avoid problems. Think access rights QOS etc....
I'm sure one of you have done this before. So our company has decided to have a separate physical network for Guest WiFi. This means putting up a new Cisco Wireless Controller and Access Points.  We will also put it on the edge of our LAN, making sure that it's touching only the router of our 2nd ISP.
Using most modern APs and WLCs you can make use of the 2.4 and 5 ghz spectrums G,N and AC band standards...there is no need to create two separate environments. We have 4 or 5 guest wifi SSIDs in our environment although use AP numbers in the thousands and 6 WLC controllers. ALso through MIMO its possible to use multiple vlans and environments without dividing the physical equipment, it is divided on the logical level.
My question will be the (possible?) interference these additional Guest APs will bring. Currently we have 4 APs we are using for our Corporate users. Our office has two floors with about 100+ users. I'm thinking of putting up 2-3 Guest APs. Where do you suggest to put them? Should I place it as far as possible from the Corporate APs? Or can they be close, assuming that it's 5 GHz and they are using different channels. Any best practice or suggestions?
