If you use a black (or other solid colour) as a gutter region, you will be in some very weird averaging. and leakage back into the original image.
But in reality, a simple "left" until it wont fit, then "down" works surprisingly well, especially with regularly(ish) sized textures. 
Yes, all the graphics cards now support non power of two textures. Most of the time they just inflate the texture to the nearest power of two in the driver underneath you. Be nice to your graphics card, use a power of two, your texture cache will thank you.
The reasoning behind this is that any kind of filtering will blur one texture/sprite into the next. 
It can be very useful though to pack often used textures near to each other to minimize cache thrashing and texture cache use!
If you really must use filtering, ensure that you leave a gutter area around each image to account for the filtering. The trick here is to extend the last pixel into the gutter area so that any filtering (or averaging) will average the same colour as the last colour in the actual texture.
