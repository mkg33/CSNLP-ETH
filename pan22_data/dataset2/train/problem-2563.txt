At first I thought it's fake, but then I've read this post which mentions that Received field can't be faked. It seems that received is proper in case of the e-mail I'm talking about:
I've received some strange e-mail recently. The e-mail has different From and Reply-To fields. It has also To set to Undisclosed recipients but it's not crucial.
Whenever an email server receives a message, it puts a new Received header on the top, and passes all others on unchanged. As such, the first Received header is always trustworthy (it was added by the server that you received the mail from). The second one is trustworthy if you trust the host/IP that it came from according to the first one. The third one is trustworthy if you trust the second one, and you trust the IP that the third one came from according to the second one. This pattern repeats for all of them, each chaining on the trust of all of the higher ones. Note the word "and"; a single break in the chain means that no lower Received headers can be trusted, no matter what host/IP they indicate.
