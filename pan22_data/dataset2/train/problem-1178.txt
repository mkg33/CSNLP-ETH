Is your server on  a cluster and you are creating the shares in the computer management applet instead of cluster administrator?  Check if there is a "Cluster Service" service that is started.
There's a lot of things that we can suggest - but you say that you're not the admin for the server. Who is responsible for the admin of the server? Could they be removing the share, either manually or via a scripted cleanup process?
Try addressing the server via its FQDN DNS name, or its IP address directly. Addressing it via an unqualified hostname could lead to it being resolved via NetBIOS rather than DNS, which in turn can lead to less reliable name resolution.
I assume you are talking about sending your files to something like, Z:\MyServer\FileRepository, where Z is your mapped drive? Will the utility work with a UNC path, such as \MyServer\c$\FileRepository?
Check what the utility is doing behind the scenes - even if's just by running it manually to see what happens to your share.  I've seen third party utilities misbehave in this manner before, and totally hose permissions, reset ownership, etc.  Once you've established that, you should permission the share so that the account the utility runs under only has rights to "subfolders and files", rather than "this folder, subfolders and files".  That should stop it.
If you have access to the source code of the utility it's even better as you should then be able to identify the offending piece of code that drops the share.
I've seen NetBIOS-resolved machines become invisible for a period when NetBIOS browser elections are being forced.
