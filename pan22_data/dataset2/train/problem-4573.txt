It worries me that a few of these might slip through the net and there's nothing we can do once the machine is infected.
I noticed that the infection method was via email (a very believable email with a PDF attachment) so obviously a decent spam filter will be a good starting point but what bothered me the most was we have backups running that'll still backup these crypto'd files if any machine gets infected. As it could be months before opening a crypto'd file has been locked (most ransom-ware only give you 48 - 72 hours to recover your data before deleting the private key) what sort of things can we put in place to stop this happening, besides a decent A/V and spam filter.
Regular Offline backups is the only way to combat malware like Cryptolocker.  Cryptolocker is only the beginning.
Here's the scenario. We've got around 15 - 25 physical machines, a few virtual ones, 3 or 4 file servers, mobile devices - the works in a single domain. A user reported that they'd been infected with CryptoLocker (ransom-ware) and as they're part of the domain, there's no reason to suspect that the ransom-ware hasn't locked the shared files on the network drives or shared drives of other machines. 
At the previous company I worked for we used a GPO to block all programs and applications from using the TEMP directory which seemed to help a lot. Our firewall showed several attempts from Cyrpto to get into the system but all failed. We also took regular backups, daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly. Apart from these steps the only other option is user education.
