You could cheat and get thin clients that mount on the back of monitors (called a 'VESA mount') and use those to run remote desktop/vnc fullscreen to the 'big iron' that you keep in the closet.  Note that this will work fine for most dev work, but things requiring fast graphics (ie. playing quake or lots of fly-though rendering while working on 3D modelling or animation) will of course suffer.
We have several stand-alone servers with no monitor, keyboard, mouse - just a machine in a room.  We access them with Remote Desktop.  It is very convenient and isnt any different than sitting right in front of the machine.
I haven't used these, but I'm seriously considering giving it a shot.  NComputing has an adapter box, and it looks like LG has something similar: LG Network Monitors.
Have you considered using Remote Desktop, VNC or similar software to manage your servers.  All you will need is an Ethernet cable.
Remote desktops require a login to get to the big iron where the real work is done, so walking off with one doesn't get you anything beyond the physical hardware (of which the display is almost as expensive as the computer).
