Your current wireless router, depending on the model, might already include a wireless USB print server
Companies such as Cisco/Linksys produce wireless print servers. They can be a little pricey, but as they've been around for a while you may find cheap second-hand units on e-bay.
Another possibility, if you're in the market for a network storage device, is to find one that supports usb printers, which you could then connect to your wi-fi router.
