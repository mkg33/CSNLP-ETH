What this means for us mortals is that when a Mac stalls at the Apple logo or the logo with a spinning gear, it probably has a corrupt Mac OS X installation. It may also be having trouble accessing an internal or external hardware component, but this is less-likely.
You could also, if you feel comfortable, manually boot into Single User Mode (Command + S right when you boot) and then run fsck -y to check the boot device for issues. Then try mount -uw /. Then if that works, simply type reboot and see if it works (fsck stands for "File System ChecK", so if you did a hard reboot you may have caused some issues with the file system)
Once the spinning gear appears the BSD kernel (Darwin) has assumed command and begins loading device drivers.  Shortly thereafter it transfers command to the almighty (and controversial) launchd process.  Such are the workings of UNIX.

Rebooting your Mac in Safe Mode can sometimes get things working well-enough that a second, normal reboot then works normally  Hold down the Shift key at startup to boot in Safe Mode.  DiskWarrior is also worth a shot (this is by far my most used disk utility). If that doesnâ€™t work, an Archive & Install may be needed.
