The way it’s supposed to work is that when you update registration information for .COM, .NET, and .EDU domain names, the registrar should send the the new WHOIS information to CRSNIC. The problematic situation described above is one possible result when that transfer fails.
My next step is to let HostGator have a look, but first I want to better understand how this happened.
Did I screw this up? I don’t even know how this might have happened, so I’d like to learn. I’m trying out HostGator’s reseller service and I bought a domain name through it, but I didn’t want the default name servers and so I changed them during the registration. After registration the domain name record is correct everywhere except at whois-servers.net and whois.crsnic.net and it looks like the DNS network is using that same information.
While it’s arguable that CRSNIC might have dropped the ball somewhere, eNom could have automatically checked to confirm that the CRSNIC record had been updated, and obviously didn’t.
I would conclude that eNom failed to properly transfer (and confirm the transfer of) the updated WHOIS name server information to CRSNIC.
