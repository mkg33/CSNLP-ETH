Brick walls indeed do bad to signal penetration. The more dense the wall, the more it blocks 2.4G frequencies. Steel-reinforced concrete is obviously the worst, because steel mesh is very good at blocking electromagnetic radiation.
Anyway, I'd say the two ways to improve your signal would be putting a more powerful antenna on the router or putting a more powerful antenna on your wireless card (and/or get a better card, like you were thinking about).
Disclaimer: I've read about wireless stuff, but all I have is a crappy Broadcom b/g mini-card in my Dell notebook. Other answers may be better.
If you look through the advanced wireless setting option in the dd-wrt firmware there is an option of increasing the transmission strength. 
Don't set the value to high because it will cause the router to overheat and probably get fried in case of improper ventilation.
Installing more access points, using directional antennas and scanning for good channels helps. I use Android app called Wifi Analyzer to see what channels are occupied by neighboring networks. Using 802.11a and 5GHz frequency helps with other traffic, but penetrates walls worse.
I recently hugely improved the wireless signal to all parts of my house by putting the router on a shelf by itself, further away from the wall than it had previously been, and free of encroachment from books and piles of clutter which had been accumulating around it.  Not sure about the percentage change, but it was enough to make streamed video work in places which couldn't even sustain a stable connection before.
