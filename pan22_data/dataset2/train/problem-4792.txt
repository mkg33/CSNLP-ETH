There is no combination of keystrokes that will kill the shell in the way that you describe, although in my opinion it's a very rare situation that Control+Alt+Delete doesn't work in.
It's unclear to me what you mean by "shell".  On Windows, this would typically refer only to explorer.exe, which provides the taskbar, desktop, and folder views.  However, your example of killing the X server with Ctrl+Alt+Backspace is very different: it kills the graphical engine running your display.
I find that once I can get Task Manager up you can usually kill the offending process(es) and be on your way. I fully admit though that often the process is explorer.exe.
The way I do this is Ctrl-alt-delete then start task manager, kill the process. If that doesn't work then it is time for the big, red switch.
You can launch task manager by pressing control-shift-escape, handy to know if control-alt-delete isn't playing nicely.  Kill the explorer.exe process, then file, new task, explorer.exe.
Now, when you hold Ctrl and hit ScrLk twice in quick succession, the graphics system will be terminated.  See MSKB 244139 for more details.
(Before complaints arise: this actually terminates all running programs, services, and drivers, by initiating a blue screen.  UNIX systems can generally tolerate the graphical system being killed and restarted, but Windows... this is as close as I can get.)
