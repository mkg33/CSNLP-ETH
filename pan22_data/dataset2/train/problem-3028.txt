Basically you go to Network Connections -> open properties for the virtual switch you want to delete -> click Configure -> go to the Driver tab -> Uninstall Device.
As always, I would recommend that you export your current settings to a .reg file to have an appropriate backup before attempting similar changes.  
I didn't want to install the Azure Powershell tools so I just followed the steps in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Gb342gSGg
Even though I'm not using Docker, I wanted to figure out a solution without using regedit, so after attempting the answer from RobV8R, I found instructions on this question on MS Technet.

Also, I'm going to assume that you'll want to follow @mxgg250's advice, and set all hyper-v services to manual start, otherwise it's going to recreate the switch on reboot.
To prevent the Hyper-V service from creating a new one next time I restart my computer without disabling it altogether I changed the Startup Type of each Hyper-V service to be Manual.
Ultimately, the OP performed an in-depth search within the registry and found the virtual switch configuration stored within the following key:
