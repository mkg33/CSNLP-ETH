You will notice that when you scroll on the start screen, live tile updates cease to occur. The UI seems extremely smooth because when you are scrolling, it behaves simply as a cached image, which takes little processing power to render.
Even when connected over RDP, the animations seem just as smooth and snappy, which seems odd given how hardware accelerated graphics are nerfed through RDP connections.
Yes, the new interface makes much better use of available graphics hardware, pushing far more of the work to the graphics card over the CPU than was done in the past.  The Windows 8 team wrote a great blog post on the subject describing the use of graphics hardware and how there was a huge focus on improving the experience through better use of the GPUs.
The start screen is really slick and smooth and I'm quite impressed by how snappy everything seems, but I noticed something interesting...
Is the Modern-UI hardware accelerated? If not, how do they make it so slick without needlessly taxing the system?
Turns out there are massive improvements to RDP with Windows 8.  You can read about graphics improvements to RDP on the Remote Desktop blog from Microsoft.
