DRAC's will work in Windows and Linux, with IE you need to tweek active x settings so the plugins will install properly.
I added one years ago (2003/2004) and it worked fine. Some network config to give it its own IP, but seemed to be simple.
I have 9 Dell 1850 servers that we are going to be relocating from our office to our remote data center.
They are easy to configure, you press Control E during bootup when prompted to access the drac setup.  There you set IP information, and initial login account.  If you use dhcp, you'll see the drac's ip address upon reboot.
I would like to know if anyone has been sucsessful in adding a DRAC card to a server themselves. Ebay has a good selection of cards but I wanted to see if anyone has any experince with this and if there is anything specific I should be aware of.
I have installed countless dracs at my job.  I have installed them in Dell Poweredge 1950's, but I'm sure they will work in the 1850's.  They are very easy to physically install in the system.
I highly recommend updating the firmware on any drac as a first step, it seems to help save headaches in the future.  You do that via the web interface.
