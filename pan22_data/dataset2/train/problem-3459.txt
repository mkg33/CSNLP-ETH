I am using httpd for starting the server. I even tried starting using the below command but I am still getting the same error..
I tried to change the listening port for my Apache HTTP server in UNIX by modifying the httpd.conf file (present under conf directory) but this doesn't seem to have any effect when I restart my server.
I tried to start my Apache HTTP server in unix but got the below error so I thought of changing the port.
When you say you downloaded Apache and installed it on a "UNIX" box, what Operating System are you actually running? Are you running Linux? Solaris? FreeBSD? OpenBSD? Etc.?
Probably better if you use the full path and not relative just to make sure nothing is going wrong. Your best bet, though, is tell us what OS you are using and maybe get this installed with a more supportable way that has documentation behind it.
Further, whatever system you are running should likely have Apache as a package to install from its package management utility.
I tried changing the port number to a value greater than 1024 (non privileged port numbers) but I am getting the same error as above(error still list port 80).
