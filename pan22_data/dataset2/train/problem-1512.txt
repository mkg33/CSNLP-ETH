Anyway, with FTP the name is giveaway: "transfer" and "protocol" should tell you that it's for transferring files across a network, and will have limited capability to interact with the filesystem.  FTP isn't a general purpose filesystem tool.
Why do you want to use FTP instead of the OS copy|cp|whatever command for this?  Do you only have FTP access to the server?  Can you not telnet|ssh|RDP|etc instead?
Most FTP servers does support renaming '/folder/file' to '/another/folder/another-file' as long as target directory does exists.
Is it possible (and how) to copy a file on a remote machine to a different place on the same remote machine using FTP?
Do you specifically need to make a copy of the file, so that a full copy of it exists in each of two paths, as opposed to just moving/renaming a single instance of the file?
You can rename file using RNFR and RNTO FTP commands (see Rename function in your favorite FTP client). 
I suspect it would depend on the ftp server, but you can accomplish a move with the ftp rename command.
