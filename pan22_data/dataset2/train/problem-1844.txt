I put this last because it's really a minimal concern -- Datacenters spend money making themselves very reliable and robust in the face of subsystem/component failures.  Disaster Recovery in the sense of "what happens if my datacenter goes away" is best addressed by having another datacenter, so the questions I ask are along those lines:
It's a good thing that you're thinking about what questions to ask your hosting company, but I think you're approaching it backwards.  First figure out your requirements, and then ask each company how their infrastructure will meet them.  
The other thing I would look for is connectivity... you would like a provider which is also a ISP or a Backbone.
In addition to what everyone else has mentioned, some other things to consider (geared toward colocation - hosting your hardware at someone else's facility):
When they're explaining how their infrastructure meets your needs don't be afraid to ask questions, and if you aren't satisfied with the answers you're getting don't be afraid to insist on having someone relatively upper-level give you a good explanation -- You are giving the hosting company good money, and if their sales guy can't explain things to your satisfaction insist on a network engineer or someone from their Datacenter Operations team to explain things.
There are a number of things you can look for which will be more or less important to your specific situation. Thinks I always like to know:
See if there are any options to have the shared site mirrored... I know personally that HostMySite.com used to set these up for a bit more than shared hosting... not so much now...
