There is no notion of access modifier being use. Almost everything is by default, which is the package modifier. So all your code is only working because everything is in the same package. If you change the package of any of the three class (Misc, MainFrame2 and GuiTest) nothing will work anymore. This is one of the first step you need to take, decide what can be accessed and what not.
You need to make your class public, you don't need to hide it. You want to use it where you want when you want. Extending JFrame is a bad idea, you don't inheritance favor composition. Your actionPerfomed is a bit too "intelligent", it keep track of which lyrics you need to show. This method should not know what she need but should ask someone what should be the next lyrics. You should not use pane.setLayout(null);, try to use a real layout and please don't use absolute positioning. This is hell for maintenance ( I didn't implement this change though). So here is your class, clean up : 
That i was declared in MainFrame2 and use in Misc was very unusual and should be avoided at all cost. If you need a variable to be accessible by other classes make get/set and use those to control the state of the variable.
The method lyrics should know by itself which lyrics should be return to the asker, since you want the lyrics in order. One of the big flaws of this class is that it's static. A class that resemble a controller should not be static. You should make an instance and inject your instance where you need the controller. This would help in assuring that no one else is calling the static method from another part of the project and change your order that you should receive your lyrics.
You should not return "Something's wrong. I should always be 1-4." bad data as mechanism to show that the method failed. You should fix your method to avoid encountering the wrong case, or throw an exception if you're not in a valid state.
