For example, for Seagate disks there's SeaTools for DOS (which is actually a bootable CDROM image).  Try Googling for " software diagnostic disk" or " disk utilities"
2) Could you try putting the disk in another computer?  Or, alternatively, you could get a USB hard disk enclosure to allow you to mount the disk on another computer over USB.
1) Some (all?) hard disk manufacturers provide software tools which you can burn onto a bootable CDROM.  You boot directly into the tool and then run some diagnostics which should hopefully provide some useful information on how to proceed.
Once you have done this you can then repair your GRUB installation.  The fact that the MBR is missing after a system crash is kind of concerning.  I would HIGHLY recommend backing up your data if you are able to access it again and then run diagnostics on the hard drive.
I have a multi-partitioned hard drive on my laptop set up with GRUB. I got a blue-screen while working on Windows 7 and when rebooting I got the Operating System Not Found error message. I rebooted the computer once again and entered the BIOS setup just to see if recognized my HDD - it did. Next step for me was booting a Live CD and seeing if I could repair GRUB or at least check if something changed on the partitions, but it doesn't seem to recognize anything there. Tried blkid, fdisk -l, not even GParted can see it.
