The drive is being correctly identified as a 250GB Samsung SSD, however the full capacity isn't being recognized. 
I had a similar issue with a 256GB Samsung SSD not showing full capacity (it was only showing 111GB capacity).
I have a 120GB SSD that I recently copied to a 250GB SSD via a device-device clone on Clonezilla, the clone worked without issue and all of my previous partitions were successfully cloned to the new SSD. 
I've solved it purely by accident using diskpart.exe while desperately trying out anything related to disk and volume management in Windows:
and voil√†, you can now see all the unallocated space in Windows Disk Management and can extend an existing volume or add a new one.
However, after this clone there doesn't seem to be unallocated space on the drive, just 120GB of partitions. 
I have attempted to use tools such as MiniTool Partition Wizard to "recognize" the missing space however have failed to do so.
Windows Disk Management is reporting the disk as 111.79GB - with no unallocated space, as does the "Volumes" tab on the drive.
