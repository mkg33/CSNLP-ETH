Because Libraries is selected, the list of files is always scrolled to the bottom.  Because I like my desktop sorted by date, I always have to scroll up to get to the files I wanted to get to.  This is particularly aggravating whenever I'm using an open file dialog, as the files I want to open are newer and therefore at the top of the list.
(Note:  I'm sorting by date descending, and grouping by date.  Changing this does not alter the problematic behavior)
Whenever I open up an Explorer window, and click on the "Desktop" icon, "Libraries" is always selected in the files list.  
I've been searching for a solution to this exact question.  I place all of my recent and to-do files directly on my desktop and need quick access to them in a details view format.  To access the files, I use Windows Explorer from the taskbar then click Desktop which also ends up highlighting and selecting Libraries by default and then requires scrolling -- really annoying. 
I stumbled upon a work-around that may work for you. Pin the Desktop icon to Windows Explorer on the taskbar. Then whenever you need to access the desktop you have to right click the Windows Explorer icon and then select Desktop.  In this method Libraries is not selected and you can select your files by date with the most recent files showing at the top. It works for me although a more direct single click folder view of the Desktop would be ideal.
BTW- this issue seems to also exist when you access the Desktop folder through Computer, a users profile name, Network, and Homegroup.  So basically whichever link you select just prior to clicking Desktop will get selected and highlighted in the Desktop view. Perhaps searching for a solution to these similar (if not the same) issues, may reveal a different solution than I provided.
