I contacted my host and found the problem. Both me and my client are using the same host, who completely block servers contacting each other. So we're looking for a different solution now.
Most can connect fine but one client cannot, they get a "connection closed by host" error. They also noted that they cannot connect via Windows Explorer, which I tested and it doesn't work for me either. I get a message:
I have a Ubuntu server hosting client websites, IP: 88.208.194.208. We have Pro-FTPd set up and it runs fine when connecting through FileZilla to upload files etc. We have some clients with software that automates some file uploading so I have set up FTP accounts for each of them (actually standard user accounts in Linux, but the FTP uses them the same).
We have a basic iptables firewall on the server but nothing else AFAIK. iptables is not blocking anything specific.
I also checked log files and could not see the client server's IP address anywhere (ran grep in the entirety of var/logs). The client has also tried disabling firewalls etc their side with no luck.
