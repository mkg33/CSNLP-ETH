If you always want it running, use update-rc.d foo defaults; that will stop it in 0, 1 and 6, while leaving it running in 2, 3, 4 and 5.  (1 shouldn't run anything but a shell, 0 and 6 are halt and reboot)
I have a service foo which currently starts at runlevel 3 and above. How can I stop it from doing so, without using update-rc.d foo stop 3 ., which (if I understand it correctly) would turn off the service at each runlevel change. 
Once installed, run rcconf in SSH and you will receive a dialog box displaying all services set to run on boot. Select the ones by pressing Space to disable/enable the particular and you're done, simpley click on Ok and that service wont bother to start again on next boot. Being using this for years. Very handy tool for Debian/Ubuntu users like me.
Why don't you backup the startup script somewhere else and remove it in the /etc/init.d/ ? If the update-rc.d doesn't work.
(ie., if I was at runlevel 1 and enabled foo, then when I changed to runlevel 3 it would be disabled, no?)
