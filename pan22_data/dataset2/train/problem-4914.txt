So now the question is: Can it be run when plugged in? The answer is "no" in the ideal case, but "possibly" in the case of a defect in Explorer (or some other Windows component). However, such a behavior would be a bug in Windows, not by design.
Well... hopefully not currently. Any time information in a file of any type is read, there is also the remote chance that the program reading it has some defect that the virus attempts to take advantage of, and either run directly or indirectly. One older example was a jpg virus that took advantage of some sort of buffer overrun in the image viewer. Its a constant task for the people who product antivirus software to find new viruses and provide updates. So if your have all the current antivirus updates and system patches, its probably not an issue today, but a theortical maybe tomorrow.
On a clean system, I would say that a virus can't run itself.  But I think that a program could be written that could be running all the time, just waiting for a drive to be inserted, then look for a certain file and run it, if available.  This is pretty unlikely, as the program would need to be installed to run all the time, but it does seem to be within the realm of possible but not very likely.
