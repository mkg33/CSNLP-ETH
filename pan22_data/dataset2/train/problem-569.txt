A last question, perhaps the most apt culprit: what's your system's power supply?  It'd be worth testing the system memory too (Windows 7 has a diagnostic you should be able to find in Control Panel or Administrative Tools).  Anything weird or strange, especially hardware-related, almost always boils down to defects in one of these two, but from the behavior you're describing it points more towards PSU than RAM.
Definitely a hardware problem, but you've ruled out the likely culprit of temperature.  It's a stretch, but if you can confirm this with more testing, it's conceivable that some incompatible state lingers in the video card's memory and survives the reboot.  Stranger things have happened.
Is your GPU overheating?  Perhaps the graphics driver settings in Windows are different than Linux, causing it to run hotter in Windows.  The nVidia System Monitor can show you the temperature and fan speeds.  Speedfan may be able to do that too.  If it's running too hot, check that the GPU fan is running fast enough and it's not set for extreme overclocking.
