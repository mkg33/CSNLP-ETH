Based on the question I assume you're talking about a L2 DCI...which is pretty widely accepted as a "bad policy" for a multitude of reasons.
BUT assuming you don't care about any of those reasons a good place to start is by saying that FabricPath != Trill. Just like STP != PVSTP and MST/RSTP != RPVST. It's Cisco's proprietary version of what TRILL might deliver, but it is not TRILL. Thus making it inoperable with other vendors.
Increasing the size of the TRILL domain has some scalability issues (nickname exhaustion to name one) and also increases the size of the failure domain. For DCI I would look at some of the more tried/tested models (VPLS for example) and I'd be tempted to leave each DC in it's own TRILL domain.
If someone had a gun to my head and told me to implement a L2 DCI I would use several geographically diverse links and bond them where I can. You might could get away with TRILL if you have devices that actually support the standard.
When I last checked the TRILL WG wasn't chartered to work on cross data center TRILL solutions although the following draft shows what such a solution "could" look like draft-aldrin-trill-data-center-interconnect-00
