Then we need to chain it into the formula in step 1. Replace the "false" in step 1 with the formula in step 2.
You can do this with a macro is all you want is to build a large array of repeating data. I personally avoid macros and do most of my text generation in Powershell.
Give that a try and I hope that it works. When I run this formula against your data in Column D, I get the same numbers you have in Column E.
When we work with formulas we need to lay out our logic for what actions we want to take in order. All formulas are procedural in nature so this helps figure out what we need to do first. I'm assume that all inputs are in the "New ID" column and all outputs (aka returns) are in the Parent ID column. Looking at your data example, here is what I think you want.
Now that we have our first group of numbers handled, we can add an IF statement to the mix to chain out logic together. We now need the "FLOOR" equation to round a number to number of significant digits. In this case, eight digits. Here is what the formula would look like alone:
Finally, we just need to round down the remaining numbers. We can do this with another MROUND. Here is the formula alone:
This first IF parameter tests to see if the number in D2 has a remainder when divided by 10^9. If it doesn, return a zero, if not return the text "false"
The first equation we use is the "MOD" Equation. If we divide every number by "1000000000" (10^9), we can look for any number with a remainder of zero. Each one we find is one that want to return a zero with. To do that, we need to use the "IF" Formula. Here is what your formula in Cell E2 would look like:
Now, if you want to take data and do some calculations on it, we can do that with formulas. Here are the ones I think you need:
