I do provide SMB on the LAN but not WAN, and I'd like to not start running a full web server locally if avoidable. (Because having far greater unnecessary functionality also means scope for a wider attack surface: best avoided if not needed).
Given that scenario, what is the substitute expectation for users who have been using FTPS (or who have been using FTP and want to add TLS transport) to be doing instead?
In the past I've used FTP over TLS to let non-technical friends and family remotely access important files on my server.
Of course decent FTP clients will support this and will exist for many years, but the point was that an ftp(s):// URI has been usable in browsers for decades but now clearly won't be (or won't reliably be). So what should I do, to give them what they need/expect insead?
I assume a not-especially-technical client user who wants it to "just work"within the default OS or their usual browser, and not download specific FTP/client software just to add that capability. The functionality they need is as simple as "enter URI -> authenticate -> get file system root listing -> browse & search directories and up/download files".
I've just found that they can't do so using Firefox any more, and the firefox bug/feature states that FTP is heading for being "clearly deprecated" and FTP over TLS is being tagged as WONTFIX (Mozilla link1 link2 but see also link3). I also can't get IE11 in Win8.1 to connect either (most family are on 8.1 not 10).
