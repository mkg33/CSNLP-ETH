I have this strange problem on the acer aspire one d250. It happened already once before, stayed for about two weeks, and then "fixed itself".
I tried contacting Acer about this, but the support was not helpful, completely stupid, it seemed like they used canned responses, the usual.
Also, when it is getting charged, it charges pretty fast until about 70% and then progresses extremely slowly.
The battery holds the charge that appears on the battery indicator normally. Just can't get the battery to charge fully -- I can't get it past the 90%.
the battery can't seem to get fully charged; ie the indicator is stuck at about 90% (it's probably not a software problem -- I have ArchLinux and Windows 7 installed and both report exactly the same) and it never passes that value, but it still shows the status as "charging" (I tried everything I could think of -- leaving it charging for extremely long amounts of time, doing a few complete charge-recharge cycles, removing/reinserting the battery, cleaning the connectors, even updating the BIOS, etc., and nothing helped).
At first I thought this would be a simple battery failure (even if the computer is not that old, about 6-7 months), but as I mentioned it happened once before, and then one day it fixed itself.
