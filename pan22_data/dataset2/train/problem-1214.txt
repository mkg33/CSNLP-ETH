Bit of an issue with the ASUS U3100 Mini Plus (https://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Asus_U3100_Mini_plus_DVB-T) under Mint Serena...
So I've installed the firmware (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenELEC/dvb-firmware/master/firmware/dvb-usb-af9035-02.fw), did the quirks thing as it was claimed by USBHID (actually needed to add quirks as boot option as adding options to /etc/modprobe.d/usbhid.conf did not work...):
@user879862 what you noted was not exactly what was needed, but it did point me to the right direction, so thanks for that! Btw, I did not see your answer until few days ago, when I installed Xubuntu 18.04 instead of Mint... Thing now works, it is possible that this will work with Mint as well.
The issue I see is (output from lshw) that device appears to be unclaimed and system thinks it's Keyboard:
And that's it. Very simple but it was pain to figure this out given I had no clue how this works... Anyways, this was very helpful to me, hope it helps someone else as well:
