I am going to assume you are a fairly new DBA. In addition to the two existing answers, there maybe a couple of related things you should look at. 
You should only have one log file, but it is subdivided into VLF files, as a DBA you have some control over how this is handled.  There is a fairly deep look at VLFs in the post Why are virtual log files not always allocated in order? 
I have to keep track of fragmentation within multiple databases, would it be correct to understand that I only check index fragmentation? 
Tables with clustered indexes: the clustered index is the table data so that can fragment as with any other index
For larger database performance the number of datafiles is appropriate for the number of processors you have. I go into some detail about it in my answer at Split .mdf datafile methods
Stored procedures, views, etc: the definition text for these is stored as NVARCHAR(MAX) values so they are off-page and if longer than ~8kb (~4K characters, as they are stored two-bytes-per-char) they can potentially fragment, but this is not going to be significant.
As far as I can see with research the only thing that fragments is indexes no other objects in SQL can fragment.
Tables without a clustered index (heaps): the heap structure can also fragment, and is potentially prone to other issues too depending on use patterns (such as space/efficiency lost over time+use due to forward records, see https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2016/07/fix-forwarded-records/)
