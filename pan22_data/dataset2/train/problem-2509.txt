batsd is a daemon for aggregating and storing statistics, while batsd-dash is a configurable dashboard the present the data you have stored in batsd. 
My choice was using influxdb as backend for statsd and rendering graphs with Grafana. Initially I was tempted to send my metrics directly to influxdb, but could not deny the variety of clients in multiple languages for Statsd. That and you will need it also to aggregate data with time.
With batsd and its dashboard you can get started rather quick, specially if you know Ruby. However the dashboard is quite limited.
I do not think you should try to replace statsd since it is almost a standard for most metric tools. The big problem when building your metrics system tends to be the default backend: graphite. It is a pain to install unless you are familiar with Django apps.
Is there any alternative to etsy's statsd? Maybe even a complete dashboard-like solution? My research only found proprietary SaaS solutions. 
For those who do not know: statsd is a deamon which collects app and system metrics via UDP and sends them to Graphite to generate more or less beautiful plots. There is an API for all important languages available. 
This seems perilously close to a shopping question, which aren't permitted on SF (see the FAQ).  I also don't know statsd, but from the list of capabilities I can say that munin fulfils them all.  Rrdtool is used as the data aggregation and graphing engine.  Since it's plugin-based, it can collect and process any statistic that you can locally source on the server with an atomic operation.
