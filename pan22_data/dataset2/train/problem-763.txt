My company has our printers provided by a contractor via a managed service. The contractor has software installed in our network which is supposed to detect the printers and then report back on the print volumes. This software is not working therefore, I took a look at the logs and discovered that the software was scanning the IP range that of the server (where the software is installed) and not other VLANS in the network (where the printers are).
The service provider asked me to send the address ranges for the printers therefore, I sent the below list:
Frequently VLANS and subnets are deployed in a 1:1 relationship, but that does not necessarily need to be the case.
A VLAN is a layer 2 construct. Putting devices on separate VLANS is like connecting them to different physical switches. Devices on separate VLANS cannot communicate directly with each other.
In your situation, the vendor is essentially asking for the subnet mask for each entry in your table. This will allow them to scan the entire subnet, not just a single IP address.
