My MiFi is a Novatel 2200 branded for Virgin Mobile. I read on their support site from another user that you can use a USB connector without data pins to just supply power to the device so it charges the battery.
(rant) It is too hard to find USB hardware. I wish there were keywords for each type of USB connector so that when I search online I could just use a simple keyword to find the exact connector I needed. Searching for Micro A or Mini B does not narrow down the results very well since A and B are just ignored. (rant over)
Some USB-powered external hard drives come with a 3-plug cable, of which only 2 (one for the host, one for the drive) actually carry data. The third only carries power, and is for use with a host that doesn't supply enough power on only a single USB port.
I have a 3 inch USB connector which I prefer for portability but it only charges randomly. I cannot force it into charge mode.
I'd like to find a way to use USB to charge my MiFi device. Right now the standard USB connection turns on the 3G connectivity but does not charge at the same time. Meanwhile if I use the wall charger which came with it the WiFi hotspot is active while it charges. I would like to do the same while connected to my laptop.
