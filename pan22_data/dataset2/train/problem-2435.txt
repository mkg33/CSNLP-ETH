Sounds like heat, especially if the fans get louder. Try putting the computer in an open area, and run the system with the side panel off / open and see if you still get "freezing." If there's dust in there, blow it out thoroughly. I usually use an air compressor at about 40 PSI to clean my electronics out.
Really, the easiest way is to just swap it out for another, known good unit.  It takes extensive time & effort (and equipment) to do a real good job of testing one, and if you're just watching (not recording/reviewing) the data stream, you could very easily miss an anomaly.
One way to test your power supply is by unplugging non-essential components such as extra hard drives, external USB drives, etc. and running only with the core components.
My HP Pavillion is on its 3rd power supply. I think heat killed one of them (a power surge killed the other one, but that's another story.) After I replaced the power supply, I moved the tower from the "tower bay" in my desk to the floor (so it could get more air), and setup a small, external fan next to the tower. That fan is always on, and points directly at the tower. I also use a temperature monitor for my hard drive: HDD Thermometer, which tells me that my hard drive is running at a cool 98°F. It also keeps a log that tells me that it hasn't gone above 128° today, even though I've been using the computer all day.
One other check you might do is go into your computer's BIOS and look at the voltage readings of the 3.3v, 5v, and 12v. If they are really high or really low (+/-.3v, +/-.5v, or +/-0.5v respectively), then you might indeed have a power supply problem.
BTW, once or twice a year, use compressed air to clean out the dust inside your computer. It really helps!
