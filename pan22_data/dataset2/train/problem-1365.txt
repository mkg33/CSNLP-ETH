Though it is against Apple's policy, you can install OS X into a virtual machine and develop an app that way. And if you can manage it, you technically can write the code and such on a Windows machine; it is, of course, only text. But the compiler, SDK, etc. is completely OS X-only.
I was looking for a solution to develop apps on Windows. In the end I bought a Mac mini and I am glad I did. The Mac and the develop tools are working just fine. The time I saved figuring out configuring Windows/Virtual machines/OSX and so on I spent on actually developing Apps.
However, you have to code your app/game in ActionScript but you can extends the AIR SDK functionality through Adobe Native Extension (ANE).
Airplay SDK claims to allow you to develop in Visual Studio on a Windows PC.  I have not tried it out, so no idea how well it works.
You can also look into other ways to make iPhone games, such as the Unity engine, or Flash (I know at one point they compiled to iPhone games, I think they have since discontinued that)
