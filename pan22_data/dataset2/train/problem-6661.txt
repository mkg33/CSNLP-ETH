I have a folder "abc". I create a symlink: ln -s abc abclink. but then, whan I type, cd abclink it says "No such file or directory".
Since I wrapped this variable in quotes when creating the symlink, the tilde did not go through bash expansion, and so the resulting symlink pointing to the literal path ~/project rather a project folder in my home directory. 
Usually when you run into that, your target is invalid.  i.e. abc doesn't exist.  Yes, you can create symlinks to things that don't exist.
Either escape the spaces in the path with backslashes, or enclose the unescaped path in quotes, not both.
A possible source of this problem: if the target directory contains spaces, you don't need to put quotes around the value inserted by hitting the Tab key, because the Terminal escapes the spaces with backslashes for you.
How could the symlink and the folder it's pointing to both exist, but I can't actually use the symlink? 
I had an extra confusing use case which is ultimately the same as the accepted answer—the destination directory didn't exist—but with an extra twist.
