I really like mailcleaner - great spam filtering "appliance" that is easy to configure and opensource.
Pentaho Data Integration is probably my favorite tool ever.  It's an etl tool with job level scheduling functionality and a remote server agent.  I've used it to move data, manage processes, schedule regular running jobs, send myself reminder emails.  Oh, and because it's open source and extremely well coded, it's pretty trivial to add new features that can do just about anything.
For WAN acceleration Riverbed Steelhead appliance are great.  Also provide a platform for branch servcies like print, DNS, DHCP and other more advanced applications.  You can even run a Windows or other OS on the appliance while it is doing teh WAN acceleration task
esva / global domination anti spam filter, works really great, but project is not so much alive as one could hope for.
virtual appliance would be aep network netilla.  it's an ssl vpn that runs great in a virtual appliance.  we've had a physical appliance for close to 10 years and just upgraded to a virtual appliance.  it doesn't require ie and will also work on a mac which is rare for ssl vpns.  
Also like the Symantec Mail Security appliance.  Now available as a VM from what I have seen.  Simple to install and high accuracy.  Also allows AV at gateway and management of data "leakage"  Downside is the license fees but they work great
physical appliance would have to be riverbed.  it works wonders for a WAN with very little interaction.
