I've been very happy letting the Zune software manage these for me, though I must admit I've not given it very many photos.  
For photos, I use iMatch to manage hierarchical categories (people, places, etc.) and write the categories and other metadata back to IPTC tags in the files themselves, which are usually in a year-month-day directory hierarchy.
For music I prefer my own directory structure, which right now is structured like: "...\O\Orbit, William\William Orbit [2009-06] My Oracle Lives Uptown\".  I get the appeal of the "just tag everything and let iTunes sort it out!" approach but it doesn't work too well if you want to get at your music from other applications (media extenders, etc.).  I do most of my organizing in MediaMonkey, but it doesn't support some of the tags I want to manage so I have to supplement it with extra tagging in iTunes itself.  Keep hoping they'll fix that someday, 'cause I really do like MediaMonkey, but I also like seeing albums show up in the right order on my iPod.
Google Picasa can arrange your photos into folders according to the year, month and week taken. Sometimes it can be really good, but when you are searching for a picture manually it can be hard to find exactly what you are looking for.
Like Andy, I use iTunes to manage my music. I have set iTunes to automatically organise the mp3s into folders according to the artist and album.
