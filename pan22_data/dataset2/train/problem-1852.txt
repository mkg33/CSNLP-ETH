Since it was launched Q1-09 i'd lean towards PC3-14400. You could ask whoever you are buying it from to verify this.
Also you never stated whether you need DDR2 or DDR3. The Intel site says DDR3-800 not DDR-800. There is a difference. Anyway, it is what the motherboard manufacturer says that matters, not Intel, because it is possible to make a DDR2 motherboard for an otherwise DDR3 spec'ed processor.
Although JEDEC does specify DDR3-800 (PC3-6400) as being a standard part, I've never seen them "in the wild".
The best course of action is to find out what the motherboard manufacturer recommends, or has qualified, as correct memory for the motherboard. Most manufacturers list actual part numbers for qualified memory, and will provide better support if that is what you are using if you have problems.
Newegg specializes in PC and Gaming components. Your servers probably require ECC memory. Newegg's inventory of ECC memory has always been incomplete.
I bought a ZOTAC mini PC ZBOXSD-ID12-PLUS, and it states it uses DDR3-800. Tried looking for the ram as well, and had no luck. luckily it came with 1 GB ram, so I opened the PC up, and surprise they are using a DDR3-1066 (8500). So that's what DDR3-800 is.
