This doesn't actually answer your question, but if you upgrade to hardy and wait six months you'll be able to upgrade straight to Lucid. (LTS to LTS direct upgrades are supported)
If you have used any non-official repositories you should disable those, and note any packages that came from the non-official locations.  If you have manually compiled anything you should make sure you have notes for that.
They explicitly recommend against skipping versions during an upgrade.  Assuming that advice is sound, you have a long road ahead.  I would start with looking through the general UpgradeNotes, and then drill down into the individual steps you may have to take.
There is no supported direct upgrade path.  You will need to upgrade from gutsy -> hardy -> intrepid -> jaunty -> karmic.
It will probably be easier to simply make a full backup, reinstall clean, and then reconfigure the system and restore your data.
I tend to do clean reinstalls (backup / format / install / restore) whenever possible. It's a great opportunity to get rid of all the crap that inevitably accumulates on any system.
As long as you are going to be doing a full backup anyway, the better route may be to just do a fresh install of Karmic.
If you don't have a full backup you should make one before you start.  A lot of changes have been made between gutsy and karmic.   Things are likely to break, and you'll have to adjust configurations to fix things.
