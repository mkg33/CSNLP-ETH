By following the recommendations https://www.starwindsoftware.com/blog/vmware-vcenter-server-appliance-homelab-tips I have already lowered from 8 to about 7Gb RAM by disabling updates, vsan health service, dump collector and HTML5 UI. Is there anything else can be tweaked? 
vSphere Cluster is 3x HPE DL380 G8 with 128GB RAM on board connected to 3PAR. The total number of running VMs is over 60. Although the vCSA deployment size is Tiny meaning there should be the enough resources to maintain the production, the project I currently work on requires the installation of over than 50 VMs more. Therefore, I need to ensure the vCSA configuration could handle the desired workload until we are ready to update the vCSA configuration. 
I would recommend to disable also VMware Performance Charts and VMware Content Library Service. Check the list in the source to disable more unused service in your configuration.
