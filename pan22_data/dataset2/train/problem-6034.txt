When testing, make sure you've compared different options of ext3 logging - they may be quite different in terms of performance (writeback logging gave best result in my Postmark experiments).
1) Postmark - it's a benchmark which emulates real-world usage of a filesystem accessed by a busy mail server.
You have to google for it as I'm not allowed any more hyperlinks yet - the project itself is hosted on SourceForge, and a really nice quick start guide is found on OpenSolaris.org website.
While bonnie++ is primarily focused on bench-marking performance it does work above the filesystem.  It performs some tests that give different results per-filesystem.  I suspect you are probably interested in the change in performance related to EFS as well, so you may want to try that at least as one of your tests.
My first answer would also be bonnie++, a quick search also reveals Iozone3. Both are available as Debian packages. If you do simpler tests (cp, mv, rm), you should consider clearing the cache kept by the kernel with echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches before each test otherwise it might cause differences that are not representative of the filesystem itself.
2) Filebench - another great benchmark, giving you even more flexibility. If you have a specific reason for considering a move from ext3, you'll probably like filebench - it has many different workloads so that you can only concentrate on the performance bottleneck which interests you (file create/delete operations or sequential read/write vs random ones, to give you a few examples).
One final note: be sure to spread the load across as many disks (spindles) as possible for the most accurate results. It also makes sense to allocate a few disks for benchmarking specifically, and newfs them before each run of your benchmark.
