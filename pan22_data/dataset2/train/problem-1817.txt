Check virtual network mode in Networking Options of your Parallels Desktop. It shouldn't be "Networking is not required" for sure.
Because I am required to work with MSSQL via PHP, I have installed Parallels Desktop and run Server 2008 R2 on it. I am using the same mixed mode authentication which I previously had on windows.
Probably worth confirming MS SQL is listening on ports 1433 & 1434, or whatever it might have been overriden to in the registry.
I have tried running PHP on the XP install with parallels, and using the hostname as COMPUTERNAME\SQLEXPRESS, LOCALIP\SQLEXPRESS localhost localip etc, PHP never finds the server.
When I attempt to connect to the server with PHP using either a new test file or my old code, it just doesn't find the server.
Also note that I can connect to the database server using Management Studio without problems, so SQL Server is running.
Seems "Bridged Ethernet" mode it's only your option. Both your Mac and virtual Windows will have own separate IP addresses in this mode and you can communicate between virtual PCs. 
If there's nothing listening in the netstat cmd above you may need to activate one of the virtual machines network options in order to make a local connection work. Bit of a guess there as i've never setup a vm without having one of the network options active.
