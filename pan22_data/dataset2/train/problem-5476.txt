If that's not what you're trying to achieve please clarify your question because it is a little ambiguous. Hope that helps.
So go to your local user management an add him to the group of the remote server. This implies that you have the Domain-Admin password at hand to be allowed to do that.
Assuming your VPS is remote - do you have some type of VPN access to it? If so, that should suffice but you would always have to have the connection established. I would check with your ISP to see what they recommend for remote access to a SQL Server. If not, you could look to setup on the Win2K8 VPS but you would likely need to open up a handful of ports on the firewall.
How can I connect to a remote instance of SQL Server (on my VPS) from my local machine using Windows Authentication?
If I understand you correctly you want to be able to run your SQL management tools using credentials from your VPS rather than your local machine. You can use the runas command using the /netonly switch. This authenticates you remotely rather than locally, allowing you to run programs using credentials your local computer can't authenticate (e.g. those on a remote computer or domain). E.g.:
To achieve what you want your local user must be member of the domain of your VPS. I currently have no MS-SQL installation at hand, but there should be a user-group at your VPS named something like "SQL-Server-Remote-Access". So your local user must be a member of that group.
Do I have to set up my computer as a user on my VPS somehow? If this is possible, please could someone provide very simple instructions as to how I could do this as I am very much a beginner!
By default, if I try to connect using this method, the username is my computer name but this user isn't associated with the remote instance of SQL Server.
