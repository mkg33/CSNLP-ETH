You need to set up either a reverse proxy (so that the webserver at oursite.com will proxy content from oursitelabs.com) or you could set up a 302 for those urls at oursite.com so they get redirected to the appropriate oursitelabs.com.   Another possibility would be to do something tricky with frames on oursite.com so that it 'frames' the content from oursitelabs.com. Or do something funky with having the oursite.com page request content from oursitelabs.com via AJAX. The effects in each case are slightly different, but they'll all work to some degree.
What you are asking for is not really easy without adding extra components. The reverse is very easy. It really would be much simpler to point the DNS entry to the Centos server and have Apache proxy the requests for the IIS server.
There appear to be a few options like ISAPI_Rewrite available for IIS itself, but I do not have any actual experience using them.
I would install Apache 2.2 for Windows on that server, set up on port 80.  I would then move IIS to another port (81?) and set up mod_proxy rules on a per-request basis.  If they request /media-relations/, then proxy the requests to your CentOS/labs machine.  If they request all else, proxy the requests to http://localhost:81/.
