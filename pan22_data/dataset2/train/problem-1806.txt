I fixed the problem by telling /etc/resolv.conf not to search the offending domain.  At this point smbclient -L started working and so did remote mounts from Nautilus.
As Tync said, m$ may have introduced some patches that effect the compatibility between windows and samba.
These are only guesses based on logical conclusions. If possible, try running an outdated XP on a virtual machine and list its shares: if this works, I'm right :)
Currently there's a problem with accessing Windows 7 shares: they've changes something in the protocol, and Linux Samba is no more compatible. I guess they've released a patch for XP that makes it incompatible too: this was made to make Win7 shares accessible to XP and vice versa.
OK, it turns out the problem was with the Samba smb.conf configuration file.  The NetBIOS name of my wife's machine happened to coincide with the hostname of a machine on a network searched in my /etc/resolv.conf.  For some reason Samba requests and Nautilus were going to this machine instead of to the machine on the local net.
Also I've read that Samba developers are currently negotiating with M$ about the new protocol, and soon we'll see a patch that makes Samba compatible again.
I've Googled this error message and have determined that a lot of people have similar problems, but I can't find a workaround.  I suspect my wife has to grant some sort of access or permission on the Windows side.  Any suggestions?
When reading the smbclient man page, you will see that you can provide both a username and password. This can be done by:
I want to find out about the Windows XP "shares" on my wife's windows machine by browsing from my Linux machine using Samba.  I am relatively clueless about both windows and samba.  I tried a basic operation from the command line and got this error:
