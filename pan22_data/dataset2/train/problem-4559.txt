If you are talking about passwords for websites, etc. then I recommend using the Firefox extension XMarks.  All you have to do is install it on every computer and it will synchronize passwords as well as bookmarks.
There are a couple of great devices for password management (http://mylok.ii2p.com/ and Roboform) . I'm constantly traveling and I've found them more useful when I'm hopping from computer to computer.
Roboform has an online capability, not only can you sync but my understanding is that you can access the stuff on their site without having the client installed (say, someone else's computer.)
The latest version has built in sync option so you can setup a local ftp server or a network share and use keepass. Network share might be simpler as keepass implements its on file locking mechanism so it will tell you if someone else is using the password database. It also has many ports so you can even put it on ur mobiled phone, home computer (ftp sync), etc..
Firefox with Firefox Sync (also known as Weave) is good for that. Remote storage is encrypted; the encryption password is separate from your Weave credentials.
