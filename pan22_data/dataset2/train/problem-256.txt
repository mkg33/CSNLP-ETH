The Model M class of keyboards, historically made by IBM and now by Unicomp, are incredible from an ergonomy point of view.
I've got a bunch of Kinesis ergonomic keyboards and am currently typing this (on my iMac) on a Kinesis Advantage. Great keyboard, especially if you're suffering from RSI or similar, works fine with my Mac and even comes with Mac key caps.
Any keyboard (for the most part) will work in a Mac thats USB. The only difference is that the Windows key becomes the Command key, Alt becomes Option and are reversed from the Mac standard. If this isn't a problem, then go for any keyboard you would want.
Nobody's recommended the Microsoft Natural line yet?  The MS Natural 4000 is truly the Cadillac of keyboards... pleather palmrests, good key action, extremely sturdy and well-built.  There is also a native Mac driver for mapping command/ctrl/alt, hotkeys, etc., but the keyboard will still work as a standard USB device without it.
Unicomp now makes them with USB interface.  They have a PC layout, so you'll need to swap Option and Command in System Preferences on the Mac.  They may be able to customize what's printed on the keys for you if you ask.
It's certainly a pleasure to type on, but has caused my Mac to crash so often now that it's impractical to use if I want to get any work done at all.
