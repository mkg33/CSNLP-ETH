SmokePing provides long-term storage and visualization for various tests including latency and packet loss.  Perhaps it would be useful for UNIX/Linux users.
Comcast is probably unaware of your service issue. Provided you find a decent contact with their support, they might be able to resolve your issue.
Or is it that you appear to have connectivity but you can't seem to connect to anything ... web sites, mail servers and the like?  In that case, next time it's working right, look up the IP address for a site, then next time the service seems to be out, try connecting to the IP address rather than the www.whatever.xyz address. If it works with the IP address but not with the "friendly" name, it's likely a DNS problem at the ISP end.  There are alternate DNS providers you could try in your internet settings to get around this one, at least temporarily.  
Does the connection go away altogether?  Assuming that there's some kind of "Connected" indicator LED on your modem, does it stay lit or not?  Is there a pattern to when it comes and goes?
If you want to monitor your connection, you can set up mrtg. You can even point your ISP to it. But I doubt that'll help. If your provider doesn't treat you fair as a consumer, just quit using its services if you have alternatives.
this will generate a traceroute and you/they can identify if the flakiness is local to you, on their network, or the backbone network.
It tests your internet connection every 10 seconds. If you login, it can aggregate results and you can generate a report with connectivity % for the last days or month.
