A physical button somewhere either down the sides or on the front of the laptop which can toggle Wireless on and off.
Have you Tried Fn+F4? The Fn key is usually blue and close to the space bar, if this does not work than maybe your wireless card has become disconnected, in that case it should be easy enough for you to fix just look under you laptop where your battery, Ramm, and HDD are and you should see a wifi symbol or something similar, open that up and see if the two wire have become disconnected, it might be a software issue but i have a hunch it is hardware.
My internet worked perfectly fine until my rabbit jumped on my laptop, and I assume switched something and now my internet won't connect. I have has this happen before are just resolved it by hitting fn f4 but for some reason that's not working!! I have a dell XPS using windows 7! Please help
