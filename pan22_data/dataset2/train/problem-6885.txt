Beyond that, when choosing a surrogate key you should use the simplest and smallest one which works for you.  This usually means an integer (IDENTITY).  Sometimes IDENTITY is an issue because of insert hot-spots, in which case a random integer may be necessary, but that is a special case.  
You should avoid using natural keys except under very specific circumstances.  A natural key is visible to a user and in most cases is subject to change or be duplicated.  You can deal with a primary key changing, but you don't want to.  An exception to this is something which is strongly regulated by an independent body, like country codes or currency codes.  In such cases the risk of a change may be worth the reward of keeping things a little simpler by using a natural key as a foreign key.
Please give me some advice for choosing the primary key from the three type identity column,or other choices.
If you create records in multiple (distinct) databases and then need to consolidate these records into a single table then you may want to use GUID as your primary key, since you don't have to worry about key collisions in the consolidated table with a GUID primary key.
