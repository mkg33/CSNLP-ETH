All of these are aliases for my mailbox.  Google Apps also makes this really easy to setup through their Apps for your Domain panel.  If it works for domain1.com and domain2.com, I don't see why it wouldn't work for subdomains as well like a.domain1.com and b.domain1.com, but it may involve making changes to your MX records.
That's it. As with anything in the AWS console, the steps can be automated (you could create a Lambda that just takes an input of someusername@somesubdomain.mydomain.com)
Is it correct that MX records can be set to direct email to all subdomains *.mydomain.com to one mail server?  Is that still true if there are also web sites at those subdomains (using A records)?
(Many examples I've seen talk about directing mail to user2@jones.mydomain.com into the same mail box as user2@mydomain.com - but this is not what I'm looking for.)
I haven't specified the server technology being used because I'm wondering if this is generally possible. If you know that server x can do this, please mention it in your answer!
As for the DNS question once you have any type of record for A.X.com then no wildcard will be consulted for any other type of record for A.X.com. Thus having an A record for a domain will prevent wildcard records from being used for the MX. This is documented in RFC 1034 section 4.3.3.
I've opened the sendmail can of worms but I don't want to eat them. If you don't already know how to configure sendmail then you shouldn't attempt this.
