It is possible but there are things that you can't make run on Windows Server like Media Center. Also make sure that audio configuration for server machine is different than on client machine - set the following:
Also be careful that some tools like Acronis True Image Home are meant to be used at home. What they mean by that is - client Windows OS. You will not be able to install such a tool on Windows Server. :-(
I've typically run a server OS on my laptops. Some software does a check and won't install unless it sees a server build (one of the SharePoint versions strikes me as one of the more recent exceptions). The only issues I've seen are for things like DVD playback and the Zune. 
It really depends on what your primary purpose is. But as indicated, drivers may indeed be an issue. In most cases the generic drivers work fine, but you won't get the advanced performance. If you're into media and graphics intensive games, it's probably not a good fit. If you're looking for more of a development platform, it'll probably work for you.
