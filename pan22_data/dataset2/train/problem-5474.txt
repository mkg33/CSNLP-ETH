A box will appear, with all sorts of useful information and at the top, what version of XP you are using, its Service Pack level and a few bits of Hardware information.
Right-click on 'My Computer' and click Properties, it will tell  you right at the top the version you are running.
This should be obvious, but I can't seem to locate or think of anything that would indicate clearly whether I'm using an XP server or a workstation. 
There's no such thing as Windows XP server, so it's doubtful you're using that. The server equivalent of XP is Server 2003
I suppose someone could be using an XP machine as a web server or a file server or even a print server.  Look at what processes are running.  Do you see any server-ish processes such as Apache?  What ports are open?  Is file and print sharing enabled?
I don't have an XP machine to get an example at the moment, but if you hit the start menu, select run and enter `winver' that application will also tell you what it is that you're running
Also, look at user accounts and shares.  Browse around on the machine a bit.  There should be some obvious tipoffs.
