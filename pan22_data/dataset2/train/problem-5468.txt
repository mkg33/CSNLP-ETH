Alternatively you could use SNMP. You can send an SNMP write to the device with the location of a config server using an TFTP URL or HTTP URL and setting the "Pull config" option via SNMP;
try to use rancid. techically its use ssh\telnet, to dump configs to the database, where you can see diffs of your configs, and one of the rancid modules is can be used to send commands to multiple devices:
(On reasonably modern HP switches) if you use SFTP to push and pull the configuration files, that avoids the need to issue commands to the command-line. Then you can use whatever CM tool you choose to template, delta, or whatever. You can, of course, push a bad set of changes really fast this way to multiple switches, so be careful if rolling your own system.
What protocol(s) can be used to programatically "push" configuration settings to Cisco/HP switches, over a network? Of course, I could write a program which would imitate what a human does when logging in by telnet/SSH, and then issue command-line commands. But I'm hoping there is a nicer way to do this.

(I'm sure I could find the answer through Google... if I just knew the right search keywords to try!)
