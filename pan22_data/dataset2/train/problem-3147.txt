Windows 10 has quite robust Speech Recognition. Set it up and activate it, then use these commands to control media:
You don't need to say the entire name of the software: switch media player is enough to switch to switch to Windows Media Player; switch cast is enough to switch to Windows' Cast to Device media casting tool.
As others have said, AutoHotkey can help in this case greatly. For example, this script will remap Previous/Next buttons to Winkey + < / >, Volume Down/Up to Winkey+ [ / ] and Mute Toggle to Winkey+ \ . For Play/Pause, Space bar works anyway by default in YouTube by default and in desktop players like MPC-HC / MPC-BE / VLC. Just for Windows Media Player, you can remap Ctrl+P (default for Play-Pause) to Space.
I found one app which can do almost all of them in windows 7 and it works without any issues when your desktop is unlocked. Also it is pretty easy to use. 
To find out what commands you can use in an open window, you can hover over the buttons with your mouse, and check the tooltips. If there's no tooltip, you can say show numbers, and a matrix of numbers will overlay over any actionable elements on your screen.
This isn't a complete answer to your question since it is likely too specific but it may contain some useful information so I am passing it along:
I found that "Snip" software not only displays current song played but also allows you to control your player. It currently supports: Spotify, iTunes, Winamp, foobar2000, VLC, Google Play Music Desktop Player, Quod Libet
Only drawback I found is it will not work when desktop is locked say I come back from sleep and the computer is locked and I have loud music playing. Multimedia keyboards can mute from there itself. But with this app you need to unlock first.
