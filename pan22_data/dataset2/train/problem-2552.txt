In theory, I would send a packet with gradually increasing intervals until the connection is lost. Any tools that might help (free or open source would be best, but I'm open to other suggestions)?
Network admins reported the timeout is set to 60 minutes, but this is clearly not the case. The remote side gets a connection closed much sooner, but outbound connections will just hang on my side.  This is very frustrating for outbound connections for which the remote side has to think for a bit before responding (svn update, ftp with large remote directories, etc.)
Assuming I have machines on both sides of the firewall between which I can make a connection, is there a way to measure what the time limit on TCP connections might be for this firewall?  
A new (NAT) firewall appliance was recently installed at $WORK. Since then, I'm getting many network timeouts and interruptions, especially for operations which would require the server to think for a bit without a response (svn update, rsync, etc.). Inbound SSH sessions over VPN also timeout frequently.
I probably should have used likely intervals plus a few seconds, but I'm pretty sure the timeout is between 240 and 300 seconds.
That clearly suggests I need to adjust the TCP (and ssh) keepalive time on the servers in question in order to reduce these errors. 
The appliance is not under my control, so I can't just get the value, though I am attempting to ask what it currently is and if I can get it increased.
I tried making an ssh outbound connection, but I had to do more than just let it sit there. Without interaction, it will appear valid indefinitely, but it will stop accepting input after a certain idle time.
