this should work. 1. Make a cube object. 2. Add a rgidBody to it. 3. Drrag the camera under it(child it). 4. On the cube, click the freeze restrain's arrow. This reveals 6 toggles. 5. Click the z of the bottom row, OR, the way your plane is rotating(by the x,y, or z axis). 6. Drag the cube that contains the camera under the plane object. 7. Now hit play and the cube won't rotate, and neither will the camera, and you can see the plane rotate.
Seems to me the effect can be achieved by simply not parenting the camera and using a script to do the same with addition of smoothness, that way the camera will be abit behind the rotation and then catch up, not instantly, and the rotation will seem more apparent.
When I attach a camera to my flying object (plane), when I rotate the object, the camera is perfectly following it so you can't really "feel" the plane rotating. I want to create the effect that you see in flying games where you see the plane rotating along the x axis (so you see the nose go up and tail down) while also semi-following the plane, creating a better effect.
