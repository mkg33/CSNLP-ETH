Seems you should assign a separate IP address for every HTTPS server or just use a SSL certificate with several names
All that #2 is doing is taking the long way to #1. If you don't require the logical separation that #2 provides, you should stick with #1.
Yes this is possible with and without virtualization. You're not limited to a single SSL site per server. With traditional technology, you're limited to a single SSL site (one certificate, potentially multiple sites...) per IP address.
SNI is changing that, allowing multiple certificates basically by sending the Host header before negotiating SSL or TLS. It is not widely adopted yet, and you really can't rely on John Public to have the necessary technology (though for internal use you might be able to control the environment enough to make it work reliably).
2) In a virtualized environment, each of your VMs will have different IPs and hostnames, they won't share an IP with the host in most circumstances.
1) The most widely supported SSL implementations require 1 certificate per IP not per host. You can have a single server with multiple IPs and host different sites on each IP and assign different SSL certs to each without issue.
