I have also seen it used in an NFV context where the traffic entering/leaving a NFV stack. North/South (entering and leaving a virtual router) and traffic between modules at the same layer in the same physical infrastructure is referred to as East/West, i.e. Routing within the same physical box.
I found the definitions from Microsoft Technet(https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/tip_of_the_day/2016/06/29/tip-of-the-day-demystifying-software-defined-networking-terms-the-cloud-compass-sdn-data-flows/) very useful:
North/South - Meaning traffic coming into and out of the network into Internet space, i.e in and out of edge firewalls and/routers.
Generally speaking, "east-west" traffic refers to traffic within a data center -- i.e. server to server traffic.  "North-south" traffic is client to server traffic, between the data center and the rest of the network (anything outside the data center).
I believe the terms have come into use from the way network diagrams are typically drawn, with servers or access switches spread out horizontally, and external connections at the top or bottom.
East/West - Traffic internal to the network that doesn't leave, i.e. LAN client to server and server to server communications. 
North South traffic is usually considered from end users to the internet, where traditionally organizations used to have fat links to end user and thin links to the external connectivity. In the recent times, the traffic patterns have changed drastically and more traffic is generated inside the data center in a server to server communication which is referred as east west traffic.
