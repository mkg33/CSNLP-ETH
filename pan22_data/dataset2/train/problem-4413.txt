At my university we have super fast LAN internet in the hostels, but no WiFi available. Many students have used their laptops to create Hotspots, but they face the penalty of a fine should they ever be caught. My question is whether there is a way to spoof the network/create a hotspot that cannot be discovered. 
I think that you cannot really hide such a "hotspot". You can only make it more difficult to see. Depending on the skill of the administrators and technicians, and depending on the time they spend, they will find it. 
The IT technicians are obviously very secretive about the way their system works, but from what we can figure out is that they walk through the hostels and search for WiFi hotspots. When they find one that isn't theirs, they attempt to connect, and by doing so uncover the IP behind the network, pointing to the physical computer and port which it is connected to, and they shut it off. 
PS: I'm not the most tech savvy person when it comes to hardware, so please excuse any incompetence.
Is this a possible way of doing so, or could they monitor the traffic on the physical port and flag a hotspot according to that? And is there any way to get around either of these scenarios?
