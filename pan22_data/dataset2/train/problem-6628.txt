Download a Simplenote client that supports importing from Evernote and also supports exporting to text files. Here's a list of Simplenote clients to choose from. 
On OSX, I then use textutil -convert txt and then pipe through uni2ascii to handle any unicode characters.  On other operating systems, you can probably substitute Pandoc for textutil.
There's a rich API you can use to get access to the data. See for example https://github.com/dvj/clevernote which  uses the api to provide a command line interface to evernote. It converts the evernote markup to markdown, which is easy on the eyes, but still maintains the overall note structure. 
I recommend you start by using the Export to HTML feature of Evernote.  This obtains a directory full of HTML files, one per note.
Apologies for the self-post, but I've written a PHP script to try to address this exact shortcoming.  It's called enex-dump.  It will take an ENEX export and spit out a folder containing plain text files (any formatting/attachments get discarded).  Command line usage is unfortunately required, but it should run on any platform that supports PHP, which is most of them.
