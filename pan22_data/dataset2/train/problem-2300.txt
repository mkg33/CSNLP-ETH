Since I've undone all the changes from within VMware vSphere Client, what else is left for me to do?  Is there a file within ESXi that I could edit to clear this issue?
So I went ahead and removed the iSCSI drive from the ESXi host but I'm now running into problems.  I am unable to reconfigure the Lacie iSCSI drive size because it displays the following message: "iSCSI not available while a computer is connected to the target"
I have a "Lacie 5big Network 2" drive which is setup with RAID 5 and and 3.6TB of available space.  Using instructions from " http://www.techhead.co.uk/vmware-esxi-4-0-vsphere-connecting-to-an-iscsi-storage-target " I was able to add the device to the ESXi host.  Unfortunately it was only allowing me to use 1TB out of the 3TB which was dedicated to iSCSI.  I have no idea why.  This is another problem that I'm facing.
Thanks in advance to anyone who could help me resolve this issue.  If I'm not clear about anything that I've mentioned here please let me know and I'll clarify with more information.
