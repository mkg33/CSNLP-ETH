I don't have any scripts, but the built-in documentation is really easy to understand and very useful.
To solve the second problem, (the locked file error and subsequent wait), use the switches /r, /w and /reg, for example:  
robocopy "C:\test_source" "\server01\C$\test_destination" /L /V /E /LOG:"c:\test_robocopy.log" /R:10 /W:30
This means retry one time only after waiting one second and make these settings default in the registry.  
Its really so simple that most just do their own from scratch. I have never seen any "code samples", as its basically just a matter of from where, to where with some parameters thrown in... but have a look at the different robocopy GUIs out there (just google it), most of them will show you the generated command.
Start small, just copying a single folder from point a to point b.  Be sure to include the /L switch and the /LOG switch.  The /L switch just lists the files it would have copied and the /Log will create a log so you can verify what you want copied.  From there you just increase the complexity.  For an example script:
The linked script is a template that can used to copy open files. You can just change the copy command in the script to robocopy and you will be able to robocopy open files.
