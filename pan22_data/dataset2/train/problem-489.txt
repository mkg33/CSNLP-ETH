The oracle db connection uses an ldap lookup. On our demo server, it seems to be stuck waiting for an ldap connection to do something. Network team doesn't see any connection on the other side. Now, in netstat (from the zone I'm root), I definitely can see the connection as ESTABLISHED.
Now, some demo server which isn't too much used crashed (saw it this morning, could be a couple of days ago). It seems to have the same symptoms as our unexplained app crash:
My question is: how can a connection become ESTABLISHED, sitting there, waiting for something, and why can't they see anything from the other side.
The server is still in this state, so I can experiment on it (and give some more data) for some time (not too long).
Now, sometimes, things get wrong and our application stops working. I try to take a lot of traces whenever there is a problem:
I'm guessing that, if this can happen for an ldap connection, it could happen to anything (db connection, ...).
I work for some administration. We are responsible for app development, I'm personnaly responsible for the software application servers (Glassfish) and there is a team which manages the infrastructure (network, load balancer, oracle db, physical servers (Solaris on x86 machines)).
But, as it often happens in production, I don't have too much time and have to bounce the server asap.
