For incoming remote helpdesking and field office windows servers, I use ultraVNC, DynDNS and clever port forwarding. I don't use a proxy solution, but the ultraVNC people have got a package that makes it easier to roll your own.
- roll your own VNC setup for your Windows servers in field offices that do have a screen (and 'power'-user) attached to them
we use http://www.freeremotesupport.net . It is like Teamviewer, but it is completely free. And we assemble ourselves from a few opensource software. So can do you.
We use a Bomgar device.  It is an appliance that we have in our server room.  It is accessible to the outside network and a simply link on our website directs customers to it.  It enables full screen sharing and control.  see
so I tend to use whatever management app comes with the local distro, and I don't really need a proxy (we install a VPN client and 'showdesktop' icon/script on each computer).
We use Dameware Mini Remote Control. It works pretty well for everything we need to do with it. It has a ton of features we really don't use. But for a basic remote control program it works great.
We use ScreenConnect for our ad hoc remote support requirements - it works very well for us. Free to try. http://www.screenconnect.com/
