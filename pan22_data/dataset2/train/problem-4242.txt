I did an investigation of where writes to my SSD come from. I found the same thing you did. After analyzing logs of writes as well as thinking about things I realized that it is Firefox's crash recovery. In order to be able to recover from a crash Firefox has to write the session to disk. The session information is stored in the four files you listed. Firefox updates these every ~30 seconds. With lots of tabs in a big session this adds up to a few GB per day. 
There is a setting in Firefox that controls how often the session restore saves files.  Go to about:config and change:
It is perfectly normal for a browser to store changes to cookies and sessions to the disk. The data about which tabs you had open has to be kept somewhere. Your usr directory (I assume that is where Firefox stores those things) shouldn't be located on an SSD to begin with, move it to an HDD.
Perhaps someone has a compromised the machine and is using it for anonymous P2P or F2F networking with obfuscated and encrypted filesystems?  Like:
