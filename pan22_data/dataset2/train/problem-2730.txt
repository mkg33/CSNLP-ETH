If you know any cisco config, these will be a breeze and there is so much documentation. It is completely free and light weight and can have squid running on it and run DNS/DHCP.
The best thing about vyatta's is that there so simple to set up in a virtual environment (XenServer).
There are a number of ways to do this but I would suggest using one of the Linux firewall distros. I personally use Smoothwall Express (installed on an old PC) but there are others to choose from. Such a system will give you what you require, as well as a good firewall.
A layer 2 bridge will keep the interference on the network to a minimum. Just make sure you have a third interface with a Layer 3 address on the network or a serial connection for remote out of band administration.
This is also heavily dependent on what "more advance server admin stuff" you want to do. Will you be mangling packets in-transit? Then you'll have to make iptables rules as appropriate. Are you going to be filtering traffic based on content? Some DPI magic will need to be done, and the appropriate packages installed.
It also lets you do any NATing you might want to do and you can add another firewall to your network.
You need a bridge, containing both your interfaces. It must be a transparent bridge, passing through everything including ARP-packets.
I would design the Linux machine to be a transparent Squid bridge that merely passes Layer 2 traffic.
