If the SOA's of all the domains are going to be the same, just put the SOA in a separate file, db.soa or something, and then include it in each zone:
Since the bind zone format is pretty flexible any simple text manipulation tools might be a bit dangerous.
I've a BIND9 server with a lot of zones and I need to increase the serial number of the zone files by one. Some zones are using the YYYYMMDDXX format but other zones just increase it by one, as they are dynamic DNS zones, so updating all by one would do the job for me.
That way there's only one place to have to increment.  Also, depending on exactly how you're implementing whatever all you're doing, it may make more sense to use UNIX epoch time as the serial instead of incrementing by one each time.  You could create a script, say touch-zones.sh that would overwrite the db.soa file and use the current unix timestamp in the serial. all zones would then by inclusion have their serials incremented.
I've used a utility called h2n to manipulate BIND zone files. I first learned about it the O'Reilly DNS and BIND book. You want the "-y" option.
One method to accomplish your goal, might be to enable dynamic updates for all your zones, with acls limiting access from the local machine only.  Then simply add add, and then remove a temporary record in each zone with nsupdate.  Bind will deal with updating the serial for you.
