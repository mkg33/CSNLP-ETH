I just had this problem. I copied all other files seperately and left the install.wim until last. When I did this I walked away. It took about 5-10mins but copied successfully.
I know this thread is a bit old, but in case anybody has this issue.  My ISB flash drive is 130gb and formated ntfs and boots to Win PE 4.0. I still had the Error that install.wim was too large to move over. so I simply copied the .iso over to the flash drive and used 7Zip to extract to a folder booted to WinPE dropped to D Drive and went into teh Win7x64 folder and ran setup. OS installed
I'm sorry to revive an old thread but I didn't find a good answer on here. I'd like to share how I achieved this.
The 2000 at the end of the final command above limits the output .swm files to 2000MB. You can make this smaller / larger if you want; I used 2000 because of no particular reason.
You cannot copy install.wim to a FAT32 partition, because FAT32 partitions do not allow files larger than 4 GB and the install.wim file is (slightly) larger than 4 GB. You can recompress the install.wim with "wimlib-imagex" with compression level "solid" using the following command:
Then, instead of copying install.wim onto the USB, copy all of the install.swm files. For me, as mine is a little over 4GB, I had 3 of them. Make sure there is no install.wim remaining on the USB drive (only the .swm files) and voila.
If unetbootin doesn't work, as @Dennis suggested, try YUMI (similar to unetbootin/universal USB installer). I can give it a .iso of a windows installer and a thumb drive, and it works like a charm. If it can't, it usually gives informative error messages.
