If your iptables is completely blank (apart from the masquerade statement) then you likely need to add a FORWARDING chain to permit traffic through the box.  Try starting from a known working config-
The key to make this work is to create separate routing tables for the different interfaces, and tell the networking stack to use these routing tables instead of the default one.
In a typical configuration, a local network uses one of the designated "private" IP address subnets. A router on that network has a private address in that address space. The router is also connected to the Internet with a "public" address assigned by an Internet service provider. As traffic passes from the local network to the Internet, the source address in each packet is translated on the fly from a private address to the public address. The router tracks basic data about each active connection (particularly the destination address and port). When a reply returns to the router, it uses the connection tracking data it stored during the outbound phase to determine the private address on the internal network to which to forward the reply.
