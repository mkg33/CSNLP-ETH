There is one recommendation for hardening that seem to be a Bad Idea(TM) in EC2. That one is CIS section 2.3.1.1, Ensure 'Accounts: Administrator account status' is set to 'Disabled'
This is referring to the default admin account called Administrator. You will want to create a new local admin account that does not have the username "Administrator" and then you can safely disable the account named "Administrator." The spirit of CIS 2.3.1.1 is to remove this default account and create something unique to your company and not use the default username provided by the EC2 instance. 
I'm doing some system hardening, using recommendations from CIS. (For reference, the PDF is titled "CIS Microsoft Windows Server 2016 RTM (Release 1607) Benchmark" and can be downloaded here: https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/microsoft_windows_server/ )
In EC2, you can't boot to safe mode. There's no physical console. The only recovery option available is "Directory Services Restore Mode" which isn't the same as Safe Mode.
