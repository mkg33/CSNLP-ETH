Octoparse is a great free web scraping tool. I used it to scrape Linkedin data successfully, and here is a detailed video tutorial to extract data from Linkedin. 
BeautifulSoup does not work on LinkedIn. Scrappy violates policies. Octoparse is only for Windows. Is there another way? I want to extract Similar People data for a person's account. Please help!
I would also go with beautifulsoup, if you know python. In case you rather code javascript/JQuery (and you are familiar with node.js), you may want to checkout CoffeeScript (Check out the Tutorial) I already used it successfully on several occasions for scraping web pages.
This is an example of a scraper which I built with it for a personal project, which can iterate over web pages.
Beautiful Soup is specifically designed for web crawling and scraping, but is written for python and not R:
lxml is a nice web scrapping library in Python. Beautiful Soup is a wrapper over lxml.  So, lxml is faster than both scrapy and beautiful soup and has a much easier learning curve.
