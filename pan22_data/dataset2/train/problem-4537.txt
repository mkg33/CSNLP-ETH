I recently had a similar problem trying to install Debian and also Ubuntu from a (Lexar 128GB) flash drive. I checked the image integrity and it was fine but every time I'd try to install it would tell me that the image was faulty and quit. I eventually loaded (the same) image onto a DVD and used an optical drive and it worked fine. Not sure if this is a possible workaround for you but it worked for me. 
Error code is 256; my machine is amd phenom ii asus m5a78l-m based. I am using bootable flash drive.
You can have a better clue checking the logs. According to fedora documentation, logs are in the following location during installation:
You can take a look on if the supposed to be missing file is there on the installation shell prompt (Alt-F2)
Error code 256 is no more mirrors to try. So anaconda is trying to get the file on all it's options.
Description of error is packages/xfs...noarch.rmp couldn't be taken from anaconda. I tried two different images and my flash drive is sandisk 8gb; bootable created by following redhat installation guide dd command.
Maybe the kickstart file mentioned a file that is not or should not be there, maybe the package is missing.
If you think any of these may be helpful, please detail the whole missing package name. Any of the potential workaround I mentioned here are complex enough to be a whole question itself with it's full thread of answers.
Anyway maybe the best option is asking RedHat support for the missing package if it is really missing and put it on place (maybe is there, but corrupted)
Eventually, you can add the missing file to the installation disk (that is a dirty solution but help me out when I had a similar problem in the past) or you can remove the file in the installation list (this is far more complicated)
Then, as I don't know the full rpm file you are lacking, you may take a look on if it is available here:
