Also if nothing will work for my case, just let me know. That's a reality that I'm also mentally prepared for. Any input whatsoever is appreciated.
As the Sway app has no off line features anymore I would go for using the web site directly instead.
Instead, I would simply like to find a simple work-around that does not involve the windows store. I would like to just get a stand-alone install of sway and manually place it on my windows 10 device. Here is what I tried:
What if I found a friend who had a functional windows store; could I then download on my friends device, then transfer the set up on my device? I would just try that and test it on my own, but I'd rather not pester people unless I know things would pan out.
If I should not pursue the 2nd approach, is there another approach that could work? One thought came to mind:
I realize that the conventional way to download sway is from the windows store. Of course I wouldn't be here if that way worked. Unfortunately for me, my windows store on my windows 10 device is terribly bugged and despite many factory resets and tinkering, the windows store crashes every time before it even loads. I think this issue is too big to be resolved given what I have time for.
