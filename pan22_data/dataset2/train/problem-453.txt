When you say crash, if you mean physically damage, then that is highly unlikely - It would really require there to be a significant hardware fault, and in that cause your computer would likely be heading for a failure anyway.
Ultimately, though, it's going to be hit an miss. Computers do crash, even when not overloaded, overloading them makes it more likely but not certain.
Yes, it could happen.  However, no, it's not supposed to.  If the equipment has a weak point, you may well find it.  If it's all up to spec though, it shouldn't be a problem.
Also, if your program is using 100% of the CPU, this could also indicate that your computer may not be up to the task, which could cause the program itself to fail.
If you genuinely have the CPU nailed at 100% then there will be very little opportunity for your operating system to perform the little house-keeping tasks it would normally run periodically and so over time your computer could start to malfunction.
If you mean cause the software, or operating system to stop functioning correctly, or stop all together then that is more possible.
