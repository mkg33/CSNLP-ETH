If however your current user has been bogged down with lots of applications that start-up - only for that user - then creating a new one is a perfectly valid solution to that problem; seeing as it would require the least amount of work.
Your best option no matter what you decide is to enable user account control.  This will help to prevent changes on your system that require administrative rights without your knowledge.
Will I be better off (security wise) creating a new standard account instead of changing the type of my current admin account? And if so I would like to know why. 
I would like to downgrade my Windows 7 admin account to be a standard account, mostly for the added security benefits. I will have another admin account in case I need to install or update softwares. 
The only reason I can fathom for creating a new user would be if the current one has been compromised, in which case the entire system could be compromised. So creating a new user would likely be a placebo for a solution.
The method I use at home and on the work network is to rename the administrator account and create an additional standard account.
