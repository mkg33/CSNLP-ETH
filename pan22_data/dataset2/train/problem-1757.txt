I was quite impressed with the organisation & categories of the Ubuntu (9.04) menus - they seemed well thought out so might be worth looking at.
These are the only folders I have in the Start Menu (no subfolders) and I try and keep only one shortcut for each application in these folders (no ReadMe/Help or Uninstall shortcuts - they're just clutter to me).
Here are the categories I have in my my Windows 7 Start Menu at the moment. Some of them could perhaps be removed (Ease of Access, which I don't have any use for), some could be merged (Maintenance into Administration).
I've found that what every way you try to organize your dock, it's all still clumsy. For me, starting to use QuickSilver was a revelation because it wasn't necessary anymore to organize anything. All you do to start a programm is to call up QS (Ctrl-Space on my system), enter the program name with a learning incremental search feature, press enter and the program launches. It's always much faster then to select the program in the Dock or the Applications folder. Of course, that is my personal preference on this. Unfortunately, I've not yet found a program like Quicksilver for Windows that works nearly as good.
