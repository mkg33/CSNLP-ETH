Well-written programs that expect to be installed with privileged execution permissions should validate that they have not been started in an insecure configuration, to prevent themselves being used as avenues for damaging a system, and will not run with incorrect permissions or ownership.  Ensuring that this behavior is part of the code is part of the security auditing performed during the release of many major software projects, both open and closed source.
To answer your question "why", the answer is that many of these binaries (most notably ssh and sudo) require the setuid bit to be set, and you cleared it.
2) Execute a command on that server to output the full path of every file and its permissions. For example:
4) Pipe that into a script that sets those permissions. Ignore errors due to non-existing files. For example:
I know this is a huge security issue etc. but I think it's really weird a lot of my services stopped working (MySQL, SSH, Node) and most importantly sudo probably others aswell. I don't want to reinstall the entire server and I also don't have a ubuntu backup. I don't really care about the security issues, I just want to get the services especially MySQL running again since this is a test server anyway.
