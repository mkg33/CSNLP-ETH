Windows 7 on my lap top.  I have a Sprint 3G/4G wireless.  I'll connect to the internet and it shows a strong connection.  But I will not be able to access the internet.  Not just to my wifi, but any wifi.  Like last night I was at a Flying J trucks stop and attempted to connect to their internet.  Tells me the same thing.  Load a page and it says "HTTP No Response".  
If that fails, you can clear out your wireless settings by uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers in Device Manager.  Just right-click on the driver and choose uninstall.  And then from the Action menu choose "Scan for Hardware Changes".  You will need to re-setup your wireless network, because this will erase all settings and passwords.
I'm not a computer whiz so this is all outta my league.  When this happens, what do I do to repair it?  Also, it will show DENNISRYAN2 as the internet source instead of just DENNISRYAN.  I don't understand what the "2" is.
You can open the "network sharing center" by right-clicking the wireless connection's tray icon.  If there is a red x in there or yellow exclamation, click on it and Windows will attempt to troubleshoot the problem.  
It sounds as if you're trying to do two things at once. The Sprint cellular internet card and your WiFi shouldn't be used at the same time. Try removing the Sprint card, then connecting to WiFi.
