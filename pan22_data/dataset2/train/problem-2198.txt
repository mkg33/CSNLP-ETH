I need my Windows users to have a remote desktop (via RDP or VNC, I suppose, or maybe there's something better) on a Linux server to run desktop applications (the most important of which is a Win32 one, I hope it is going to work with WINE) remotely.
VNC works very nicely. Most Linux distributions have a the server sides vnc x-server included these days. Get a compatible windows vnc client and you should be good. If you need some additional security look for the ssl-enabled vnc stacks that are starting to crop up.
I'm assuming, possibly incorrectly that your users are sitting in from of the windows boxes and need access to some linux gui applications.
The cleanest (although not easiest) way is to run Cygwin/X locally and start apps via SSH with X forwarding enabled. Invoking the apps can be done via batch files or shortcuts.
Getting a windows side xserver like the one in cygwin will also works but is more complicated and will be much harder to explain to windows users. If your users are already linux savy this won't be to bad, otherwise go with vnc.
