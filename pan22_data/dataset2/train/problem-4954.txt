I know I am going against the flow when I suggest this, but I usually prefer to use a general purpose distribution like Debian.  A custom build distribution like the others that have been suggested will work well if what you needs never really goes beyond the features offered.  A general purpose distribution is usually a lot more flexible and is easier to adapt to server other functions.  Also, with a general purpose distribution the skills you learn maintaining it are more reusable and directly applicable to other situations where you use that distribution.
m0nowall and Smoothwall are the two biggest I know of for turning an old PC into a firewall/router.  I'd suggest digging through features and screen shots then playing with each a little bit.
For gateway/router I use one of the most secure os on earth : OpenBSD. For files server I use FreeBSD.
Sounds like you might be interested in Smoothwall.  I have not used it myself but I knew some people who worked on the project years back, and it has matured quite a bit.  I have heard good things.
