Are there any good, open source tools to help me with migrating all of our existing email from approx 75 email inboxes to Google G Suite?  Some people at this company have email addresses that they have been using for over a decade at this point, so migrating email between the two systems seems like it will be a huge PITA - but I was wondering if I could get some suggestions for how to approach a project of this scale from other IT professionals who have real world experience moving from one email server to another.   
So, we have a server running Ubuntu 10.10 that hosts our Zimbra email server.   I would like to move away from using Zimbra and I think the best option for the company I work for would be a hosted email solution like GSuite but I do not have any experience migrating from one email server to another and I have a few questions.
Another possibility I was thinking of was purchasing a different domain name to use for hosting the G Suite accounts, and then have any email that is sent to the old domain name be forwarded to the new mail domain.   
Our email domain is @poweron.com, and I would prefer if we could keep this email domain for hosting our email, but obviously this will mean that the old server cannot still exist at that domain name.
