This is no legal advice. However: Copyright expires about 70 years after the death of the author (exact time frame depends on your country, it goes up to 95 years). For any computer stuff that is unlikely to be the case anytime soon.
First of all, as the title says, in case a game's copyrights expire can I use its sprites for my own game and claim copyrights?
You may find sprites where the license allows usage. That can be that the completely free-to-use ones like public domain or WPL, or slightly more restrictive ones like some flavours of the creative commons one.
In any case: read the license terms carefully! No license terms mean NO PERMISSION whatsoever. You'll have to ask in those cases. And asking doesn't hurt either in the cases where a license is stated explicitly as well. Authors usually can license their stuff however they see fit - and the conditions may vary depending on who asks and for what purpose.
In my particular case I'm interested in this game's sprites, the website is entirely in Japanese and due to their sole use of images with text, I cannot translate it. Can't seem to find any information regarding its copyright anywhere.
So in your particular case, it's pretty much impossible, as it's unlikely your game sprites are from a game that was made less than 10 years after the first computer was created.
