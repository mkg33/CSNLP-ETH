The phenomenon is somewhat more complex. I did some research in the according logs and want to share my guess here for all whom wondering too.
The related log entries showing drops in the input chain with TCP flags ACK and PSH (push). This indicates that some service in the network is awaiting messages from the google servers (via. push). But wait - why the package is logged in the input chain? Thats rather easy to explain - if the router  (or as @chexum already mentioned - the conntrack) has no connection information about NATed/PATed traffic the package looks like traffic for the router and not for any devices behind it. So that explains why "google is sending traffic to the router". 
And here i can only speculate for now: The drops are observed in times where most users are at the internet. My guess is that googles replies took to long (mybe because it prior push traffic lower than other) so that the connection times out. The timeouts on this particular router are about 10s for TCP packages and 5s for SYN. After some more time the conntrack will remove his memory about old "invalid" traffic and from that time on every traffic from this connection looks like input traffic.
I think @samuel should observe it a little more and see if any pattern is recognizable. But generally i sare @chexum oppinion that these drops are ignorable.
