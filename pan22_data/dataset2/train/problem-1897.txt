Make up a USB bootable copy of Win 10 and boot off it whenever you run into this problem. You could then tell it to scan the drive for errors. (Yes, I know, sometimes you can't stop it from booting... :-) I get it. But TRY. Reassign the boot to only the USB stick in the BIOS, so it can't find the normal boot drive. That sometimes does the trick).
Then run a Command Prompt, chkdsk c: /f /r (or D: or whatever the NORMAL drive letter is assigned, don't scan the USB boot which ~usually~ is X:). Do the /r even though it takes much longer, at least the first time you run into this, later you can do just /f which is much faster. The /r finds bad blocks and marks them out, something that doesn't show well in the SMART data.
Just throwing this out there as a thought - Is this on SSD or Hard drive? Hard drive, you have a better chance. SSD's tend to be touchy little things, corrupt one and you're screwed. Anyways, try this:
One other thing you could try, (especially on a hard disk) is get a copy of GRC's SpinRite 6 and run at least level 3. It finds and fixes errors Windows will not even see. It's not cheap, but then neither is your time or the psych help you need after this sort of problem! LOL! Great tool to have in your toolbox if you have multiple machines. Works on SSD and Flash drives, but not as well. DON'T use above level 2 on Flash or SSD!!!!
Best of luck! BTW - Don't normally have time to hangout here, just saw the Q and wanted to offer a thought, so little likelihood of followup. Sorry... :-}
You sound savvy, and this may all seem stupid, but I've found Win 10 (and 8, 8.1 as well) does the new style drive scan but it doesn't seem to work a lot of times, while the old tried & true chkdsk does. Typical MS "fixing" something that wasn't broken and bollixing it up! The trick here is catching it before it boots by itself, and forcing a boot from USB, or even a CD, then running chkdsk.
