Alternatively, you can buy a wildcard SSL certificate that covers every subdomain for a single domain.
The encryption used is the same in all of these certificates.  The level of security provided is dependent on the key size you choose (you should choose 2048), the ciphers and versions of the SSL protocol your web server supports (this can be changed in your configuration).  The main trick here is to not support the older, weaker ciphers and versions.
A certificate for example.com won't necessarily match www.example.com as these are different domains.  Most providers will automatically include the www subdomain as a Subject Alternative Name when generating your certificate, (even the completely free CAs such as StartCom do this) but you should make sure that they actually do this before you ask them to generate the certificate.
Whether you are getting a single domain certificate, a SAN certificate or a wildcard certificate, there are three types of validation you can go through:
You can buy a SAN certificate (also known as UCC or Unified Communications Certificate) that will allow you to have more than just the single subdomain in the same certificate, so you can buy one certificate to match example.com, www.example.com, shop.example.com and login.example.com.  You can even have other domains included in a SAN certificate, so the same certificate can cover example.net, example.info and example.co.uk (and the subdomains for all of those, although having more domains usually will cost you more).
EEAA's answer is correct so I won't repeat that, but there's plenty to add on the subject of SSL/TLS.
