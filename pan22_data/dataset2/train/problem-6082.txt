JS mentions number theory. Fermat is credited with the Fermat primality test, a probabilistic algorithm which dates to the 1600s and serves as a precursor to more modern primality tests such as Solovay-Strassen and Miller-Rabin. [it would take a historian specializing in math & number theory to try to pinpoint exactly what Fermat knew about it versus modern knowledge which is much more complete about the structure of its pseudoprimes (false positives) etc.]
In a 1917 paper, H. C. Pocklington discussed an algorithm for finding sqrt(a), modulo p, which depended on choosing elements at random to get a nonresidue of a certain form.  In it, he said, "We have to do this [find the nonresidue] by trial, using the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, which is a defect in the method.  But as for each value of u half the values of t are suitable, there should be no difficulty in finding one."
Using oracles (e.g. chicken bones, stones) to decide on where to hunt can be seen as a randomized algorithm. One can argue that randomizing the hunting grounds prevents game adaption and overhunting. 
one of Einsteins 1905 "miracle" papers was on brownian motion, a classic physical example of a random walk and yields a formula (ie, basically an algorithm, if the physical process is the "computer") for estimating/calculating particle (molecule) diameter given other known physical constants and the observation/measurement of the (random) particle displacement over time. this paper also served as early theoretical/experimental/foundational evidence for the atomic theory of matter.
The Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm was published in 1953 and dates back earlier to the Manhattan project, long before Rabin. Like many of the early randomized methods given in other answers, it is a Monte Carlo algorithm.
Is it possible that the claim on the Wikipedia page is a garbled form of the claim that Rabin's was the first Las Vegas algorithm?
Buffons needle algorithm for estimating $\pi$, basically a Monte Carlo method, dates to publication in 1777. note that Monte Carlo methods date to the 1940s with the US "Manhattan" atom bomb project & were coinvented by Ulam, Von Neumann, and Metropolis.
