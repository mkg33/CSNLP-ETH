You could also hide the icon if it's annoying you by right-clicking a bit of blank taskbar near those notification icons and selecting Customize notification icons you can then find it in the list and change the behaviour to Hide icon and notifications.
Short answer, easiest way to get rid of it is to either disconnect your machine from the internet, or plug directly into your corporate network.
Direct Access is technology built in to Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 that automatically creates a connection between your PC and your company's network whenever you connect your machine up to the internet. It's a bit like how people used to use VPNs to connect their laptop up to the corporate network from home or hotels, except that this happens totally transparently as you log into your machine and doesn't disrupt you from connecting to other resources outside the corporate network (unless your admins have set it to do so).
I find in the notification area an icon showing a tower computer and screen. Its tooltip says "corporate connectivity is working correctly". Right-clicking brings up a window "Microsoft DirectAccess Connectivity Assistant".
