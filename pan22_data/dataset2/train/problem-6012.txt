The ultimate goal of OOP is to reduce code duplication, improve readability and support reuse as well as extending the code.
Your method names sometimes are English (makeBoardEmpty) and your native language (karelericiz, kare). Stick to either one (preferably English).
Also this approach adds public methods to DrawingBoard which should not be accessed by users of this class and which are only there to satisfy the implemented interfaces.
Your class  DrawingBoard implements several *.Listener interfaces. But these interfaces are meant to be implemented as anonymous inner classes
Finding good names is the hardest part in programming, so always take your time to think about the names of your identifiers.
in your method addIntoEmpty() you have a "stack" of if statements wrapping different loops and depending on the fact that the previous loop finished or not (kopya). Instead you should use a return :
I changed some part for to make code more object oriented. Firstly i changed square class made their fields private and added some more field.
The  anonymous inner classes approach would reduce the public interface of  DrawingBoard. Also you could uses the default implementations the JVM provides for (almost) all *.Listener interfaces to avoid "empty" methods:
board class hold int array to count neightborhoods in the last code. this time square class held neighborhoods and board class only held square class.
