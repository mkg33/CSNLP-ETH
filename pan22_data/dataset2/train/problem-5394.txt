Basically, what we want is something that enable us to say to our users "see? your PC is as slow as was three years ago! stop complaining! Is all in your head!"
Anyway, the defacto standard Benchmark for Office systems is the BabCo suite, but I doubt it's free or cheap. 
We usually check startup programs, virus, fragmentation, disk health and common problems that causes slowness (Symantec AV drops disk to 1mb/s , or a seagate HD firmware error in certain models), but in those cases the slowness is pretty evident.
I strongly disagree with the "it's all in your head" sentiment, even if I understand the reasoning for it. The problem is that this nearly never solves the perceived problems the user has, be it real or imagined. 
So, we are asking if there's a way to OBJECTIVELY check that a computer didn't dropped its performance, compared with similar ones o previous measures, specially for work use (I don't think that 3dmark benchmark o similar may help).
In other hand, the most common is the user complaining about his pc but for us looks OK, even in 6 years old desktops. People sometimes even complains about his new  quad core desktops speed!!!
On WinXP, try System Monitor MMC snap-in (perfmon.msc). It even has the right counters loaded by default (pages/sec, disk queue length, processor time).
