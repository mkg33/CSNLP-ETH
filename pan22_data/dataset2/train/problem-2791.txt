Roughly the way your VPN works is that it encrypts the traffic and sends it over a different protocol (say IPSec) between you and your VPN. So if your ISP is trying to throttle certain things rather than your entire connection (say by scanning HTTP packets) then their throttling tools wouldn't be able to see the traffic in order to throttle it, hence bypassing their throttling.
Either your ISP is throttling your connection or there is a routing bottleneck somewhere between your ISP and where you are downloading from that isn't present between you, your VPN, and where you are downloading from.
I had the same issue with Verizon FiOS and saw about a 10x speed increase when using a VPN (same one, btw). After some digging I narrowed it down to downloads from Amazon S3 east. Amazon S3 east is the default datacenter when serving files from Amazon S3, and a lot of sites/applications serve content from Amazon S3 east (at least a lot that I happened to use). Whether Verizon is throttling or it is just routing I don't know.
