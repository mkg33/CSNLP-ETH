It's common to have a DHCP server just handing out IP to certain MAC addresses for testing, especially for embedded systems. Tiny DHCP is a simple DHCP server that runs on windows
You would only have one DHCP server, just setup multiple DHCP scopes.  Information on configuring scopes here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd759218.aspx
IN the past dhcpd scopes were the only way togo, but for a while now DHCPD offers a type of clustering of DHCP servers.   The setup is not to hard.  Full detail here, but I have cut and paste the details here to make things simpler.  
If you have the isc dhcpd, it should be relatively straight forward to add a second scope which only contains reservations for the three specific targets.  As long as the server has a virtual interface on the subnet that the three specific targets are on, it should offer the reservations to those clients, not general-pool leases from the general pool.
You can have multiple DHCP servers on a network if they are set to only hand out addresses to certain machines.
