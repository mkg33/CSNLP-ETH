docx2tex is the best.  It's free software, based on .NET, and works well.  You may be able to get this to work with Mono on non-Windows machines: it uses just the System.IO.Packaging .NET class, which has recently been implemented in Mono.
I don't know about equations, but there are several rtf to LaTeX converters that should also handle the graphs.
Be aware that LaTeX has a pretty steep learning curve, especially if you want to control the layout as much as you need to for a book.  Its great once you have the knowledge, but it may be a struggle to get there.  Does your publisher really expect you to do all of the layout?  I thought that most of them did the layout themselves using some fairly expensive software packages.
I'm preparing a book to be published and keeping everything in .docx files. Other than text the files include graphs (jpeg) and lots of equations typed in MathType. Since MS Word is not fully appropriate to balance text and shapes according to book format, some pages are having spacings at the bottom after some text, and then comes a shape on the next page. I know that LaTeX is very good at formatting, so is it possible to convert MS Word documents (or PDF documents, since I can easily convert them to PDF) into LaTeX format so that I can handle my work in LaTeX from now on?
