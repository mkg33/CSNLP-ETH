In the current state, ObservableCollection doesn't make much sense, because there is no list, you will only ever have one item in the collection.
If you switched to two (or more) threads, ObservableCollection is still not a great choice, since it's not thread-safe.
But if you don't need parallelism, a single processing thread (i.e. two threads in total) is enough and it also means you don't need any locks (assuming only this thread writes to the log).
If you wanted to process each file in parallel, you would need more threads. To keep the log clean (and to perform any other operations that are not thread-safe), you should use a lock.
In any case, you shouldn't directly use Threads. Instead, you should use Tasks, or some higher-level constructs (see below for more), since they are more efficient and easier to work with.
Not really cached, FileSystemWatcher just raises its events one at a time. So, until your event handler returns, you won't get another notification. And since you execute all your code in that event handler, that can take a very long time.
