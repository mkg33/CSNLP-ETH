I can see that there is now approx 400mb still in these files but I cant see what it is or how to remove it.
Try running DBCC UPDATEUSAGE against the database as SQL may be reporting incorrect data on the space used in the database.
Any ideas on how to progress, I would really like to remove these files or at least shrink them down to a much smaller size
See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-updateusage-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017
If this alters any space usage metadata then you could retry the EMPTYFILE again, then remove the files if it is successful.
So it appears I have an object in the database with no rows taking up 400mb which has no record in sys.objects
DBCC checkdb fails with "CREATE FILE encountered operating system error 665 (could not be completed sue to  a file system limitation) while attempting to open or create the physical file
I am trying to delete all files from my database from an unused filegroup. There are two files totaling aroun 1.5TB.
I have tried adding a small file to the filegroup and performing an emptyfile operation on the files I want to remove and then performaing a dbcc shrink emptyfile however i get "page could not be moved because it was deallocated during shrink" The page refers to the object contained in allocation units but not in sys.objects
