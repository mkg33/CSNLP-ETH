Something similar was shown here before Excel 2013 - Is there a way to turn off a chart series without removing it , but I have much more series and I would like in the filter option on the right to be able to group them also. Is that possible? Is there any other possible way to do this? 
I have a scatter plot with many series in it and for better understanding of  the data, I would like to be able to sort them into categories and select for viewing only some of them to compare the results. (Another option would be to create multiple charts, but the original data is located in multiple files where is updated constantly - so I would like to have everything in one chart and quickly select for viewing some of the series)
Data preparation on a different sheet with lookup formulas for the red, blue and green series columns.
You can load your chart on Excel by pasting the URL on the Funfun Excel add-in. Here is how it looks like with my example:
As you can see by this link, I used an online editor with an embedded spreadsheet to create this chart. The data in the spreadsheet is connected to my code via a JSON file, as such:
If you are willing to use an Excel add-in, you can use Front languages and there is an easy way to do this in Javascript.
