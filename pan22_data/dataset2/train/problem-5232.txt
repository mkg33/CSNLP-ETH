For example you could just keep track of each Tile's state and colour and do numerical comparisons instead of interrogating the actual texture of each gameObject? This has the added value of using a single Texture Atlas to store your tile textures and then just map to that Atlas as per the norm if a tile needs to change via a user mouse click.
I want to make a path of orange ..if I click on 3 orange tile (tick mark)then If indexpointer of OrangePath1 == 3 and indexpointer of OrangePath2 == 3 and indexpointer of OrangePath3 == 3 then print ("Orange connected")
Do a little research for finding paths in an array between two points. It's an old problem with many solutions. The most optimal solution, if my memory serves me, is the A* (A-star) algorithm.
I assined all 5 color texture in array having 1 to 5 indexPointer using inspector panel... All tile has same TagName "CubeTag" but object Name is different for all tile.
I am making a puzzle game, i made 5X5 cube, lets take example of orange. very left column is orange, upper with orange dot is static and lower with orange dot is also static. inbetween there are 3 orange tile, if i click on one orange tile color gets change on every click, if i click 5 times, five different color will appear as i told earlier. i want to connect the orange dot with orange tile as shown in figure(mark as tick), 
This will check whether every tile in a column has the same texture.  You should be able to modify it to suit your needs.
The second option will be better for you in the long run, as it means less work for you to design new levels.
my question is how to tell the engine that all 3 orange tile is connected. and print "Orange is Connected"
You also need to set up the board in the inspector.  Set the board size to 5, then each column size to 5, then drag over all 25 gameObjects.
