The Mersenne Twister is not cryptographically secure. After observing 624 outputs from the algorithm, it is possible to predict all past and future outputs. I suppose it's better than having all 0's and 1's in the sense that it will better mask the underlying magnetic signature, but that's less effective since your adversary will know the exact pattern that was written.
I'm no security expert, but I suppose my answer would be do NOT use the Mersenne Twister for this task due to that reason. But then again, it's all kind of a moot point, since writing the whole drive with anything will render its previous contents unrecoverable with current technology.
I know of another method -- the Mersenne twister. This is used in one instance by DBAN as a PRNG to securely erase data with, and it is easily 'random' enough for wiping drives -- and it is very fast. However, I'm not sure how I would use it in Linux. Is there a Mersenne twister program which I can then pipe into dd to wipe drives with?
Why are you using DD to wipe drives? shred is designed specifically to do that and is common to all modern distros.
