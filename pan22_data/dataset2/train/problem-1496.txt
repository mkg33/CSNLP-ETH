Whats setup; windows 2003 AD environment with a few servers and AD clients. At the moment when users log on to the domain they will sync their time with the AD. However most of the users logged on to the servers stay logged in and will lose sync after some time. And all clients and servers have static IP’s. So I’m looking to setup NTP to update more frequently the time on all servers and clients as the application running on the system require very accurate time sync
Under Time Providers -> "Configure Windows NTP Client" you can configure the NTP servers the clients will use. 
Hi using w32tm or some other service (NTP W32Time) is there away to increase the accuracy of windows time to sync at-least every 1sec?
Under 'Global Configuration Options' you can set the parameters for the service. The poll intervals are powers of two seconds, not actual seconds. So a value of 4 will be 16 seconds, and 12 will be over an hour. NTP clients start at the MinPoll interval, and gradually work up to the MaxPoll interval as uptime increases and time reliability (i.e. the local-clock needs less adjustment) improves.
That's not how NTP works, presuming a full NTP client. NTP works by disciplining the local clock so it can't fall out of sync, rather than hard-setting it back to true. Since you're in an Active Directory environment, you have some group policy options available to you to configure NTP an all domained machines. The key policies are found in Administrative Templates -> System -> Windows Time Service. These settings enable or disable NTP-client (or server!) services, and allow you to tune NTP internals.
Setting your Domain Controller policy so your DC's have NTP Server enabled, and using your Domain Computers policy to enable the NTP client and point them all at the DC's will create a NTP hierarchy without having to visit every station.
