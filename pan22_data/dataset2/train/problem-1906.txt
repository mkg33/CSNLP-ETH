I changed the location of a user's personal folders to a mounted network drive, by modifying the values under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders.  After restarting explorer, the folders are moved as expected in Quick access only.  If I go to the folder from "This PC", the old location is used.  If I change the location of the folder manually, (right click > Properties > Location), it works fine.
Most likely, it's because for some of the folders, when you move a folder via the Location tab in the Properties dialog, not only is the 'primary' value under User Shell Folders is modified, but a second one is created. For instance, if you move Documents, not only is the path for Personal changed, but a value named {f42ee2d3-909f-4907-8871-4c22fc0bf756} with the same path data is created as well. This behavior exists for Documents, Downloads, Picures, Music, and  Videos. The pairing is as follows:
So, if you create those additional values with the appropriate paths, the folders under This PC should be redirected as well.
How can I change the location of the user's personal folders so that the changes apply everywhere in file explorer, including "This PC"? (I'm using Windows 10 Professional)
