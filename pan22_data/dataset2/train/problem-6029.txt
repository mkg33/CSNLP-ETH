I'm a unix guy, I don't know much about windows networking, but I know DOS from 2.11, and this just looks like a bug, but maybe it means something.
It is completely possible -- and not even uncommon -- to have directory names in Windows that contain illegal characters.  The Windows APIs cannot handle these characters, so managing them through the GUI is near-impossible;  often you can't even rename to fix the bad characters.  To remediate such names, you have to use the command line or 3rd-party utilities like Unlocker.
To ensure that the folder name really is just a colon, though, see what happens if you include quotes around it as a name, i.e.
In this case, what I think you're running into is a backup program that creates a folder named ":"   For whatever reason, backup programs seem often implicated in creating folder names with colons.
One last note -- some SAN devices allow the loading of more than one namespace.  This means that multiple names are stored with each entry, so that you will generally see the stored 8.3 name as well as the full long name, and could also have, say, Mac namespace that stores a name compatible with Mac naming requirements.  Without knowing more about the SAN, I can't advise you what is in use, but it poses another possibility.  You can see some of this if you just do the listing to include the 8.3 names, which in Windows is
FWIW, another way that illegal names are created in Windows is simply by copying a folder structure from another source, which contains those names.  Windows generally does nothing to stop copying with the illegal names if you use a command like XCOPY, and will also allow you to copy a structure that results in path lengths longer than the ~255 characters that the Windows APIs can handle.
