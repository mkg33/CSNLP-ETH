It sounds like you'd get some benefit from documentation describe the "basics" behind the security system in Microsoft SQL Server.
Getting away from Microsoft, there's a really nice "crib sheet" that Robyn Page wrote that gives good background on the security model.
For a 10,000 foot view, what you're looking to do is create Active Directory groups (which you'll make users members of) to which you'll grant various permissions on resources ("securables") hosted by the SQL Server computer. What specific permissions and securables you'll be dealing with depends on your specific application. If certain users need UPDATE access to certain tables, or the ability to execute certain stored procedures, you'll use SQL Management Studio (or, ugh, Enterprise Manager, if you're on SQL Server 2000 or older) to grant the desired permissions.
I'd have a look at these docs relating to principals, permissions, and securables to get a feel for how you can apply permission for users/groups to access objects in a granular fashion in SQL Server.
