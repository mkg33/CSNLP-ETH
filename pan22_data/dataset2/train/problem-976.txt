I have an 8-inch windows 10 tablet (Chuwi hi8). Whenever I visit websites with Chrome, it loads tablet version of websites (same is with Firefox too). But I need to see the normal desktop version of the website. Is there any way to force Chrome to load desktop version of websites? 
There are several reasons for making this sort of decision but it mainly comes down to the size of the development team and the number of sites they have to maintain. I can expand upon this if required.
The reason for that is because that particular website uses responsive web design and dynamically reorganises the layout based on the screen width of the viewing device. You can test this by using a desktop browser and manually shrinking the window and noting how the elements are resizes and adapted for smaller view ports.
The Ars Technica site is a good example of a large site maintaining two dedicated code bases for different devices. From the desktop version I can view the mobile version and on the mobile I can select to view the desktop version.
There are a few websites that subscribe to a different philosophy and maintain a different site specifically for mobiles. In these cases the site will provide a link (normally in the footer) to swap between the versions.
