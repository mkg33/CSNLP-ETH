As already suggested by Stefan and Ricky, if your fiber ports are aggregated in an etherchannel, then you can safely remove any of the fibers and all the traffic will use the remaining fiber. In order to check if they are aggregated you can run show etherchannel summary and check the output lookinf or any PortChannel interface made of both fiber ports. 
Just be careful if running PVST, RPVST or MST. Port costs could have been tuned in such way that one port is forwarding some VLANs and the other port is forwarding some other VLANs. In this case, whatever the fiber you pull off you will generate impact on your network. 
To be on the safe side, run show interface <name> several times for interfaces to both fibers on one switch and watch the counters. The one which doesn't change at all, while the other one does, should be safer to pull.
Along with all my colleagues already told, I would recommend you to have a look at *show interfaces * then check input and output rate.
You'll have to look at the configuration of the switches to see how those ports are being used -- etherchannel/bonded, spanning-tree redundancy, etc.  You'll need to look at the config of both ends to see if it's safe to use the "backup" fibers at all.
Also you could reset counters using clear counters GigabitEthernet .. then have a look what interface is used.
Otherwise, if both fiber ports are not aggregated and STP or RSTP is in use, then you need make sure you are pulling off the fiber connected to the blocking port. Run show spanning-tree <interface_name> for both fiber ports in both switches and look for the ports in status blocking. 
If you made an ether channel / port channel, don't worry, the traffic will go over the remaining fiber. Otherwise you could consider to make a channel.
