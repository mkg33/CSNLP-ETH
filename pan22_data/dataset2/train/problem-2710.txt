At this point, I'm stumped. There are no other installations in progress, so there must be some artifact left over from the interrupted install that's gumming up the works. But what?
After force quitting the Installer app, the message above was still showing, so I restarted my MacBook Pro and then tried the installation again. This time it wouldn't even start, instead showing one of those candy-stripe activity bars and the message:
Also activity monitor can shut down any other installers running that was the way it worked for me...
Simply just check that no Applications are downloading in the App Store because I had iMovie downloading in the background and I didn't notice until later. After that I just cancelled the iMovie installation and the other installation downloaded within seconds.
I started an installation of the Xcode 4 developer's preview last night before going to bed. When I woke up, the installation had popped up a message saying to close Xcode first (doh!). I did so, but whatever script had displayed the message seemed to have hung because the (uncancellable) message wouldn't disappear, and the installer wouldn't progress.
When an installation happens a daemon installd runs. Killing a leftover installd should allow another installation to happen (and will kill any new ones that are waiting for the defunct one to finish). So,
Is there a previous Xcode installation on your computer? If yes maybe you should try and uninstall it first. Good luck..
