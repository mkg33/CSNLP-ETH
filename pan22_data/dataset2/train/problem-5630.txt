Your local print shop may be able to do VeloBinding. I've found it to be satisfactory for the type of use you're describing.
I usually print 2-sided, with 2 or 4 pages per side depending on the text size and length of material I am printing (like a chapter). I have been fortunate to always be in the vicinity of a printer that also handles stapling or binding, so this process is automatic as well.
Also (can you tell I'm an avid reader?) I have a Sony Reader that's always got things on it. Not so good for technical books (PDFs with images/figures/tables are a nightmare), but great for novels. But that's a bit beyond the scope of your question :)
I've been taking up reading some of Sonatype's Maven books, available online, but I find it more relaxing to read on paper rather than on screen.
Still, loose A4 sheets do not bring me close enough to a book reading experience. Aside from ordering a print copy, what can I do to print/bind a PDF to be as close as possible to an actual book?
I've used a comb binder (see comb binding on Wikipedia), with good results.  Check at an office supply store.  You get your book, with thicker covers, and a spine that's only moderately annoying.  It does lay pretty flat, which is an advantage over regular books.
