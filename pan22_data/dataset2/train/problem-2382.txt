It is possible to install a sort of "software EFI" on a strictly BIOS-based computer. The trick is to use something called the Developer's EFI Environment (DUET), which is an EFI implementation that boots like a boot loader from a BIOS. The problem is that DUET is, as the name suggests, a developer's tool. Thus, installing it can be awkward and it doesn't always work. If you're willing to invest an hour or two, though, you can try it out with little risk (none if you have nothing but an empty disk plugged in when you try it). The process is too lengthy for me to describe in detail here; instead, see my Web page on the topic. In brief, you'll need to download a Linux emergency disc (to be used for installation) and a package that includes DUET and a few other pieces of "glue." You'll then boot the Linux emergency disc, partition the hard disk, and run an installation script that installs it all on the disk. If this is successful, then when you boot from the hard disk, you'll end up in an unfamiliar EFI environment. You should then be able to install Windows to the disk. My Web page includes notes on installing Windows 7 under DUET, but things may have changed a bit for Windows 8.
As Craig suggests, it's also possible to split the disk into two sub-2TiB partitions and boot in a standard BIOS way. This works in Windows, but aside from questions of how to split the disk space, there is a caveat: Some partitioning tools react badly to MBR disks that are bigger than 2TiB in size. IIRC, the standard Windows tools handle it OK, but some other tools balk or misbehave. Thus, I recommend caution when using unfamiliar low-level disk utilities on such a disk.
