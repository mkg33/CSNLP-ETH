Not being a full blooded member of the DBA clan, but more of a dev clan, I find myself trying to figure out some slow running queries.
Ok, well I'd like to give you all an answer tick, because there was some great answers, with alexanderos giving the actual answer I was speaking which was clarification on how limit itself actually worked.
The actual reason for the slow down was a server issue, in so much that it had been set up incorrectly by the cloud provider and really wasn't performing how it should have been.
The subject of my question however is not 'Why my queries are slow' , but one of wanting to know how the 'LIMIT' command in MySql works.
How ever I've left that project behind now, but I have learned a few good things in the process on how to deal with a mis behaving server.
At the moment, I'm still trying to troubleshoot the server performance itself, so as a way of giving it a little SQL to chew on (Just to make it do some work) I'm using the following:
The table I'm using is a live table with an excess of 50Mil rows in it, and as I'm only conducting tests at the moment my expectation is this will return the first 10 records off the top of the table, and would easily do so in under 10 minutes.
