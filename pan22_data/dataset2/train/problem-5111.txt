The best way to set this up would be with a firewall or other Router type appliance (whether it be an old Watchguard Firebox, or even just a small PC with several NICs in it) running something like PFSense. This is an open source firewall system and you can divide your system into subnets and ad WAPs to the ones you want to have wireless to. PFSense can be configured to allow or deny traffic between the subnets with relative ease.
The more ghetto way of doing it, but by far the easiest is to just buy two wireless routers and put one behind the other. By doing this, the true internet facing one becomes your "open" or "public" wireless network. The one behind that router becomes the private, any machines connected to the forward one would not be able to just "see" the machines connected to the one behind it.
Obviously the first implementation is the more text book proper way to do something like this, but the second way is perfectly fine, and will function as you desire with little configuration.
