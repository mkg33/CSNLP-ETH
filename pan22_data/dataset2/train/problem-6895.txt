Until recently, Go used to be of the last bastions of turn-based no information-hiding games where world-class human players could not be defeated by computers. But now this bastion has fallen, as the program AlphaGo managed to beat one of the world top players.
Your question is hard to answer because if a computer can find patterns it can develop strategies based on that data. Computers can only make perfect choices given the data at the time (which we will some times look at as mistakes but really it's because the data was missing, incomplete or misleading).
The reason that Go was so hard for computers was because it took a lot of intuition to play it well. Computers do not possess intuition but they possess an immense amount of processing power and memory which can be used to find patterns, really what a computer does when analysing data.
However, Go was never designed as a game which is hard for AI. It was developed thousands of years ago. Being hard for computers was an unintentional side-effect of the game design, not a stated design goal.
What game mechanics make a turn-based strategy game without information hiding hard for AI, yet still playable for humans?
