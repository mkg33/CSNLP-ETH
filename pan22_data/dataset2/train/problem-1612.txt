How do I push a file from a Linux box to a Windows Box? Which versions of Windows have a built-in SSH server that a Linux box can "scp" (secure copy/ssh) to.
I'm not to much skilled, but, instead of setting up a ssh server on windows, i suggest you to share a windows folder and then using samba, just copy the file to this shared folder. To a LAN a think this is a easier solution.
Having tried many things, The best choice seems to be to favor the remote machine, since you can't easily fiddle with settings from there.  From a windows machine to a unix/linux machine, always use a SCP client to their SSH, and from unix/linux, use smb/cifs client to connect and upload to the Windows File Sharing already present there.  
Check out Cygwin. It contains an implementation of an SSH Server for Windows (OpenSSH sshd server). It works with Windows 200, XP and 2003 (with a few caveats). Here's a good installation guide. Once it is installed and working, it works like a champ and gives you some level of standardization across servers.
If you need something fast, setup an FTP server.  I recommend FileZilla.  If you plan on doing this a lot, setup SAMBA so you can share drives between a Linux and Windows machine.
