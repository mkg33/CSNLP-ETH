After long debugging I found that in my home page(after login) there is "change password" form was there in code,Initially its hidden but when we click on "change password" it show as popup.When page found successful login it fills that form internally because this form content 3 type="password" fields.Because of auto-fill property of browser. That's why remember password prompts too quick. 
Hi I was facing this problem from long back.After login that remember password prompts too quick to click on save button.
Initially I key those 3 password field as type="text" but when user click on "change password" link , internally it changes their type from text to password.
When user successful login to home page, browser doesn't find any password field so that it doesn't auto-fill any data that's why it remember password box doesn't disappears too quick it remain showing on page unless we hide it. 
Alternatively you can look at a service like LastPass. It integrates into Chrome. Auto-fills usernames and passwords. Prompts to save them but also allows you to directly enter them into the 'Vault'
I switched to 4G in a place with slow internet, and since it took longer for the browser to establish connection the pop up stayed open for longer and I was able to click it!
