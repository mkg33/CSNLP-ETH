What I did however, is make a powershell script that simply removes the r:link="rIdXX" altogether. The best thing is that the images are still stored inside the docx-file so once I did this, the document was restored to its original state with all images working and Word 2013 stopped crashing.
The r:link is defined in word\_rels\document.xml.rels. In my example it looked like this: <Relationship Id="rId23" Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/image" Target="http://servername.se/images/series1/image.gif" TargetMode="External"/>
For instance, in the file word\document.xml there is something called <a:blip r:embed="rId22" r:link="rId23">.
Unzipping the docx-file and rummaging around in the xml-files within I saw that some images was linked to websites that were since long gone. As soon as one scrolled to one such image, a placeholder would be shown or with older Word it crashed.
A user of mine had this problem recently, what happened is that when opening documents in Word 2013, the document would crash Word. Word 2016 would only show placeholder images and sometimes crash. Never got to try 365.
After opening a few documents that are about a year old, a lot of them show blank placeholders for some of the JPG/PNG images. Not all images, but most of them. Strangely enough I can right-click and Save Image As... to get the image out as a JPG/PNG file, and if I view that file it's fine. But even if I try re-insert those images, they're still blank. 
I had placeholder images in a lot of older docx documents, unzipped the docx, removed all instances of r:link="rIdXX" inside the document.xml with a regex search and the document started working again.
