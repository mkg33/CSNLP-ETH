Thankfully, you can mix and match them. I've been using libnss-ldapd together with libpam-ldap for over a year now without any problems.
I am very fond of libpam-ldapd, have been using it for a year now in production on quite a few Ubuntu servers. I can recommend it over libpam-ldap.
If you have a "shadow" free LDAP (if you use ppolicy you most certainly will if you use OpenLDAP as both ppolicy and smbk5pwd don't update the shadow password ageing information) you need libpam-ldap or users won't be notified that their password will expire soon.
Edit: In conjunction with libpam-ldapd on Ubuntu you should also look into the auth-client-config package to correctly configure PAM et al.
While libnss-ldapd is better than libnss-ldap in practically every way, the libpam-ldapd has one major deficiency: it can't handle LDAP ppolicy, and I couldn't find any information about password change using LDAP Extended Operation (it may handle it transparently). 
The project is originally called nss-pam-ldapd and on its homepage you can find a list of its biggest advantages over the old libpam-ldap package.
