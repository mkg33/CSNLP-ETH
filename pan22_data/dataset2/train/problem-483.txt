The easiest way to re-code a video to H.264 Baseline would be to use Handbrake, and choose the Android preset from the presets drawer. Then, as H.264 Profile, choose Baseline.
As example, here is a guide to using popular free software HandBrake to convert 720p video for the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer:
It's a very common SoC in older 2010-era android tablets including popular ones such as ASUS Eee Pad Transformer, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Acer Iconia etc, so there is plenty of info on the web on how to make the most of it.  Anything that applies to ones of these tablets will also apply to yours.
Chances are your Android device does not support H.264 video with a profile higher than Baseline. The profile defines what features can be used by the encoder, and the Baseline profile is one of the "lower" ones, meaning that even less powerful devices should be able to play the video.
You set the quality of the output by changing the Constant Quality slider. Lower values mean better quality, and higher values mean worse quality (and lower file size, of course). 22 is a good default, but you can choose anything between 18 and 28. See my CRF Guide for a bit of background info.
Once you've set that, simply re-encode your video to an MP4 file, and try playing it on the device again.
