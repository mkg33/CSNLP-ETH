I know that this is a frequent question, because I found lots of material on the internet. However, I seem to be missing something yet. It would be great if you could help me with it :)
In my understanding that vector is normalized, so when I scale it by some scalar its length will equal that scalar. If I draw an object every frame and translate it by the scaled z-axis vector (plus camera position), the object should be directly in front of me, all the time, right?
Note that this is not about how to place an object in front of me all the time, but rather what is wrong with my understanding, that using the z-axis vector does not work here.
However, when I run my program, the object is not in front of me all the time. It is in front of me, as long as no rotation around the y-axis is done. Here is the relevant (I think) source code:
If the problem is not as obvious as I think it is, I can prepare a small example demonstrating the issue.
I would like to shoot spheres in the current view direction in a simple scene. I use an FPS camera, so no z-rotation. The vector pointing in the correct direction should be (m[8], m[9], m[10]) where m is the modelview matrix as returned by glGetDoublev(...).
