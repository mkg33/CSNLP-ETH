But I have another approach to your task: Buy a cheap wireless door bell, attach motion sensor instead the button (you'll probably need a relay) and put this setup into mailbox. The other end in the house can ring or - with additional modification - trigger Raspberry Pi GPIO...
Okay, so I had this idea where I could put a Raspberry Pi into my letterbox with a proximity sensor connected to its GPIO (all battery powered), and it could text me when I get post. 
gammu is the stand alone application with python library for mobile phone control. Here is a good tutorial which I used: http://www.mattiasnorell.com/blog/send-sms-from-a-raspberry-pi/.
plug a wifi adapter (with hostapd support), which makes your rpi a host, and your mobile would connect to rpi. a small lan with only a host and client....
My latest idea is to put a crappy (one month standby) phone in the box with it, and try to interface the two so the Pi can actually text me. What I have not found so far is anything that might let me control the phone (or indeed, any compatible phone) - does this kind of thing exist? Or are there any pre-existing projects with similar parameters that anyone knows of?
I have done the research into the functional element (Pi, prox sensor, python to make it all work) but I'm having trouble with the communication element. I was hoping to connect the Pi to the internet, and then it could just use the Twilio library - but our postbox is outside of line of sight, and outside of WiFi range.
see www.marsiot.com , use android phone installed this app, you can remote control pi's GPIO, very simple
If you have all the necessary code etc and just need to be sent an SMS message, how about creating an IFTTT recipe? You could even receive an email/push notification instead of SMS.
