I updated VirtualBox and installed new Guest Additions. Now it's using "VirtualBox Graphics Adapter for Windows 8" and I cannot select a wide resolution.
My issue was running Windows XP (in VB) in Ubuntu 14.04. Running that since it is the only way to connect remotely into work. ANyway, max res was 1024X800 until I did the follwoing: 
If you go into your virtual machine's Settings > Display, and uncheck "Enable 3D Acceleration", then the guest will successfully run at 1366x768.
I recently experienced the same problem. Fortunately, for me I was able to fix my resolution issues by using this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCSXDjKKaQo . I followed the instructions step by step and now everything is functioning perfectly. The guy on the video is using a MAC to access the terminal which would make the changes to the screen resolution. I'm using Windows 7 to access Command Prompt (CMD). Interestly enough, the commands work on both Terminal and CMD.
I figured out how the guy from Indonesia  did it and managed to make it work , but on Win XP guest OS . Should probably work for Win 8 just as well .
