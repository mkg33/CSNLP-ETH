So, to get back to your problem: your alias won't work until bash re-reads its configuration. You can do this by starting bash again (either by creating another shell inside your existing shell by running bash, or by closing and opening your terminal) or, you can use the source command to get bash to re-read a file. So, after you've edited ~/.bashrc, do source ~/.bashrc - alias working, no starting bash again.
Basically, ~/.bashrc is a file that contains directives that are run by bash every time it's started. The default shell for all recent versions of Mac OS X is bash, so it's run every time you open a Terminal. bash does not, however, magically know to re-read its configuration files when you edit them, so the alias doesn't immediately work when you add it to ~/.bashrc. What you do when you run bash in your existing shell is create another instance of bash (which will read the modified configuration file, because it's starting up). Note that your original instance of bash is still there, running behind the bash you ran manually. If you close the shell (with the exit command) you'll return to your original shell (if you close it, you'll get a "process completed" message from the terminal).
I have an alias that I've added to .bashrc, and it only activates in Terminal after I run the 'bash' command. I feel like I should know what's happening here, but I don't. :)
