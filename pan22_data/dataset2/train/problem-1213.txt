I confirmed that it seemed to work as expected.  I did not alter any files on the drive.  Then I replugged the sata cable.
"How can I most simply bring the array back online with both disks? I would prefer not to rebuild the entire disk if possible and I would prefer not to loose the data on /dev/dsb."
That was working well.  Then I decided that I needed to make sure I understood how I would deal with it if a drive failed.  So I unplugged the sata cable from the drive in /dev/sdb and I started the array with
