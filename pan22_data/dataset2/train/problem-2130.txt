This does not seem like any kind of contradiction or inconsistency to me, anymore than having 4 phone jacks in my apartment but only 3 phones would be considered inconsistent.  Having 5 phones might be a problem.
On the BCM2837 (the SoC used in the Raspberry Pi 3), there are actually 3 banks of GPIO pins, so there are four interrupt lines going from the GPIO controller to the interrupt controller. 
You can verify this with the "raspi-gpio get" command, which lists each pin's function (INPUT/OUTPUT/ALT). If you filter the results with grep, you should see:
Even though the GPIO controller in the original BCM2835 only had 2 banks, Broadcom was forwardâ€“looking and reserved a bit in each register of the interrupt controller for future versions, the gpio controller of which would have an additional bank. 
The BCM2835 datasheet that you referenced was written for the first generation Raspberry Pi, in which there were only 2 banks of GPIO pins.
The diagram on page 89 and the description which follow do make it explicit only three interrupt lines are used.
