At the moment, you get the href elements of each tag only to see ignore it in most cases. You could move that logic behind your if.
it will remove the duplicated logic and make your life easier if you want to change something in that part of the logic.
Python has a style guide called PEP 8 which is definitly worth reading. Your code does not quite respect it on a few aspects (spacing, parenthesis, etc). If you are interested, you'll find various tools to check your code compliancy to PEP 8.
You don't need to keep track of count as you iterate over the tags. You could use the enumerate builtin function. to write :
Title borrowed from Ned Batchelder's excellent talk called "Loop Like A Native" which deals with the point I am about to make.
Also, enumerate takes a start argument so that you can start counting from 1 if you want. Because I do not really understand the logic, it is hard for me to tell what is preferable here. I'll take the solution counting from 1 as it is closer to your current code.
Because of points above, this is easy to change because we have references to BeautifulSoup in a single place.
To be continued (for instance because you do not need loops at all) but in the meantime, the code looks like :
If you are only interested in getting the 18th url from the initial one and then the 18th again there is no reason to go through all of them and count iterations and so on. You can simply access it directly using the indexes. On this computer i do not have BeautifulSoup installed but try this:
