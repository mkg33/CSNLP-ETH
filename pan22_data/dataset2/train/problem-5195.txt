Also, make sure that the antenna supports frequencies you are going to use. This could be a problem if your router has 5GHz mode.
Your best bet would be to install powerful antennas in the basement, next to the device or to get a repeater. There are some interesting directional antennas which you could use. If the device is going to be in the basement, you could just point the antenna to emit up.
To elaborate on the other answer here make sure that the two antennas can see each other. This is a very common mistake that most people make when running external antennas from a wireless N AP. If the two antennas are unable to clearly talk there will be dead zones and generally poor signal quality even if the signal strength is okay or good. 
Do a web search for Cantenna and see if you can make a directional antenna. You pick up some antenna gain this way. Follow the links, don't use the pringles can, there are some sites out there telling you how to make one from a soup can, its cheap and supposedly extremely effective.
For microwave devices, signal loss in the cable is enormous, so unless your antenna is within several meters of the device, there won't be any signal for it to emit.
