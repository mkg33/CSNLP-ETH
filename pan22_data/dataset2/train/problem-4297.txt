I`v been doing job with that soft, but once some errors occured (nothing was corrupt, but couldn't finish the job), I tried GParted to do the same and it succeeded.
There are quite a few alternatives, both commercial and Open Source. One of the more popular OS programs is GParted.
Apparently, since the last time I had to do a lot of playing with partitions and images, Symantec acquired, neglected, and killed off PartitionMagic.  (Yeah, it's been a while.)  What, then, are we meant to use instead, that gives us that general behavior of actually doing what it's goddamned supposed to that PartitionMagic so nobly displayed?
While I myself voted for GParted, there is also EASEUS Partition Master Home Edition (Sure, not for business).
My vote is for Gparted also.  I have a USB stick as an Ubuntu 10.04 boot disk.  Gparted let's you move and resize NTFS partitions, which is especially handy when managing windows boxes :)
There are a number of programs that do this, some of them have been mentioned already. If you're interested in something that also offers a compliment of other tools in addition to several partition managers you might try MultiBoot USB.
