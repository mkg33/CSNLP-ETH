I've just received a new laptop with a ghosted Windows 7 Professional image. When I go join the machine to the domain I see the 'Domain' text box greyed out (the system is in Spanish) :
Downgrade it to home and then upgrade it to pro again using the windows anytime upgrade.Make sure you have the anytime upgrade keys.
Also check to make sure the correct protocols are installed. Right Click the NIC and choose properties.  "Client for Microsoft Network" etc should all be there.
My local account has administrator rights. To verify it's not my account that's at fault I've enabled the Administrator account and tried to join, logging in with that account, without any success. Does anyone know why that box is greyed out? The 'Network ID' button is also greyed out in the system properties dialogue box.
It would appear that there was something wrong with the image used to ghost the machine from. A re-install from scratch using the DVD resolved the problem.
You also want to check your Services.  Computer Browser, WorkStation, Netlogon, etc should be running.
