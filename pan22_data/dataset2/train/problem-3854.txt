Highlight the rows you want to re-size.  click on the ribbon's "Home" tab. In the "Cells" group, click on the "Format" icon -> a drop down menu will appear select "AutoFit Row Height".
I have copied some data into Excel 2010. I have found that some of the cells need to be widened to allow the data to fit. How do I automatically adjust the height of the cells to fit the content?
In the margin, where the columns are named, double-click the border of the columns that needs to be widened, same place where you would click and drag to manually resize. This will autoresize it.

But to me, the trick was to select all the rows that need to be taken into account. Note that it might be counter intuitive but the first row is not enough to let Excel figure out it must resize based on all the content in each column.
