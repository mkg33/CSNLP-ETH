I really don't want to reinstall this computer. What is the most likely cause for the bluescreen, that I could fix without reinstall?
When the new computer boots up, it bluescreens very briefly (the image below is basically just one frame from a video), then immediately resets.
Next time it comes up, it gives me the option to repair itself, I've tried it, but that doesn't help.
I've tried going into the BIOS and disabling the onboard sound card, the onboard network port - no luck.
I've tried booting into safe mode, but it resets even there. However, the repair option goes into something like safe mode while doing repairs, and that one works fine.
I followed WinOutreach2's link and found the instructions very useful. I couldn't boot into the system but was able to use WinPE to load the regedit make changes to both ControlSets.
I've moved a drive containing Win7 64bit to a different computer. The architecture is not too different. The "new" computer (not too new, really) is an AMD FX 4100 quad core, GeForce GTX 560, some random cheap old motherboard. The original computer was an even older AMD CPU (quad core), older GeForce, etc. Everything is 64 bit.
As and31415 pointed out, a 7B stop error corresponds to an inaccessible boot device. This is usually due to a change in SATA mode, such as moving from RAID to AHCI or AHCI to Legacy. It can also correspond to a change between controllers, such as from an Intel storage controller to an AMD storage controller.
