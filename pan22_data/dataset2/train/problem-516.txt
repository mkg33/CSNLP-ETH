For test purposes, I'll use the octave port. List the distfiles required for the port by running port distfiles octave. You'll get the following output:
Make sure that you have all the distfiles belonging to a given port as many ports have more than one.
To achieve the same result, I downloaded http://packages.macports.org/ntfs-3g/ntfs-3g-2012.1.15_3.darwin_11.x86_64.tbz2 and put it in /opt/local/var/macports/incoming/verified. sudo port install ntfs-3g then finds the file i have downloaded and does not try to download it again. I found the same with the llvm-3.1 package.
I want to install some software in Mac using 'port install software-name' but some software come with very big package and I don't have a stable connection. I want to download the port file using a download manager and then have port install the software using the downloaded file. Is it possible? How?
Inside the square brackets is the name of the file to download, followed by the path that MacPorts will search for the file. The links below that are a number of mirrors you could download from using your download manager. Go to /opt/local/var/macports/distfiles and create a directory called octave if it doesn't exist. Put the downloaded source package in that folder. Proceed to install using sudo port install octave.
