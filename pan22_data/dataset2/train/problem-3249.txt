If you want to get into your Macintosh HD, you'll have to replace the Macintosh HD with simply  /. For instance.
I wanted to get started with using Git and Github especially for installing Web software to my htdocs directory. htdocs is the folder in which you put all your websites that then run by using MAMP -- Apache server, PHP, MySQL and stuff.
The problem is that all my applications and everything really is not on my user but in the Macintosh HD.
When you open Terminal, you start out in /Users/username/, or, in short, ~. This is the same path as Macintosh HD:Users:username.
Superuser on Mac OS X refers to the root user account used for system administration and has little to do with file system paths. It's possible that your user account does not have permissions to write outside your home directory, that's what the lock icon and button are for in Get Info dialogs, or when you want to delete something your regular user account doesn't have the permission for:
The Finder's Go to Folder... menu item uses the Unix paths (i.e. those starting with /), so it's useful to know these even if you're not often using the Terminal.
I want to know if this is just my fault for installing everything on my Macintosh HD instead of Macintosh HD/users/JeroensiMac/~. Also I would like to know if its possible at all, and I am just missing something.
You can execute a command as root in Terminal by using sudo or su. Be aware that this is dangerous if you don't know what you're doing!
