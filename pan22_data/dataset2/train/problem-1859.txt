I think the purpose of the question was for you to develop an algorithm for the problem, and not just use brute force.Also, this does not seem to me to be a problem that can be solved linearly, so maybe try something with best case linear and worst case O(n^2)
First, at a very high level, let me say that I find the implementation straightforward to read and easy to verify correct.
Having said all that: why was this exercise in leetcode? I suspect that the intention was to push you to a more sophisticated algorithm than this one, which is brute force. It might be a valuable exercise for you to see whether you can find a more efficient solution, perhaps using trees of some kind...
First of all, your code is readable.Try and use more generic variable names like endIndex instead of wordLengthin isPalindrome as the function can certainly be reused.
Given the context and the fact that the code is essentially use-and-throw-away, I can understand why you didn't provide more documentation than this for palindromePairs. I'm not sure, though, why there isn't corresponding documentation for isPalindrome, which is almost certainly reusable.
I don't find these names helpful - particularly the second one, for which I would prefer something like lastIndex. Alternatively it can be written with two indices as
