but maybe it is good enough and combined with a little human communication it may be all you need...?
Herea a shot in the dark, but if you look on ebay you can get some truly awesome deals on EoL'd Cisco's, I'm talking 2600/3600, with that you can do exactly what your proposing, There is a need for a little CLI config, but after that you will be truly impressed with what it can do for you, i.e shaping torrents to a minimum throughput during 5pm and 2am, but still not allocating them all the bandwidth the rest of the time, leaving space for everyone else to do their homework, and perhaps prioritzing http or reserving a minimum amount of bandwidth so that even if susy, joe, and! bob are torrenting and copying that ftp file, john can still browse, (and turn in his homework). 
This may not be what you expect, but why not consider a non-technical solution? Buying more equipment is not going to solve your problem as your problem is a human one. Find another way to share the bandwidth better. There are various possibilities:
Ultimately, you will need to get everyone to communicate better. That is the only way to solve the problem. No amount of LARTC is going to help you.
I have upgraded two WRT54GL with the tomato firmware (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_WRT54G_series#Hardware_versions_affect_firmware_compatibility), just make sure you get the open WRT54GL that is marked L and you don't have to worry about bricking the device. They are open and you are free to just upgrade them with whatever.
