On this dutch site they say this router has been tested as the best of a batch routers. If I would buy a router again I for sure would buy a draytek router because they are very good. I right now have tried a lot of routers like syscom/sweex routers which are very cheap but aren't stable.
I myself have never bought a draytek router, but I hear that they make the best routers(little pricey, but very very good). Let's say for example
I'd really consider getting separate devices to handle the three different tasks.  It costs a bit more now, but will save you money in the long run. With an all in one unit, upgrading one piece forces you to upgrade everything.  I have a generic docsis 2.0 modem, a linksys 610n router (really nice dual radio that supports dd-wrt) and a generic linksys voip box.  When I want to upgrade to a docsis 3.0 modem, I don't have to pay for a new router/voip box.  (not to mention having to re-configure my router).  In the end, being able to upgrade individual pieces rather than re-buy the whole thing is a plus  (yet I'm still a Mac user, go figure)
One of the best sets of VoIP routers is the line by Edgewater Networks, the Edgemarc. The following is from their website (not every router will have everything, but they are very loaded with features):
There's plenty of standalone VoIP gates on the market. They are really handy in a sense that they could work over any connection as long as you can provide ethernet to them. You won't be tied up if you find cheap 3G or cable provider.
