When deploying more than a few access points I'd always recommend a central controller solution and supporting those might be much easier than supporting actual individual access points - which may be thought more of as just dumb antennas.
if http interface is not strong requirement - take a look at mikrotik, i had reasonably good experience with it on router-board platforms. they are configurable over ssh / telnet.
Cisco LWAPP seems to becoming or at least be the base of a new standard called Capwap for controlling thin access points. In turn, the controller (WLC) doing this should have plenty of programatically accessible interfaces and of course ssh shell access as a last resort.
I'd recommend you look at the offerings from Ubiquiti (http://www.ubnt.com). They're a manufacturer of WISP-grade 802.11a/b/g APs. All their APs are Linux-based, and a development kit including toolchain is available. Out of the box you have SSH-based access to the OS running on the AP, but you could compile anything you want. 
The issue here is APIs. Let me explain. I have built a management system that manages elements in the network and I want to support Wireless Access points. So are there any APs that have Web 2.0 style APIs (REST, Web Services, etc) or at least SSH with config files that I can download, modify and reboot AP?
btw - isn't it enough to use radius and put unauthenticated clients to separate vlan with captive portal? all additional things [ firewalling / bandwidth shaping ] could be sorted out on central router.
I'm looking for an industrial grade (din mount, preferably weatherproof enclosure, no reboot every month like home APs, etc) Access Point / Bridge (802.11 b/g, dual radio) with APIs.
