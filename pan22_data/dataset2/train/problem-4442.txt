We have a site that currently has a satellite connection used by users, and a 3G connection used for a specific application. Connections are from different providers. Every connection has it's own router, switch and connections.
The trick, especially on an Internet connection, is finding something that you can ping which will give you a reliable indication of whether your link is down or not, or else you will get spurious failovers.
If you have a Cisco router behind the two connections, you would use IP SLA to track a remote device through each connection (typically by pinging it regularly), and then configure HSRP such that the HSRP priority on the main router is changed if ever its link goes down. Traffic will automatically move back to the main link once it's back up.
if your devices and router interfaces from the lan side run same IP range , may you login to each device and configure primary and seconry GW  
there are two solution first one will be the automatic and profissional solution and need to be done from the side of your routers and the other one i consider it as a way out 
Is there a way, to move all users and servers to one switch and connect the two routers on that same switch to provide redundancy in case of one of them fails? E.g. if Satellite connectivity fails then everything will go via 3G and vice versa.
if both USERS and Application servers and router interfaces from the lan side run same IP range so simple you just need to configure FHRP on both router and map all your devices to single GW .
 wher Xs are your lan ip range and Ys are the mask and Z1s are the primary GW and Z2s are the secondry one
