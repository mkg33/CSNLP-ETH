It will probably be set to "Send NTLMv2 response only". Change it to "Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated". 
I've changed it so the VPN uses a different username and in a few minutes of testing, that seems to workaround it at least.
As a workaround (and probably why that other Win7 machine is working) you can change your local security policy to work around it:
As my last update - I think I have it - the VPN username is the same as the Windows account username, but the passwords are different (because the VPN connects to a firewall, not a Windows server), however when accessing network resources Windows seems to be trying the VPN credentials first - because the account name is the same, the password failures cause the Windows account to become locked.
There is a good reason why Microsoft changed the default on this, so once the VPN server gets updated you'll want to set it back.
Windows can sometimes record a failed login if a station attempting to log in and the server can't reach a mutually agreeable encryption setting, or worse, agree on one mistakenly (thus generating a login failure)  before falling back to another one. 
Dennis raises a good point. The other way I've seen this happen is that you have 3rd party applications or something (3rd party or not) installed as a service that has been given the credentials and is repeatedly using them to attempt to connect to something.
Search for "Local Security Policy". You can also find it under admin-tools in the Control Panel. Open it.
By default Windows 7 is set to "Send NTLMv2 response only". The Server 2003 server may be set to "Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated". A bug in the protocol negotiations can produce the errored logins you are experiencing. The hotfix your friend mentioned is probably this one:
