Blade servers have huge advantages for the account managers who sell them, because HP (et al) have invested so much money in their development that they have incentivised each secured sale to a level that makes that Porsche 911 S4 look more like a reality than a distant dream.
Like everyone else I'd not recommend using blades, I don't see any TCO gains in such a small environment and I doubt you'll need any other benefits that might be.
Depending on the blade you plan to buy, I would say for a hundred of Virtual Machine  use rack servers. The disadvantage with blade is the cost of add-in cards like add another network mezzanine cards or changing/adding switch...etc
Back to VDI though, you should easily be able to run your estate on a dual quad-core server (thinking Intel X5672 or above).  You'll hit memory and storage bottlenecks before CPU.
With rack server you can choose your own infratructure. But it's just my point of view and it depends on which blade you want to buy.
But obviously you might still want two physical servers for redundancy, but you won't need super-fast connectivity between servers. There's going to be heavy traffic between storage and servers but probably not more than can be handled by bonding a couple of 1G ethernet links. IO on the storage side and lots of RAM is where you'll want to spend your money.
Wait for HP's quarter-end, or even better, their October year-end, to see the advantage coming your way in the form of your account manager all of a sudden calling you to tell you how good they are.
For just a hundred clients, depending on load, you could even do with a single server, since CPU power is not going to be a bottleneck. I've seen figures around 6-8 vCPU per physical core, but my experience is that 8 cores would be more than ok for 100 Win 7 clients.
