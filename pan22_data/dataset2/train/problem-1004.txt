I believe you should be able to use the Cisco Flash MIB to do remote pulls (initiated by your management server, as you are trying to do.)
So, just to break it down, make sure you have an AAA model created, a user created, and the scp server enabled, then try it again. Also try connecting  with the flash:. 
c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.155-3.M.bin                                                           0%    0     0.0KB/s   --:-- ETA lost connection
I'll just attempt to enter an answer.. I've never seen an scp copy to a Cisco device work in the way you are trying to do it.
$ scp c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.155-3.M.bin user@10.192.255.22://c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.155-3.M.bin
Occasionally I have an issue when I try to SCP a file to one of our Cisco devices. When the connection starts, it immediately drops and says "lost connection". I've had this happen when there wasn't enough space on the flash drive but this isn't the case today.
It works except on ASA devices. The key is you have to have destination file name. Whether you use x.x.x.x:flash:filename or x.x.x.x://filename
So, just to make sure that you haven't simply missed or misconfigured a step. Check Cisco's guide to SCP here
