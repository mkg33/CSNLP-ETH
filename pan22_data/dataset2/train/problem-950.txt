I am a power user of desktop virtualization with VirtualBox, but I don't have much experience with server virtualization, and so I need some advice about with path to choose.
The load of those three servers are very modest, and two of them currently run on top of ancient machines with low memory.
What are you most comfortable with? If you're well-versed in linux and have worked with KVM, then go that route. If not, ESXi would be quite easy/simple to install and get up and running with relatively little tweaking/prodding.
I'm a big fan of Hyper-V. I'm currently running about a dozen CentOS machines as well as several SLES and some Windows 2008 machines and everything runs like a champ, easy setup and whatnot.
Does this absolutely HAVE to be a virtualization situation?  Because if you have have just those three areas of functionality can't you just install them all on one OS instance on the new hardware and call it "the server"?
As far as Unix / Linux are concerned, a workstation (desktop) is a superset of a server, not the other way around. If you are comfortable with VirtualBox, why not using the same technology to virtualize your servers ?
