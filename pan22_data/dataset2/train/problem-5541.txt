In Windows 95, I think I could force similar things by zipping "C:\Program Files\Something.txt" and "C:\Progra~1\SOMETH~1.TXT"
I also think I was able to create the situation with some less odd activities, perhaps when working with multiple filesystems (like HPFS).  Using a filesystem that supports features that ZIP was not designed for might be particularly prone to have things like this happen.
I don't have an answer for exactly what you did to create such a thing, but the reported results are not surprising to me.  If this is causing any serious problems, you might want to consider a different file format.  .tar is usually considered to be pretty good and preserving filesystem details (particularly on things that are Unix-like).
I believe this is entirely possible according to the ZIP format.  The problem is rather uncommon, because most software that creates ZIP files will choose to update an already-existing file, rather than create a second file.  I'll make this up: perhaps the ZIP file format keeps track of files using an index number, rather than using the filenames to index?  Anyway, as my hazy memory recalls (when I played around with stuff as a teenager, many years ago), if I made a ZIP file of two files, TEXT1 and TEST2, and then used a hex editor to rename TEST2 to TEXT1, then I would have a ZIP file with two files named TEXT1.  It is absolutely not a violation.  The typical behavior of software is to ask about overwriting the existing file when the later file is extracted.
