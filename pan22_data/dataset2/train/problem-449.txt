Use Sysinternals Autologon.  It stores the credentials in the registry more securely than other methods.  
I'm testing Windows Server 2016 (instead of 2012) but unchecking the "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer" box in control userpasswords2 does NOT seem to let the machine auto-login with the provided account on boot.
I realize this is an old post but it doesn't appear there was a direct answer offered to Ben's question.
Wow, I have been struggling with this for a few hours thinking that Microsoft had blocked this in the version I was using (Server 2016, 10.0.14393) or it only worked for non-admins or... most likely, I was an idiot.
After applying this change and rebooting the server it managed to successfully auto-login to the account I had provided.
I noticed that there was CTRL-ALT-DELETE requirement on login so thought I would try to disable this...and suddenly auto-login began to work!
To see if this is your issue as well, run the command query user.  If you're not actually on the console, you'll see a different SESSIONNAME.
The problem was that I am using it for testing on a Hyper-V server, and the virtual machine connection isn't really the "console" session when Enhanced Session is enabled.  It uses RDP to create a new session.
