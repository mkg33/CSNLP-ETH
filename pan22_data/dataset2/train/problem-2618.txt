So I thought of asking you before I damage something. Maybe this can be useful to someone else besides me!
I would like to rename some TIFF files to a different extension, but I'd like them to behave just like TIFF files do on Windows - thumbnails, picture viewer, associations. I've tried dabbling with the shellex in the registry (for some reason my registry doesn't have shellex for common types, yet everything seems to work), making a duplicate of the tiff root class, but neither of those worked. I may have done it wrong. I'm also unsure of what's needed after such changes (the description of the file type in Explorer seems to change right away).
NOTE -- Don't use an extension that is already being used by something else or you'll destroy the file association for that extension.
OK, so I understand that this may be achievable by combining a number of answers from other questions, but the exact recipe has been eluding me and I wonder if there isn't an actual 'correct' way of doing it (maybe via VBScript or similar).
