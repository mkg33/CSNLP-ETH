I haven't used Mysql Cluster but you should be able to do replication in it, also mysql cluster does quite a bit more than you are probably needing, if all you need is replication. MySQL cluster has the capability of routing to different sql servers on the fly if one goes down, thus reducing the need to modify the dns records of the host name everytime or setting up a temporary sql server or just letting it be dead until fixed. It can do other stuff as well. So to help you out, I suggest using the MySQL community edition as its more user friendly for you than mysql cluster.
Grab the mysql community edition, this will allow you to have replication, thus, you can set 1 mysql server as the master where everthing is edited and the second mysql server is the slave and it can just retrieve what the master has at a configurable interval. You can easily add more slaves in the future as well. Also, the slaves don't necessarily have to be on separate machines also, you can run more than 1 instance of MySQL. However this would defeat the purpose of replication and being failsafe. This is most likely what you are looking for. Also, mysql has a guide on their website for setting up replication for mysql community edition.
