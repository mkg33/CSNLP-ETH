You need to be root to modify user permissions for any given program. If you are the root user, simply open a terminal and type sudo chmod 755 path/to/program. If you need to give permissions to a directory, it would be sudo chmod -R 755 path/to/program. After entering in the command, it will ask you to type in the root password. You should now be able to run the program.
If you are not the root user, you need to ask them to give you proper permissions. The solution I gave you allows anyone to read and execute the program, which may not be the desired result. Depending on your setup, you may desire to create a user group so that only certain members of the group have access to the file. Additionally, if you want full permissions for everyone, you would use 777 instead of 755. You can find an explanation of what these numbers mean and of the chmod command by typing man chmod in the terminal. This is a manual page explaining the command. When you are done reading, hit the q key on your keyboard to exit. If you need any further clarification, please feel free to comment.
