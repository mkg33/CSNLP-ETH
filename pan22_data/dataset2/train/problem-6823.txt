Software firewalls are good when you want good control of connections to and from your computer.  Other than that they are a weak substitute and only offer very minimal security improvements over a stand alone hardware firewall.  A software firewall will likely be a good decent substitute for common sense computing.  If you are cautious and use your computer wisely(Not downloading and installing random apps from random places) then you really don't need a software firewall.  if you are a careless computer user, like the mob, then they are a great tool.
Your router should by default include a firewall, if it does not then assume all ports are always open.
A software firewall does give you the option to control what going out of your computer onto your local network, so in some cases it can stop the spread of some exploits. Likewise it can stop malware from being spread to your machine from other local boxes.
I'm connecting to the internet through a router at the moment, a Linksys WRT54G, do I need to have a software firewall set up? It seems kind of redundant if you're never going to directly connect to the modem.
A firewall is still good for the event of somebody else being on your network.  I personally believe there is no such thing as too much security.
You dont need to be directly connected to the modem to catch a virus, (this seems to be your thinking). If your connected by wire or wifi you can pass viruses.
You dont NEED a firewall on your router but it is HIGHLY suggested that EVERY computer has a firewall of its own up and running when connected to this modem. In short your don't NEED a firewall at all but any technician would not recommend you naked through the web.
