I was playing with a lab setup recently (Windows 2003 R2 x32 SP2, Windows XP SP3, Active Directory) and noticed that if I locked the workstation, the following strange behaviour appeared:
Because they are not locked out after three attempts, they can keep trying until they get the password. Once they have the password, they just wait for the user to get their account unlocked by the admin, then they can login as the user.
The issue with #2 and #3 would be if, say, someone just got fired and you wanted to prevent them from taking files with them, and disabled their account/changed their password, they could still access the files if their workstation was locked (or I assume if they were already logged into their computer).
The attack vector to exploit #1 would be if the hacker has a set list of maybe 200 or so possible passwords based on combinations of the user's birthday, kids names, whatever. They then try each of these passwords, in turn, to see if they are right (maybe using a USB keyboard wedge to automate it).
