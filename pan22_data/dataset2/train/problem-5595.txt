iOS and Android combined are large markets, with OUYA and NVIDIA Shield around the corner, Android is definitely going to be a hot spot to consider since minimal changes can be made to support these platforms.  However, don't limit yourself because you like a specific platform, put that game on anything with a screen and an input device.
SDKs aside, if you want to maximize your audience then you should consider getting your game on Kongregate, Desura and if you've got something great, Steam Greenlight.  You've also got console opportunities with PlayStation Mobile although I don't know how large that audience is.
If you want to make money on your games, and even if you don't, you just want to reach a large audience, there really are no other mobile platforms. Android, iphone make up most of the market, with RIM dying out, and Windows Phone barely making a dent.
If you think you have the time, then there's no harm in experimenting with other SDKs. Just learning how to efficiently use new tech can take some time though. I would go with option 1 if you're just trying to get a game out.
