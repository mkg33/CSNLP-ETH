I assume you want this in .htaccess because you want to get rid of kim, john, lizo and simon but keep larry, moe and curly.  If you do this, then I suggest creating one htaccess file in one directory, and setting that directory as the DocumentRoot of all of the virtualhosts you want to "get rid of".
If the requested host is not "domain.com" and it's not blank (http 1.0 and broken clients that don't send a Host: header), then it redirects the user to domain.com.  This saves the server from having to figure out what virtual host a client wants then looking for and reading the htaccess file.
Do you intend to lose the "kim" part and retain the "whatever" part so that kim.domain.com/whatever redirects to domain.com/whatever ?  If so, then drop this into every site's .htaccess file:
If you want to get rid of everything but "domain.com", you can improve performance by getting rid of all the virtual hosts entirely, having just one site, and in your apache configuration doing (see "Canonical Hostnames")
