TLDR - Infrastructure mode is not needed for use as a software AP - In linux, any driver with kernel support will work, and windows has a different set of required features.
One WiFi  (or any network adapter) interface cannot connect your laptop as well as other devices to a network (yes, there are exceptions($), but on some level, they're still multiple interfaces).  Connection-sharing must be done with a system with two adapters.  Commonly, this is done with Ethernet and WiFi, but it can be done with two WiFi adapters, though they'd have to have separate BSSIDs and IP addressing.  Other than differences in antennae configuration, there's little difference in the transmitter/receiver of any standard Wifi adapter:  the infrastructure/ad-hoc modes are performed by software.
Infrastructure mode is kind of redundant these days - hostapd works fine without it with any adaptor with kernel support (which is quite a lot of them), and I'm semi certain being. I know specifically that many ralink chips with the official ralink/mediatek drivers work as an AP or as a hybrid AP/Clinet (Its both at the same time) - using either the virtual router functionality in windows 7 or better, or some other mechanism in XP.
If you already bought it or can try it in the store, this should tell you (under Windows 7 or higher):
Virtualrouter uses the same mechanisms as the realtek driver I suspect and they use "Windows Virtual Wifi and Wireless Hosted Network features." - they have a list of hardware thats supported here.
