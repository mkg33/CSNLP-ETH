The USB Print server probably won't be able to handle the centronics->USB adapter. If it does...well you're in luck.
My customers have had good luck with the "Cables To Go 6-Foot USB to Parallel Printer Adapter Cable".  It runs about $15 at major online retailer such as Tiger Direct, Provantage amd PC Connection.
the print server may not be able to properly translate the request into the format the printer needs in order to understand how the document is supposed to look, and even if it did the centronics adapter may not relay the request in properly, as it may be using a propriety protocol between itself and it's device driver. the computer can get it, (possibly automatically as windows searches online for the driver as it always does when you plug in a usb device it doesn't have the driver for)
but the print server can't use a windows driver so it doesn't get clued in on the special way to talk to the printer and thus can't.
My first guess: no, because either the printer won't be able to receive whatever you send to it or the router won't recognize your printer being there.
