A friend, using a remote machine, ran a script that SSHed to my machine, and ran the following python script that resides on my machine:
Assuming you are logged in with different user accounts. The short answer is, you can't. If you could that would be a security problem. Your regular user account won't have permissions to read the process, pty, and socket of the other process. 
Otherwise it will be slightly more difficult. You will probably have to change the rights of /dev/pts/3 first and after that you can do tail -F /dev/pts/3.
If he was using screen, than you can do screen -r to attach the session to your session or screen -x to share the screen session.
Screen might help, but must be compiled with multiuser support, and then installed and configured properly (with ACLs, etc). If that is done beforehand then you can use screen. 
There is also another option, you can use ttysnoop for this. http://www.linuxhelp.net/guides/ttysnoop/
