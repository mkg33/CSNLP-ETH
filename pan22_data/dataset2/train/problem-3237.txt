Browse for Pictures, here all pictures we added in Sample Pictures folder are displayed, select any one and click Choose Picture and you’re done.
Now open metro Control Panel on Start Screen where Personalize section already selected on left here your current lock screen is shown with 4 sample lock screens at the bottom provided by Windows.
First of all copy all your favorite pictures to Sample Pictures folder “C:\Users\Public\Pictures\Sample Pictures” .
You can try Decor8 for $4.99. More info here http://www.neowin.net/news/techspot-how-to-change-the-start-screen-background-in-windows-8 and if you keep reading in the comments there are ways to do it for free although slightly more involved.
But if you dont want to use that too then I reccomend you to upgrade to win 8.1 because it gives you the option to set the desktop wallpaper as start screen background. Also you can set a custom image as lock screen
Put mouse on the top right of the screen, when the charms (?) menu shows up click settings, then click "Change PC Settings". You will now have the ability to modify the lock screen. Note that Windows 8 has two different Control Panels, I don't know why. Infact it irritates me because some features work in standard control panel while others only work in metro. Goodluck
Basically I want to know if there's some hidden toggle for that in the OS somewhere and that anyone is aware of it.
I was a big time user of Windows 7 untill switched to Windows 8.  I had customized the login screen for Windows 7 and Microsoft had a nice Registry switch to do so.  I am looking for a similar way to change background of the start screen and also the login screen where you answer the password without using any 3rd party software
