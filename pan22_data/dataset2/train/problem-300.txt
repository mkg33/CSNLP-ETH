I am a former Microsoft employee. The few times I did get access to user data, it was with the knowledge and agreement of the customer.
You are putting your data on Somebody Else's Computer, and the data can be accessed in some way. In other words, the answer to your exact question is almost surely: Yes, some Microsoft employees can see your data but make an active choice not to perform the tasks that would let them do so.
I have had my emails being read by my email services provider, since then I operate my own email servers. My hotmail, yahoo and gmail accounts are 'public domain' as far as I am concerned!
A wider question is how large the risk actually is for leaks of such data. My opinion is that the risk is considerably lower that a Microsoft employee would attempt to access your data (and leak it) than that a configuration or software error made by you as a tenant would make such data available to third-parties. The latter is what we usually see when it comes to data leaks that make it to the news.
Will they? Probably not, except if they have a reason (usually legal and you have nice answer about that - also keep in mind that there are legal cases they cannot disclose). The probability depends on how your data is interesting or problematic.
Is what they get usable? That part depends on you: if you send them cleartext data then yes, if you encrypt it before sending then no
A  long time ago (over 20 years) I 'caught' an 'big blue' partner's tech reading/browsing a customer's hard disk on a computer that came for repairs.
Now, think, all the companies 'out-sourcing' their data/development/support to Asia and Europe. The recent Capital-One security breach, etc. The Man/Woman CSR 'holds' the box! When you call your credit card/bank the 'CSR' asks you to verify your information... now he/she knows a LOT about you!
The short answer: If it is cloud it is YES!!! The first rule of IT (or any tech) security is 'the man who holds the box OWNS the box'.
