Nope, the Drobo is setup to do their BeyondRAID stuff, so if you don't want that (and the automagic space expansion, hot swapping, special stuff that comes with it) you're better off getting a different NAS.
In general you can't switch RAID controllers easily anyway (an argument for software RAID) each controller deals with the drives differently, sometimes you can swap controllers and just need to rebuild the array other times it's a nightmare of Elm Street proportions with getting an identical controller being the easiest solution. So if you had a WD ShareSpace and it died on you, you'd probably be able to get the data off using some tools or a different controller, but it could very well be a pita; requiring chicken sacrifices and an RMA to WD. I should also point out that the ShareSpace doesn't do hot-swapping of drives.
You could always build a mini-pc and slap FreeNAS, Openfiler, NASLite, or your preferred flavor of server OS on it, using software RAID you'd have an extremely resilient, cost effective system.
