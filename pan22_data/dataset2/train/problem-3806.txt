The machine starts with the SSD much faster in the last two points (about 10 sec totally). This is amazing and just as desired. The first point is fast too and cannot be enhanced further, ok.
The problem is that the second point takes over 80 sec. It seems that the machine is doing "nothing" as no HDD action is done as far as I see. I guess windows is doing something in the background and/or waiting for some sort of response that is timing out.
