You are not supposed to ever use the "male-to-male" dongles or "male-to-male" cables. They are outside USB specifications, specifically for the very reason - so a user cannot connect a PC host port to another host port, either another PC or downstream ports of a hub. For the very same reason the upstream port in hubs has either a Type-B connector (or non-detachable A-plug). When you plug the male-male cable between PC and downstream port, you are setting an electrical conflict, host against host. That's why nothing works when you try this.  
It is strongly advisable to get some USB basics before wasting too much time experimenting on wrong assumptions. Unfortunately, there are no non-technical interpretation of USB, the best I know of is this one.
Your hub is apparently on the very cheap side, and has unprotected "ganged" power wiring. The idea is that it gets the power from either a wall adapter, or from VBUS from host cable. When you plug wrong cable into downstream port, the hub gets powered, yes, but from a wrong way.
No, you can't use "alternatively" the downstream ports of a hub. There is no alternative. A USB hub is a "directional" device, it has an "upstream port" (to be connected to PC host, and only to PC host), and several "downstream" ports, to be connected either to more hubs, or to USB peripheral devices. The downstream ports have the HOST FUNCTION, they supply power and control peripheral devices. The USB has "star" topology, it has one host, and everything gets branched out. Don't confuse USB with a symmetrical full-duplex Ethernet switches. It is not a "network" as you imagine it.
