Now you are at the server's command prompt; if you want to enable SSH access, edit /etc/inetd.conf and remove che comment symbol ("#") from the SSH line.
I have imported a VM into an ESXi server using the VMware "Converter stand alone utility".  However, this process is a little tedious.  Since I eventually want several copies of this VM (or, to be more accurate, several more-or-less identical instances of this VM) to be running at the same time, is there a way to clone the already imported VM?  Or do I have to re-import for each instance I want?
You need console (or SSH) access to the ESXi server, and then you can copy your VMs around using standard UNIX commands (cp).
From memory the vCentre Server ( vmware.com/products/vi/vc/features.html )  will let you convert a machine into a template and then deploy multiple copies of that template into virtual machines. I believe there is a 60 day trial available ( vmware.com/tryvmware/index.php?p=vsphere&lp=1 ).
Unless I'm sorely mistaken, you should be able to run the Virtual Infrastructure Client, connect to your ESXi server, right click on any stopped virtual machine and choose "Clone" which will duplicate the existing VM into another VM.
