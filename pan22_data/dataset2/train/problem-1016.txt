You're right that four cores is overkill for the task of playing a single video.  But if you play that video at the same time as doing some other CPU-intensive tasks, they'll be able to run independently on separate cores instead of having to share time on the same core and slowing each other down.
More CPU cores means the processor can do more things simultaneously.  They don't help with doing a single thing faster â€” though some programs can divide up big tasks into independent sub-tasks (called threads) that can be done simultaneously on several cores.
so is very probably that with more 'physical' cores the processing speed can be lower, but it will be computed more faster due the quantity of cores working on it at the same time
well for info purposes, a quad core could have 4 more 'logical' cores which gives more 'thinking power' to the processor, and a dual core can only have 2 'logical' cores
But there are probably 3ds-max or Maya users that buy quad-cpu, maybe they have other personal opinion about it... 
So, if you have four cores, but your computer only has enough simultaneous work to keep two of them busy, you're not getting any benefit from the other two.  On the other hand, if the workload can be divided up into at least four parts that are able to run simultaneously, those extra cores can provide a huge benefit.
