It is worth noting that if you are using the Windows system clock to gauge time, its resolution is typically limited to 10 or 15 milliseconds (i.e. it only updates once every 10 or 15 milliseconds) in most cases.
Yes. It can. My company wrote software that will synchronize clocks more accurate than that. Sadly I can't open source it. If it is a 32bit windows box, than you can use Automachron for this, and I can confirm it works. 
If you have a domain, the workstations should pull time from the Domain controllers.  So if you have the domain controllers setup to a reliable Internet clock source (http://www.pool.ntp.org/) then the clients should stay in time.
To get your domain controllers setup for a external Internet clock, check out: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/816042 and skip down to the section on "Configuring the Windows Time service to use an external time source"
For client machines use Group Policy to adjust how often your clients check the domain for time: Computer Configuration: Administrative Templates:System:Windows Time Service:Global Configuration Settings -> Update Interval (in seconds).
