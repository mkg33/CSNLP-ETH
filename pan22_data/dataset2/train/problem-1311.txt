Jurgen Appelo, NOOP.NL blogs author, published Top 100 best blogs for Developers here. Maybe it could be useful for you.
Basically, peruse the many blogs in the Planet SysAdmin blog roll. In fact, I see at least one person from that blog roll on this site. ::waves at Matt Simmons::
RunAsRadio - a podcast for IT professionals. Although not a blog it still gives IT pro's a steady stream of valuable info on a variety of topics.
Bruce Schneier's blog and Crypto Gram newsletter is a must for anyone interested in security. It doesn't just focus on computer security, but a much more comprehensive thought process. Watching Schneier and Ranum face off is an enlightening experience. http://www.schneier.com/blog/
While not a blog, I get a ton of useful info from the Ars Technica Forums, Ben Rockwood's blog for Sun stuff and tons of others that aren't coming to mind. Google Reader is my friend.
I despise MS documentation as it's generally written in some oddball bureaucratese language with lots of circular references. I find the folks writing the blogs to be a breath of fresh air as they actually write in English.
Marcus J Ranum's site is sort of a blog and has valuable if infrequently updated information: http://www.ranum.com/
http://blogs.technet.com/askds/default.aspx - MS Directory Services blog, useful for DFS and file related information
Uber Geek Brian K Jones has a blog at his amusingly named domain. It delves into mostly *nix issues. He is responsible for introducing me to and convincing me of the concept that SysAdmins should be proficient in at least one programming language: http://www.protocolostomy.com/
http://www.istartedsomething.com/ - Not so much IT Admin, as general Windows/computing news, but a good resources.
