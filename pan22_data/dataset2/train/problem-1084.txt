A simpler approach for your specific case is to get APs that support at least 4 SSIDs, assigning one to each child and one to the parents, but that does have performance impacts, and does not scale well.
If the children have each their own device, it might be easier to do it per device. Your modem/router may already have the necessary functionality (mine has).
Well, I do this at work, but it's not overly hard or expensive to set up at home, though it can be a bit daunting to start with.
Virtual AP is a function that allows you to create multiple SSIDs and use different passwords, but unfortunately not all routers have this function.
I use pfSense for my router, among the packages for that is freeRADIUS, but you can set up a freeRADIUS server (or other RADIUS server) any way you like and have WPA Enterprise security, which can be set with a username/password per user. Of course, your access points need to support WPA enterprise, but that's not a difficult bar to meet if you step away from home RouterAPSwitch-all-in-one-box products. 
The RADIUS server needs to be set up with the users and their passwords, and the AP's (typically by address) and their passwords for accessing the server to authenticate users. The APs need to be set up with their access passwords on their side (they don't need to know about the users, that's the server's job) and knowing what address the server is at.
