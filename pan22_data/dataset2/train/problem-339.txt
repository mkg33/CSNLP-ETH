Many Linux tools follow "do one thing and do it well" rule. We have mkisofs for creating an ISO image, then e.g. cdrecord or cdrskin for burning it. In Windows tools that bloat to do all things by themselves are far more common. Another answer has already suggested they may build images on the fly; they may also store these images as temporary files.
Yes and no. Yes, you must create a suitable stream of bytes; and no, because you don't need to store it as a regular file on your HDD or SSD.
Burning a CD-ROM compatible with ISO9660 on command-line will always require a step to build the iso(9660) image, I think.
Linux has a habit of making "one good tool" to do a job, and then chaining up tools to achieve a complete task. Hence a lot of disk writing tools are little more than a graphical user interface for another tool or set of tools that do the actual work. After all why would you reinvent the wheel when you have a perfectly good set of wheels available already?
Note you can achieve something similar in Linux. Check -o option of mkisofs; if this option is lacking, stdout is used. Programs writing to  optical media can use their stdin in "Track At Once" mode.
The data needs to be written to the DVD in the correct format with the correct disk lead-in, lead-out and filesystem structure.
However, graphical tools like k3b (KDE) or brasero (gnome) will allow you to create data CD-ROMs without you need to explicitely run this step, they probably build the image on the fly during burning process.
Writing to disk either needs the ISO formatting applied on-the-fly to the collected data (files) before being passed to the disk writing buffer, or it can be helpful to create an image file that can be streamed directly to the drive.
