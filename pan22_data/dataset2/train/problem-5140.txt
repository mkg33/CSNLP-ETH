I connect an ETH002 board (from Devantech) to the network. Power of the RPi is connected through the output NC (Normally Closed) of a relay.
I'm facing the same issue for a long time. But I use a trick to WOL my Raspberry Pi's (I use several RPi's in the museum where I work).
You can use PoE with the pi, use a PoE switch and a PoE splitter at the pi end.  Works well and with a smarter, yet more expensive switch, you can reset the port to power cycle the pi.
RPi gets power from a normal phone charger like a old PC AT power supply where you need to manually power on and off. For this reason pi cannot power cycle itself and functions like WoL cannot work.
It would be nice to use WOL on the pi, but not seeing any input on anyone getting that to work, even though the nic chip will "support" it.
To wake it again, I send the following command to the relays board (assuming the Relay 1 is in use):
I'm no expert, but if the ethernet chip is also the controller for the USB ports, the answer may be to get power via the main USB ports for the PI via a USB hub that support power back-feed.  
if u want to wake on lan something, a bios must exist in the system, because u need a clock to wake it....the RPI doesnt have any bios inside. Thats all
