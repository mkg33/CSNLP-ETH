broken RAM can also cause spurious reboots. Check it using memtest or using Windows Memory Diagnostics (available on any Windows Vista install DVD).
For hardware failure try a different powersupply and take a look at the motherboard, if any of the capacitors have white/yellowish stuff on them or are round on top then you have a blown motherboard.  Sometimes a blown motherboard will run for a while then lose power, depends on which caps are fried.
Most diagnosis is done by swapping components.  The video card is responsible for a surprising number of evils.  Also the video driver (try running the generic one for a while).
I've seen where a flaky power source will randomly freeze a machine.  Rebuilt the darn thing 4 times and swapped with different hardware before we finally put a meter on the power source.  This was back before our rack days...
Check out your event logs. They will tell you if something errored out before it rebooted. If you see nothing, then you can start looking into hardware failure. There are some good boot CD utilities to check for hardware/memory issues.
The cause of many reboots is driver related.  Right click My Computer, select properties. go to the advanced tab. Under Start up and Recovery click on settings.  turn OFF the option to automatically restart.  if its an OS issue you should get dumped to a BSOD and can then get the error and error codes to research.
