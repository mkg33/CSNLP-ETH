I have asked this same question on the mono mailing list the answer was that it is up to the ubuntu devs to package mono for ubuntu.  Seeing as ubuntu only packages stuff for its 6 monthly releases this means that they will not provide packaging for mono releases which happen after the feature freeze.
You will probably notice that the mono project provides packaging for all other major operation systems including: windows and mac osx. But not for ubuntu even though it has the largest mono user base.
It looks like the latest version in the official repos is 2.4.  So you've got a couple of options.  If you're just using it temporarily you can download a virtual machine or live CD which has the latest build on it from the Mono download page.  However, if a VM or live CD will not do, you may have to compile Mono from source.
Long answer... you can compile it from source but this requires you to be a quite advanced user. The mono project is produced by Novell, Novell has a linux distro called opensuse which competes with Ubuntu. Novell therefore has no incentive to package mono for ubuntu.
