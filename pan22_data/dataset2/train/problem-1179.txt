When tearing down the first build, I noticed that I had connected the fan hub from the NZXT case to one of the motherboard headers. The fan hub has a cable labeled PWM. In the second build I did not reconnect this cable, I instead just connected the case fans directly to the motherboard fan headers. 
I don't believe the issue was with the power supply in the first build (mainly due to the excruciating testing that the system endured with Prime95/Furmark, all stable) I think the problem was with the case fan hub PWM header, or with the old 2133 crucial memory that I'm now not using. Either way, I'm stable....even if this isn't a definitive answer for someone else, hopefully it guides someone further in troubleshooting. 
I ended up returning all of the hardware from the first build (case/power supply/motherboard/processor/cpu fan/gpu) etc. I replaced every single part with the same hardware (new) from Microcenter. Kudos to Microcenter for being awesome about the issue I was having.
The one thing I added was that I purchased new memory....so it's very hard to tell what the real issue was with the first build.
Here's a great resource for setting up and troubleshooting the H440 case fan hub. I personally just disconnected all fans from that and plugged them directly in to the motherboard to have a more silent build.
