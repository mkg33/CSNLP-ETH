It is useless and the reason is "famous" Microsoft SmartScreen message filtering, as they call it "Technology"...
"MTA with illegal Microsoft SmartScreen filtering engine has detected. The message is not accepted for delivery due to violation of RFC2821 6.1 (http://www.rfc-base.org/txt/rfc-2821.txt), Please contact Microsoft company for clarifications"
The best case it will be temporary solution, later messages will go to junk or will be deleted anywayâ€¦ and you never predict when it is delivered or put in junk or deleted.
They do not declare this directly, but follow that rule directly, rule of fighting of legit messages and not spam.
However there are exceptions - top domains and mail service providers like Yahoo, Gmail are not filtered strictly by SmartScreen, so there is still a chance to have message received in Inbox, but your IP should not be blocked or blacklisted.
"... All messages sent to Microsoft  (MSN, LIVE, Hotmail, Outlook) accounts are spam, therefore must be put in junk folder..."
Do not waste your time, you can't resolve this issue even if you join Micrsoft's stupid JMRP & SNDS, call support, ask for delisting at:
I had the similar problem of delivery to Apple (@icloud.com, @me.com, @mac.com) accounts and the approach above helped, Apple removed my IP and domain from blocked list.
I block customers who come to my web with Microsoft (MSN, LIVE, Hotmail, Outlook) emails and ask them to open accounts with other email providers (Yahoo, Gmail etc) and the copy of this message customers see at my web simultaneously goes to Microsoft support emails like I have indicated above
If many webmasters who acquire customers at their web follow this way we will defeat Microsoft SmartScreen sooner or later
Reconfigure your MTA (SMPT) to ban those IP addresses and bounce emails with the following message or like that:
