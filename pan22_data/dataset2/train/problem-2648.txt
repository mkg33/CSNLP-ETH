One thing to take into account regarding the failure rate on drives designed for RAID vs single drive systems is the vibration factor. Raid drives are designed to handle the additional vibration caused by a cage full of drives where as consumer class drives are not.
If you're just trying to be cheap because your budget is tight, make sure you have a hot spare (or three) in the raid array, and know that this could mean a frantic 2AM drive to work if two drives two fails at once.
If the drives are just for booting and swap, and all the real data is on a nice reliable SAN or enterprise NAS system, again, it should be just fine (but in that case you only need two or three drives, so why bother skimping?)
This is a really bad idea. There's a good reason laptop drives are so much cheaper than their server-grade cousins. Plain and simple - they are not built to be used 24x7. You will see incredibly high failure rates with these drives if used in a server capacity.
I really hate it when a well thought-out, passionate argument is destroyed by one tiny ugly little FACT.
In addition to the problems above, you may have additional issue running these drives in RAID configuration due to the lack of TLER.  (If you are considering a model without.)  This quote references desktops and the RAID Edition drives but I imagine the same to be true in the 2.5" line if you substitute in "notebook" and "enterprise" or "SAS" where applicable.
The enterprise drives are preferable, and there for a reason, but if you're honest with yourself about the reasons you're not using them, and PLAN for the much more likely failure rate, go ahead.
