In other words, as long as Machine B sends back to the source address and source port given in the packet it received, that you can reasonably expect the return packet to find its way back to the original source.  This assumes that the return packet is sent within a short amount of time, as automatic NAT rules tend to timeout after some number of minutes.
Close, but Machine B needs to look at the source address and port number that it actually receives, which might be different than N.
You can have multiply IPs behind NAT, so You need to choose to which it should be forwarded. Outside of NAT only router IP is visible and internal NAT IPs are not visible.
The NAT at Machine A might not use the same port N that Machine A sent on.  (Imagine machine C behind that same NAT also sending on port N: they can't both use it.)  So Machine B might see a different source port, M.  But if the NAT does that, then it should accept traffic sent back to port M and automatically map it back to N at Machine B.
If I send UDP packets from Machine A behind a NAT to Machine B's port N, where Machine B is outside the NAT (elsewhere on the Internet), can I reasonably expect that NAT to pass UDP packets received from Machine B on port N back to port N on Machine A, without requiring manual port forwarding on the NAT?
