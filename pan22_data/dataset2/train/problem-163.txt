There's a big difference between "It should work" and "It will work" and if I was that HP guy I'd have gone with the first statement too, if he'd gone with the second and you'd lost data he could have been in trouble. That said 'it should work' :)
OEMs almost never recommend putting different sizes or speeds in an array together.  But you can definately do it, unless as already stated the OEM has a bug or "feature" that prevents it.
Unless there's some specific bug in the hardware, all putting a larger drive in the array will do is make the space beyond the size of the smaller drive unused/unusable.
In an array the entire drive moves at the slowest speed drive speed and errors are over 30 percent more likely on non-matching drives (not because of physical limits but because the writes don't queue, or don't queue the same)
As the addendum, Required up time is the best measuring stick.  If you need 5 nines (99.999) of up time, match all the way to the batch number. for 4 nines match make, size, and speed, for 3 nines i would still match make speed and size.  for 2 nines i match speed and for anything lower i don't really care.
If your not sure what 5 nines is. On a windows box imagine at least a 3 way cluster, split across geological fault lines with redundant ISP's at each site,  Any updating software like windows updates are kept turned off until they are tested in a matching test lab and applied on a 2 for 1 rolling update schedule.  At this level you can afford a new array when you loss one drive.
