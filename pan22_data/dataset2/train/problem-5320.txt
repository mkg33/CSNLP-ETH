You need to maintain a data-structure with relevant info about items like relics and bosses with states that need to be maintained. There is no magical way around it. This data-structure could be a large array that stores objects with info regarding each of these entities.
However, you'll need to make sure layers do not conflict. If change a does one thing and change b does another contradicting thing (non-linear game) than if both a and b happen you need to apply layer c that merges these changes in a desired manner.
This is where layers come in. You can design your level editor to support layering. This means each change to the world is saved as a "delta" like a layer you apply on top of the existing world (think of an image editor). However, this layer may also move characters into new position if needed.
Today computers and consoles have lots of storage. Storing multiple maps may be more efficient if there are very significant changes. The issue is, what if you wanted to change something minor in all the maps at once?
