Yes, this is absolutely possible, doesn't change regardless of whether you're using a web-mail client or a conventional email client, and cannot be worked around at all.
This is one of the single biggest issues with using email for any type of data that is supposed to be kept secure, you have zero control over the transit path between your email client and the recipient's email client. This is compounded by the fact that there may be multiple email servers between your outgoing server and the recipient's incoming mail server, which means more places the email could be intercepted or modified.
Can someone be receiveing all copies of my outgoing emails when I am using a web interface of an email server? Can the admin configure the email server to do so? If yes, will sending an email via the same SMTP server but using email application with an encrypted TLS connection help?
Once the email is sent to the server, you literally lose all control of it.  The server admin can have the system do whatever they want with it, including silently dropping it or completely rewriting the destination addresses.
