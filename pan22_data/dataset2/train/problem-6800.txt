I sometimes find downloads made using Google Chrome get interrupted, causing files to be truncated. Chrome seems to detect this situation as ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH, but then ignores the error and considers the download to be successful. There is thus no notification that the downloaded file is incomplete.
-Usually getting to a site means you are possibly going through a proxy at some point or another. This is possible with downloads to. The Download link may go through a proxy to the Server to request the download.
Is it possible to get Chrome to consider these interrupted downloads as corrupt and thus notify the user to retry? If not, is there an alternative download manager for Chrome, even something as simple as command-line wget, which considers ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH (or equivalent) to be an error and either fails or automatically retries?
This is a great program which which will show you download progress as well as errors if you run into any. 
I prefer this over using chromes built in down-loader. As I have had a similar issue to yours. Give it a shot with some of the downloads you have had issues with.
