There is one big problem however: you are frequently trying to fetch elements outsize the arrays range in countSurrounding(), and you catch the exceptions.  You should never use exceptions to deal with standard conditions since they kill performance.  You could fix that in many ways.  One way which would add efficiency would be to precompute the neighbors of each cell at creation.
You did a good job when it comes to encapsulating. Nearly all of your methods are just a few lines, so every method really only does what it is supposed to do.
Just out of curiosity: Do you want to add more functionality to your game of life program? For example when I wrote a game of life program I added some functionality like saving the curent field or going backward in the game to see older fields. You can also implement some functionality like speeding up the game or having custom field sizes instead of fixed 60*60.
Furthermore, your code is a good example that code, if it is well written, needs no comments to explain WHAT is done. Because you should see from the code itself what is done.
