Anyone have any other practical and useful ways to use it? For example, for loging in to websites or something.
I just bought a Thinkpad T410s. It comes with a finger print reader. I'm using it on Windows 7 Pro 64-bit for loging in.
Apart from authentication, some fingerprint readers allow you to start a program just by swiping a finger.
Many things that require authentication, like web sites, can be configured to use the fingerprint scanner.
Lastpass supports windows 7 fingerprint readers. I think that that might be your best option. I love lastpass and the security is excellent. 256 bit AES encryption transmitted over SSL then reencrypted on their end. This would allow you to have a master password for all of your browsers linked to your fingerprint reader.
Lenovo has a password saver utility that works with the fingerprint reader. On my (old) Thinkpad T60 it's called the ThinkVantage Fingerprint Software. It works a lot like the password manager in Firefox. It saves usernames and passwords for web sites, and submits them automatically. You will have to scan your fingerprint once for the first site, then it's automatic after that.
