We are beginning the process of moving to a new facility. Office and warehouse operations will both be moving, and we must get shipping operations up and running at the new location while continuing to ship from the old location. Our contract with some third-party warehouse tenants requires two business day turnaround (only weekends and holidays excluded), so we can't have major downtime during the move. 
Renumbering the servers when they move isn't a big deal, but our wireless terminals for order picking in the warehouse have fixed IPs (and a fixed IP, non-DNS reference to the host they speak with) and would be a massive undertaking to reconfigure when the servers move (each device would have to be reconfigured at least 2 times -- some when we start using them in the new building and the host is still here, all of them in both locations when the host moves to the new building, and the rest when they finally make the move to the new building). We're trying to avoid that if possible.
We would like to keep our 172.16.60/61.xxx internal address space in use throughout the move. Is it possible to keep using this same internal range, and have our existing WatchGuard Firebox 520 and whatever router we get for the other location (preferably the same model) just treat both locations as one network, leaving our host IPs the same throughout the move?
