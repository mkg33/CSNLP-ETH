When the build is complete mycorp is going to be all over in the code.  If you wanted to sell the same product to DifferentCorp it would be a lot of work to remove reference to mycorp.  I assume that by adding mycorp they bank paying you to custom build a product for them, will have some feeling that you will not be going and selling to their competition, as soon as you get it working.
I would also much rather use schemas as you've said yourself. This gives you the added benefit of being able to specify permissions on the separate schemas.
Perhaps a good idea is to ask the people in charge why this naming convention was chosen this way. Since you work in bank these naming conventions are (in general) pretty strict, and perhaps useful in the bigger picture. 
I suspect this is a requirement of the company you work for and/or the expectations of the purchasing bank.  
But from what I can read in your comments and in your post, then no, I don't see much use in using the naming convention you specified.
