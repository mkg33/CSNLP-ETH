    Open the file /etc/squid3/squid.conf and make the following changes: A. Find the line with "http_access deny all" and comment it out by placing a # at the beginning of the line. B. Paste the following two lines into the file:
The ip of the vm is static. vboxnet0 is assigned as virtual NIC of this vm. Wht further configuration should I do to provide internet connection with vboxnet0? Any help is appreciated. 
NAT will use your host computer as a relay to internet (but still in the 10.20.0.x range) and Bridge will make your VM part of your network like any other computer on the (probably) 192.168.x.x range.
    Give the guest OS a Host Only Adapter (default one is vboxnet0) and make sure vboxnet0 does dhcp.
That's the normal behavior of HostOnly. Only your host will be able to access your VM. If you want it to have internet access either use NAT or Bridge as Networking Option. 
    Open Internet Explorer's Internet Options, Go to the Connections Tab, Click on Lan Settings..., Check the box for Proxy Server and make the address 192.168.56.1 and the port 3128.
I have opened a vm with hostonly network as networking option on my desktop. I have assigned an appropriate static ip to the vm. I can establish an ssh connection to it from my desktop and I can also ping my desktop from the vm. However, I can not reach to outside network inside the vm.
