After installation and rebooting, the user has their first opportunity to access the "Settings" menu.
The "Privacy" section has "Location Services" defaulting to "Off", and "Problem Reporting" defaulting to "Manual", and "Connectivity Checking" defaulting to "On" (with a note saying, "If your network communications are being monitored, it could be used to gather technical information about this computer.").
I was confused by this also, but found https://www.howtogeek.com/349844/how-to-stop-ubuntu-from-collecting-data-about-your-pc/ which shows that it is in one of the dialog boxes you get on your first reboot.
If the information is being involuntarily uploaded before the user has any means to prevent it, then this would be a violation of trust, and would reflect badly on the people who neglected to offer users a choice.
Post-installation time seems too late to prevent uploading the hardware and installation experience information, but it's worth noting that an option to prevent such uploading is not present in the "Settings" menu (lest anyone speculate that the option to control this might be present there, and recommend to "keep calm and carry on").
I downloaded this file, dated "2018-04-04 05:29", and did a full installation -- and at no point during the installation did I see the checkbox promised by Canonical to control sharing of hardware and installation information.
