There actually is a (more or less) authoritative guideline where to place files on Linux systems: the File Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
/usr/local for binaries plus /var/local for data is a fine choice. The basic reasoning is that everything in /usr is handled by your distribution (i.e. may get removed or overwritten), while everything in /usr/local is handled by yourself. Apart from that the two hierarchies are nicely parallel (e.g. you have /usr/include and /usr/local/include etc.), so it's fairly intuitive to navigate.
If you're using autotools, ./configure --prefix=/usr/local will often give the desired result right out of the box.
It will create (and subsequently) install a .deb package, so you can do a clean removal, or install the same package easily and quickly on other machines (of the same architecture)
/opt/ is another common choice. I don't like it. It feels funny. You might find it fine. /var/opt/ feels outright wrong -- /var/ is a home for data, not binaries.
You might like to skim the FHS -- keeping in mind that it is a bit dated, and it was never proscriptive, instead descriptive of common practice. That said, it's still worth a read.
