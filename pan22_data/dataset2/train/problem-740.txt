Also any tweaks that you can add to the networks interfaces (ex: buffer size, LRO, etc) will increase performance of the Guest VM.
VMWare has a very good document that provides best practices for performance tunning. You can find it here "Performance Tunning Best Practices" 
That said, while I'm not sure about schedulers, but you can definitely strip out all the unnecessary hardware support in order to free up some extra RAM and such, and as @Chopper3 suggested using the VMTools drivers for the virtual hardware.
This paper will also help you understand how low level virtualization works in ESXi and maybe give you an idea of what can you disable/enable on the Guest OS (Kernel included)
All that said I'm not sure what kind of optimizations others can com up with but I'm definitely interested as well -- while a lot of "hardware" stuff is handled by the hypervisor (e.g. LRO) I've never read any statistics that detail the effect of LRO in the guest, which could have an effect on performance.
Generally I don't customize the kernels in my VMWare VMs -- they're similar enough to physical systems tat the extra customization isn't really worth it IMHO, I just treat them like physical machines.
