This is a very basic tester and will mainly show wiring errors.  It may show that the cable is technically capable of gigbit, a more advanced tester may provide better results.
This tester uses and base unit and a remote unit to connect to both ends of the connected cable. As such, it will test the capabilities of the cable. It does not take into account whether the devices you'll connect to the cable will be able to handle any given speed.
I wonder, if wiring for 10/100 and 1000 is same, how can the following lan cable tester detect the difference between them?
For instance, while the cable may be capable of Gigabit connections (Cat5e or Cat6, acceptable length, low enough noise on the line, low interference, etc), connecting a 10/100 NIC to either end of the cable will obviously then only provide the connection up to the capabilities of the equipment connected to it.
10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX use pairs 2 and 3. 1000BASE-T uses all four pairs. Thus a simple tester can see if pairs 1 and 4 are crossed. Notice that the tester does not have indicators to differentiate between straight-through cables for 100BASE-T and 1000BASE-T as the connections are identical.
