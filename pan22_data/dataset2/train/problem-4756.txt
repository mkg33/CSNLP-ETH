I suppose I'm looking for suggestions, but really trying to understand what is going on eg. why searching for false works and true does not - I first thought the connection was preemptively closing, but it's not.
"Oh we don't need to execute the first and third portions of the view because they are not in the output!  Let's skip and only run the second portion!"  This is a feature, not a bug (and it is what allows table partitioning to be useful).
filtering on the boolean field for a true value: AND is_logged_in IS NOT NULL, AND is_logged_in, or AND is_logged_in = true, gives the following error message:
db_remote has a view (v_sessions), which contains two fields: a text field and a boolean field, which is created with a CASE statement.
The goal is to (1) create a connection, (2) return a view of another database, and (3) close the same connection all to be stored in a view (no stored procedure or embedded password).  I came up with the following code, which uses a trust account and seems to work, until filtering on a boolean field.  Searching for false (field=false) works, but searching for true (field=true) or IS NOT NULL prompts for the password.
It's really odd that the data is being returned w/o needing the password, but when filtering, that is when the password is required.
