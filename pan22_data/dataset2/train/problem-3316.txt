Let me add, that the first rule of DRM is, that DRM does not work - so reconsider if you want to pour resources into what is finally a lost cause.
In a well-working virtualisation environment, the guest can not, should not and may not be able to identify the host if the host doesn't explicitly allow so, this is of course completely oposite to your requirement of something like a DRM system for VMs.
Let me give my overview, based on virtualization experience. Any malware with a network component will propagate to wherever their addressing/routing allows them to. Regular/well-known malwares tend to only operate in ‘user mode’, in a such a covert channel. If you are sharing CPU's, a busy process on one VM can effectively communicate state to another VM (that's your prototypical timing covert channel). Storage covert channel would be a bit harder as the virtual disks tend to have a hard limit on them, so unless you have a system that can over-commit disk space, it should not be an issue.
