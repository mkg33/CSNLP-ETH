My thought is that a mail message would try the first 5 Google Apps mail servers, fail, then go to mine and succeed.
It will not work the way you proposed. The way to use multiple mail servers is to have a "smart host", which will accept mail for all of the mailboxes on every mail server you need to use, and will then forward that user's mail on to whichever server is hosting that user's mailbox.
There are some options for split delivery in Google apps.  This feature seems to be aimed at easing the tradition from your old mail system to Google apps, specifically so you can slowly transition people over a little at a time.  But I don't see any reason why you couldn't set this up, and run with it.
For this to work you are almost certainly going to need to perform some configuration of your other mail server as well to perform the same step.  If the account isn't local, but the destination is for your domain, then forward to Google.
My goal here is to only use the somewhat expensive Google Apps for only important email addresses (eg all the employees), then use the other cheap email server for other email addresses like webmaster and some other unimportant but needed emails.
Google Apps email accounts are free, though they do come with a premium option for 50$/year on a per account basis which offers a few additional features.
I haven't set this up, but from what I understand from reading the docs, you set your MX at Google.  Google will accept messages for accounts that live on the Google domain, and will forward everything else off to a server you configure.
I was wondering: Can you use multiple email servers at once? In this case, I was going to add all the Google Apps MX records then add the MX records of another email server.
