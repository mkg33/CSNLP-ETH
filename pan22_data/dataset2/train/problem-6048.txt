Shut it down.  Let it sit.  Then, boot up some disk clone software and clone it to a hard drive of equal or greater size.
I'd do a clean shutdown and then run chkdsk. Individual files disappearing would not likely be caused by a bad disk, but could conceivably be due to filesystem corruption.
I vote for shutting down the computer ASAP, ripping out the drive, and living with whatever data you have in backups, while you still have it.
SIDE NOTE:  If you don't already, in the future, keep you system and data on separate drives (NOT partitions).  It could simplify this process and spreads the work out.
Also, this really doesn't sound like it's a server or even a workstation, nevermind one that you administer. It sounds like this belongs on superuser.com.
I would use live CD to boot the OS from the CD. This would ensure that malacious software would do no further damage from the current OS on the hard disk. For example: BartPE for Windows. It would detect the harddisk and all the data present on the disk. You can then backup on external USB device like flash drive/hard disk.
