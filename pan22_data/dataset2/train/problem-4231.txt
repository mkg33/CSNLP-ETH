You could use the BIT datatype to represent boolean data. A BIT field's value is either 1,0 or null.
In SQL you use 0 and 1 to set a bit field (just as a yes/no field in Access). In SQL Server Management Studio it displays as a True/False value (at least in recent versions).
As already mentioned by Phil, there's no Boolean data type in SQL Server. So, we need the bigger picture of what you are trying to achieve in order to suggest an alternative.
Returning the string "false" is very different from returning a Boolean value of false (if SQL server had supported Boolean types in the first place), which is why we need a context.
When accessing the database through ASP.NET it will expose the field as a boolean value. Thanks @guffa, This answer from here
You will have to compare the column against something to make the result a boolean the engine can use:
There is not boolean data type in SQL Server. This means you can't return a bool as a column from a SELECT and you can't store a boolean value on a table. However, it's very common to use BIT or VARCHAR data types to represent boolean values. They are not boolean per se, you need to compare them against something to actually use them as a boolean.
This doesn't mean that SQL Server doesn't use boolean logic. These are needed whenever you write filtering or conditional expressions. These are a few:
