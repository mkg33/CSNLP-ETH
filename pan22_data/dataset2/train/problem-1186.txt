And if you say, your software requires a specific AD user to be logged in, that may cause issues as well.  Though you could easily set the virtual machine to autologin to that specific user, but users won't have their own settings/drives that way.
You don't sound like you have a cluster...you sound like you have 50 domain connected PCs that you want to run virtual machines on.
The easiest way to handle it would be a terminal server (or 5 terminal servers) that everyone logs into, then you just have to keep one server up to date.  But that costs money for hardware.
The way I've seen most labs do this is reimaging the computers before each class.  My college used ghostcast controlled by an extra PC in the lab, which would netboot all the PCs at once and send an image with the correct software for that lab.  Then they only had to manage the images on one computer.
You're right, managing updates on the virtual machines will be hard, especially since they won't be powered on most of the time.  You can use software deployment tools in group policies to manage the settings, and that will work, but booting them up at the start of class will take a bit as it updates the software.
