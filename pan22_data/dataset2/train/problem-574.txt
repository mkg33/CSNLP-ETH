Also, you might consider using a pre-built service for this - like running your software on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud and using their Elastic Load Balancing.
For the balancers you could look into LVS at http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/, perhaps running ldirectord and heartbeat to direct traffic and perform failover.
Nginx is awesome as an upstream proxy, I have used it with great success in a configuration doing 1M+ uniques daily
do you need the user sessions to be handled by the load-balancer(s) and always driven to the same web server (if alive)?
When the need for several load balancers arises, you may want to go for a heartbeat configuration, that either will ensure only one balancer mounts the virtual IP for a given domain, (if sessions required, or mount both and feed DNS with two IP addresses for instance). Maybe this should be detailed in another question at the time it becomes necessary (as the tools evolve quickly).See also this link for instance.
For example Varnish, Pound and HAProxy are all good at what they do, but they also have their differences - however, for what you are asking, any of them will do. Personally, I would think you'd be best off with HAProxy, but that's just a guess.
You might be best off reading an article about load balancers to help you decide what kind you need: http://1wt.eu/articles/2006_lb/
