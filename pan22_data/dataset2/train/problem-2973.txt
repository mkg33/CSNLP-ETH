I couldn't find instructions for that particular controller, but if you get into the RAID configuration, you should be able to figure it out.  If not, post the options you see.
Also, just a friendly reminder - modifying the existing RAID set will essentially destroy all of the data currently in RAID5.
Is there a way to use the RAID controller just as a disk controller (no hardware or software RAID configuration) to achieve this? If not, is there a different way to do this?
Depending on the controller firmware, there are usually two ways of doing this.  Some controllers offer a "JBOD" setting that passes the individual disks though.  Other controllers require you to set up a bunch of single disk RAID0 groups, which essentially does the same thing.  Just a little more work.
For reasons that have more to do with the re-purposing of the system and human capital rather than technology, we want to revert to a simpler configuration without a RAID. Ideally, we would like to keep the OS disk as is and mount each one of the other disks independently.
