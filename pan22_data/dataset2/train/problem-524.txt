Since it is linked just to XP, I would be tempted to do a clean install with original media (avoid slipstreamed, or vlite media).  Apply all the patches, do not install any software.
You mention that it only happens for Windows XP and no other operating system.  That is pretty odd.   I think I would want to see if you can replicate the problem on a completely clean install of windows.
If I had to guess it is networking related.  A quick test would be to take a machine that has never had the issue and hook it up to the same connection as a machine that has had the issues and see if you get duplicates.
On the other hand if it only happens to specific machines no matter which user is logged in, then it is machine or network connection related.
No answer per se, but please check the Server Event Logs for any errors when this happens and I bet you could get a good idea.  Or post the errors and someone here will know.
If you move a user to a machine that hasn't had the problem before, and the problem follows them, then it is a user based issue.
