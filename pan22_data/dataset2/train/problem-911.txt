If power is lost and it's just a matter of time before you need to shutdown, do the shutdown.  If this is really a mission critical application there will be a budget for keeping the system online (via an associated cost for the downtime, aka insurace.)  When that happens invest in a very good data center space.
You mention that these two UPSes are connected to two separate circuits.  Are these two circuits connected to the same power panel (and therefore connected to the same upstream power source) or are they connected to two separate power panels each backed by a different generator?
If they are not connected to two separate generators then you might be complicating matters by adding two UPSes.  At large scale, having two separate UPS systems is lost if they are both backed by the same generator.  If they aren't backed by a generator at all, you might just be adding complexity instead of availability.
If you are just trying to maximize your runtime, connect your server to both UPSes and everything else to just one.  Setup the the server power supplies to prefer your dedicated UPS and only shutdown when the shared UPS is low.  You should be able to setup the power supply preference either in the BIOS or via the DRAC/IPMI.  This assumes that the server draws more than all of the other equipment combined (which is probably a fair assumption..?) then again, we're now getting into power math which is it's own beast.
