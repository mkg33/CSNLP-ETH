None of the above affects your local AD, it is much more about considering the impact of AD Connect on Office 365 and managing it properly.
If you are migrating from a local Exchange it is more complex since the local Exchange attributes will be synched including for example email addresses. Converting a mailbox to shared is more fiddly with AD Connect. Get it wrong and you can get unexpected behaviour like a mailbox reverting back from shared to a standard user mailbox.
Essentially once AD Connect is configured the synced accounts are managed locally not in Office 365. So if you disable an account locally it is disabled in Office 365, if you delete an account locally it is deleted in Office 365 etc.
If you synch everything you end up with lots of system accounts listed in Office 365 which is harmless but annoying. If you don't synch everything you need to take care, because if you move a user to an OU that isn't synched then that user will be deleted from Office 365.
AD Connect does not have much impact on your local AD but it does have an impact on Office 365 so the main thing is to be sure you understand this.
