Recently I ran into an app that talk to other computers w/a UDP broadcast  to '255.255.255.255'.  It may use unicast after initial setup, I'm not sure as I've never it actually work.   
As mentioned, normal addresses are routed 'fine' (ping, remote desktop, CIFS file sharing), but not the broadcast address.
internal hosts that are trying to communicate this way, and though I see the broadcast go out on the local net (with the computer doing the sending also sending out a response to itself).  But no sign of the address being accepted or routed through the server.
I use my linux server as a primitive router.  Currently I have it able to use masquerading to talk to the outside world (using a fixed IP), but about a year or two ago, I upgraded the link between my primary workstation and the server to 10Gb.   Everything else in my internal net is on a 1Gb net.  For the most part traffic goes from the internal nets to the outside.  Both use a 192.168 subnet, with the 1Gb talking on 192.168.3.0/24 and the 10Gb on 192.168.4.0/24. 
10Gb would swamp the 1Gb link, so I use iptable's FORWARDING rules when I need to talk to specific addresses on the 1Gb net.
I've tried using source & destination rules to forward the 255.255.255.255 broadcasts to the "other internal net", if it comes from one of the two
