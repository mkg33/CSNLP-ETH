found primarily in Ethernet environments, and is mostly used to bridge networks which have the same media types. Bridges keep a table of destination addresses and outbound interfaces.
You've configured the same subnets at each site across a routed link/interface?  Looks like you [think that you] want to bridge the traffic rather than route it.  If that's the case, you need configure bridging.  Configuring Transparent Bridging
a combination of source-route bridging and transparent bridging that allows communication in mixed Ethernet and Token Ring environments. Translational bridging without routing indicators between Token Ring and Ethernet is also called SR/TLB. For more information, refer to Understanding and Troubleshooting Source-Route Translational Bridging.
Bridging happens at the data-link layer, which controls data flow, handles transmission errors, provides physical addressing, and manages access to the physical medium. Bridges analyze incoming frames, make forwarding decisions based on those frames, and forward the frames to their destinations. Sometimes, such as in SRB, the frame contains the entire path to the destination. In other cases, such as in transparent bridging, frames are forwarded one hop at a time toward the destination.
found primarily in Token Ring environments. Bridges only forward frames based on the routing indicator contained in the frame. Endstations are responsible for determining and maintaining the table of destination addresses and routing indicators. For more information, refer to Understanding and Troubleshooting Local Source-Route Bridging.
Bridges can be either remote or local. Local bridges provide direct connections between many LAN segments in the same area. Remote bridges connect LAN segments in different areas, usually over telecommunication lines.
used to bridge data between different media types. This is typically used to go between Ethernet and FDDI or Token Ring to Ethernet.
