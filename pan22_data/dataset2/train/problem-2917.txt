the clause graph can be analyzed via all kinds of graph theoretic algorithms, is an apparently natural measure of "structure" and with strong connections to measuring/estimating hardness, and it appears that research into this structure and its implications is still at the very early stages. it is not inconceivable that transition point research, a/the traditional and well-studied way to approach this question, might eventually be bridged into this clause graph structure (to some degree it already has). in other words the transition point in SAT may be seen to exist "because of" the structure of the clause graph.
another somewhat interrelated line of inquiry here is the relationship of small world graphs to (hard) SAT structure eg [4,5]
this important paper [1] by Toby Walsh is related to the the SAT transition as measured in the clause/variable ratio. however it goes further in measuring a property called constrainedness, $\kappa$. its a rough or maybe natural measure of hardness such that overconstrained or underconstrained problems are easier than constrainedness at a critical intermediate point. 
it finds an apparent fractal self-similarity structure of hard instances wrt the constrainedess parameter such that as a DP(LL) solver during search tends to find subproblems with the same critical constrainedness no matter which variable is chosen next to branch on. there is some further analysis of fractal structure in SAT instances (such as Hausdorff dimension of SAT formulas & connection to hardness) in eg [2,3]
[2] SELF-SIMILARITY OF SATISFIABLE BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS DECIPHERED IN TERMS OF GRAPH DIRECTED ITERATED FUNCTION SYSTEMS by Ni and Wen
of course the standard point in this area applies that a very definitive answer to this question would be inherently close to a P$\stackrel{?}{=}$NP proof, or that such a proof would (will?) be the best/near-final answer to the question.
there is not a lot of widespread recognition of this concept so far in the literature, but the clause graph of the SAT problem (the graph with one node per clause, and nodes are connected if clauses share variables), as well as other related graphs of the SAT representation, seems to have many basic clues as to how hard the instance will be on average.
