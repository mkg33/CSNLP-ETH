I encrypted a folder, it went through the process, but never showed the directory as green. To confirm that it did not work, I booted to the OSX partition and was able to open all the folders on the Bootcamp partition, including the folder that has encryption turned on. That tells me that the folder is not properly encrypted.
I have a MacBook Pro and I ran Bootcamp to install Windows 10 Pro x64. All is well with both OS's. I know that I can't encrypt the entire Bootcamp drive, but everything I've read points to being able to use EFS to encrypt a folder, which is sufficient for me.
Since you cannot encrypt the whole drive the only option is to use some other product to handle the encryption to hide also the filenames and other metadata.
Other documentation talked about using efsinfo.exe, but I don't find it on my Bootcamp drive and the link to it from Microsoft is no longer available.
Unfortunately EFS works on file level and not folder level. The contents of folders will stay readable even after encryption, only the file contents will be encrypted.
