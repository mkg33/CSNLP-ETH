Every now and then, Windows will just flat-out refuse to connect, throwing up this worthless error message instead:
The 802.11ac standard only works with 5GHz and NOT 2.4GHz.  So, if you purchased an 802.11ac wireless adapter, it's driver is probably tuned to favor 5GHz (802.11ac) over 2.4GHz because of higher speeds.  Now, if your 5GHz signal is weak at your location, you MAY still get more bandwidth than 2.4GHz at the same location with better signal, just because of 802.11ac.  Anyway - You have got two choices:
If I try connecting to the 5 GHz network, which is served by the same router, a Fritz!Box 7490, Windows will do just that. The router is two rooms over, so the signal strength's in the gutter. I need the 2.4 GHz connection.
I have no clue what to do. I have restarted this PC at least a dozen times, deleted and reinstalled the WiFi thingy's drivers, and physically un- and replugged the antenna. It's still not working.
For what seems like months now, my PC running Windows 10 has had intermittent problems connecting to my 2.4 GHz WiFi network.
Some more details, in case they help: My PC's motherboard is an Asus Z170-Deluxe. When building this PC, I went looking for a decent motherboard with built-in WiFi support and found that one. Here's a photo of its back with the antenna plugged in:
I'm fairly certain that it's not the hardware failing. I've got macOS Sierra running on this PC as well and it's got zero issues connecting to either of these networks.
In the Device Manager, it's listed as "Broadcom 802.11ac Network Adapter", which is just about the most generic thing they could've come up with.
The only thing I could gain from that was some nonsense about low signal strength, which is just that: nonsense. Every other device in the room my PC's in (including a Switch, an iPhone, and another cheap laptop running W10) can connect to both networks, no problem.
