The first router also has DHCP reserved address with 192.168.0.2 for the second router (will that now be than LAN IP for 2nd router also?)
Step 1.open configuration page of 2nd router i.e ( by typing the IP address 192.168.0.1 in web browsers address bar) enter Id and password mostly default is admin & admin respectively.
Step 2. after successful login into the routers configuration page find DHCP option and disable it i.e. (DHCP server: Disable ) after that save settings close browser and proceed to next steps.
Step 3. now turn on your 1st Router connect it to the internet. if 1st router successfully connected to the internet. then take LAN cable i.e(assume proper length according to 2nd routers position)  and plug one end into LAN port i.e(mostly yellow in color) of the 1st router.
And can a pc from second router access the admin login of first router? Can they also communicated between since they are on separate routers?
wait for the moment you will see 2nd router is connected to the internet successfully. i.e(if not connected restart both router).
I have 50 Megabits Internet and I'm planning to get another router to give Internet to my friend, I want to limit 25mbs for him and 25mbs for myself I'm going to do that in a way that when I am not using the Internet he will get 50mb and when he is not using the internet I will get 50mb that's some QOS stuff that I know very well but I can only apply limit to IP addresses, will that work if I get a router and plug the cable to ethernet of second router and LAN of first router(the internet one) kind of treat the second router as pc and limit to 25mbs and the second router will have many computers connected to it and can configure DHCP etc.. but I'm a little bit confused about addresses and if there is a better way to do this.
now remains the question of bandwidth allocation. don't worry about that router is build in such way that it serves data in a manner that you both will get EQUITY.
