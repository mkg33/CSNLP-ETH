How does one ensure that the time remains in sync with the time server?  Do i have to deploy vmware tools on the linux host? and then sync the host to the ntp server, the guest with the host and with the ntp server?
Yes, you have to install vmware-tools on the VM client.  Then you can set the box "synchronize guest time with host" button on the VM's Options screen.
How does one ensure that linux hosts, running on vmware infrastruction 3 or vmware 3 esxi remain in sync with the ntp server.  I have found that a linux guest running under esx or esxi has a tendency to have the clock drift in the future.

There's an answer which is already selected (and it is the best answer, since vmware tools gives you so many other advantages), but another option is also to run regular ntpdate commands in the cron. This corrects your clock, however doesn't manage clock drift, but works in a pinch. 
Note that it is somewhat contrary to some of the information in this thread.  For instance, it is specifically recommended not to use the vmware-tools timesync feature anymore.
If you install the NTP daemon on your Linux guest as a client, it will periodically check and make sure your clocks do not drift in the long run. You needn't do any fancy host-guest syncing, because the server is just .. on the net. :)
