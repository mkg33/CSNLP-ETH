At the time I didn't know about the advanced option to import large documents without paging them, so I now have sections with several hundred pages.  And a few shorter documents that are not paged too.
In Onenote go to the FILE menu, then click OPTIONS, then on the left click ADVANCED, then scroll down on the right the second last check box is "Insert long printouts on multiple pages", untick it. problem solved.
For anyone who stumbles across this page with the same problem then the plugin I used was: OneNote Gem at a cost of US$28.
Create a new section and highlight all the pages you want to combine.  Right click and drag and hold on new section.  Once it opens up, let go of right click.  Now export to PDF and assemble.
After a bit of hunting though, I have yet to find a continuous scrolling option or a way of merging pages.
Ideally I'd like to be able to navigate through them as if they were a single document rather than several hundred discrete documents, and merge or regroup the pages by chapter.
I would suggest selecting each page you'd like to combine by pressing control and shift, then clicking each page simultaneously. Once all pages are selected click the share tab then select the E-mail page option. An email draft will be created consisting of all the pages selected combined.Just copy and paste wherever you'd like for editing.

I simply create a new section select all pages needed, move or copy selected pages into my new section, go to file select export select format as current section then convert the section into a pdf.
