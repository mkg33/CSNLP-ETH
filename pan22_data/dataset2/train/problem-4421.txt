Typically, when a user is created without specifying a group with -g or --gid, the default behavior is to set their primary group as their username, and this gid is not placed in the /etc/group file.  Hence files and directories created by the user joe will have ownership joe:joe.  But you will not find group 'joe' in the /etc/group file.
Is this a surprising discrepancy, or is it normal for /etc/group to list only members where the group is secondary?
There exists a program called members you can install on most linux distros that lists the actual members of a group whether it is their primary group or a supplementary group.  
Generally speaking, system administrators should add the user to their primary group's member list in /etc/group because the getpwent() family of system calls will remove duplicates when called.  Programs aren't supposed to read /etc/group or /etc/passwd directly, they are supposed to use the system calls.  All this has been true for at least 20 years now, and probably much longer.
I read this as "production_1 is the only member of the group valid_senders, whose group id is 12345."
