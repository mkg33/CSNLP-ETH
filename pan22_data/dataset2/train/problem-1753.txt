I have a bunch of Dell computers on Windows 7, some with Intel NICs and others with Broadcom, all of which lose their network connection momentarily when resuming from sleep mode.  This fact seems to persist even when setting the NIC to not sleep ("Allow computer to turn off this device to save power" unchecked).  When a user with redirected folders is logs on they will lose their connection until they manually refresh after the NIC reconnects.  I know that I could enable Offline Files to work around this but I'd prefer to keep everything on the server.  I could alternatively disable sleep mode but that's not ideal for obvious reasons.  Are gigabit NICs simply unable to maintain a network connection in sleep mode?  What's the correct way to handle this situation? 
I'm fairly confident this isn't possible. While asleep or hibernating, the system suspends devices and OS-functionality you would need to keep processing data through a NIC and up the network stack. You're best bet is to configure less aggressive power-saving settings.
