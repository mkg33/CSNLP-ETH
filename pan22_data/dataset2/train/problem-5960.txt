SteelEye DataKeeper does block level replication of volumes and has work very well for us in similar circumstances.
If it was just file servers you needed I would throw in a vote for DFSR, as it's block-level, controllable, free(included) and mesh-like it it's replication, but with at least one no-go limitation: (PST's tipped it off to me) Files must be marked closed in order to kick off a replication of the blocks.  If people keep Outlook open, like they always do, 24/7... those PST's will never get replicated in DFSR.  Just another reason to hammer the Exchange admins to block PST creation (or block it on your file servers).  Also a note to check for any solutions you review is open-file sync support to make sure you don't find out the hard way like we did that open files weren't getting replicated.
I have tried both for mirroring an exchange 2003 over WAN, and they failover nicely. The prices are pretty high though.
Check with your sales person, maybe they can get you a good deal on the replication software if you are in the process of replacing your arrays.
Replication via the storage platform is pretty much always going to be the best bet.  Granted the desire to move from one platform to another makes it a lot harder to do as most of the time you can only replicate from one array to another.  Now if you are sticking with HP arrays they should be able to replicate between each other so the replication software cost wouldn't be a waste.
