I want to create a measure using javascript/php in a web app. Not using my Raspberry Pi. Ultimately, I want to deliver said measure as a variable to wearable technology (watches). I want the measure to be represented by the dial on a watch. 
For this I advise not using the Pi at all.  You're going to want a small-sized micro-controller for the real application, which will require a different type of program.  If you go the route of the Pi, you'll end-up with a lot of stuff that doesn't port over, and maybe a little bit of stuff that does. This will almost surely take you down a path that's more like Arduino than it is like Raspberry Pi.
Could the raspberry pi be used to create a prototype of the required technology (of course not used as wearable tech). I'm just trying  to figure out how I would approach such a problem - how I would create it from scratch?
Adafruit (just as an example - I'm not affiliated) has a whole section on "wearables" that includes small micro-controllers and tutorials on how to use them.  I'd start there (www.adafruit.com). Even if you end up buying from someone else, this will help you get a survey.
