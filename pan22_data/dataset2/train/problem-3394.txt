Unix systems might not have an exact equivalent because HyperTerminal does two unrelated jobs which in unix are done by separate programs.
In OS X you have Terminal.app and in Linux you have several choices including xterm and gnome-terminal. I would recommend PuTTY for Windows over HyperTerminal.
This may help.  It's one of the first things that came up when googling "USB serial client".  Note that you'll need to connect to a serial device (not necessarily the one listed on that link) using a terminal client in the *nix variants.  In most flavors of *nix the device will be found in /dev/ after attaching the USB cable.  A quick way to find out which device is to do this:
One job is providing a text terminal inside a GUI environment. This job is done by terminal emulators such as gnome-terminal, konsole, rxvt, Terminal.app, xterm, ...
Minicom is a very nice serial communication program for Linux, over the years I've used it with all kinds of bizarre hardware requiring RS-232 communication. For USB devices the device you'll need to use will be something like /dev/ttyUSB0.
Another job is converting between user interactions and serial port interactions (since you use HyperTerminal to connect to it under Windows, I presume the device uses the serial-over-USB protocol). Under Linux, minicom is often used for this; there are undoubtedly alternatives. Whatever program you choose needs to be connected to /dev/ttyUSB0 (or /dev/ttyUSB1, etc, if you have more than one device).
