I have connected AS 100 with AS 200 using EBGP. Similarly, AS 200 with AS-300 . This I have done using neighbor command.
Also, in the real network - if you advertise each and every routing information to other ISPs then the routing table will become so large. Do we normally do this?
Apart from multiple OSPF area's, which is to limit 50 routers per area, is it really the way internet works. You can ignore the fact that it can be IS-IS or other igp protocols within AS. In simple words, is this a kind of real topology of internet.
Next, my context based question is if this is the typical scenario, then how I can ping 11.11.11.11 from R2.
Do I need to advertise each and every network information of ISP-2 to ISP1 and ISP-3 so that they all can communicate?
But, I believe if we don't do so then how can I communicate to internal network of other ISPs. So, I believe we have to do so. This means routing table will be very large.
I have never worked on the customer premises, but my assumption is that one service provider runs IGP services internally - For example - OSPF or IS-IS.
If so, is it done in the same way in the real network. This will be such a tiring job to advertise each and every network information of ISPs.
Now, when one service provider has to reach another service provider to communicate server on the third service provider, it will pass/transit through another ISP.
How can I do this automatically? I am using CISCO - GNS3 any cisco commands will help. I have explored re-distribute but I haven't understood much.
