I recently setup centralized authentication system using OpenLDAP. Now I need to extend the users that are defined in the database to include a new object class that contains some security related data about them.
Look inside bundled schema if there is the object of your needs (located, on a debian filesystem is /etc/ldap/schema)
As an example (taken straight from openldap manual), if your file contains this it'll add/modify all those fields
After you can modify your ldap entities and attached to them new objectClass (and, by extension, new attribute types).
Here is an example LDIF file to add the objectClass posixAccount to an existing entry uid=testuser,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com of e.g. objectClass inetOrgPerson:
You can run ldapmodify to modify one or more entries, you just need to feed to the program the credentials and a file containing all the changes you want to do
If you want to build your own attribute type and/or your own objectClass you need to request an OID object number (OID Registration).
The - are important to separate the add blocks. One has to make sure that all necessary attributes (for posixAccount homeDirectory, uidNumber, gidNumber) are added in the same file.
The number following the YOUR_ATTRIBUTETYPE/YOUR_OBJECTCLASS must be unique (ie : one number for each attribute)
