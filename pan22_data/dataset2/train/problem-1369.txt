We want to avoid having to support an entire build server Puppet configuration on top of RedHat(/CentOS) just in order to support Oracle so I was beginning to wonder whether we can employ Docker to provide a RedHat-like environment required just for Oracle on top of our standard Ubuntu systems. The idea is that Oracle will run in its own container but the rest of the build agent will still run on standard Ubuntu, able to talk to Oracle over TCP.
There are some hacks about installing Oracle on Ubuntu floating around the net but they seem to be very fragile and a matter of hit-and-miss.
You can use OEL 6.5 LXC Linux Containers ontop of Ubuntu 14.04 as described step-by-step here at my blog:  
This is definitely a feasible approach. We use Ubuntu 14.04 for our host machines and run several Oracle 11g instances within Docker containers for development purposes as well.
Currently (Docker 1.5) for both 11g and 12c the main issue is Docker's hard-coded shared memory limit Issue #2606.  There are currently two workarounds for this:
We are struggling with a common problem of trying to provide an Oracle 11g instance for our developers to test with. Our standard build agents are based on Ubuntu 12.04 but Oracle supports only RedHat based OS's.
I know what LXC's are and the difference between them and full-fledged virtualization like KVM/VirtualBox etc, but I was wondering whether it could still be possible.
