The laptop has a UK style keyboard while the desktop has a Croatian keyboard (I bought it while I was posted there and use the desktop so rarely that I have never purchased a UK/international keyboard). 
p.s. I have NEVER set up a Croatian keyboard on the laptop since I don't know the language well enough for it to be useful and when I remove the keyboard from either PC it gets removed from both.
Anyway, when I set up the desktop to use the Croatian keyboard and then log onto the laptop I have the language bar notification icon (keyboard input change icon) appear in the taskbar, and the keyboard automatically gets set to Croatian. Inversely, when I change the laptop keyboard to English and shut down, the desktop PC seems to be set to the English language when I boot it up.
Basically, I have two different PC's (one is a desktop and one a laptop) with windows 10 set up on each and I use the SAME user account on both PC's linked to my Microsoft account. 
The first time this happened was a real pain to sort since my windows password at the time contained a y (or z, don't remember which) and these keys are inverted on the Croatian keyboard, so I couldn't log onto the system.
Does anyone know how to set up one keyboard on the desktop and one on the laptop without having them link this way through the user account?
