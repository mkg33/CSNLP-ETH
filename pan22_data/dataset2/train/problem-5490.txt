Best is relative, but there's a few tools I've used over time for this. For local, file level backups I use bvckup 2 - the newer version is currently in beta, and free for now (and 20 dollars once released) and there's an older version here, but this is one of those applications that I wouldn't mind paying for. It does incremental, automatic backups, so its pretty fast after the initial scan.You can set it to do periodic schedules or backup in real time. 
CrashPlan is a tool that you can download and use for free if you're backing up to a local volume. You can schedule it, and it will only back up changed files to conserve space. It would also allow you to back up files to a point-in-time, which can be handy. You want the 'green' option when you get to their website.
Its got a load of configurability, so it can't be all that hard to get it tweaked to your precise needs. 
If its for remote backups, I use bitorrent sync - it does encrypted, remote file backups, with nearly no configuration, and works on nearly everything I've thrown it at - I've even backed up over 100gb of small files over wifi to a raspi I use as a poor man's nas.
