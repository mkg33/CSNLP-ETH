Since your server is running prefork mode, this means that each connection gets its own process - so first of all check to see whether there are 1024 or so httpd processes running on the system.
have a serious problem. I've got virtual server which runs Apache and two web project with a lot of visitors (about 5 hits per second). My server starts to shut down by itself. In error log I found this problem

This will then allow you to view the state of connections to your server and try to figure out just what's causing all the connections to be consumed.
My suspicion is the possibility of some kind of rogue proxy or rewrite statement which is causing the server to continually loop its connections within itself until all of them are consumed.
