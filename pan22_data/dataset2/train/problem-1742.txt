I'm running Google Chrome. When I do anything that'll save a file to my local filesystem - right-click and "Save As", click a download link, save an image - nothing happens for a good 20-30 seconds, and then suddenly the operation proceeds as normal.
The browser remains responsive whilst this is going on - I can navigate to other pages and so on - but the delay is infuriating. Especially since it often looks like nothing's happening, so I'll hit the download link again - and again - and then suddenly end up downloading four copies of the same file.
Then see what's happening on the filesystem, Filtering on your path. See if Chrome is waiting or another process.
Another common problem on Windows Vista or Windows 7 is when performance is much worse after installation of updates - that you may not be aware off. Usually this problem goes away after a few reboots. 
I ran into this issue a few months ago, on a freshly built computer. The slowdown began after 3 months of use. I am actively researching this problem.
Do you face the same problem when you are using another browser such as Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer? If so, then the problem most likely has to do with Windows.
If you have recently install any new applications, use Windows' System Restore to rollback the changes.
