It would be better if you did not remove the directory, but instead of cd ..; cd - you could do cd $PWD.
By cd .. and cd (directory) you move up and back into the (newly created) directory, and the files are there as you expect.
I have a directory, containing files generated by compiler. During each rebuild this directory gets cleaned and, after build process ls gives me empty output. After I cd out of directory and then back to it ls works right. 
What @Kent said or: don't remove the directory but only its contents, this way you can stay in the directory (without "cd .. && cd -") and "ls" does what you expected it to do.
create an alias refresh="cd .. && cd -" that will go a directory up and then again cd into the previous directory
Your script is most likely removing the directory, and not just the files which are there.  So, when you have cd'd into it, and the directory is removed, you do ls on a directory which does not actually exist.
The best alternative is instead of cding in and out of the directory, is to add the directory name to your ls command, and run it from the parent directory.  So, ls YourSubdirectory instead of just ls.
