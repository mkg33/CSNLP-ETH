We want to get functionality similar to Yousendit or one of the other services that allows end users to upload large files. But we have a few Linux servers and want to use these instead of a third parties.
Apache has a tendency to use as much memory per process as the uploaded file is in size. That will kill your server very soon if you continuously receive large files.
There seems to be software for practically everything else for Linux, I can't believe there isn't something that will meet our needs.
You can customize the email message, logo, etc. they charge based on how many uploads you do per month and how much data if I recall correctly, but it wasn't much.
I've used a rebranded sendthisfile.com for a while and it worked great, but my use is sporadic and I couldn't justify paying for it when I run my own servers. I just installed and configured Droopy on Ubuntu 12.04. It uses Python. It seems pretty solid.
http://drop.io is really slick and free up to 100MB in file size; may also have an embedding/customizing option.
Have you tried to setup lighttpd for your upload receiving needs? It should behave in a more sane manner: saving chunks to a temporary directory you define and not consuming all the RAM you have.
Externally: a public Web server serving a directory accessible by a CIFS share, which users can e-Mail out.  BasicAuth configuration for password protection, if necessary.  Client side tools for encryption.  Tons of options here in general.
If you don't mind spending money, I've (easily) branded/integrated a YouSendIt "corporate" account within a Website I was doing contract work for: we embedded the YouSendit form into a page on the site; took all of 15 minutes maybe.
