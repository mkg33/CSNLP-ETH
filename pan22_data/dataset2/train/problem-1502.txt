Part of it comes down to what's supported, you might have PE's running older code that don't support FEC129.
It's not necessarily that a single VPLS domain ONLY signals with BGP and ONLY discovers with LDP, it's the fact that you can interoperate within the FEC 128 standard (and FEC129).  I definitely think you're usually going to select one and run with it, but there are all kinds of environments out there.

I've always used the FEC128 multi-home method described in the link with BGP auto-discovery and it works just fine - if I understand your question correctly.
FEC128 on Junos will support running individual mesh groups inside of a single VPLS instances (1 or more group of LDP signaled PE's, 1 group for BGP signaled PE's).  You can configure them to interoperate by configuring a border PE to be a member of both the BGP signaled group, and LDP signaled group.  That way if you are signaling with LDP in one area, and you want to introduce BGP in another - both can work together.
