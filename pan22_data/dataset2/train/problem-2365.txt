As far as I know, the physical radio behaves the same whether it's an AP or a station – at least in "simpler" modes like 802.11b/g/n (perhaps it's more complex in 802.11ac). That is, it does not need to switch between incompatible "AP" and "STA" behaviors.
Instead it just sends different kinds of frames. If the firmware allows it, then it can freely send "AP-like" and "STA-like" frames at the same time. This is especially true for "SoftMAC" devices, which (unlike "FullMAC" ones) defer most of the control to the OS and drivers.
I don't really know how it works; I'm just writing the post because I have tested it on my own hardware.
I always find the Arch Linux Wiki a good source. There‘s also a section „Wireless client and software AP with a single Wi-Fi device“.
Yes, it can be done (depending on Wi-Fi device capabilities). I believe "Wi-Fi Direct" turns it into an official feature (e.g. a TV simultaneously acting as a station on the home network, and as access point for direct video transfer), but it's also possible to have just a regular AP.
