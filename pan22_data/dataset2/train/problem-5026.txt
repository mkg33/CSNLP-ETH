Assuming that you manage the fiber yourself (dark fibre, your own runs...etc), then yes - this should be possible as long as you have the proper configuration on both sides of the Cisco ISA570.
We have 2 network rooms in our building and each are connected via a fiber link. One room is very tiny and is where our Comcast Internet comes into the building. I want to place our Cisco ISA570 into the other network room which is much larger and easier to work in so I must get the Comcast Internet over to the large network room and into the ISA570.
This will work as you've outlined, however if there are any other devices on Vlan 1 on either switch they will be "outside" of the ISA570.  It will be better to create a new VLAN (999 for example) and place port 1 of each switch in that VLAN. You'll also need to ensure that each switch is configured to carry the new new VLAN between the two.  This will logically connect the cable modem to the Internet/WAN port of the ISA.
Since both of the switches are connected over the fiber link, I assume VLAN 1 traffic would egress the small room switch and arrive at the large room switch still tagged as VLAN 1 and would egress port 1 on that large room switch into the ISA570. And the reverse is also true.
If you are using cisco gear configure the interswitch ports as trunks (never know when you may want to pass other things between the rooms). Using VLAN 1 in cisco land is considered bad form, so create say vlan 10 in both cisco boxes, in the switch in the small room the Comcast box is connected to an access port with vlan 10, then trunk vlan 10 between the cisco devices. Then anything on configured on vlan 10 in the large room goes directly to Comcast, you can use other vlans for things you don't want internet access to.
