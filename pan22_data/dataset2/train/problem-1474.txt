How about a 'Find the Item' game where you hide an item somewhere in the play / act / scene.  You have a time scroller so you can go back and forward through the play enactment looking for that item hidden somewhere in one scene.  And/or you could have multiple items flashed to the player before the game begins and he has to find as many as he can in a time limit.  Have multiple decoy items, or have all items selectable so you can click any item for an answer.
How about a theater manager game, where you can hire actors, upgrade the scene. You get money based on the audience. The actors could also have experience levels and/or stats. You could also expand this game to other plays, or make some mini-games in it, like some button-mashing, some kind of "improvise" mini-game etc.
'Shakespeare Hero' - Have the words come at you while they are being spoken/presented, and either type them as a typing test, or click them to a certain rhythm (ha, can't really see how this would work, but it would be funny!)
'Mystery' - Have the player watch a scene, and ask her a question afterwords.  The question could be about the written content (ie: Who said "...."), or have the actors 'randomly' doing quirky things not related to the play, such as scratching, sitting, sneezing, etc, then quiz them on who did what.
There there's an obvious 'tomato throw' game.  Try to hit the actors by launching tomatoes at them, or target non-actors too, depending on the objective.
