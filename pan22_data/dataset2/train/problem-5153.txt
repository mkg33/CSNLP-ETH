It may be interesting to see if you can actually ftp to the server.  You may want to use telnet or netcat and rfc959 to see if you get any low level responses that could clue you in to where and what is responding on that port.
As previously mentioned, I'm posting here to re-itterate; this is common if you're nmap'ing from behind a NAT'd router. Are you running NMAP from behind your home ADSL or Cable modem. I see this all the time with my Apple TimeCapsule. It can give you a shock the first time you see it :)
Maybe there is some kind of NAT on this machine or any other router on the way? Check output of iptables-save (if it's Linux)
Plus, try nc -l tcp 21 to see if you can listen on the port 21. If you can't and nothing is showing up on netstat, you might be compromised. Try rootcheck to see if it finds something (since chkrootkit didn't found any: http://www.ossec.net/rootcheck ).
Try nmap'ing another address on the same network which you know is unused; if that also shows the port open, then someone is NAT'ing your traffic somewhere else.
