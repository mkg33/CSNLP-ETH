Keep in mind that one basic rule for the ASA is that to initiate traffic from a lower-security interface(Outside) to a higher security interface(Inside) there must be a explicit ACL entry to allow this traffic through. Without seeing your ASA configuration it is hard to tell what could be causing the problems. 
It seems like the server itself naturally responds to your crafted SYN packet with the RST-ACK in packet#23 (of the inside cap, see above) -- probably because port 8000 is closed.  This will prompt the Firewall to forward the RST to the Outside (Packet#23 in Outside cap), and purge this connection from its state table.
In your inside capture, there are two packets going from the Server (10.1.102.19) to the Client (10.1.202.1), but they are coming from different MAC addresses. 
That seems weird, but is probably not your problem.  As far as I can interpret it, your problem is as follows:
But your crafted SYN-ACK packet fires off in #25 (of the inside cap), prompting a RST from the Firewall (#26) because there is no entry in the connection table related to this flow.
You are describing normal/defaul operation of the ASA.  Only established TCP connections are allowed from OUTSIDE to INSIDE.  You can disable this by configuring TCP State Bypass.
By default, the ASA randomizes the sequence numbers in the handshake (to prevent session hijacks).  So your sequence numbers don't actually match.   You can turn off that feature.
