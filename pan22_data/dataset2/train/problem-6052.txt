Because of the low-level hooks that VirtualBox (or any VM software) makes into the host OS and its hypervisor, I don't think its possible to install the 32-bit version of the host software onto a 64-bit operating system.
Is this COM automation of VirtualBox itself or of an app running in a VM?  You can run a 32-bit OS on a VM running on 64-bit VirtualBox.
Have you tried this yet?  Most 32 bit applications should run just find under Vista 64.  If you run into any problems or if you have any specific problems errors, please update your question with more details.
Unfortunately, I can't find any documentation for VirtualBox's installer's command line switches, which might let you override the OS's bit-level detection.  My guess is that there is just no way, for the reason I described above.
The easiest way would to be to install Vista 32 bit as a guest OS. If you have a retail version, you should be able to use the same key for that without problem. Then you could program on that guest OS and install Virtualbox 32 bit on that guest OS. This first layer will be hardware accelerated an the second layer will then be software accelerated, now it's only dependent on the amount of memory you have available for this.
The actual virtual machine monitor in virtualbox is a device driver in windows (exactly the same as VMware or VirtualPC).  The Networking and USB components of virtualbox are also device drivers.
If you don't have the amount of memory needed or you need the second layer to be hardware accelerated then you would need to do a dual boot.
