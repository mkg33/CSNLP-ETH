I want to build a custom irrigation control system using the Raspberry PI.  The main obstacle I have to getting started is knowing how I can use the Raspberry PI to send power to the valves to open and close them.
Standard irrigation typically runs at 12V. It's easy to figure that out with a voltmeter. Certainly you'll need relays or MOSFETs to gate the power; you can run it on the GPIO ports.
I think the easiest way might be add a USB relay board.  Then take your 24V AC power from the existing irrigation and wire through the relays. 
I've actually done something similar (drive valves from a datalogger's digital IO ports). A relay is definitely necessary as most irrigation systems are AC (I used Netafim valves, 24 VAC). To drive the relay directly from the GPIO you'll need to step up the power with a transistor, e.g. a 2N2222A.
I currently have an existing irrigation system and control system, so everything is already wired, setup, and working. 
From what I have read, I'll need an add-on board to be able to drive the valves...that's where I need the help.  I'm looking for some direction on where to look next.
I essentially want to write some software for the PI, remove the existing irrigation controller and replace it with the PI and drive the irrigation using the custom software.
Here are some options. It sounds like you are fairly unsure about what is necessary, so these will cut down on the learning curve compared to full DIY.
I have done what your trying to do and I used a i2c relay board and some custom software I put together to turn in on and off as needed
