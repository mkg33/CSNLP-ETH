In the spirit of Jonathan Barton's contribution above, I developed a little Windows C# command-line application to deal with this problem, and allow the mouse to move smoothly across multiple monitors, and also to wrap-around between left-most and right-most monitors. Note that this program does not require a "heuristic" to determine when the cursor is near the screen edge, so the cursor flows very smoothly across the edges.
This issue seems to be present in Windows 10 when there is a gap between two displays in the 'Select and rearrange displays' config section. I was able to fix the issue by slightly moving the two displays towards each other so there is visually no gap between them. See example
MouseUnSnag also addresses this related superuser.com question about the cursor getting stuck on edges of monitors of differing heights:
Temporary fix.  I returned to my Logitech wireless mouse.  I'd been using a Minicute left hand mouse, but it gets stuck.  So far, the Logitech M705 mouse does not. Logitech must have seen it coming.
I developed an application to deal with this issue as Microsoft evidently seem intent to ignore it.  You can get it from here: http://www.jawfin.net/nsm
I don't know if this will help others. But, I simply dragged the monitor numbers to move #1 to where #2 was and vice versa. It worked. And, so far (fingers crossed) it has not reverted to the mouse sticking problem. Good luck.
