-Setting up SMTP routing within the local Internet domain  (http://www.h2l.com/help/help85_admin.nsf/f4b82fbb75e942a6852566ac0037f284/7f9738a49efc4f58852574d500097b01?OpenDocument)
-Smtp Listener task changed to Enabled to turn on the Listener so that the server can receive messages routed via SMTP routing
On the Domino server, I also have hMailServer installed on port 25. I configured Domino to use port 26.
-I'm using the hMailServer (which have the local "preview.local" domain name) to send mail to preview@preview.notes.
What I need to do is be able to send a mail from somewhere else to a domino user that will be redirected to his account.
Is using the Domino Smtp server instead of hMailServer will solve the problem? I can Telnet the Domino Smtp Server.
I have been trying for a couple of days to set up a Domino 8.5 server. Basically, I want everything to be run inside a local network. Right now I can send email to other user in the Domino directory without any mail address. I am pretty new to all this stuff, so maybe the answer will be really obvious.
