If you make your own system, you still have to draw inspiration from somewhere, so I recommend making your own system inspired by FATE or GURPS. That way you can easily make changes that benefit the gameplay and simplify the implementation.
At the end of the day, the most limiting resource is going to be your time.  Do you want to dedicate your time to making a game or making a framework?
However, your situation is different. Neither FATE nor GURPS are frameworks that are designed for browser based RPGs. So the question is about adapting them, not about using them. Adapting an existing tabletop system for an online RPG is non-trivial and likely an overwhelming task for an average person who writes their first online RPG.
Generally, when you start without experience you should go with the existing solution instead of inventing something new.
Making an engine is a lot of work.  Since you're at the point in your development where you are asking this question, I would recommend making one.  I think every game developer should write at least one engine.
Once you've written your own, and it works for your first game, that's awesome.  You'll learn how and why frameworks work -- you'll learn about some of the goofy things that seem simple on the surface but are surprisingly difficult to handle in an abstract way.  You'll also learn more about what the popular frameworks are doing behind the scenes.
