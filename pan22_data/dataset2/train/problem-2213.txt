One thing we really liked was the ability in FMS to publish at multiple bit levels, because we were streaming to churches in remote
I would say use flash. Go with wowza media server 2, try using http dynamic streaming for live playback, using osmf player. 
If requirements are small and not 24/7, you might want to use Wowza for ec2, for hourly basis setup :-)
locations they could only handle say 256kbps, whereas those in the city or at home could handle 1500kbps, and FMS let the user switch on the fly without a dropout in stream. It would even automatically switch down a bitrate if the local connection couldn't keep up.
That said, we didn't look into the Windows Media Server much because we didn't have any developers with experience in it, so I can't provide a fair comparison.
Adobe FMS does have a free authentication add-on, which can be download from here; https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=fmle3
We went with FMS because of its built in fuctionality with flash clients, and was still pretty cheap (in context) to license. It also came with some demo apps that almost perfectly suited our needs. In fact if it's <= 5 users then the demo license will be fine.
I'd go with Flash, but there are other solutions other than FMS to stream with, such as Wowza Media Server 2 (http://www.wowzamedia.com/products.html).
