So xen02.domain.com is the FQDN of my system running Xen.  The :X represents the "Desktop number" in VNC speak.   The NNNN would  be the port number on which VNC listens to.  To connect to the VNC console, I would then open a VNC session to xen02.domain.com:NNNN and I'll see a nice GUI to manage everything.
I don't mean to be rude but you said you only have 1 month of experience with Linux.  I don't know you or your previous experience but if I were to guide myself based on people who I've worked with who only have 1 month of Linux experience, setting up an orchestrating solution for VMs might be a bit much.  Why not try to make use of the built-in management tools instead?
We run open source Xen for virtualization purposes and although I have to admit I didn't do the setup, here's what I know:
If you're coming from a Windows workstation OR you want a GUI to use when managing from Linux, there's (either by default or perhaps it requires additional configuration, not 100% sure) a VNC session you should be able to connect to.  That VNC session will give you a GUI to stop/start/restart VMs.  In my case:
