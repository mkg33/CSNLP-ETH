Or would it be better if the host OS is Debian server (for stability or whatever as it's going to be on 24/7) and I let my GUI run as a virtualised guest? 
The uptime of the virtual machine will be a fraction of the uptime of those host no matter what. Not to mention I tend to experience better uptime on bare metal than in a hypervisor to begin with.
So how about if I do this: I install Ubuntu on it (as GUI desktop) with virtualbox, and then a debian server as a virtualbox guest. (Alternatively, the same setup with KVM). My plan is to let this PC be running 24/7, and the server will host a website and some more stuff, but nothing that is too critical, so only for myself and some friends (and no, not porn or illegal software or anything like that). Then I can use the Ubuntu as a normal desktop, while the Debian server is running virtualised.
But make sure to keep the expectation that VMs would go down whenever there is an issue with PC and it will happen, and mostly at times when you don't want it to happen.
It is not unreasonable at all. I have couple of windows 7 PCs running vmware workstation and servers on it as VMs and those have been up and running for quite a while.
I would say as a rule of thumb select the one that needs the highest percentage uptime and make that your host os.
I have a PC with lots of RAM (16GB) and a fast CPU (core i5). I would like to use this one machine both as a server and a deskop pc.
