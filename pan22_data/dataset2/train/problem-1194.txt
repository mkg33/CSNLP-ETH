I've made a game where you can shoot some cans, but I want to add an effect when a can is shot. You know, a kind of explosion or something like that. The way the game works now is: when the can is shot it disappears destroy(gameobject), but I want to add an effect before it disappears. Any suggestions? I want to keep it simple. The effect has to be in within the same method where I destroy the cans.
Especially the Explosions Section https://unity3d.com/de/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial/explosions?playlist=17147
For a 3D game, a simple particle effect spawned at the location of the can would be easy enough to do.  For a 2D game, you could use a particle effect or a sprite animation at the point of impact.  Heck, add a sound effect.  Doing any of those could happen inside your Shot() function, ideally by calling a Subroutine.  Just don't make the effect a child of the can, or it won't finish before the object is destroyed.
I recommend you create a prefab with a particle system(or set of them) that also has a despawn timer script attached to it. The particles can be used for an explosion. The despawn script will wait a certain amount of time or until particle systems finish and will be attached to the top-level of the prefab. If you don't know about Prefabs, I suggest you research them because they are uber useful. You can use the Instantiate(Object theObject) function to spawn that prefab. You can make a public GameObject field in the MonoBehaviour of that Shot() method. This would allow you to simply drag the prefab from the Asset Explorer into the properties window for that object.
