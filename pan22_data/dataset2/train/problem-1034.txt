In order to ensure the connection between them, we've changed the user that runs the email server and we've given to him read/write permissions. 
As long as I know, with this schema, problems with permissions are avoided ensuring that users and passwords are identical in both devices. As far as I know, SYSTEM user can't be manipulated in order to achieve this.
We're trying to connect an email server with a NAS device. Email server runs over Windows 2003 Server and NAS device with Open-E. No "Active Directory", just shared folders with CIFS.
The problem comes with Plesk Control Panel wich runs on the email server and lets the users manage his mail domains. With Filemon (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896642) we've discovered that Plesk retrieves information about the size of the folders with the process 'sysinfo.exe' wich is loaded by the SYSTEM user. As I said before, no active directory, just shared folders with CIFS. Obviously this access results in 'ACCESS DENIED'.
