If all encryption is done by your program or "service", you just need to apply compression before actual encoding. It is a common technique, and will increase safety too.
A variation on this if your packaging solution doesn't itself support encryption and so on could be to:
Depending on the encryption software you are using, there may be an option for to compress as well as encrypt.  What encryption tool are you using?
Now you have an encrypted compressed volume containing the files you need.  Next step, to create your installation packager:
The proper way to handle this would be to decrypt the data, compress it, then re-encrypt that compressed archive. 
One option you could try is to decrypt the files, then use an archiving app like 7-Zip or WinRAR to compress them, and use the toolâ€™s built-in encryption function. In fact, modern version of such utilities not only allow you to encrypt the files, but even the filenames, so that the archive is truly opaque without the passphrase.
These utilities also have the ability to create self-extracting archives, usually with various levels of functionality (eg creating shortcuts, running scripts, etc.), thus allowing you to create a compressed and encrypted installer.
As Zach said you can't really compress encrypted data ( you might get 1 or 2% compression if you are lucky).
