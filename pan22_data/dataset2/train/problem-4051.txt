I personally would recommend finding an oldschool repair guy to do this since they'd already have the parts and skills needed. In my case I'm currently stuck at a blown transistor and am debating converting my old screen to LEDs ;)
Like I said, I have to do this 8 to 10 times before it finally turns on. I believe it can't be a faulty button just because pressing it 10 or even 100 times just doesn't make it work, I have to disconnect and reconnect it.
You  want to look for domed, leaky or otherwise flawed capasitors, and replace them with quality capasitors (I've had reasonable luck with off brand cheapies, but this is good advice. There's a ton of great guides worth looking at - this is the one I used.
This monitor will only turn on on 1 out of 8 or 10 attempts at pressing the "power" button, only after I had disconnected and reconnected it to the power line before each attempt, i.e.:
I'd check to see if its the backlight (you can get replacement inverters online) with a flashlight - if you see an image, you basically have it narrowed down there.
I'd note that bad capacitors are symptomatic of other issues and its going to be a massive timesink fixing these. I have a monitor with a near complete capasitor replacement that's not usable cause the backlight power unit may have a bad transistor as well.
