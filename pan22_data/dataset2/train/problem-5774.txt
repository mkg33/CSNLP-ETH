I have the same problem. I have an exam with 2 versions required. When I print without hidden text, all the spaces and formatting disappears, so I just get a list of questions without spaces for answers. The only way I can find, without coding or macros etc, is to add text boxes for the answers with the hidden text within.
What the above will do is substitute each hidden character with an underscore character (or other replacement character(s)). This solved the problem of words of varying length for me.
The text inside the text box can then be hidden, but the text box will stay there, taking space with its fixed with.
The answer provided by soandos was a good start for me. However, when replacing text of variable length, it's not very convenient to use a fixed number of underscore characters.
To search by the hidden attribute, go to find and replace, and then with the focus on find, click the Format->Font button.
This should update all occurrences. (If not you can use Alt+Ctrl+Shift+S and then right click on your style to select all)
What you are going to want to do is before printing, do a find and replace by the hidden attribute to ______, and then print (but don't save) that copy.
