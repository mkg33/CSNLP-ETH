If your try to run an applet the latest version of Google Chrome removed support for NPAPI.to enable it go To Chrome open a new tab and paste the line bellow in it and press enter
If you are using 64-bit Windows, only IE supports 64-bit Java. Chrome and Firefox will only work if you install the 32-bit Java.
Just now I ran into this issue, which was caused by an MSI installer trying to update Java and fracking things up. Basically Chrome looks at registry to find a better java version than the System32 one, so it accesses this registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MozillaPlugins inhere @java.com/JavaPlugin,version=x.x.x is where the RIGHT path of the plugin is defined. Check that Path entry against the actual path and if it's not matching, that this is the issue. In a 32 bit Windows 7 it should be (or mine is) "C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\plugin2\npjp2.dll".
I agree about the 32 bit Java for Chrome. Anyway, after installing Java for the gazillionth time, still not finding the plugin in chrome, I went to the control panel and clicked on Java 32bit. The Java Control Panel opened. Under the security tab I checked Enable Java Content in the Browser. Under the Advanced tab I checked the box under Java Plugin. Restart chrome and voila! :) Hope this works for you; I've been dealing with this problem for at least a month.
I did all the above however after half an hour still cannot get it to run. I reviewed all steps, I already did correct. Eventually found that although I had closed the chrome user interface, the service still running which means chrome has not yet been restarted, so I killed that chrome process running in background, and IT WORKS!
