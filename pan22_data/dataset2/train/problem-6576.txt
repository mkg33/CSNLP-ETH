The problem I'm running into stems from having these Pis connected to the same network, and then same DHCP server, via ethernet and WiFi - There is a race-like condition that means the rest of the network, when using names to address these Pis, can't deterministically prefer the ethernet connections over the WiFi.
I'm running a Raspbian on a bunch of Raspberry Pis. They each have a unique hostname set in /etc/hostname and the dhcp client correctly registers that name with my router.
I'd like to make the Pis report a different hostname to the network DHCP server when obtaining a lease based on which interface they connect with. This seems to be possible in a static way by adding a lines like the following to /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf.
Looking into the docs for dhclient.conf(5), it suggests I can use the concat function from dhcp-eval(5) but I'm not having success. I'm trying this:
If you dhclient call in verbose mode (dhclient -cf myconfig.conf -v) it will tell you about the syntax error it otherwise silently ignores.
