The keyboard is large enough for touch-typing and the screen is sizable (for a netbook) and sharp. It's surprisingly fast, and light, and it runs cool. All in all it's a surprisingly sweet little computer, and quite visually attractive as well.
The Dell Mini 12 is one contender. It's got the roominess of a full laptop, but the portability of a netbook.
Before buying one, try spending some time coding on one.  The small, rearranged keyboard might kick your productivity in the face.  For instance, I have a Dell Mini9 and I would never code with it.  Its keyboard is hard to do home-row typing.  The trackpad mouse is too close to the spacebar and I keep tapping it as I type, moving the focus to wherever the mouse cursor happened to be.
I'm waiting for more detail about the Acer 1820PT. It's a convertible with multitouch and a better than average processor for an ultra portable. Sounds ideal for a Windows developer with all the new Windows7, Silverlight 4, and Windows Phone 7 goodness.
If you're really after a netbook, then I would recommend the Samsung NC20. I have owned one for the last month and have found it quite satisfactory for coding on, but I probably wouldn't want to do so all of the time. I run Windows 7 on it and upgraded it to 2GB RAM.
I have a Dell mini 9 which is great as a web device but way too slow (even with an upgraded SSD) for Visual Studio development.The bad news is it tends to be processor bound to so many netbooks in the same class will have similar performance problems, I think.
Those specs with a decent processor should be sufficient to run VS.  I recommend ASUS' netbook offerings, particularly the Eee PC EPC1000HE, which has garnered fantastic reviews all around.
