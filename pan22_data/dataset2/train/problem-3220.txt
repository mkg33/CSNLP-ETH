If the ZIP file is downloaded to C:\Users\your_user_name\Downloads and you were to extract the archive into that directory, then a directory named mysql-5.6.22-win32 would exist inside C:\Users\your_user_name\Downloads. This folder contains all the MySQL files. 
If you're having trouble with the installation process, I would recommend using the installation packages available from the web site, unless you have some specific need to use the ZIP archive.
You would then need to move that folder into the Program Files folder, giving the MySQL root directory a full path of C:\Program Files\mysql-5.6.22-win32
A file was supposed to be created at C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1. I don't have a MySQL directory in Program Files. I also searched my computer for the file but couldn't find it.
The archive is a compressed version of the MySQL directory structure. When you extract this archive you'll find that it creates a directory called mysql-5.6.22-win32 inside whichever directory you told it to extract to.
NB: The exact name of the MySQL folder will differ depending upon the version you downloaded. Mine is 5.6.22-win32, but yours may differ.
I asked this question on Stack Overflow as well, but decided I had to ask it here too. I have been trying for quite some time to install MySQL Server. I have read the documentation countless times, but can't even find a hint of what to do. It is really, really frustrating me.
