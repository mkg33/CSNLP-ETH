My gameboy micro (if that's an old enough console ^^) hasn't got two but six buttons (+ the 'cross')
I'm curious that most console controllers released these days - and all handheld consoles - contain four main buttons rather than two. Obviously increases in processing power, graphics engines etc, have allowed for more complex games, but is there an argument to be made that two buttons are really enough to create some great games? In other words, would someone releasing a new handheld console on the market today be foolish not to include four?
A simple top X list of NES or Gameboy games would be argument enough that you can make great games with two buttons (plus directional control).
Limiting the game designer by only offering two main input buttons is simply bad design.  Yes, a great game may only need a single input, but that does not mean all games should.  
But there is also plenty of games that would be either impossible to make for 2 button input, or would be so cumbersome to play they would no longer be considered top X material.
In short, having few or many buttons does not mean your game will be a hit or a miss, the game itself and how well it works with the controls your target system has to offer is more important than the number of buttons the player has to use.
If a game developer chooses to use only two of the four available main press buttons, that is currently an option.
