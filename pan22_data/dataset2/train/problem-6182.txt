Almost any major application has been packaged for some major linux distribution.  This can be very helpful to you because almost everyone provides the scripts and information needed to build a given package.
By the way, when you are thinking of installing from source, consider creating a package for your distribution's package manager on a test system and install the package on the production system. Package management systems are a blessing for administrators. Give them a chance.
So in addition to reading the manual, one thing I will do is simply go look at what the listed dependancies are in the package repositories.
For example if you needed to build PHP you might go take a quick look at all the build-depends for the php5 package http://packages.debian.org/source/sid/php5.  The package information pages include links off to the web sites generally if for some reason you wanted to rebuild everything from scratch.
How does system administrators identify which dependencies are missing when installing an application from source code? 
We don't install from source if it's at all avoidable. Otherweise, by reading the documentation and, when in doubt, trial and error which means usually to read (and understand!) the error messages during configure and make.
