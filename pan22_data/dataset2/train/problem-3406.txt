Assuming the CPU fan is plugged into the motherboard correctly, I would assume that something with its electronics (which communicate with the motherboard to indicate fan speed, etc.) are defective and contact the vendor to arrange for a warranty replacement.
The fan and motherboard are both working fine, and the cpu is not overheating (you can leave it on the BIOS "health" screen for ages and the cpu temperature doesn't get above about 45C).
I've had the very same problem -- a perfectly working cpu fan which when on automatic control comes to a halt, and so the motherboard prints that the cpu fan has failed and switches off.
If you can plug that fan into a different motherboard, and it works okay there, then you may have a defective motherboard on your hands, but I suspect it's most likely the fan.
Unfortunately if you disable the fan control (and power-off on fan fail) in the bios then the case fan I have is incredibly loud (since it's at full speed), so I had to combine this with a separate fan controller for the system/case fan.  These two combined solve this problem for me, but the main problem seems to be that the cpu fan control by the motherboard is a bit too aggressive at slowing it down, and I guess that some fans stop rather than running fast enough for the fan check to be happy.
It may be possible (although I haven't tried) to disable the motherboard fan control so they run at full speed, and then to slow down the fans once you've booted an OS using something like SpeedFan (on windows).
