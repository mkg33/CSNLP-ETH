Is it possible that the Ubuntu machine has IPV6 configured, and the slow down is it trying everything on IPv6 first?
So. Open /etc/fstab. sudo nano -w /etc/fstabAnd search for the "defaults". Change it to noatime,barrier=0 . Save the file and exit (ctrl+x, y).There is also an another entry with "remount" in that field (where the other had 'default'). Write it like you put a comma and write the noatime stuff behind. Like this:
errors=remount-ro,noatime,barrier=0 (not sure if the 'errors=remount-ro' is the one what you'll have, just check it.)
You can remove the firewall with: sudo apt-get remove --purge ufw (Didn't find any point in using UFW, you can still use iptables (its a wrapper anyway)).
But the internet and FF is going at very good spedd in thevirtual machine which is inside the ubuntu with window 2008
Also, you can try disabling barriers. Its a mount option for ext4. Will make it much faster, but if you encounter a power outage or something, you may lose data. So think. (To be honest I use it with that , I had some power loss, etc, no file loss at all). But I warned you. :) 
ASK if you dont understand something, ASK if something is not like I wrote. :)About the net speed. Check /etc/resolv.conf >> sudo nano -w /etc/resolv.conf . Type in the OpenDNS addresses:nameserver 208.67.222.222nameserver 208.67.220.220 . Save the file, exit.ALWAYS BACKUP THE ORIGINAL FILES! You can do that with nautilus (just copy the originals into your home) OR with sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.old .
