Start mstsc, put in the server ip address or name, put in the username in the form domain\username (where domain is either the AD domain or the local machine), click the Options button, check the box that reads "allow me to save credentials", click the Save as button, save it with whatever name you want to where ever you want, click the Connect button, type the password and select the box that reads "remember my credentials". Bada bing, you've just saved that connection with your credentials and need only to double click it in the future to automatically connect and log in. 
I am running Windows 7 on my Desktops that are connecting to the office AD Domain, and we connect to a remote set of servers that are on their own AD Domain. Remote Desktop refuses to save our credentials. My Boss want to be able to save his connection settings to a folder like he did in previous version for quickly connecting to the servers. Server 2008 seems to not correctly support this. If i look at the logs it looks like the client is sending the computer name as the user name and not what is saved. 
It sounds like a GPO or possibly even a local policy, affecting the target machines, causing them to ignore credentials saved on the client. If this is the case it won't matter what RDP client you use, you will still be prompted for at least your password.
I remember there is one setting on the RDS server that says always prompt for password, another setting to disallow saving password.
It's an awesome utility. Save credentials. Handles resolution automatically. Makes for easy access to multiple servers. Makes my life sooooooooo much easier :-)
