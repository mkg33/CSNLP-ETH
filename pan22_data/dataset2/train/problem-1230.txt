One reason for suggesting it is that it does allow you to go beyond monitoring 'just' the web front-end if you want to, and also allows you to group checks by service (e.g. your report_server service could have a check for the web front-end, one for the web back-end, and one for the primary DB, all of which would provide alerts tied to this one service).
It certainly is more than a simple script with email output, but setting up the kind of monitoring you are talking about is still very easy (a few lines of YAML or JSON).
I would agree that Nagios is a great software but if you want a freeware I would suggest you to take a look at AppPerfect Agentless Monitor. Linux Server Monitoring with AppPerfect is extremely lightweight and adds negligible overhead to target system while monitoring. You can monitor all the important statistics related to CPU, disk, network and memory using this tool. Setup is very simple and the software is very easy to use. A clear documentation and tutorial is also available here for Linux server monitoring
I've upvoted Richard and Janne's answer, but if you want some more detail as to what your webserver is sending and receiving, the first couple chapters of the O'Reilly book "Web Client Programming with Perl" by Clinton Wong gives a great overview of the HTTP protocol.  If you want more detailed monitoring than just up/down and want to include response codes, etc, it is a fine place to start.
Personally I think Zabbix and Zenoss are overkill if you simply wish to monitor the status of a web server. But if you also plan to monitor anything else than they have more features than you'll ever need ;)
Important note about Nagios, the fact that it's full blown does not mean it's a hard and long installation, It's quite simple and friendly.
The book is old, but still valid.  Published in 1997, O'Reilly has posted the contents of the book online for free at http://oreilly.com/openbook/webclient/ as part of their OpenBook initiative.
