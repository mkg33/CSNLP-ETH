If you need to be notified, then you will need a celphone. Preferably one that you have a means of linking up to the net with(An Android phone, for instance), but an old school GSM 3g "modem" phone is fine as well. You can then use that out of band link to send you a notification email or email-to-sms to page you of the outage or any variance with your connectivity.
I've been giving some thought to old smart phones as self contained battery backed up monitoring and notification nodes. Given that most Android phones can be coaxed to run Java or get a shell(same story with iPhones, Kindles, etc.), there are many options along this line.
If you have a known good remote point you can test, then you can implement your own ping/netcat/curl/wget tests to validate the network connection's availability as well as the latency.
Though, if you are thinking of a commercial venture, a Mifi for the home "data center" as the out of band link would be better.
If you have no need of being notified immediately, you can just log locally. This can be done on your hosting server... or on another, perhaps dedicated, monitoring box. A monitoring box would be ideal, especially if you will be hosting other peoples' hardware and/or VPS(s) in the future.
