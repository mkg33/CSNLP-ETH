EDIT: I read it's a Dell R710, AFAIK that should have IPMI2. Configure it running ipmitool locally on the system, and test the serial over lan feature using ipmitool sol enable on another system. Bang! You have your serial console. Dells also are able to redirect BIOS on the serial console (that IPMI will in turn redirect on serial-over-lan). You should have done that anyway to get access to the system if anything goes really bad. I manage a couple of old Dell PE1425 using null modem cables with bios,grub,system serial consoles, and a couple of Dell R300 the same way but using IPMI serial over lan in place of the actual serial cable.
Also, install the new system on another disk or partition if at all possible, so you can test the new system before erasing the old one. I usually do that with two disks system: I take one disk out of the mirror, create a new (degraded) mirror with the free disk, install there, if everything is ok I destroy the old mirror and hot-add the 'old' disk to the new mirror and let it rebuild.
If hardware does not break, there isn't anything you can't do with a serial console, so that's the way to go:
