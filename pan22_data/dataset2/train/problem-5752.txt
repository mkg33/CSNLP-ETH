Both MockAzureQueueManagerBuilder and MockStuffLoggerBuilder have BuildMock methods. I think the Mock post-fix is redundant here since building a mock is already implied by the name of the class.
Generally speaking, methods should start with verbs. This is especially the case when implementing the builder pattern. As a result, I would remove the With prefix from the appropriate methods (e.g. WithRememberEnqueueWasCalled() becomes RememberEnqueueWasCalled()). This also makes the code more readable in my opinion.
When unit-testing, the general rule-of-thumb is to only test a single concern. In the unit test you have provided, you seem to be testing three separate concerns since you're asserting against three values on three different objects. I would split the unit test in question into three separate ones.
In your builder classes you have opted to use factory methods instead of constructors. While this is not necessarily wrong, exposing a factory method generally implies a semantically different operation than constructor invocation. From the Constructor Design guidelines:
In this case, I don't think exposing factory methods on your builders is necessary, especially considering that all they do internally is call their respective instance constructors.
