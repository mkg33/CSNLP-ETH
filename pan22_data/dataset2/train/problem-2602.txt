Another common cause of heat-related failure is clogged / blocked air intake / exhaust ports. This is a VERY serious issue which causes heat to build up in the system and can induce failure in any number of components (outside the CPU or GPU). 
But to answer your question whether software itself can cause damage? No. Only the heat that is produced running the software will cause damage. If you cool your system enough, you can run ANY piece of software without damaging your computer.
Chips (CPU/GPU) are protected with thermal sensors and they should throttle down when they start getting too hot. If these sensors are faulty, or if some software can override this behaviour, then you are going to get thermal damage. This protection is NOT foolproof however. Even when your chips are throttled down, you can still cause overheating if there's no proper cooling. When this occurs, your computer will shut down immediately, but by the time that happens, the heat can stay and still damage the components.
Laptops are not good for gaming because by design, they don't have proper tools to cool down the parts. If you're really into gaming, you should get a proper desktop and preferably one with liquid cooling. It doesn't even have to cost a lot.
Long story short - laptops are not ideal for doing heavy CPU+GPU intensive operations. Very few are designed well enough to handle high loads for long periods of time.
Laptops, especially PC laptops, are notorious for having build-quality problems, particularly related to assembly. These problems include too much / too little thermal paste between components, heatsinks not mounted properly, fans misaligned or stopped, etc. While the laptop may seem to be operating normally under regular desktop applications or even many games, any combination of issues can cause epic failure if the right set of components is pushed to their heat / power limits.
