in our PHP project we have few 404 pages, so I decide to do it on PHP level using PHP header() functions
In our load-balanced multi-server setup, occasional 404s happen, but they're quickly fixed by rsync (via lsyncd). Before Cloudflare, a re-request to the 404ed file would very quickly become 200 as rsync does its job.
You said all 404s, but for full reference of course it might make sense to wrap that in a <FilesMatch> or <LocationMatch> to limit the scope.  
I have recently run into an issue after switching to Cloudflare, and the solution is to basically stop Cloudflare from caching 404 responses.
However, since Cloudflare caches all data based on the caching header, and neither apache nor nginx send a no-cache header for 404s, Cloudflare ends up caching the 404 response for a while.
I believe this is a new capability in apache 2.4 as using expr conditionals is not the in the 2.2 version of the mod_headers documentation.
I've been searching for a solution to globally add such a header for 404s in both apache and nginx (globally, for all hosted domains), but so far have come up blank.
