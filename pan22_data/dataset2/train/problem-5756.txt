The documentation for pg_basebackup does mention that the backup is "taken without affecting other clients to the database", but I need to be certain that "backup mode" won't do anything unexpected to the production server.
"Not affecting other clients" means that SQL programs can continue all operations without restriction during the backup. Possibly with a loss in performance due to the I/O load caused by the backup itself, but there's no way to avoid that.
This may be mitigated by the option --checkpoint=fast|spread but it's already spread by default according to pg_basebackup manpage.
I am in the process of setting up a standby server for a PostgreSQL 9.3 install. I was looking to use pg_basebackup to get the initial starting point for the standby server. However, the documentation for pg_basebackup mentions that it will "[make] sure the system is automatically put in and out of backup mode". I can't seem to find what "backup mode" is, or what effects that will have on the production server.
In and out of backup mode means that it will execute the pg_start_backup() function at the beginning and pg_stop_backup() at the end.
The effect of pg_start_backup() on the production server is a possible I/O spike caused by checkpointing (applying the transaction log also named xlog or WAL files to the final data files).
