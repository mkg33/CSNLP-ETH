Here is what you do; use the Add Printer function and choose to add the same printer again (it may ask for drivers, so be ready). Do this for each configuration you want. Name them as you said with descriptive names so they are easy to identify. 
We have a networked laser printer at work which we use for two different tasks. One of them needs high quality printing, and for the other we prefer to use the lowest quality available, mainly for toner saving.
Once installed, change the configuration as you need. You can then select the configuration you want when you use the print dialog.
Not sure if it's a PITA or not. That is relative to the person doing the configuring. If adding configurations saves you time in the long run, it's not a PITA. 
Is a PITA to change between the two configurations every time we print, so... Is it possible to install the same printer two times at the same time, for example one with name and configuration "High quality", and the other "Low quality", and send the jobs to one or another?
