IETester is an excellent choice for testing in IE5.5-8 without even bothering with virtual machines. There's also Multiple IE, but it's old and buggy.
Try http://utilu.com/IECollection/ for multiple IE browsers and http://utilu.com/UtiluMFC/ for multiple Firefox browsers.
Now all you have to do is revert to the particular snapshot that contains the browser version you care about.
If you want to do it from a single VM image, just use snapshots.  VMware Workstation will handle this quite nicely.  Install your base OS with the lowest level IE you care about and take a snapshot.  Then install the next major version you care about and take another snapshot.  Rinse and repeat for however many versions or patch levels you care about.
I could obviously have multiple VMs, but that would be highly inconvenient. Is there some easy way to have multiple versions of browsers installed simultaneously? It's mostly about IE and Firefox; other browsers are not popular enough to make testing with their old versions a terribly high priority.
