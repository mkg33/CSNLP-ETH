Insert your Windows 7 installation CD.  Follow the prompts to allow the Windows 7 installer to wipe the hard disk and create any partitions necessary.  That means when you hit the screen in the installation process that wants to know what partition you want to install to, choose the Custom Options link at the bottom right.  Then, select all the existing partitions, and Delete them.  Make sure the only thing left in the list is "Disk 0 Unallocated Space".  Select that, and hit Next.  This will allow the Windows installer to create the partition it needs, and to format it properly.
You took the hard drive from computer 2, and tried to use it in computer 1.  You used third party software to erase the hard drive and create, as you say...
Zero-filling the drive or secure erasing it or deleting all partitions will not affect the installation media. Either there's a problem with your DVD, or the drive is having problems reading the disc. Try again with a known good disc, or else if the DVD drive's bad use something like Rufus to transfer the contents of the DVD to a USB stick and boot from that instead.
If there are no issues with the Ram in Computer 1, and there are no issues with the installation disc, Windows should then install without issue.
