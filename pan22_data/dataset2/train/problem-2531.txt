Check out pfsense.  FreeBSD+pf based.  The web based interface is easy to use.  The download CD is both a live and an install image, so you can try it with out having to install it.  A VMWare appliance is also available for testing if you don't have a spare box laying round.  pfsense also comes with a selection of add-on packages that install with the click of the mouse.  Check them out too as they may add a feature your looking for (or wanted but didn't know it yet).
We recently switched from an aging Watchguard to a Juniper SSG and have been really impressed.  The SSGs come in a number of models depending on performance and feature requirements.  We don't use many of the UTM features so I can't speak specifically to those, but you should definitely put Juniper on your list.
SonicWall has a great line of appliance hardware and subscription based services. You can check them out here
I would recommend that it is also worth looking at SmoothWall's UTM and commercial firewall offerings. I won't comment on the quality of the kit - as I am irretrievably biased (I work @ SmoothWall).
