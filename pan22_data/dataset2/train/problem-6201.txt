With a similar issue, I disconnected all my peripherals (headset, mouse, keyboard, and monitor) and it magically worked..
Found even after a reboot "can't connect to this network" error. To resolve: open Device Manager (devmgmt.msc), locate the wireless network adapter, disable and then re-enable. Wireless connected back up immediately after doing so.
I can see your Wi-Fi adapter is a Qualcomm Atheros AR956x card - the drivers for which are here. Download and install the latest drivers. To find if you have a static IP, when looking at "Wi-Fi Properties", as in your screenie above, click on "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)", and then click on the "Properties" button for it. If you have a static IP, there'll be a selection of numbers in the format of "##.##.##.##" in the text boxes. If not, then you don't have a static IP and everything should be OK in that department.
Hopefully, the driver update should fix it as I have seen articles of people with the same adapter not being able to connect to wireless, but after updating are able to connect.
log into your router and change the network name. I have fixed this issue on multiple laptops by doing this.  It seems to simple, and like this should have no bearing on connectivity but it does. Hope this helps.
