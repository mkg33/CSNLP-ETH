It could be that IE and Firefox just assume that if the value isn't specified it should be treated as auto repeat "on", while Chrome assumes that the default is auto repeat "off".
You can see many of the bugfixes and updates at the Chrome releases blog and you may want to give a Beta or Dev version of Chrome a try just for comparison. There is a newer version of Chrome stable than the one you have stated so you may even want to try that (but I didn't notice anything about GIF image handling in the release notes).
Animated GIFS have been a back and forth issue with Chrome (quick dev ticket and Chrome group search shows issues). Currently, Version 6.0.401.1 of the Dev handles most GIFs as ChrisF stated - no repeat unless repeat is specified in the GIF. This is technically the correct way to handle animated GIFs but is typically not the expected way.
This probably won't help as I guess you're using the Windows version but on the Mac (5.0.307.11) version, (just checked) they work fine.
Animated GIFs really are the love 'em/hate 'em files of the internet. The fact that you have only 3 frames makes me think it is rocketing through those 3 frames and ending - it may not be reading the hold or pause settings you have indicated in the file.
