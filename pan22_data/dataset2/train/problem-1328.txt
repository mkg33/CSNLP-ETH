BUT... after using it for several days, installed many packages, an Apache webserver linked to a MySQL server, my system is now very slow...
I recently bought a Raspberry Pi 3 model B (the last release of the Raspberry foundation), and after reading a lot of articles on the Web for SD card vs USB performances, I decided to move all the Raspbian system to my USB stick (most of articles said that USB is generally faster, more reliable, and in my case it has the double of disk space).
So I moved the system to the USB stick by following this guide https://forum.nextinpact.com/topic/168514-installer-raspbian-raspberry-sur-clef-usb/. The main command used to move the partition is rsync, as described in the guide.
Most of the time I use SSH to connect to the RasPi or sometimes a network SFTP connection from a Linux (Ubuntu Xenial) computer, and all tasks I launched that are relative to the Raspberry induce a big latency (the latency can be from 10 to 30 seconds long):
I also checked the disk transfer speed with the command hdparm, and the USB transfer speed is more than 20 MB/s, which clearly cannot cause this extreme latency.
At the end, all processes were successful and when I booted for the last time, I saw that the system was successfully moved to USB by checking it with the df -h command.
So I searched on the Web, I found some topics where guys had similar problems. I tried their solutions but nothing notable. Maybe I won 2 or 3 seconds of latency, but it still almost unusable...
I think I give you all elements of my problem, and I hope someone can really help me because I really don't understand why this is so slow (and, believe me, I am a professional developer, and I'm used to search everywhere on the Web for a working solution, before posting on a forum).
