I would check out the release notes for 9.10 and 10.04, this way you can at least see how much the upgraded version will affect your setup. In addition there's the possibility of incompatible configs, but that's a different story.
Moreover, if upgrade there is, I would wait a few weeks after the launch of the 10.10, since there are usually nasty bugs coming with the freshest version that
Versions change, sometimes new configuration files are not compatible with the old ones. Sometimes, while features are added new bugs appear... and sometimes features that used to work are broken...
If you're not doing a lot of custom tweaks here and there, problems should be few during upgrade. That doesn't mean that there's any guarantee.
Usually one wants to update frequently when Ubuntu is used as a regular desktop (multimedia features, etc...). But a server does not need usually to have the latest improvements.
Finally, for a server, you want security first. For that you should install a Long Time Support version: 5 years of support and updates for a server.
If you don't really need any of the new features provided in the new version, you're probably better of staying where you are (as long as Ubuntu provide security updates)
I would, though, recommend landing on an LTS-release, as these provide security updates for a prolonged period of time (5 years for servers)
