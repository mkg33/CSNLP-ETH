If you're using IIS7 then use URL Rewrite.  You can use a simple wildcard compare or regex to block the specific folders that you want and you can edit them easily over time.
I think that anyone running a public webserver just needs to get used to this kind of garbage in the logs, and find a good tool to parse them.
I had something similar on my local web server.  It turned out to be microsoft media player - it was searching on localhost for various album covers.  Make sure nothing else on the box is referencing localhost. 
Was there an image at that location that you removed? Otherwise my only guess would be that someone misspelled their image domain and accidentally is trying to request that image from you. The image might be being requested from a high traffic place like a forum signature or something like that
There could be many reasons for this occuring, from the unintentional (mentioned in other posts - ie. mistyped url - re-used IP address), to those probing for vulnerabilities in your server.
To remedy this you could ban the IP that is requesting the image, but I don't know that this would stop the flood of logging.
