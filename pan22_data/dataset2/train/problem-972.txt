You may need a switch or 2 to extend the number of ports available on the ethernet router(s) - just make sure you don't run a cable between Ethernet Router 1 and Ethernet Router 2.
This will allow your existing network to access the devices of the new network, but not the other way around, assuming the Ethernet Router is configured to do NAT.  Note that you will have to ensure the LAN IP addressess for the Ethernet router are in a different subnet to the IP Addresses handed out by the Xyxel.  (If the Xyxel hands out 192.168.x.x, you could set the Ethernet Router up to use 172.16.x.x).   There is a minor issue you need to be aware of of "double NAT", which might cause problems with some obscure protcols.
In each case, the "gateway" (or LAN interface on the router should be X.X.X.1 or X.X.X.254 (for example 192.168.1.1 or 10.1.2.254)
This second solution is a "better" solution then the first as it does not require double nat, and is more secure (ie separate zones).    You need to be mindful that the IP range on the LAN Interface on Ethernet Router 1 and (and Ethernet Router 2) are different to the LAN interface on the Zyxel, ideally using 3 different networks [ but strictly speaking you can use the same ranges on the LAN interfaces of Ethernet Router 1 and 2 ].  I'd recommend
