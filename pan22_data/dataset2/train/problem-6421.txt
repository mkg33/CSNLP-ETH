The MAC is normally integated into the network device. The transciever may also be integrated or it may be in the form of a module. Integrating the transciever lowers the total per-port cost but reduces flexibility.
Unfortunately the same was not easilly possible for 10GBASE-T in SFP+, due to high power requirements of 10GBASE-T. Eventually SFP+ modules for a reduced-distance variant of 10GBASE-T became available but they are still expensive and uncommon.
The fiber world uses a dizzying array of different standards, so pluggable transervers are the norm there. The copper world on the other hand mostly uses fixed transcievers. From time to time though it is desirable to connect a copper connection to a SFP port, so 100BASE-T SFP transcievers are made.
Logically an Ethernet interface (or many other types of network interface) can be divided into two parts. The MAC that turns packets into a datastream and the transciever that takes that datastream and turns it into a form suitable for the physical medium.
