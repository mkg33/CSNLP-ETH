As this is a supported option, there should be no actual problem in adding it to the cron job, supposing you are actually running a nginx server. However, as the documentation states that all available command-line options can be configured in the cli.ini file, rather put it there too, for two main reasons: (a) clarity — better keep all configuration in a single place rather than specifying the key size in a config file and the used server in the cron job, and (b) updates — if the cron job has been created by a package manager (or any other form of installer), a future version might overwrite your changes, although most package managers warn users for modified configuration files that would get overwritten.
According to the documentation: “By default, the following locations are searched: /etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/letsencrypt/cli.ini (or ~/.config/letsencrypt/cli.ini if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set).” The file does not necessarily exist by default, but you can certainly create it in one of the searched locations.
