If you did store the mode list separately, you could also make things cleaner by making that list the only place where information about the modes is stored and using it to generate the html, instead of having to maintain the html and the code in initModeMenu separately.
I am writing a JavaScript/HTML driven web application. For the user interface, I am not completely sure that my JavaScript is 'OK'. Mainly, I switch between "modes" by assigning a placeholder variable to a new function, which changes what the onclick event does for items in a table (either open, edit, or move them).
Code style - Javascript programmers are used to passing functions around and probably wouldn't bat an eyelid at the idea of assigning different functions to a variable, but it makes more sense to me to always have the same function as the event handler, and call the action for the current mode from within it:
Readability - the code reads fine.  The modes concept is explained well just by reading the code, so I wouldn't worry about that.
Am I breaking any code styles? Is my script hard to follow or understand? Is it unconventional for me to assign bookmarkEventMapping to another function later on in my code, using it as a placeholder? What can I do differently? Can you recommend any material that I could read to write clearer JavaScript?
