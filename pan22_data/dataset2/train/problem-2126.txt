It would seem that Windows 7 is designed purely for the internet-connected computer. When setting up a network similar to above I am plagued by "no internet access" and "unidentified network" messages and have to sift through the public, homegroup, work settings etc.
What I want to know is: is there a way to operate a Win7 PC in a closed network as you would have done with XP - no "unidentified network" messages etc. (it would appear this is due to lack of DNS, but there's nothing I can find in the sharing centre/troubleshooting that says this officially)
My PCs regularly swap between the network name i've applied and "unidentified network" and i often wish I could have my Win XP days back!
I have previously regularly created closed networks of Windows XP machines, that is, several machines networked together with switches and routers (& static IPs) but no connection to the outside world (no DNS for eg).
(i am aware of methods to disable "no internet access" and "default to work location" in secpol.msc)
