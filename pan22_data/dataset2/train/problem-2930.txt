I'd recommend you switching to Windows 7 x64. Windows XP x64 doesn't function very well for many people due to device driver incompatibility and lots of software doesn't make use of the x64 so you'll wind up with software running in 32 bit mode because there are no alternatives... Windows 7 has much better support from what I've seen for x64 and many of the device drivers will install 
The difference you will find with the 64-bit edition for Windows XP is that it's difficult to find hardware drivers for it, and some software simply isn't compatible.  You'd probably be much better off running the 64-bit edition of Windows 7 (don't waste any time with Windows Vista, it's like a persistent yet inconsistent problem child) and virtualize Windows XP in VirtualBox.org to run any applications you have that aren't compatible with Windows 7.
Why not just compress fewer files at once? You're unlikely to have more than four CPU cores, so you don't need to have more than four compression processes running at once to get the most out of your CPU. And if you use a multithreaded compression program like 7-zip, you can just do your compression one file at a time.
