Simple friends . Our normal short cut to go 1st cell is Ctrl+home . In mini keyboards we have to add Fb key together as follows. CTRL+fn+home (left key).. the same as for end ( ctrl+fn+right key)
I had the same problem admittedly with a crappy Chinese imitation of an Apple mini keyboard (there literally is no model or manufacturer identifier on it whatsoever). I used AutoHotKey to map Win-x to End, and Win-z to Home. I had to do a bit more work to @Mokubai's answer in order to make Ctrl-End, Shift-End, and Ctrl-Shift-End work though:
ON my brand new computer I made this same discovery and I used the HOME and END keys a lot to go to the beginning or end of a document.
My Dell Precision 7510 laptop does not have dedicated Home and End buttons but it does have dedicated PrtScr and Insert buttons (like this).  Because I normally use an external keyboard and I regularly use my Print Screen key I needed a way to toggle that button between being Print Screen and Home when using the laptop keyboard.  Building upon the example from Iian, I setup Win+Print Screen to toggle the override.
AutoHotkey is the simplest solution to this.  It took me a while to find the right mapping for my keyboard and I thought this was a good place to share it.  (Thank you Ilan for showing the CTRL and SHIFT combinations.)  
This is partially working, but try pressing UP or DOWN arrow for your purpose. In most one-line text input fields, it does what HOME and END do.
