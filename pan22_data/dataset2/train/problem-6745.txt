For a home setup, if you have two APs as the same model, you could write a script to run on a host on the network that automatically pulls the config via the network from the first AP, tweaks a few values (IP address, name, etc.) and pushes it to the second device.
If they're just APs (and identical), and not wireless routers, you should be able to save the config from the first, import it into the 2nd, and just change the AP's IP. 
However, unless you change parameters often, it's probably easiest just to configure the second device manually.
It can be thought of essentially a central access point with multiple 'antennas' on the network. However, this is comparatively very expensive.
Since it is non industrial application and your range is not a huge one, I suggest to use a range extender instead of new AP. It has a higher transmitting and reception power so you can get more range than standard wifi.
My house is just a little too big to get good wireless access in all corners.  I'd like to add a second access point.  I can do this, but I have to manually configure this second AP to have the same keys, etc.  Is there any way I can get this second access point to get its configuration from the primary one?  What would this be called and what sort of hardware or firmware do I need to do this?
