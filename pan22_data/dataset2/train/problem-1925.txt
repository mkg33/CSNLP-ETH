You can use various tools to track the location of an IP, for example DNSstuff have a pretty good IP Whois tool
You might be thinking about Private domain registrations such as what GoDaddy Provides.  DNS information is meant to be shared in order for people to be successfully forwarded to sites/services you want them to reach.  In order for people to reach you, they need to know one or two things: DNS name or an IP. 
If I go with something like dnsmadeeasy etc., I use their dns servers.  can someone still figure out where I am hosted somehow?
IP owners can be found doing a quick WHOIS lookup since ARIN keeps a public database of every address it allocates.  They HAVE TO be able to provide administrative contact information.  There is no way to make this private.
Normally if I go with a hosting company, I use their own dns.  so anyone who does a whois can figure out which company I am hosted with.
DNS just points at an IP address, regardless of whose nameservers you're using. IP addresses are traceable back to the ISP that ultimately owns them. There is no way around this.
Through DNS, anyone can find information about who's hosting what for your domain, just do a quick DNS lookup or go to http://www.intodns.com/, and find a bunch of sweet DNS information about a domain.  
If you're accessible from the internet, then someone can figure it out. There isn't much of a way around that.
