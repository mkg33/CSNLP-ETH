If you were doing this in XP, then installing the themes is exactly the same... just copy the theme files into C:\Windows\Resources\Themes as you did on XP. 
Click the button that says "Play with the bits" to download the installer, and install it (no reboot required!).
Yes, download the app from the following site (it allows you to use custom themes WITHOUT needing to patch!  :)  , meaning no need for taking ownership, updating the system file cache or anything like that).  
While you're at it, here is another great program which compliments custom themes nicely, to change your start button image: http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-7-start-button-changer-released . And someplace to start for new orb images: http://www.deviantart.com/#order=9&q=start+orbs . 
That doesn't mean that Windows 7 won't have this feature, but it does mean it won't inherit anything from Windows XP written to do this, because the feature you're thinking of was a hack created outside of microsoft.
