However the predicates in your requirement are rather odd. I suspect that if you want to change these in future you may run into issues - e.g. switching to a different authentication mechanism.  
Starting with a fresh server, I can make requests with the Authorization header and they won't be cached. If I make a request as a logged out user, the request is cached. The problem is that subsequent requests with the Authorization header return the cached result.
The question of whether you should use varnish should consider a huge number of variables which you've not told us anything about. What you have implemented is as close to the requirement you describe as anything I can think of. Although I would want to validate the mod_cache/varnish is honouring the "Vary" header correctly.
My website serves the same pages to both logged in and logged out users. Requests from logged in users have an Authorization header. I want to use Apache's mod_cache to serve cached pages only to logged out users.
This sets a Cache-Control header on every request that does not have the Authorization header. Interestingly, the responses for logged in requests now contain the header "Vary: Authorization".
