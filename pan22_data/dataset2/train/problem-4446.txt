Another reason for what you observe could be that something is storing data on NTFS alternate data streams (see for example http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897440.aspx), I don't know whether TreeSize or WinDirStat are able to report data stored this way.
It might be trashes from users, or System Restore information, or something similar. WinDirStat or TreeSize wont be able to access those directories, at least if you don't run them with elevated privileges. And even then, you can't enter System Volume Information (that contains among others the restore points) because even not the administrator account is able to see it. On older versions of Windows there was a trick (using AT /INTERACTIVE) to run a program as the local system account so it gets access even to those protected locations, but I don't know a way to run an interactive program with such privileges on Windows 2008. One possibility would be to mount the partition (in read-only, just to be sure) from a Linux live CD, as the Linux NTFS drivers ignore all access control, and using the du command to check what takes space.
