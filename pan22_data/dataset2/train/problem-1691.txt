But the nicest feature for me is that I can combine batches and sql files in a single package (a combination of running a report + an ssis package to import/export data in csv file + some data change scripts).
I use sqlcmd for running admin scripts, batch jobs and reports. I also use sqlsplus, which is like Oracle SQL*Plus, but for SQL Server (found it at www.sqlsplus.com)
Used it as well in doing data processing before we migrated over to SSIS. It is definitely a useful feature.
I actively use this when deploying logshipping as it allows me to do everything within a single script connecting to the primary, monitor and secondary servers.
One can execute sql files from batches using parameters provided from a central batch file that executes everything and has all parameters in one place.
I use the sqlcmd mode in SSMS on occasion. Typically when migrating databases from one environment to another.  For example if I need to backup the database from production, then restore it to dev, I'll do this all in one script using SQLCMD mode to switch servers.  I've used to here and there for one thing or another, but I don't use it all that often.
