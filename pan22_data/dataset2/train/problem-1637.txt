You could make your Webservers only consider the 'send transaction' done when they receive the final '250 OK' from the mail server. 
If they don't get that, they should retry the send. That should take care fo the lost forever issue when the smtp server fails on the reception.
You can build a webservice that you support can query by simply parsing those bounces and the logs from the webservers.
If you install a local mail server you can do a bit more on the configurations (how many times to retry, when, etc as you mention). But you still may get bounces after a message is 'delivered'...
Since bounces can be asynchronous it is a bit difficult to build a query interface for specific messages, you may be able to send a message and still get a bounce hours or even days after the fact. So the status of a message could be changing from 'sent to smtp server' to 'bounced'. 
SMTP servers themselves have logic to keep retrying the sending of emails for a few times (configurable) when there is a failure. If the email is undeliverable you will get a bounce and should then evaluate what to do (retry or give up, depending on the reason for the bounce).
