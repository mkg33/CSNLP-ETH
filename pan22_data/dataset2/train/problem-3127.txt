also - if you look for fully blown [ yet open source ] antispam - take a look at esva. it's ready to use appliance for vmware based on postfix and couple of content filters. in their forums you'll find description how to pull white list of users from AD. their forum might look semi dead and author is not the most active one - but whole solution is really sophisticated and works great for me in couple of deployments.
If you have a spare machine, even a fairly low spec PC, you might consider installing MailCleaner, which will provide ant-spam and antivirus scanning of your inbound emails. It's Linux based but doesn't require any great degree of familiarity with Linux in order to get it set up and running. The filtering results are excellent, even without "training" the anti-spam databases, and the web interface makes day-to-day tasks a breeze. There's also a support forum should you need it.
It seems to me that you've already done everything you can to limit the mail reaching the Exchange server - the next step would be to try and find a common factor in the spam that would allow you to block it before it even reaches the GFI box.  (i.e. Treating it like a DDoS attack)
If the traffic is coming from only a handful of hosts, would it be feasible to shun those IP's on your border routers?  Sometimes ISP's are also willing to help out with these sort of attacks - might be worth contacting them to see if they can ID and drop the bad traffic.
One duct tape solution might be to make your primary MX record an invalid one, and make the secondary MX record the valid one.  Most spambots won't waste time trying alternate MX records, while legit mail will still come through... the down side is, you run a small risk of losing mail from incorrectly configured MTA's.
if you have ability to set up additional host [ can be virtual machine ] - i suggest you get postfix [ or exim or any other linux smtp relay ] that can filter mails based on recipient address.
