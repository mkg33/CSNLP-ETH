Just because your ISP doesn't offer fast speeds doesn't mean they aren't available - or won't be soon.  Cablevision in New York/New Jersey/Connecticut areas offers download speeds of 101 Mbit/sec.  FiOS offers 150 MBit download speeds with some plans.  And things are getting faster, so if you had one of those routers, you won't necessarily have to replace it next year if you have a service that gets even faster and you want to take advantage of that speed.
If you have more than one computer on the network and want to transfer data between them, then high-throughput routers are great. If you're only running one machine on your network, then that 450mb/s local speed doesn't make sense to pay for, and you'd be better off getting something cheaper.
You're thinking in terms of connection to the internet.  Remember, that a router is also responsible for connections to a local network as well.  So, if you had a couple of machines on the same network and transferred files between them, then you may want such speeds.
