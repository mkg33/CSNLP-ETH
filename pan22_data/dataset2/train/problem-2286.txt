I do not recall this exact problem but I have had similar problems on a number of occasions.  Like you I had to abort Excel to clear the problem and it told several such failures before I identified the cause. 
I had to remove the Custom Formatting on hundreds of cells which took ages as you can't select multiple Rules when deleting them. So manually deleting one rule after the other, while every Delete takes a couple of seconds...well you get the point.
I later found out during the same day that my C:\ drive (the installation drive for MS Office) apparently didn't "have enough" empty space. It was odd, since I already had 10 GB free. Regardless, I simply emptied up another 10 GB on that drive, and copying inside Excel is working fine again.
The cause was Excel waiting on a question about the operation I had requested which was hidden behind the main Window.  I have since discovered that getting that hidden question to display can be difficult but is possible.  I do not know why, on rare occasions, the question is not on top as it usually is.
I experienced this issue as well today, and I was absolutely clueless as to why Excel was freezing up for ~20 seconds whenever I tried to copy something. I most of the suggestions mentioned in this question, to no avail.
So, if you haven't found a solution yet, I suggest freeing up some space on the drive you have Excel installed on. That might just be the trick.
Anyway, my Excel sheet is quick again when the Conditional Formatting was reset to only a few Rules.
In my situation I had an excel sheet with Conditional Formatting on some cells and for some reason this Conditional formatting was copied a couple of hundred times, probably when I copied the cell the custom formatting for the entire range of cells was copied as well.
