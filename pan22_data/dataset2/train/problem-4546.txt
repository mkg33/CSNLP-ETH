My grandmother has done this, though that was before the current climate of air travel and security risks. If you DO check in your desktop, you might want to invest in shock watches - little stickers which let you know if your luggage has been mishandled - in addition to that, it lets the airline staff know that you will know, which would reduce risk somewhat.
Also, don't forget that you'd also need a screen, keyboard, mouse and other parts to make a desktop usable. The sheer volume of things needed makes laptops more viable for travel.Even with a mini ITX system, this is a non trivial amount of things to ship
I'd suggest delivery it with a dependable package dispatch. Perused audits, and purchase protection. Don't convey it with you as checked things ready for traveler aerial shuttle, as this is an incredible approach to annihilate anything.
If you're careful with your desktop machine, moving it won't be a problem. I'd recommend shipping it with a trustworthy parcel courier. Read reviews, and buy insurance. Do not carry it with you as checked baggage on board a passenger airliner, as this is an excellent way to destroy anything.
Considering hardware is considerably cheaper in asia than the UK, in my experience, it may be worth just getting what you need in japan. Or just get a laptop or netbook - the price differencial isn't as bad as it used to be.
You may have to switch the voltage on the PSU if you do move your desktop. I'd also strongly recommend keeping the original packaging and shipping the PC in that, and removing, securely packing, and bringing the hard drives with you.
