I literally threw my HP gear into the trash because I was so tired of HP clearly not knowing how to write software.  Their consumables are expensive too.  I've switched to Brother across the board, better software and (much) cheaper consumables.
Have looked through Canon and HPs offerings and nothing jumps out - the biggest variable being if network scanning requires software on each machine
I use Brother MFC-6890CDW, and it works with the default (new) OSX scanner software (Image Capture).  You don't need to install anything.  It works wireless out of the box, too.  There's a review at MacWorld you can google.  It's about $300.
We use a Ricoh Aficio SP 3200SF.  It scans to USB, FTP, SMB, or to the Ricoh software.  It only does TIFF or PDF, though.  Also, the document feeder doesn't hold to many sheets (maybe 10-15).
I use the HP office jet 7310xi, got at costco for $200 or so, im sure there is a newer version, but works great with mac and windows and does all the stuff you want above. You have to order the 2nd tray, but you can get one. The current rev is probably newer, but the office jet 73xx series are nice.
