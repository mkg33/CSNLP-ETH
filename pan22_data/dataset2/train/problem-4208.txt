Media Player Classic along with VLC also support this feature, again, which was available since Vista.  In MPC, it's an obscure listbox on the bottom of the Output options.  VLC, switch to Advanced and look under the Audio tree.
What's so frustrating is that this would be a simple thing to build for the kernel streaming subsystem for the Windows kernel engineers, if they just wanted to / were allowed to. If the devices aren't sample-locked, you will have to drop or duplicate buffers (or samples) very occasionally -- I'm OK with that! Or they could use a software sample rate converter with an adjustable target rate, and tweak the effective output rate for the output device to keep in sync. (I did this for the BeOS Media Kit probably 20 years ago!) Worked well enough in practice.

This doesn't work if your primary device (HDMI out, USB device, etc) doesn't implement the "stereo mix" device. My on-board, RealTek, analog sound implements it, but I don't use that device at all, so I can't use this solution.
As long as your Audio drivers are updated and the Application supports it, then you are good to go.  Some programs can be fooled into playing onto another output device by switching the default device after you've hit play. . .
Windows is allowed only one primary audio source, so you can not play from two different piece of hardware.
For a hands on example, play something on Youtube. Fire up Windows Media Player.  Go to Tool, Options, then click on the Devices Tab.  Doubleclick the speakers and switch the output to, say from Back Speakers to Front Headphones.  Now you have Youtube through the Back connections and an MP3 going on the front headphones.
