I tried all the solutions for the problem from here (except the last one, where you mod your mainboard): http://www.overclock.net/t/1202751/amd-fx-cpu-throttling-fixes-please-sticky
So, yeah, if something similar happens to you, check if the problems start appearing at a certain temperature level (best tool for that: SpeedFan) - for me it was at about 66°C GPU temp.
The problem was the combination of components / high temperatures and thermal throttling: both the CPU and GPU draw huge amounts of energy and get very hot* and the motherboard has a "features" to throttle something, possibly the CPU, on high temperatures. 
...and it would run fine with almost all games, except Battlefield series (reason still unclear). So I exchanged it with my girlfriend's Gigabyte 970A-DS3P, which is lower-end but serves my purposes and doesn't have the throttling.
*it didn't occur to me that 70°C is "very hot", because my former computer was a Shuttle PC (tiny brick of a desktop, with shitty ventilation) and the top CPU temperature was 105°C. It would still run games at this temp, ...just not for too long.
