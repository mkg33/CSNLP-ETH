by the way I find someone with the same problem as mine and someone suggest this to help him (Possibly because you need to configure differently your WiFi card: To do monitor mode and STA mode (AP client) at the same time, you need to bind two virtual interfaces (STA and monitor) to one physical interface (your wifi card).
I suggest you to try doing this by hand, before running wireshark. You will need to use the "iw" tool in order to do this.
I am using Kali whenever I turn my wireless card into monitor mode I lose connection with the Internet. Can I keep connection with the Internet while using monitor mode? Is there away to bind two modes (monitor & managed) into one wireless card?
When you are connected to WiFi, your card runs in managed mode. When you switch to monitor mode you start passively and not actively treating signals and hence you lose the connection.
My wireless card is Alfa AC1200 with two antennas and it supports monitor and packet injection... Please, any help 
Gave a look here (chapter "Adding interfaces with iw") http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw)  he meant to bind two modes (manage & monitor) in one card but how can someone do that I did not understand 
Monitor mode sets your adapter to "receive-only mode", which means that you cannot send any more requests to the internet. Wireless adapters can either send or receive packets but not both at the same time.
