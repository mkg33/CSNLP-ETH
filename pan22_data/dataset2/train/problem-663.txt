I'm not certain about what you are seeking. You want a "health check" but that may not always tell you why this particular query (whichever query you're running at the moment) is suddenly exhibiting performance issues. There is a system_health event session (here's a set of queries to shred the contents) which will give you all kinds of information that you may, or may not be able to use (various levels of understanding are assumed when looking at the data). 
Note that your DBAs would need to create this stored procedure in order for you to be able to use it. Once installed, I find the sp_WhoIsActive @help=1 documentation to be quite helpful. 
Additionally, there are stored procedures available in the community that may be able to help you with pulling specific information. I see @Kin has already provided my personal favorite, but for completeness it is: 
If you can't access the actual event files, here's a query to get you started on the ring buffer. Then you can use the other queries with this as the base data.
Unfortunately, being a DBA is an entire career dedicated to learning what these things mean so I'm not sure how helpful much of this will be. It will give you an idea of what all is happening on your server at that moment to be able to help you formulate a more targeted question. As it stands, it could be server load. It could be a statistics issue. It could be OOM. It could be any number of things. To identify any of these would be a book (hey, lookie there) but hopefully this will provide a good starting point.
In the event that you cannot persuade your DBAs to create this, I've written this query to pull a bunch of information that, hopefully, you can use.
