Why is iwconfig showing it as a local, non-unique MAC when arp (and /proc/net/arp) shows a globally unique (and likely the accurate) one?
Such a box would need multiple MAC addresses, and the vendor could choose to assign those sequentially, or to some extent reuse the same. For example the router and AP could share a single MAC towards the LAN/WLAN, but there is no need to do so.
Note: In my search, I found someone else observing the same thing, in a very different (Windows) context, but no explanations:
A router and an access point are two different kinds of devices. If you build a network in which you have one device of each kind, you wouldn't expect the two devices to have the same MAC address.
Some of the configurations involve certain virtual network devices which may also need MAC addresses. Virtual devices will often have the locally administered bit set to one.
For home-user equipment it is quite common to build multiple of these devices into a single box. Very often you will find the following five pieces of hardware all in a single box:
I'm at a wifi hotspot where, when I look up the router's MAC address by two different methods, I get slightly different results:
Some of these devices can be configured to operate in different configurations. For example whether a router is needed between switch and modem depends on the specific deployment.
The only difference between the two is that in the one from iwconfig, the "locally administered" bit is set to 1 (making it like a private IP address).
