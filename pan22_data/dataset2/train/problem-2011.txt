these are 3 different kind of log managers : it enables your system to collect filter, and transmit/store logs.
Syslog in general is quite confusing as it can be multiple things. I had a shot at disambiguating here: https://sematext.com/blog/2017/01/30/what-is-syslog-daemons-message-formats-and-protocols/
They're all syslog daemons, where rsyslog and syslog-ng are faster and more feature-rich replacements for the (mostly unmaintained) traditional syslogd. syslog-ng started from scratch (with a different config format) while rsyslog was originally a fork of syslogd, supporting and extending its syntax. In recent years, rsyslog started supporting a newer config format as well. By now, it's really hard to compare the two without getting into the very specifics and starting flame wars.
Syslog-ng is "Next-Gen". I think it's the best way to manage logs : everything is object (source, destination, filter, and the very forwarding rule) and the syntax is clear. I doubt in terms of functionality that rsyslog and syslog-ng are different.
