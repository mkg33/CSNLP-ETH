I have an ethernet connection to my router. I'm running testing version of Debian (though the problem persisted with the stable too) and I don't have any network manager. My /etc/network/interfaces is thusly configured:
Every once in awhile the connection just fails; the only pinging that works is to localhost. I've tried using DHCP, which receives offers and generally works well. A temporary fix is to physically unplug the ethernet cable from my computer, wait a few seconds, then plug it back in, a few seconds after doing which the connection works fine again.
The answer you gave to my comment, that you can ping 8.8.4.4 when the connection seems to fail, clearly indicates that your connection is up and running without any problem.
Instead, what is failing is your connection to your DNS servers, which clearly are becoming unresponsive. Since you are using a static IP, you may as well set them through your /etc/network/interfaces file. Add this line to the bottom of it:
After a trial run, if nothing untoward happens, you may change these IP addresses to some of your choice, just make sure that they differ from those you are currently using which clearly are not very dependable.
This smells more like a hardware problem. You may want to check the RJ-45, the cables and the router. You may want to check dmesg | tail to see if the network went down. If it does, is more likely that the system is not at fault (since both testing and stable had the same problem) and more your cable/router.
