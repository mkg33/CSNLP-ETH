So if your login is tied to any kind of security or encryption measures, then yes, using a strong password is a very good idea.
The only benefit of '$$%fOe._ba' over an 'abc' password is if someone attempts to crack your password.
don't reuse this password.  If someone with skill DOES get your pc, sure, they will get your data, but if you password is crackable, they can try to use it on other sites.
Sure. Tying your bike to a tree with a rope is more secure than not tying it at all. The fact that there are ways around some security-devices doesn't mean you're just as vulnerable without them. Even if you're not encrypting your data, use a strong password because it will still offer some degree of protection. In all honesty, the degree of protection a strong password offers will be sufficient in many cases to protecting your data - not all laptop thiefs are smart enough to pull the HD out, and reconnect it elsewhere.
The passwords in that database are encrypted (Triple DES) and can't be easily exposed just by having physical access to the machine. Likewise, using physical access to reset my account password will disable access to the Keychain database.
A strong password prevents viruses and worms from guessing it and inflicting more damage.  Many worms try to replicate via SMB/CIFS and guessing the local admin password.
In my case, yes. I use Mac OS X and the Keychain feature that comes with it. It stores my passwords to websites and network shares in a secure database that is unlocked when I log in to my laptop.
