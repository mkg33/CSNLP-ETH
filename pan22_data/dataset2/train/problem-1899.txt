C-u 4 M-x indent-rigidly to indent the region by four spaces, C-u -4 M-x indent-rigidly to remove four spaces.
You can do a similar maneuver to delete four spaces -- just include 4 columns in your marked region (steps 2-3) and hit <DEL>
I have a region of python code selected in emacs. What are the most efficient ways to indent and unindent every line in it by 4 spaces?
The only way I've found is using regex-replace, but that's an awful number of keystrokes for such a simple task.
Composability is the king with Emacs, just combine M-i with https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el and you have your indent block command. That is you do:
indent-rigidly takes a prefix argument indicating how much to indent by, so C-u 42 C-x TAB indents by 42 columns, and since the default prefix argument is 4, C-u C-x TAB indents by 4 columns.
My mode line shows (Python). Searching the web I found a lot of discussion of using python-mode instead of python, but I only started using emacs a few days ago so I'm wary of changing defaults before I have had a chance to understand and them. If changing to python-mode is the best option I'm happy to accept that as an answer.
Ideally I'd like something that's not context sensitive (eg. it'll allow me to indent passages within docstrings where the indentation does not relate to python syntax).
