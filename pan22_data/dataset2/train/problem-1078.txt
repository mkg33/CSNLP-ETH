I am really at a loss here. This behavior seems related to Active Directory and my domain controller, but it doesn't make much sense since I can log in as domain user and validate within seconds.
All I want to do is change the permissions of a folder (and all sub items) to include one of my domain groups (the same problem occurs even if I just try to include a single user, or apply the permissions to a single file).
We have another server connected to the DC which is working perfectly. Changing file / folder permissions is generally a very simple task:
Try clicking the "Locations..." button and selecting "Entire Directory". If it starts working, then you have an LDAP issue. Selecting "Entire Directory" forces the Select dialog to use a GC port to execute the query. Selecting a specific domain will cause it to use an LDAP port.
Likewise, if I decide to click Locations the system will hang, and the "Select Users, Computers, Service Accounts, or Groups" dialog becomes unresponsive. The worst part is that out of the many times I have clicked on locations, one of them finally brought up the location dialog after around 30 minutes (so it's working on some level, but it's unbelievably slow). Of course, I clicked the little plus symbol next to the domain and it hung there indefinitely.
However, no matter what I type into the "enter object names to select" field, after clicking OK or Check Names a "Selection Progress" dialog box pops up with the content: "Objects Found: 0" and a Stop button. There is an icon indicating that the system is searching for more objects, but I can leave it for hours and it will not find anything. If I click Stop, nothing happens. Eventually, I have to force close.
