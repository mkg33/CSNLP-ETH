However, I have one AP (rather, one location- it occurs on any AP plugged there) that is connected behind two switches that refuses to pass traffic - UNLESS I have a dumb switch in front of it. All other APs that connect to a switch have had no issues- including one that is connected behind another switch.
If you want to do a quick and dirty hack, just loop back the VLANs into each other on a switch. Just add two untagged/access ports in VLAN10, and one for VLAN20 and VLAN30, and just patch the ports together. 
By placing the interfaces against a bridge group, I am able to offer network access across all three SSIDs when the AP is connected to a simple port on Cisco the LAN configured as:
This AP is working directly connected to an HP switch with no VLAN settings at all, rather than being untagged. Not the best solution, but accomplishes all goals without needing to have to make any changes to APs/Switches/VLANs.
This makes me think that the dumb switch is stripping VLAN identification off of it? Does that push it to VLAN 1 as the default? I don't see how that'd work given that the AP works just fine behind the dumb switch but not on the switch proper.
The AP is plugged to a switch plugged to another switch and the connection between the switches is an untagged uplink.
Very ugly, extremely sketchy, but it will work as long as you don't have Spanning Tree enabled (and it will work even then if you put BPDU filtering on the ports). But as others have said already, the point of having multiple SSIDs is to separate traffic, if you feed everything into the same network there's not really any point of having multiple SSIDs.
