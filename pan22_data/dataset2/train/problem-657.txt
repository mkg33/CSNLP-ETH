If you want to get quite involved and be able to specify names for each of the panels you create, you could look at the h5 file format.
... the beauty of a simple csv file is that you can actually open it in notepad or a spreadsheet and usually find the line which is "broken" and fix/delete it. Pickle, on the other hand, is a little more complicated to debug.
This allows you to group datasets in named containers. You can then read them from disk later on one by one i.e. you don't need to read the whole dataset into memory.
On a side note, if you want to minimise the possibility of corruption, you could consider saving each panel/DataFrame (whichever method you go for) into separate files, and then make copies/backups.
You can write a similar function to make accessing the saved h5 file. This really is a flexible way to save data, and it can be compressed with one of the best known (widely-spread) algorithms in the open-source world: gzip! There are also other possibilities implemented.
