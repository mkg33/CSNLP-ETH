All fleet compositions (a.k.a doctrines) have been obfuscated to protect the operational security of my character's alliance.
I also play EVE Online â€“ a video game about internet spaceships. I decided that it would be fun to practice Rust by writing a simple utility to help me x up.
YAML anchors let me put common ship categories into multiple doctrines. When I accidentally blow up one of my ships, I simply comment out the name so that my x-up strings reflect my inventory.
This indicates that I am available to pilot either a Svipul or a Burst (two specific kinds of internet spaceship) in the upcoming engagement.
I am new to Rust and it's been a while since I wrote any C code, so in particular I would like to get better at stack/heap usage and avoid .clone() where it's wasteful. Thanks in advance for the review!
This executable exposes an ls command to retrieve the list of doctrines, and a -d DOCTRINE flag to return the x-up string.
Of course, I could look into my hangar and type that out manually, but I'm learning a new programming language so I may as well build an overkill utility.
