The application needs to communicate using a pub-sub tool in this case RTI DDS. This has been tested out in a wireless environment and another wired environment with a different PC but same virtual machine and in both of these environments the pub-sub has worked.
What way is there to debug how and why network packets are being dropped, maybe even possible through wireshark since we are currently using that tool? 
When testing out the pub-sub on the current set up, we can see through wireshark all the fragmented packets delivered from the embedded device are delivered to the PC's main operating system (windows in this case). However when the fragmented packets are sent from the main operating system to the virtual machines operating system, the virtual machine is only receiving the last packet that was received as seen in wireshark and the rest are dropped.
I have an application that I am currently testing out that runs on RHEL 6. The setup for my test is the application installed on a embedded device, connected by an Ethernet cable to PC that communicates with the virtual machine on that PC in which Linux is ran. The virtual machine (on VMWare Workstation) on the pc and the embedded device both have a static IP address since they need to communicate through each other over the Ethernet cable.
We have so far tried to disable the firewalls and pinging devices from each other which all work correctly and had no issues. Thus, gave us no insight into why packets are being dropped.
