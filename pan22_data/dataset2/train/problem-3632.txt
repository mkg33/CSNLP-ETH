To shut down the Report Manager web portal, open up the RSReportServer.config file. This is located in the install directory (usually C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\[Instance Name]\Reporting Services\ReportServer).
Under the <Service> element, there will be several elements that begin with "Is". These control which services/functions are enabled. The last entry will be <IsReportManagerEnabled>.

To do this, open Reporting Services Configuration Manager on the server running the RS service, and change the "Database Name" entry in the Database menu page:
I realized this was incorrect, I should not have configured/installed Report Server to begin with. I need to remove REPORT SERVER without removing Reporting Services. To be specific, I need the link (the Web Portal, or the link Report Server puts up) REMOVED and the Report Server database removed also.

Once it does, the RS service will no longer respond to requests to the Report Manager portal but the separate web service that processes report requests will continue running.
I've gone ahead and configured the Report Server after SQL Server installation, and as part of that I've ended up with:
