You'll need to associate GLUE records with the godaddy DNS setup and point ns1.yourdomain.com to your server.
Finally, I'd like to be able to use the VPS for hosting my own Web Site and also some other Customer Sites (with its own domains), so please, let me know if somebody can give me a clue on this.
I'm currently able to access it through the two IP adresses that they gave me, but now I'd like to get access to it through my Domain, which I get with GoDaddy through GoogleApps.
I have just completed a setup exactly the same on my VPS - Email me dave[at]proliveonline.com and I can maybe shadow your session and walk you through it?
Also, since I'm using the GoDaddy Name Servers and they are working good enough, I wouldn't like reassign them to my own host (ns1.mydomain.com, ns2.mydomain.com).
Also have setup apache vhosts for several sites on VPS and email forwding for entire domains or for individual emails.. Abd web forwding. Basically tried to replicate a 'ZonEdit' service (in regards to DNS)
