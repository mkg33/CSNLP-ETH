I am using the SQL Server Agent to run some jobs every day, but the problem is that whenever the server (the machine itself) is restarted, the SQL Server Agent doesn't automatically start when the computer boots back up again...and I have to start it manually myself.
It's possible that the service may start and then stop if it detects that it has no works to do.  An alternative option would be to NET START it just before your daily job kicks in (I would do this anyway so as to ensure that it's up).
If you have it set to automatic after you reboot the server, do you get a popup box that says "A service did not start....." ?
How can I set the Server Agent to Auto-Start after a computer restart?  Is there a particular Windows Service I need to set as auto-start ?
Take a look in your Event log (right click my computer --> manage) Then in the Event log select system.  Go though these just after your reboot and see if anything mentions the SQL Agent.  It should show it starting then failing or stopping and "hopefully" why.
You can do the same thing by accessing sql server configuration manager that should be located in start/programs/microsoft sql server/configuration tools.
