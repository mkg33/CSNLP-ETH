Rather than trying to identify the failed disk by the SATA channel it's connected to, you can identify it by its serial number. I have found that most hard disks these days have their serial numbers stamped/printed on the front edge, so all you need to do is determine the serial number of the failed drive.
Next, if you haven't got it already, install the lshw package, and then run this command (I'm not sure if you need to sudo it; it's harmless to try it with/without sudo):
I assume you have already discovered the logical name of the failed drive via cat /proc/mdstat. For the sake of example, let's assume that failed drive is /dev/sdb.
(If your failed drive doesn't show up in the lshw output at all, then it's really dead. You can probably still use lshw to find the dead drive, but this time by process of elimination.)
From this, you should be able to identify the problem drive from its logical name (e.g. /dev/sdb), and thus obtain its serial number (e.g. 6DE78FG9). With the serial number in hand, you can be confident you're pulling the correct drive.
