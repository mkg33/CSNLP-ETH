Is there a difference between dragging and dropping a file vs. copying and pasting in Windows Explorer?  I read on a forum that dragging is more reliable than copying.  Is this true?  Can copying create a file that is not bit-identical to the original?
I'm currently trying to investigate such a problem. However, I don't know if there is a difference between drag/drop and copy/paste.
Reliabilty has nothing do do with it. Dragging and dropping from one folder to another on the same logical partition (both folders reside on lets say the C:\ drive) is actualy a file move not a file copy, but when dragging and dropping a file from a folder in one logical partition to another folder on a diffrent logical partition (moving a file from C:\ => D:) drag and drop will perform a file copy proccess. while copying and pasting will alwyes be a copy and past proccess.
Apparently, there are differences between different copy programs. I experienced corrupted copies with drag/drop in Windows Explorer, but not with another file manager (Total Commander). Have yet to test copy, xcopy and others. My problem is hardware related, but yes, Windows can, in some particular circumstances create non-identical copies, without realizing it and without showing an error.
I would have thought that any copy program would eventually end up using the same Windows internal copy routine, but apparently not. Still, it would be surprising if the same program (Windows Explorer) used 2 different copy routines depending on how the copy was initiated.
