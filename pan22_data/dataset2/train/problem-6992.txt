They are all answered by 404 Error documents so I assume these requests are rejected. So is there anything I could tune? This is only a small webserver for our group so any fancy load balancing is out of question.
you could encourage those who are still trying to use your now-closed proxy to stop by redirecting them to a password-protected page (one that has no valid users, htpasswd file = /dev/null) - every request will pop up an annoying auth dialog until they give up and stop trying to misuse your proxy.
And then I realized that these processes were quite old. I killed them now and everything seems fine. 
Ok turned out that not the actual hits were responsible but old hung apache procs from the time before I closed the proxy. 
If you have only recently disabled the proxy, it's going to take some time for the people who were using your proxy to realize its no longer working properly and drop you from their lists.  I don't know of anything you can do-how many of these requests are you seeing per second?
