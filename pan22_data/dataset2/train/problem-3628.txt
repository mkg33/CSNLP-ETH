For a large system such as Facebook, you got to wonder how much artistic license (aka bullsh*t) was given in the making of the movie. In an environment with thousands of systems and thousands of clusters, watching server logs scrolling on a terminal is not necessarily the #1 monitoring activity. 
Apachetail also provides a real-time view/analysis of Apache logs by connecting directly to your Apache server from a windows desktop app. No software needs to be installed on the Apache server.
You could also use the realtime log viewer in something like LogLogic and filter our what you did not want to see. This way you could collect more than apache logs, you could get router logs, ftp logs, etc.
In an environment like that (or any production environment with several dozen nodes), you'd have a NOSC of sort with indicators, and only when something is flagged as being in a state of crapping out that one would go and actively look at the logs (probably filtered for significant events and messages.)
Another thing you can try is the "watch" command which can repetitively run a grep command on any log file you want. Using approriate watch command switches you can even highlight changes in log files in real time.
