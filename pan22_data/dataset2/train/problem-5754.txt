If you want to search through a bunch of columns at the same time, this link might be useful to you:
The first query I remembered, the second I took from here: https://www.mytecbits.com/microsoft/sql-server/search-find-stored-procedure
I had a query that would run through every schema/database on a server looking for this information, because what I was looking for might not be in my database, but I'll have to dig it up if you need more than the above.
To generate a script that you could search through with all database objects/code: Right click on DB > Tasks > Generate Scripts > Next on Intro screen > On Choose objects screen tick 'Select specific database objects' and tick the objects you want to search > On Set Scripting Options Screen, select 'Save to new query window' > Summary Screen - click Next > click finish.
However, very likely your proc will fetch the value from a table that stores it, so the proc doesn't have to be hard coded. 
It is also possible to use this method to include the data values in the script, though this could be a huge script depending on the size of your database. To do this, on the 'Set Scripting Options' screen, click advanced > then change 'Types of data to script' to schema and data.
If it's in the text of a proc/function you could use the easy and free to use third party plugin of redgate:     SQL Search, there are also ways to do this with TSQL, see answer on stackexchange searching through procedures
