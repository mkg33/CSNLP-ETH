While this method is easier to set-up, it does require ensuring that your subsequent scales for both Axis are adjusted to ensure that your ranges are consistent.  In particular, I'd set both Axis Min and Max values, rather then letting Excel do it automatically.
The Hard Way:  You can also trick Excel into making you a panel chart with some specific data layout work.  Basically, create an "arbitrary" X Axis with however many points you need for each data set, plus some additional blank values between your panels' values.  You'll get something like this:
Once you're setup with this method, you don't have the same issues with scaling as above.  In addition, you can use a second data series, format it as a column chart, and use that as banding (like the gray bands for each data series), to help better define breaks in the data sets.
The Easy Way: As Simkill suggested, just create two (or more charts) and align them, creating an ad-hoc panel chart. By creating your base chart and choosing the formating, you can copy/paste that for subsequent panels ensuring that there's a consistent appearance.  It would look something like this:
