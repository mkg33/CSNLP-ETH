The git bash command is missing from the non-working one. (Yes, I know I can open a bash window from the working one, and then just use cd ../ to change directories so I'm in the correct repo, but that's just asking for trouble, as I frequently have bash windows open for multiple repos.)
What isn't visible in the screenshot is that the entire top menu chunk (Open - Play with VLC media player) is also missing from the "bad" repo; the only item available in that top chunk is 7-Zip.
I've had git running on my machine for over a year. I have a folder in my C root called gitRepo, which contains all my various repos. For some reason, for one repo only, the git bash command is suddenly missing from the right-click context menu. Here's a screenshot from a working repo:
This may not be an option for everyone, but here's what finally worked for me. Since I knew that newly-created folders would have the correct context menu, I just renamed the "bad" repo (just to be safe), then created a new clone of the remote repo, which by default creates a new folder. Once I knew that the new repo was working, I deleted the old folder.
