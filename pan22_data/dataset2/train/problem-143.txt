I have a development site up that requires a username and password (basic http auth) before the user can see the site.  I'd like to redirect to a secure protocol first, before the user can send in the password in clear text.  Any thoughts on how to do this using Apache?  I have access to the conf and .htaccess files.  
The basic things is just to not set authentification on http virtualhost and redirect everything on the https virtualhost where authentication is done.
You can use the redirect directive on http virtualhost to redirect to the https site where authentification is done. You could also use mod_rewrite to do the redirection.
Regardless of how you have the SSL vhost configured, I'd use this configuration for the non-SSL vhost:
If I recall correctly, http basic authentication is done at the initial handshake before the SSL session is established.  So even if you are logging into an SSL server the basic authentication is done in plaintext.  That has been one of the longstanding issues with basic authentication.  Perhaps one of the other http authentication methods deals with this.  It's been a long time since I've looked at this.
Add lines for your logging, too, but nothing else is needed.  Everything will be redirected permantently to the https:// URL, and the SSL site's .htaccess or other access control stuff won't be handled until after the redirect.
