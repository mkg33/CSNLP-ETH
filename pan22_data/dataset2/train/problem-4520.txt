If your updates come through WSUS, you can determine which updates require a mandatory reboot of the machine and plan them during a maintenance window. 
Then to fix the issue, you'll need to add this registry value to ensure Windows restarts at the scheduled time, even if it is locked.
Stopping the service isn't enough, as it'll just start itself again. You have to disable the service until you are ready to restart the server.
I have a domain controller with Windows Server 2012 on it. After updates, the server does not reboot immediately. However if I remote into the server I will be presented with a countdown for a reboot. The only options are to restart now or to close the notification. However the countdown still continues and the server eventually reboots without my permission. How can I stop this from occurring?
You could use Powershell for installing updates.  Do an internet search for the PSWindowsUpate module and download it.  Then run the command Get-WUInstall.  There's a switch that lets you ignore the request for a reboot.  I've been using it on all of my 2012 servers, and I like it a lot better than using the GUI.
