The reason I think you are getting connectivity problems when disconnecting is perhaps caused by both interfaces sharing the same IP range (which I'm guessing is the case?), so connections to that network are being torn down before being re-established.
Run the ip route print command. It will show you the routing table of your computer. You will be able to find the networks that you are connected to and the default gateway then. It should reveal you what you want to know.
Run a tracert to an external source, like 8.8.8.8, and find out which gateway it is leaving out of.  This can verify if it left via your LAN address or your WiFi address (unless they are on the same subnet, in which case it wouldn't matter :) )
You are connected to both. What you are really asking (I think) is which connection am I using to send data. This is shown from the routing table.
In our office we have both LAN and Wi-Fi network. say i have now connected to both LAN and WiFi. now when i give ipconfig. It is showing both LAN IP and also WiFi IP. I want to know, to which network i'm really connected.  The 'Network connections icon' on laptop is showing that i'm connected to WiFi, when i have both WiFi and LAN connection. But if i remove LAN connection.. My network is getting interrupted and taking time to connect to WiFi again.
