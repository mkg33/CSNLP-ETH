If you don't need a routed address you can get a unique-local-address.  This is the IPv6 equivalent of the 10.x.x.x address space.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_Local_Address
is it possible to obtain a routed IPv6 subnet? We do not have any nearby IPv6 brokers, nor do our local ISPs support it, but we'd like to build an IPv6 network anyways.
Or, if you have a large global network you can get a global address space.  Big organizations like Google or IBM get these because their operations literally span the globe.  But honestly if you were a global operation you would have IPv6 connectivity available to you.
I might be reading too much into your question, but you said you wanted a routed IPv6 subnet.  The only way your are going to get a route-able subnet without your ISP being involved is through a broker.  Period.
You can obtain a tunnel through any of the brokers - Hurricane Electric has a list of geographically diverse endpoints.  Performance is better if you're close to an endpoint, however it isn't absolutely necessary to be near your endpoint.
Alternatively you can become an ISP -- you will need to apply for address space from a local registrar (and you'll need at least a few v4 addresses too - so this is expensive).  You will then need to make transit arrangements with someone to carry your IPv6 traffic (this is VERY expensive), and get connectivity run to your location (this is HIDEOUSLY expensive).
