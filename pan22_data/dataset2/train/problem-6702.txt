The following website has a good list of Working Wifi Adaptors which have been tested on various images.
http://www.MCMelectronics.com sell RPi and accessories.  Among the accessories are "Wi Pi" from Element 14 and "EDiMAX Nano USB Wireless N USB Adapter".  Both are USB dongles and I presume are suitable for RPi. US$10 and US$12 respectively.
I purchased the AirLink101 AWLL5088 Wireless N 150 Ultra Mini USB Adapter card which worked out of the box with the Raspbian 2012-12-16 Wheezy image.
I have a TPLink WN823N, quite small. I think i noted yesterday (in trying to work out my SMB performance issue) that it draws about  less than 1A of power.
I bought and currently use the CNet CQU-906 Wireless-N Pico USB Dongle. super small and worked about 1-2 minutes after plugging it in(counting the reboot time due to a new USB device being plugged in). fully compatible on my device and i was connected to my network faster than my laptop can connect with its built in wireless. here's a link to it.
oh, it also required no configuration or extra drivers on the rasbian/raspbmc side. so it worked straight out of the box
