An easy workaround in this case is to simply remove the $ORIGIN line from the zone file; it will then be automatically built based on the zone definition in named.conf, ensuring that those strings will match.
I used the following resources and I just find myself getting more and more lost staring blankly at the zone file. This is the only server in the environment multi-hosting different services:
I then created a new zone file /var/named/domain.com.zone which is configured as such. I can't figure out what I did wrong with the SOA record at the top, or if there are other issues with my zone file:
This could be caused by the $ORIGIN domain.com line mismatching from the zone "domain.com" IN { line in the named.conf file, either due to an actual mismatched or something like a UTF-8 string handling problem.
It's been entirely too long since I setup a bind server. I've creating a lot of Windows DNS servers lately so I wanted to try my hand at it on CentOS 6. Unfortunately I'm having a slew of trouble setting up the zone files. 
The log entry SOA record not at top of zone (domain.com.domain.com) is a hint that something is amiss; the SOA record at the top of the file is not being considered as the entry for the domain that's supposed to be handled by this zone file.
