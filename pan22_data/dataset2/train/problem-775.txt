I never used virtualbox on windows but on ubuntu you move the VDI and in virtualbox GUI you right click on the VM and use Configuration Menu -> storage where you can change the VDI localization to where you moved the file.
If you don't do this, you will get an error that looks something like the following (I'm copying and pasting someone else's error message which comes from Windows). If you get this error, it's simply because you didn't quit VirtualBox or wait long enough for VBoxSVC to quit.
I tried the original method (remove the VDI, attach the new copy), got the message that the old one still exists, and couldn't attach the new copy even when I restarted the OS (on Mac OS X El Capitan).
You can move the VDI to the new location, but I don't think you can avoid XML modification. As an alternative (but that is in fact the same as XML edition) would creating a new virtual machine with the GUI and choosing the moved image as disk would suit your needs?
4) Find the 8kb Blue icon that has a type of 'virtualbox machine definition' . Select it and it will add to your virtualbox list. double click virtual machine and it works. 
This worked for me with the MacOS release of VirtualBox as well (release 4.1.12). I waited 5-10 seconds for VirtualBox to quit before re-launching. I looked in Activity Monitor to make sure VBoxSVC had quit properly.
Regarding the other machine files definition, you move them and in GUI you go to Preferences and change the position of default machines directory to the diretory you moved.
The fix was in menu / File / Virtual Media Manager, remove the existing VDI. This works even if there are snapshots; just remove all the snapshot VDIs in reverse order. No need to close and reopen VirtualBox.
