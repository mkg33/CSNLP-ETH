Should the computer system at 10.1.1.1 be able to hit (either directly with the IP or through a registered dns like my.domain.com) the external ip (69.1.1.1:80) and have it 'resolve'/redirect to the internal server located at 10.1.1.2?
If this a PURE firewall then you could run into problems but in reality most firewalls will act to some degree as a limited router and so yes this should just work. It certainly works on all the firewall/routers I've used. Do you know what your FW is?
Lets say I have two systems behind a firewall and they are in the same domain and subnet. System 1 has IP 10.1.1.2 and has IIS installed (aka listening to port 80). The other system is just a normal system that has outbound internet traffic.
Should system 2 (The outbound traffic system) be able to hit the external ip and have it redirect to the server running IIS without having to modify any host file or NAT setting?
Here is a very nice explanation of this problem, given in an equivalent context. The solution is to configure what the MikroTik page calls "hairpin NAT". I have also seen the technique referred to as "NAT reflection", in the context of pfSense and m0n0wall.
