The original intent of private addresses was to allow people to run networks that didn't directly exchange packets with the global Internet without needing to assign global addresses to all machines on those networks. This saved addresses, and reduced the likelihood of inadvertant communication between those hosts and the outside works.
Later NAT came along. This allowed hosts with private addresses to make outgoing TCP/UDP connections to hosts on the public Internet. The NAT would replace the address and port used by the client with a globally reachable address and a suitable port (which may or may not be the same as the port the client originally used) and keep a mapping table so that replies could be translated.
In the home and mobile sectors too NAT became common. In the home case NAT became ubiquitous with the move from plain modems to "home routers". In the mobile case NAT was implemented at the ISP level. 
Many companies found the advantages of running private IP addresses with NAT compelling. There was less possibility of inadvertantly exposing stuff to the whole world, no need to justify address usage, no need to pay per-address fees that some ISPs charged and for smaller companies no need to readdress their systems when changing ISP (for larger companies the final point was not an issue because they could get provider-independent address allocations).
(note: this answer limits itself to IPv4, the IPv6 side of things is interesting but it's drifting a bit far from the question topic)
