Thanks for any assistance here; I've dealt with migrating websites many times but never with the mail server component...
I would like to migrate my organization's primary website to a different hosting provider, which is a straight-forward process, however we also have an exchange server that handles mail for this domain. Our domain registrar is Network Solutions and our DNS appears to be handled by our current hosting provider (XO Communications). For our website, I realize I merely need to change the naming servers to point to the new hosting provider-- which I'm assuming I'd do via Network Solutions-- however, I'm unclear as to the way our exchange server needs to be handled in this transition.
In the DNS zonefile at XO, I can see two entries listed under "MX Record (Mail Exchange)"-- i.e. one listing "mail.ourdomain.com" and another for "mailhost.xo-hosting.com." If I change the name servers listed in the Network Solutions control panel to those for our new hosting provider, I'm assuming I also need to change the server name listed in the MX record at XO? Or do I actually need to migrate the DNS management altogether to the new hosting provider? Finally, what modifications do I need to make to the Exchange server itself?
