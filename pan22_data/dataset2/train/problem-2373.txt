Ideally such resources would be entertaining or highly interactive.  I'm afraid if I hand out a bunch of links to blogs or lengthy articles that it would be ignored.  Trying hard not to make a commentary here, but I think the reality is that the material has to be dumbed-down for it to be digested.
We do a pretty good job of keeping our corporate Windows devices clean from malware. Most of our Intranet applications are browser-based and our users do a fine job of following our rules of the road on the corporate network regarding what they can and can't do.
Lately we seem to be getting a flood of these requests.  Even outside of work, I've had four people ask me to help them with performance issues on their Windows machine in the last two months. I'm to the point where I no longer bother troubleshooting and just offer to re-install the OS to save my time/sanity.
What I'm looking for is a set of good resources, videos, tutorials, strategies--whatever--that will provide some basic training to our staff/friends/family/(their kids) to help them avoid common pitfalls in running Windows.  
The same can not be said for our users' personal systems, however.  We are a pretty small company, so we often don't mind a little 'extracurricular' PC maintenance. We'll usually accommodate a few requests here or there to help our staff with their personal computing issues.  
I realize this topic is subjective so I'm going to submit it as a wiki, but I do feel that it is highly relevant to IT professionals regardless.
