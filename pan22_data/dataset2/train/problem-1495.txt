I would recommend using a DMVPN solution to connect remote sites over L2L (Lan-to-Lan) IPSec tunnels between ASAs. The DMVPN solution is much easier, cleaner, and will allow spoke to spoke communication as well.
I've deployed IOS version 8.4.7 on the firewall with two ISPs and it actually appears to be behaving properly.  Failover is happening when the primary interface goes down, and then moving back when that interface comes back AND remaining on that interface.  We'll see.
I agree with above statements. Go simple VTI based IPSEC or alternatively DMVPN. Just remember to run different routing procotol instances within and without the tunnels. Yeah you'll have to replace the ASAs with ISRs. 
As a follow-up on this question I've been working with Cisco TAC on this for over a year.  They've finally identified that this is a bug with the way the ASA platform handles connections.  essentially it wasn't clearing connections from one interface when it moved the tunnel to the other interface and it would spiral out of control as it started to see entries in the connection table out both interfaces.
Are both ISPs going back to a single head office ASA or two? If two I find it hard to see (with the config available at least) how this behaviour could occur, but if its the same ASA (or same pair) it could be related. 
In IPsec vpn tunnel fail over configuration on ASA,fail over from primary to backup link works. But after second fail over from backup to primary link vpn tunnel start flapping in few minutes and remains unstable. The behavior is observed because of old leftover connection still pointing to backup isp.
