There is a particular program that I use that whenever it starts up, its window is always too big.  I always have to resize it to make it smaller.  Is there a way I can control the size of the window when it starts up?
It's an Autohotkey script that will wait for the window to exist, resize it, and then stop until the window closes - meaning it keeps working across window-openings.
Sometimes holding the Ctrl or Ctrl+Alt keys down when you close a window (X) will keep the size and position of the window next time it opens, it may take several tries.
If the program overrides the Windows-maintained settings itself, you will have to find a solution within the program (or the developers!). Otherwise, I have heard that closing the application with CTRL or ALT when clicking the [X] button in the corner can sometimes make sure an application gets it's position/size saved. I haven't got an errant application to test it on, so give it a go and let us know.
It sounds like the program writers have specified a default size for their application and are using that on startup rather than saving the size and position you set during use. Which is non-standard behaviour.
