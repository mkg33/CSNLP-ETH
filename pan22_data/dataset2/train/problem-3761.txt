This laptop would charge up to 100% and if you unplug it then you had about 3 minutes to plug it back in.
Laptops doesn't go shutdown when battery level is below 5%.when if reaches its lowest point it goes to sleep mode to protect your data. Mean while in sleep mode it consumes some energy. If it is beyond the extreme level, it does shutdown and you may loose your unsaved data. There are multiple ways to recover your unsaved data depends on type of applications.
Have you been able to observe your computer as it ran out of power without hibernating? You don't give any information about your environment, but going into hibernation often requires some cooperation from active programs. A program that doesn't respond properly can prevent hibernation. Usually the OS might pop up a message telling you this happened, but you won't know if you're not there to see it before the system goes dark...
Another potential issue is disk caching. Hard drives and operating systems use volatile caches. If the computer shuts down too quickly, even deliberately, and the caches are not committed, you will lose data.
If his power settings were set up to do something at 5/10/15% then you can bet these settings were never triggered since the laptop would go from 20% down to 0% in an instant and die without properly shutting down.
The system could hibernate when power gets low, but if your battery is draining really quickly, it's probably deemed that not to be safe.
Try disabling "Disk Write Caching" on your disk. Device Manager -> Disk Drives -> (Select your HDD/SSD) -> Policies -> Untick "Enable write caching on the device".
It is impossible for the laptop to "go to sleep" when it has run out of power. Sleep requires power; just less than non-sleep.
