Cold temp at your posted temp (~10f) will not cause the HDD to be damaged when the computer is turned on. This temp will not freeze the LCD either. 
1) A very cold battery will lose its charge quicker and so if you use a laptop on battery when it's cold you may have less runtime (NB: I am not talking about battery self-discharge)
If the computer was exposed to the inside of a car, it is likely that there in no moisture inside the computer and start it up in your home once it has warmed up completly to room temp. 72F
Letting it warm up has two paths it could follow, if the computer was frozen in a moist environment, ie. outside, then start the computer at 31 F and put the computer in a container the coveres at least the to the keyboard of the computer and fill the contaioner with sylica gel, if you don't haver that much you can use dry rice, this is to absorb the moisture than is not going to come off the warming computer. Also I would not run any applications, just leave at log in or statr up desktop until the computer is at room temp. Also do not plug it in if it has died due to battery charge loss ( from the cold).
(If your computer dies, I have methods of saving the hard drive when exposed to cold and then re heated up.(however if the HDD is your primary concern, remove it under 10F conditions and put it into a back up starter and turn that on at 10F this will save the HDD for sure. but only if the HDD is the first concern, as opening the computer under 10F conditions will cause damage, ie moisture from breath or opening the external case in your car))
2) You will often see condensation on items brought in from cold environments but this is not the only reason you let them warm up before switch on. The other reason for waiting is because switching on a cold item and letting it heat up rapidly may result in thermal shock to delicate components (eg: disk drives and LCD screens, especially the glassmount screen connectors) as their parts expand rapidly.
