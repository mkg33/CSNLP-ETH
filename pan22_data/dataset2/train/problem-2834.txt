For me the number one reason for deploying Solaris was that some of my clients demand a service contract for all there software and hardware with a penalty clause in it. Only the bigger companies can afford a legal department which sets up a contract that gives you warm and fuzzy feeling but in the end is not responsible for anything.
Having said that, I use linux for damn near everything, from an nlsu2 as a print/file server, up to fairly beefy servers. Solaris can't cover most of this hardware. Solaris has it's place, but it's becoming a real niche now.
Before I answer your question, let me just say that I would never actively select Solaris as an operating system on any new project.  Linux just offers so much more that's missing in Solaris unless you take a lot of pains to install all the GNU stuff to emulate what is there by default in Linux.  That being said, there's two things that would possibly make somebody other than me select Solaris:
I also can't recall having to power cycle a Solaris box because it wouldn't respond. I've always been able to get something back from it and recover the system - probably not an issue on a small server, but when you look at how long an E10k or E20k took to boot, you really don't want to be forced to powercycle. I've seen linux boxes becoming wedged on too many occasions to count. 
Chicken and egg problem, you should be familiar with the technology and its particular advantages to use it in the right position, but if you have never used it you don't know these very advantages. 
However Solaris is IMHO a solid OS and has some very nice features, but if you don't use these features and you don't require a legal contract for the stuff you use, why not use the OS you actually are the most comfortable with.
Solaris is reliable. In 12 years of running Solaris on Sparc, I've never had a kernel panic unless there is faulty hardware. For Linux I've seen vast numbers of kernel panics due to kernel bugs.
