I don't have a comprehensive list, but most of what we've tried adds delay to the voice (echo), garbles the sound, doesn't allow more than one call at a time, or just plain won't work.
We use an Asterisk based solution as our PBX, and although we've found hardphones work flawlessly, we have yet to find a reliable softphone.
X-Lite is great for a free solution. If you're willing to part with some cash for a license then eyeBeam is reasonably priced.
http://www.counterpath.net/x-lite-download.html I don't like that you can't transfer (with the free version) but it seems to be a very solid client. You should also check out this comparison http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_VoIP_software
One major advantage of that client is that it supports both IAX and SIP. The free version supports two line registration profiles and they have paid versions as well.
The only one I know of is Ekiga.  Never used it so can't give a recommendation one way or the other.
On Windows we're fine (SJPhone), and although I'd prefer to use the same softphone for both OSes, I will settle for a good Linux-only one.
