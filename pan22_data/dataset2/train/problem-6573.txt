Macs used to let you hold down C to start from the optical disk.  You can still hold down Option to see the boot device list. 
This is a bit tricky to get it to work for a drive across different computers, so let's assume that you're only connecting the external drive to one machine (or that you want this convenience on the one particular combination)
That way, if the external drive is not connected, the system will boot the OS on the internal drive. When the external drive is connected, it will still boot the OS on the internal drive by default, unless you press a key to stop the boot process, in which case you can select the OS of the external drive. 
Different BIOSes work differently.  Most allow you to change the boot order, and some allow you to disable specific devices from the boot order list.  Most allow you to push a button before BIOS to see the list of boot devices.  I've never seen a Windows PC that let you spam a key at BIOS time for a specific boot device without going to the list.
This  has many caveats. First, I assume you're using BIOS and not UEFI. Moreover, you still need to do one more step to boot from the external drive other than pressing one key. However, this could be a starting point for your solution
You could set up the system to try to boot from the external drive by default/before the internal drive.
