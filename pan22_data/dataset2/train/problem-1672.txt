I would not be concerned with availability in the long run, but for a brand new product and your deadline being next month, you can either take the risk and buy now or simply postpone the upgrade until next year, for example.  
From an engineering and design perspective, implementing on newly released hardware is somewhat problematic. Besides the production shortage associated with newly released products, there is also the possibility of bugs (hardware and software/firmware), physical incompatibility, and just general surprises that crop up. You should be prepared to deal with integration issues completely unrelated to your application. 
The primary benefit of the B+ is more network throughput. The processor core itself is not any faster, just clocked 10% faster with a slightly newer rev of the SoC (same arm core), with proper cooling you can achieve the same calculation performance by overclocking.
That being said, RPI foundation has recently expanded its distributors  . Although production shortage is still possible. There are many suppliers with large stocks. For example, looking at available stock on digikey, newark-element14, and seed studio  there are over 25,000 Pi3 available for immediate purchase and overnight delivery. I'm not quite sure why the Pi Zero is still so difficult to get, but at least for the full size products there track record is getting better. 
If it were me, I would target the established product (B) and evaluate or plan to upgrade to the B+ when you are satisfied with its availability and performance. The performance gain is not worth the risk of missing a deadline or delivery date.
