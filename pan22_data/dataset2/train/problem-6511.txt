If you are using ACLs on the source filesystem, but not on the destination, mv on Linux will copy the source and then - because of the inability to set the ACLs on the destination - stop. So you end up having the file on both sides. The is no switch in mv to prevent that behaviour so in this case cp && rm is preferable.
On windows i always copy and delete instead of move. I was once moving files and this is where i first noticed a bad stick of memory. When moving the file it stopped in between and i got an error so i checked the source folder and the file was gone then i checked the destination and there was a corrupt file. This happened more frequent with bigger size files and most of them were downloads which took hours so id recommend copying and then deleting. Save yourself time in the beginning it will pay off in the end.
In Windows, at least, move is simply a more automated Copy&Delete. I believe mv moves each file individually, meaning ^c-ing won't lose any files, you'll just end up with your files split between two places - unlike Windows Explorer, which will un-move everything when it cancels.
If dest is on another device, mv will copy first, then delete the old version. This is not an atomic operation. If it fails, you may have only a partial copy of verybigdir in dest, but verybigdir will still be complete.
