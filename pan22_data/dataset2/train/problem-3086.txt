For outgoing traffic you can setup your non-internet connected PC to have a static IP address on your network.  In your static IP configuration leave the default gateway field blank.  This will keep this computer from sending its internet-bound traffic to the router and any attempt should return with an no route to host error, however, the machine should still be abel to talk to the other computers on the LAN.
Note: This is not a completely secure implementation.  There is no firewall keeping outgoing packets from reaching the internet, so in theory a specially crafted packet could still get to the internet from this machine, but for most purposes this should work.
Having said that, Internet access control is a function of the router. On my router it's under Access Restrictions | Internet Access, but it varies.
This is a bit pointless. If any of the machines on the network have the ability to receive connections then you should assume that they all can, since it is possible to surreptitiously set up a forwarder on the machine that can be accessed from the Internet.
Using your router should keep any packets from reaching the computer.  As long as you don't have a DMZ setup or any port forwarding rules to the computer you should be protected from incoming traffic.
Another option is to use parental control software (e.g. NetNanny) on the restricted PC.  If it's a Mac then it has parental controls built in under the user admin settings.
