You can do it by removing all root hints in destination dns server and create your own root zone with fqdn "." (dot). This will cause resolution query to stop at the first step. 
Open the DNS managment. Set up a new Forward Lookup Zone for google.com and set a Host A record to 192.168.1.1. Also ensure all clients use the server as the DNS.
If you're trying to restrict web access from users, there are other ways.  I would suggest setting a group policy proxying all web traffic not to an approved whitelist to 0.0.0.0, which will just blackhole all that traffic.  I've done it before for clients - it's not that difficult, especially if the whitelist is small (i.e. one SharePoint server).
I don't know that you can.  As far as I know I do not believe you can create a . type record in Windows DNS to have it redirect all requests to one IP address.  If you're confident that you'll NEVER need internet access on that network section, you can delete the Root Hints from DNS, which will cause all requests to DNS that are not internal to fail, but I'm not sure you can, in Windows DNS, cause all DNS requests to resolve to one IP address.
You can create a root zone (.) on the server which will effectively disable all DNS resolution for external names. Note that this will disable ALL DNS resolution for ALL external names.
When user changes primary dns server in tcp/ip configuration, your dns server will not be in effect. When user tries to connect by ip address, your dns server will not be in effect again. For example create a primary zone for google.com in your dns server and add an A record whichever ip you want. Clear dns client caches. And try to browse for google.com and see your dns server will be hit and resolves your configured ip address, and then try to browse "209.85.148.105"
