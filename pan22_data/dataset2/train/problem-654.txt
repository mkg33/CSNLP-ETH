If you want high Performance buy a Desktop PC with i5. If you want mobility with power use a normal laptop with a normal i5. If you want maximal battery life and don't need power all the time buy such an Haswell U i5 to get a good balance between battery life and CPU power.
The emphasis has been on power consumption for some time. Probably blame the MacBook Air for this switch from traditional thicker notebooks to thin and light. Obviously to get there the CPU has to produce less heat and so Intel created the U series of core "I" cpu's. They really work fine for basics but don't have the real agility needed for heavy task stuff. Intel makes better HQ series or even Xtreme gaming series CPU's. But they are in the more traditional laptops and gaming laptops. Mainly because they require way more cooling. Even worse is the core "M" stuff with fanless designs which are very power efficient but even less performance hounds. 
The U/ULV versions where always slower compared to the normal i Core CPUs but consume less energy and generate less heat.
