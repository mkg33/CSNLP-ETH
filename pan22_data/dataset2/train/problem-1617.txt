The kernel OOM killer is partially configurable, so one should be able to "protect" an important process. However, the real solution is to understand why the machine faces an out-of-memory condition; the most common cause:
It looks like your logs are corrupted. Try recreating the InnoDB log files by moving the existing ib_logfile(s) out of the way and restarting MySQL. If that doesn't work you're likely to have some data corruption.
So a little background, a few weeks ago I brought a new CentOS dedicated server in Melbourne, however it seems beside the number of attackers I get, there also seem to be an issue with the MySQL database, or a software that is using is as it keep crashing and drying.
One common cause of "sudden" MySQL/MariaDB crashes is the kernel OOM killer - basically, if the machine is short on RAM, the kernel kill the most RAM-consuming process.
I have gone thru the logs and don't see any reason why it would be crashing but i am wondering if anyone out there would be able to give me a hand fixing this issue.
