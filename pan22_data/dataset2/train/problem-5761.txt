Personally I would not recommend writing a Unit test for a WCF service. It is an infrastructure and generally you would orchestrate routines, call a fa√ßade or a another service, provide addition infrastructure such as logging caching etc. There is no much behaviour, and you should not. I think you get more benefit writing an integration test or an acceptance test. Also doing TDD for WCF is unheard-of.
You get more value of for your effort if you Unit Test your domain, or your standard POCO classes with behaviour, or even the services (which may have behaviour) that might consume your WCF service.
I have seen developers attempt write Unit Tests for WCF services and caught up with mocking issues, etc. And maintenance issue on both test and the code when there is a need to add additional infrastructure. Even if you were able to mock certain things as it current state, then you would test pretty much verification type testing. For example, whether a method has been called or not. We encourage more state based type testing, not verification type testing. Now you see when adding more tests means more code to maintain.
