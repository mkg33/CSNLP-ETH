If your looking to buy a watercooled solution i would use the zalman cabinet that has it all built in. Be aware that you will need to buy water cooling system for you video card your self, i myself bought a video card and then a water cooling block for it. But i dont recommend that, i would rather buy one that has water cooling block already installed.
Screwing a harddrive into the case lets it carry the vibrations.  You need something to absorb the vibrations. There are a  lot of things that do that poorly, if at all. I'm thinking of getting some of that asphalt stuff. I find this bit to be quite creepy since I know I'll need to experiment to find a solution. (I don't have one now, my hd:s make noise.)
Be aware that the zalman does not come with a water cooler block for a the I7 but the Core intel series so you will need to buy a I7 block. For a powersupply you need to find out how much power you need and search for your quite one. Be aware that building a water cooled computer is more work then one that uses fans, and requires a bit of planning. If your not willing to go all the way with water cooling, i would build a computer that fits my specs and buy a new fane for the CPU and replace the oem one.
You most likely have to PAY to make your machine quiet by paying for better engineering and higher quality components.
Look closer into using larger fans that run slower. I can't seem to find any useful link right now, but the fluid dynamics of the thing makes moving the the volume of air quieter that way. (higher Reynolds number = more noise?)  With care, you can make fan-based solutions very quiet. (Or you could just get watercooling..)
