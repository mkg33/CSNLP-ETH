SolarWinds is another huge player.  Great features and reporting.  Only downside is you will pay a higher cost.  IMO, the benefits justify the cost, but every scenario is different.
NfSen/nfdump (http://nfsen.sourceforge.net/) are really good for netflow. Stores your data in RRD format, and has a lot of options for displaying and processing.
These tools are mostly SNMP based. You can also use Netflow to get more visibility into what is using how much bandwidth.
PRTG is a nice solution, can't be the price.  You can use SNMP to monitor interfaces and it now also includes Netflow.  Probably not the most robust reporting, but a good starting point for the price.
You can use tools like Cacti or PRTG. These tools support weathermaps showing you actual bandwidth usage in the network. You can also set thresholds so that when more than 80% on a link is utilized send an e-mail or SNMP trap and so on.
ManageEngine has some nice products, but I have always found their interface and navigation not as intuitive as other solutions on the market.  Either way the product does what is advertised.
I have used Liveaction and it does a great job of showing a nearly real time weather map of our network.  This can generate a lot of netflow and/or SNMP traffic from the end devices to the server but the information that it provides has enabled us to resolve congestion issues rather quickly.
