You can configure multiple domains with the same key, but this is not recommended as all your domains will then share fate, will need to have corresponding DS records changed at the same time (if the key is a KSK), etc.
The key tag is the same... if you are using the same key. The key tag or key id references the key. It is not a good reference because there are collisions (the space is small by definition 2 bytes, so 65536 values in theory, in practice less than half in fact because of bugs in the algorithm and implementations), it is just to make sysadmins life easier.
Even for a single domain, your ZSK should change regularly (typically each month or two months are frequent values), and then new RRSIG records will appear referencing the new key hence with a new key tag.
What you call a "key tag" is what is in RRSIG records to identify which key was used to sign the records and hence produce this RRSIG records, see RFC 4034 ยง3. Typically, at a given point in time in a zone there is only one Zone Signing Key (ZSK) so all RRSIG records will indeed have the same key tag.
I was adding DNSSEC to a few of my domains recently, and I noticed that on every single one, the DNSSEC Key Tag was always 2371. What is the point in asking for it if it never changes? (or does it change? When?), and why is it specifically 2371?
The only key tags (ids) that seldom change are the one on the root zone. They do not never change, they seldom change. They changed one year ago. But they will probably not change again soon.
Your value, 2371 is just one random value among others, it has no specific meaning, but then you give absolutely no context in your question... which domains are you talking about?  are you the authoritative nameservers operator or just looking at others' domains? did you put a DPS in place to understand about keys, keys rotations, signatures, etc.?
