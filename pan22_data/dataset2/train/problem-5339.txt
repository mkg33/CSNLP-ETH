If you want to keep Secure Boot active, you can do so, but you'll need to jump through some extra hoops.
Alternatively, you can try the Boot Repair tool. If you're lucky, it will fix the problem a little bit more easily than the preceding procedure; but I'm recommending the above procedure because it's risk-free up to step #6; until then, you won't have done anything to change your system, and by the time you hit step #6, you'll be pretty sure that rEFInd will work (or you'll know that it won't and can abort the procedure). Boot Repair, OTOH, is more of a leap of faith; you run it and hope that it does the right thing, with no evidence that it actually will do the right thing. Given the uncertainty of your situation, that's a bit too great of a leap for me to recommend it.
Your DISKPART output, if I'm reading it correctly, doesn't include the right commands for full diagnostics. (I'm not very familiar with that tool, though.) That said, my suspicion is you've got a boot loader problem, not a disk partitioning problem. Your attempts to recovery with bootrec might have worked on an old BIOS-mode installation, but you've almost certainly got an EFI-based computer for which those commands are inappropriate.
