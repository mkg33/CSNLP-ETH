I did something like this once. It was a custom built application in-house (and is not avaliable for public purchase), but it would listen on an email address, and any emails that came in through a certain timefame (matching certain rules) would send an SMS to the on-call person, and then call them 5 minutes later.
Another option is to roll you own system.  We use a custom solution I developed because it has no monthly cost and it interfaces directly with the public switched telephone network so even if our connection to the internet is down we can still receive phone alerts (this is key since standard emails and SMSes won't go out with no internet connection). Our system is based on adhearsion which is a ruby telephony framework for asterisk which makes interacting with a phone system pretty easy.  We use an analog telephony adapter to interface with the PSTN.
If you want a commercial solution you should check out pagerduty.com, your monitoring system sends pageduty an email and then pager duty will make a phone call or send an sms depending on how you have it configured.
They were on a VoIP system, which made dialling out easy, but if you had a voice modem hooked up to a POTS line the principal was the same.
Using Text To Speech, along with Voice XML and a synthesiser it would read the email to the person on the other end, most of the time they would just hit * and skip the email as they saw the SMS.
