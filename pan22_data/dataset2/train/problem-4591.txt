I know I shouldn't bother with this, maybe I should disable the old mysql, but this is a Magento virtual appliance from Bitnami thats work as a whole (application and database on the same server). 
I had to follow the client's design, though, and take the mysql database to an Amazon RDS instance. (the magento/application server is an EC2 at amazon as well).
I could just forget the old mysql, but any changes I make will have to be manually updated in the remote server, and I fear this script is controlling a lot of other stuff I don't control. 
The application server has a script that starts up mysql, apache and some other stuff. In this process, it always tries to update the mysql database with any new data the server has (like DNS, hostname, IP Addresses). But since the database isn't there anymore, it fails on doing so. 
I never found a way to change the configuration of mysql.sock. I would just reconfigure it and point to the new server with appropriate credentials but I can't find anywhere in the internet how to do so.
