You'll need to configure your NAT to forward inbound connections on port 20600 to 192.168.1.2.  This is often called "port forwarding".  Check out http://portforward.com/ for detailed guides for most hardware options.
Go to a friend's house and try to connect. If it doesn't work, make sure you've set up port forwarding properly on your NAT device. If it still doesn't work, ask a new question here and post some code.
You will usually need to setup a port forwarding rule to allow public traffic to port 20600 on your router to be redirected to 192.168.1.2
You have a client, say 192.168.1.3, and you can connect just fine from it to 192.168.1.2. But when you try to connect from it to the external IP of your NAT router, you don't get anything. This is because you're on the inside of the NAT router and it is both cheap and not configured for this sort of thing. In order to verify that your server can be reached from outside your network, you have to try to reach it from outside your network.
A typical home NAT is designed to ensure that outbound connections can communicate with outside endpoints.  By default, a home NAT does not forward ports on the external interface (e.g., from your cable modem provider) to your dev box.
