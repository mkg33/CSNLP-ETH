According to this article, the kill switch for Cyber Ghost is automatically enabled with no way to disable it. 
There is no kill switch, you can easily test it yourself. Just make a ping to google, then close cyberghost.exe in the task manager and you will see that there is no interruption, also your network icon is not showing that it is disconnected. Cyberghost is NOT safe.
   If the VPN isn't working or blacks out temporarily instead of continuing to torrent your connection stops totally. This is so you will never be unprotected as long as you're using Cyberghost. You paid frigging $ so you'd never be caught, whatever you were doing, Torrenting,  Hacking the USA Democratic National Committee so Republicans can win, without a kill switch you can still be easily caught doing so, and be hauled in front of Mueller's team.    
The whole point of a Kill Switch is, for the most important example I need it for; to prevent you from being caught torrenting on your normal unsecured IP.
I am using Cyberghost 6 on a Windows 10 machine, and I've upgraded to a premium plus account. This vpn service is praised by many online reviews and many of them say that it provides a kill switch. However, I've searched a lot in the settings for this switch but couldn't find it. Anyone can help with that ? After all, what is a vpn if it wasn't for the kill switch.
