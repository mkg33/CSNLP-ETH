Reading through that page, you will be able to get a 64bit preview version of flash, but this version is not yet fully supported and Adobe seems to be in no rush to complete it.
If you're on a 64-bit version of Windows, both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of IE8 are updated to IE9 with the 64-bit IE9 installer.
The x64 install will install the 32 and 64bit version automatically.  Even on a x64 machine you still will default (unless you've changed this on a per user setting) to the 32bit version of IE.
So you don't really have a choice - both are installed, except that the Start menu will point you towards the 64-bit version.
The installation you use is determined by the Operating System.  If you have Windows 7 x64 you install the IE9 Windows 7 x64 installaion.
I am on Windows 7, 64-bit.  I checked to see which version of IE8 is installed and it turns out that the default version is 32-bit.  I am assuming, it's because of the plugin issues (e.g. Flash, etc...)???
You still want to use the 32-bit version, and for exactly the reason you suspect: there is no good 64bit flash plugin for any 64bit browser.
