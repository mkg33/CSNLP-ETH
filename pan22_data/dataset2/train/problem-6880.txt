For the latter, then RDP should do the job, make sure you have firewall rules setup to have exceptions for TCP 3389 which RDP uses.
You want stuff to be running locally on console & then RDP remotely & not affect the console session? 
Maybe I'm missing something but to me RDP to localhost doesn't make sense and shouldn't even be possible, because it would allow the creation of an infinitely recursive process.
You could do with with windows server?   There may be OS level hack to get this to work in a desktop OS, but i have never had the need to do it.
If you want the former, then your out of luck. I think MS has put this in as a limitation on windows desktops like XP/Vista so you dont end up using them as terminal servers.  
So this is a bit of a stretch, but have you looked at something like AutoIt (https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/) for this?  Basically autologin your console account per what you are doing now, then make a startup script in that profile that will RDP to itself with the other account.  Have no idea if this will actually work, but that's the only way I can think of to bootstrap the way you are describing.
Applications like winVNC and tightVNC always log you into the console session, maybe try these?  RDP has much better performance if you can get it to work.
