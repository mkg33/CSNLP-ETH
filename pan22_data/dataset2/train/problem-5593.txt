The configuration is such that there is a subnet with two usable IP addresses (/30). One of the usable IP's is the gateway address and the other is a single free IP address to attach a PC or other device.
I'm looking for a device that will allow me to do NAT as I would understand it if this were a traditional ADSL connection (i.e. single public IP on the WAN side, multiple private IP's on the internal network) to our internal LAN.
I'd prefer a device built for purpose and don't have spare equipment or time to knock up a Linux based Router/Firewall....but if overwhelmingly convinced I can change my mind.
We just had a new internet connection (WiMAX type of thing) installed in one of our remote offices. The customer premises presentation is just an ethernet cable and basically the whole internet is looking in on that wire so I need to set up a firewall. 
We already have a Billion BIPAC 7402NX wireless router on site (this was configured to use a 3G dongle). I'm wondering if I can configure the Billion as a traditional ethernet router/firewall and have the office network on a RFC1918 private range and have it route traffic to the WiMAX network?
