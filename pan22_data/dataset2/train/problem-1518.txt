Disable notifications for non-administrator users. Obviously non real administrators should use a non-administrators group account
In the details pane, click Allow non-administrators to receive update notifications, and set the option.
To disable the notifications completely, just change the update option to manual on such a server. Schedule regular monthly maintenance outages to search for, and apply patches. You get your monthly reboot completed, and you no longer have the warning for updates.
If you have users with administration rights but they're not the responsibles of install updates you can create a new OU for that non full administrators and link a GPO on that OU.
How can we disable the popup banner on Windows 2012 R2 so that the notification doesn't appear on our servers?
We have started to deploy more Windows 2012 R2 servers on our network.  When we log on to these servers (only admins log on to these servers), we are sometimes presented with a blue banner that says Updates are available and Go to Windows Update to install the updates now.  It gives us the choice to either Install the updates or to Close the popup banner.  That would be all well and good if this was a Windows 8 system, but it is not, this is a Windows 2012 R2 server.
In GPO Object Editor expand Computer Configuration, expand Administrative Templates, expand Windows Components, and then click Windows Update.
Unlike the first commenter and responder, I will tell you that I understand that there are reasons that a regular user account would be on a 2012 R2 server with a standard user account, such as a RDS server. 
All the users on that OU won't have access to Windows Update. Obviously full administrators with windows update access should be out of that OU.
We need to disable the banner so that someone doesn't accidentally click on Install.  Stopping the update service on the server is not a solution for us.  We want to be able to manually install updates on these servers.
