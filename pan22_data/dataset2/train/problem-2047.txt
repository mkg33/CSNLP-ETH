3) Your script could use a while(1) loop to keep itself running "forever".  However, it is best to never have a script run forever since you could have potential memory leaks that accumulate over a long time and eventually cause your system to swap and then you have a really slow system.  Have it run for many thousands of iterations or kill itself after a certain amount of time.  Cron will kick it off again on the next timeslot.
How would I go about telling my web server (Webfaction) to just run a python file and let it keep running forever? Someone told me I should use cron but I haven't found any good material on how to run it once, and have it not stop.
From what I understand, you want to keep your process running after close ssh. You could use screen.
Cron runs periodically forever.  Cron jobs can be run by the minute, hour, daily, weekly, or monthly.  Here is an extensive reference:
once you do that you can logout, close the terminal, whatever and your script will continue running until the server is restarted or you kill the process
4) Log your output using >> redirect to a log file so you can catch any messaging you may want to output for status.
1) Write the script such that it first checks for a lock file to ensure there are no other copies already running and/or check that the process is not already running.
