I am using Microsoft SQL Server 2014 on a Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter machine. Having run into issues doing a particular task, I am trying to investigate if the service account that is running the SQL Server Windows Service has access to certain files. I did an out-of-the-box installation of SQL Server, and the service account running that service is NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER (there is also NT SERVICE\SQLSERVERAGENT for Integration Services).
How do I check what files this account has access to? I'm fine with checking on a file-by-file basis.
One way I thought to do this was to run cmd.exe as another user and start doing dirs. When I Shift-Right Click C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe and select Run as a different user, I attempt to enter the full account name, including the domain, but I get this error: The name provided is not a properly formed account name. It's because of the space in the domain. If I omit the domain, it defaults to the domain that the computer is part of, which is not NT SERVICE. This is assuming that the password is to be left blank.
