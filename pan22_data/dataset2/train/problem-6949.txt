Setting it up with a Mac Pro or a Mac Mini Server with Promise SANlink works very well. A Fiber Channel switch is an expense, but not having to pay $1K per client for Xsan licenses is a major improvement. 
Your best bet would be a NAS. Avoid AFP and go with NFS, which mac OSX uses perfectly. The advantage of NFS is that it opens you up to a wide array of NAS vendors that could do the job. 
Given the change of focus for Apple in recent years, I won't trust them anymore for anything on the server side and you can rest assured that the little bit they still offer will be discontinued without any respect to their customers and the investments in hardware, software and knowledge they made if it doesn't fit Apple's plans anymore. 
NAS hardware comes in a spectrum from grungy little 4 drive garbage cans to Netapp filers. The more you spend, the more expandable and highly available it'll be.
I agree with Sven- don't use apple hardware for storage. Now you're talking about "SAN-type" storage, however that means different things to different people. I'm going to assume you like the fact that it's centralized, highly available, high performance, and expandable. I'm not going to assume that you need disk level access to it because that's something you see in the requirements of databases, not macs.
As long as your environment is something else than "just a few Macs only", I would seriously recommend to not use OS X Lion Server, and especially not with XSAN. 
The right system for you is going to be based on a lot of factors. Do you need NAS or SAN? How much performance? How many files (approx) and how much storage capacity?
