I've been trying for a couple of hours now and wasted 6 CDs to no avail. Can anyone suggest a workable solution?
To create a bootable CD-ROM you need to prepare the disc. You will need to add Bootfiles to the disc. Here is a simple description of how to do this. You will even find a link there to download the correct bootimage. I did this 3-4 times yet and always used this short howto and the bootimage linked there. Your CD-ROM will appear as drive "A:" after booting. There also is a way to do this with some other images, which provide CD-ROM support, but I never did that, so I canÂ´t tell you how good this works.

Edit: Blah, read too fast. I'll leave the answer here anyways, in case someone else tries to search serverfault for the link.
The bootable USB installer that HP provides works great, but we want a bootable CD-ROM instead, because we have many servers and a CD is easier to duplicate.
