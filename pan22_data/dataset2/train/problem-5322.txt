This problem also seems to have been tackled from all sides. We know that under the uniform distribution on examples: monotone decision trees are learnable, that random decision trees are learnable, and that there exists a smoothed analysis as well.  We also know that a SQ algorithm won't solve this problem.  And there is also steady progress in this area.  On the other hand, this is a hard problem that has been open for a while, so this seems to fit the bill of "Open Problems on the Frontiers of TCS."
There a number of open problems in proof complexity, I will mention only one which remains open even after some experts spent years on trying to settle it. It is the proof complexity version of the state in circuit complexity. (See [Segerlind07] if you want to see more open problems in proof complexity.)
Note there are other results I did not go into on the hardness of proper learning DTs, on the ability to learn DTs with queries, and on the hardness of learning even random DTs with SQs.
The question of whether decision trees are PAC learnable seems to be at the frontier of computational learning theory.
The reason this is an interesting and important problem is because decision trees are a very natural class, and unlike, say automata, we do not have cryptographic hardness results that make the problem hopeless.  Progress on this question can perhaps give insight into whether DTs (and similar classes) are learnable without distributional assumptions.  This could have practical impact in addition to being a theoretical breakthrough.
$AC^0[2]$-Frege (a.k.a. d-Frege+$CG_2$) is the proposition proof system that only allows $AC^0[2]$ ($AC^0$ with $\bmod 2$ gates) circuits.
The big open problem is to show an oracle separation between BQP and PH. But we don't even have a separation between BQP and AM (since AM is in PH, this should be easier). Even worse, make BQP considerably more powerful by allowing 1 round interactions with Merlin, giving you the class QAM or QIP(2) (depending on public coins or private coins) and we still don't have a separation.
