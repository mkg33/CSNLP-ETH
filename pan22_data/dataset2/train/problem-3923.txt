You can connect as many routers/switches into a network that you want to (there is a limit with old 15 year old hubs but not new switches), but each one introduces more failure points and potential quirks when dealing with consumer equipment.
Wireless is not as good as a physical cable.  Especially with consumer wireless routers/access points.  They're designed for a few people to surf the internet, not a business network.
One of the first things that needs to be done is to make a chart clarifying what the problem is, and for whom.  Chances are fixing the wireless network will improve your network greatly, but that might not be the real problem.  One of the main questions would be , are the people who are physically wired in experiencing problems?  If so, then that shifts the focus from the wireless issue to a server/application level issue, perhaps upgrade from older switches to gigabit etc.
In a perfect world, you would have network drops to all machines possible, and a good wireless access point for the few people who cant use a network cable.
