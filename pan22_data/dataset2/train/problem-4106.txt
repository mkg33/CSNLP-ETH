I've made a MssqlMerge utility that allows to compare MSSQL databases, both structure and data. There is a Free version available that allows to compare table definitions, views, stored procedures and functions. And also there is a Pro version that supports more object types and have 'Query result diff' feature where you can run and compare any query results, including queries against system views, to compare some other details not availble out of the box.
There is a lot of tools on the market which you might use to get the job done. My company is using ApexSQL Diff for both comparison and sync because it is free for Azure, but you canâ€™t go wrong with either Devart or Redgate tools.
If you cannot use one of the many tools out there because of connectivity problems and want an "offline" compare, you can use SSMS to generate scripts for all database objects by right clicking on the database and using the "Tasks.../Generate Scripts" function, and make sure you select to create one file per object.
When you have done that for both databases, get the two sets of scripts onto a local machine in two separate folders and use WinMerge (or similar) to compare the two.
Do a search for "SQL Server Compare" and you'll find lots of tools. The one we use at my job is Red Gate SQLCompare. It has a 14 day trial. But since you are talking about two different environments I don't think that would work for you, unless the client sends you a backup of their DB. The other option is to write queries against the system tables (like sys.indexes, sys.tables, etc).
You would extract your master database to a dacpac file and then compare the dacpac file to the rest of your databases. The result of the comparison could either be a xml report of the changes or a .sql file you can run to synchronize the databases.
I don't have working code for you but you could look at the SQLPackage.exe documentation for some inspiration.
