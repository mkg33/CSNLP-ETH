I have a Canon Digital Ixus 990IS. The PC (running Windows XP SP2) sees the camera fine. I can copy images and movies.
Also, you should definitely get a card reader. They're faster than using the camera and doesn't use up your camera battery to get the photos off of it.
You need to find the Communication Settings in the menu. It's probably set to PTP, so set it to MTP. I don't have that camera, but I've used several different Canons and that's what the setting is usually called. The manual for your camera doesn't mention more specifically where the setting is located, but it does list it.
I believe the Canon Ixus 990IS defaults to PTP mode (At least my Ixus 970IS seems to). There doesn't appear to be a way to change this either.
I've had the same issue with an MP3 player. The solution was the same, also (change the device to MSC).
Most of file copiers will copy same file each time from start, they will stop at same place each time.
However, this is a setting that is set on the device, not your computer. If your device doesn't have this setting, you are forced to use other suggestions such as use a card reader to mount it as a drive, etc.
You can try FileSaver. Advantage of this program is that it copies data in stages. Each stage will only copy parts that haven't succeeded in previous one.
P.S. Since KB article states that there is hot-fix available, you can just call Microsoft support, give them KB article number, and they will give you hot-fix. This would probably be least painful solution.
However a large movie (900mb) fails with no message. This MS KB article describes the problem in detail. I face "Symptom #2" (as they call it).
