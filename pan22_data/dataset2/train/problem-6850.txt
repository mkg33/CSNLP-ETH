These servers are part of a HA Cluster and when I attempt to add the disk to the cluster, I get the error stating that "the device is not ready". The validation tool says that the storage does not pass because of SCSI-3 Persistent Reservations but from my research, this should give a different error than what I'm receiving.
I have a LIO iSCSI Target configured on a Fedora 22 machine exporting 1 LUN to 2 Windows Server 2016 machines, both of these are able to access the disk without issues. 
I solved this issue. It appears that the version of LIO included in Fedora 22 does not correctly support the SCSI-3 Persistent Reservations. I switched to using scsi-target-utils and that worked without issue immediately with this config:
So, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here, everything seems to work except the disk will not add to the cluster. One thing I did see in my research is that SCSI-3 Persistant Reservations are required for this to work, but from my understanding LIO does support this. My block device is actually a thin provisioned zvol as I am running ZFS on this machine.
