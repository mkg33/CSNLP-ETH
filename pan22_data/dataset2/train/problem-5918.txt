I could boot from a Windows PE environment and create a fake AppxBundleManifest.xml file, but I feel like a fake xml manifest will likely just make things worse.  Presumably that manifest file typically contains dependency information that is needed by the uninstall process.
Not helpful.  Next I used Get-AppxPackage *Apollo* (Apollo is the code name for this game) via PowerShell to obtain the Appx Package Name for the game, then used Remove-AppxPackage "Microsoft.ApolloBaseGame_1.0.2.2_64__xwekyb3d8bbwe" to uninstall the app.  That doesn't work with the following error:
The only way I was able to resolve this was by reinstalling Windows cleanly.  In my opinion, Microsoft should create a way to force re-install an app.
My first thought was do a simple "uninstall and re-install", however attempting to uninstall the app using the "Apps and Features" page in Settings results in this error:
I bought the pre-order version of Forza Motorsport 7 in September.  During installation of the pre-order, an error occurred which left the installation mostly installed.  Forza Motorsport is delivered via the Windows Store, and is distributed via the Appx App Packager.
Using the command-line, I can verify that C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.ApolloBaseGame_1.0.2.2_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxMetadata\AppxBundleManifest.xml does not exist.  However, I cannot create the file, nor can I copy a file into that location.  Even if I run cmd.exe as system, via PsExec:
Error: 0x80070002 seems to indicate a "file not found" error.  Although the messaging doesn't show which file was not found.  So helpful.
Now that Forza Motorsport 7 has "gone gold", I'd like to install the full version of the game.  Typically this automatically occurs when you run the pre-order "stub" application, however because of the problem during the initial installation, the full game is not downloading.
Is there some way to manually get rid of an Appx package that cannot be uninstalled?  Alternately, is there some way to manually trigger a re-install of an appx?
