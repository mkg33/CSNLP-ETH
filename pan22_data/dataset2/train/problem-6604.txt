When adding a new record you could take the filter off and sort by project unique number to see where you left off.
I am working up a basic project tracking spreadsheet in Excel and would like to have two sheets - one which shows my active projects and one which shows my completed/cancelled/archived projects.  I would like to assign each project a unique number so I know I would want to have data validation on my active sheet so that when I create a new project, and enter a project number, Excel reviews a specified range on the other sheet to see if I've used that number before.  I am sure this is possible but am not sure of the logic I would need to use.  Does anyone have any advice?
You could keep all the records in the same sheet regardless of their status and then just use a filter to show only the status you want to look at.  Doing so, you could quickly bounce between the different statuses.  
A branch off of this, does anyone have a suggestion as to how I could maintain these two lists of active / archived projects and maintain an incremental project numbering system in Excel?
I would consider using Access instead of Excel. The behavior you want is built in to its basic functionality.
