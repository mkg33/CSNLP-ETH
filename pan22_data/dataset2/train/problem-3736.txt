That's okay, if you teleport forward in the scene, as well as on the cards, or play everything at double-speed if people are trying to fast-forward the text...  ...or selectively choose which animations appear in fast-forward or not...
The point is more that you should try to appease both, if possible, and do so without stepping on your art, unless they're asking to skip it.
...but how annoying is it when you just want to auto-skip the 5-minute cutscenes in Max Payne 3, to get back to mowing down half of Brazil?
I would never argue with that requirement. If the best way to do that, at various points of the story is through text, then do it exactly that way.  
Perhaps your cutscenes might appear "out of sync" if you line up animations with key moments in the text...
If somebody is so excited by your gameplay that they'd rather burn through the cutscenes and read a synopsis or read it on a second playthrough, because they just want to go back to being awesome, then you should let them do that, as well.
Players who are actively trying to speed-read, or are actively trying to skip the cutscenes and get back to gameplay aren't going to be upset that you didn't find a way to convey ALL of the animation and voiceovers, et cetera, in the 500ms that they were willing to wait, before playing again.
