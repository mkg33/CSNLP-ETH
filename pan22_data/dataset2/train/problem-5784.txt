To get started with mpirun, have a look at the Open MPI documentation of the latest version: http://www.open-mpi.org/doc/current/man1/mpirun.1.php
It can be quite finicky to configure Open MPI. In your configure script, expressly state which underlying communication support you require (for example sm and tcp). When you're running your job, specify which channels MPI should use. By explicitly specifying these values, MPI will return an error if there is something wrong.
The best solution to use OpenMPI on such a small number of machines is to use the mpirun or mpiexec commands, with or without a host file. This should work and you don't require a third party process manager such as Torque or Slurm.
If your MPI job is not starting, there might be something wrong with the communication. Test this by creating a host file that only contains your local machine, which should assign all your MPI processes to your localhost. Also, before running your own MPI job, start with the example jobs provided with Open MPI.
