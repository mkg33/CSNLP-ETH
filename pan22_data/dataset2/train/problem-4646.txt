I realize this is anecdotal but I'm using firefox on Fedora to access OWA (2k3 Exchange server) and it works flawlessly.  On my XP virtual machine it works fine in firefox as well.  On the other hand, getting a linux mail client to talk to exchange is a nightmare.
Not with Exchange 2003.  The Premium client will be accessible via Firefox in the Exchange 14 release.  More details:
No, but you can have them use IE8 instead, you should also consider going to exchange 2007 for a better OWA experience
I am wondering if outlook web access (exchange 2003) can be configured to work with firefox in premium mode (as everyone in the company is urged to use firefox)
It would be better using IE TAb add-on in Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1419). It basically uses IE engine inside the Firefox. I have been using it for years and found it very useful. It has become one of the must-have add-ins in my Firefox.
Don't have the experience for Exchange 2007, but until 2003, OWA is best used in IE, not other browsers.
