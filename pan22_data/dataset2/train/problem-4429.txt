So what happened here? Nothing uncommon, really. In combination with the other log entries (which should typically include different entries for DPT, potentially different SRC as well), this is usually really just a so-called port scan. Some other computer (or network of computers), looking for open ports, i.e. ports accepting connections. These may indicate potential attack surface for exploits etc.
Port 85 is typically used by "ML MIT Device" (no idea what that is, actually :)), but it's also used by trojans.
Should you be worried? No, clearly not. Your router identified the attempted port scan (which is considered a potential intrusion attempt; therefore the log entries), so probably automatically denied all further incoming connections from those ports, even if they'd be open. Double check to see whether you have any ports forwarded (you shouldn't, unless you provide specific servers/services to the public). It's important to mention, that too many game support websites and departments tell their players to "forward ports", even if they're only used in outgoing direction and the forward only adds attack surface without any gains.
Without knowing the specific vendor/model of your router, I'd say your router detected an intrusion attempt and logged that. Nothing to worry about.
