A basic case would be similar to using HTTP Authentication, disabling authentication in the application and using parameter REMOTE_USER to identify the user. Further data could be retrieved by the application in its data stores.
The authentication is successfully implemented against Active Directory through LDAP as there is support for these applications either out of the box either by a plugin.
I assume you mean using the Service Provider implementation provided by Shibboleth's creators (dubbed shibboleth-sp) talking to a Shibboleth IdP.
Given that there isn't any stable native SSO plugin or module for all the above webapps, i lean towards a Shibboleth deployment as an identity provider and SSO solution. As i am not sure if this is suitable for the given situation i want to ask the following:
An Identity Provider (IdP) handles authentication against a database or LDAP server and passes user information to an application = Service Provider (SP).
I am trying to plan and implement a SSO solution in a corporate environment that serves intranet web applications running on CentOS:
