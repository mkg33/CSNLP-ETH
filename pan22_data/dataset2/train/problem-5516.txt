The Information Store service isn't going to make the server "totally hang", no matter how "corrupt" the database files are. If the machine is actually hanging when trying to mount the Information Store you're not going to get a successful repair running on that hardware.
At this point, I'd be performing a disaster recovery installation of Exhcange, restoring your most recent backup of Exchange onto a new server (virtual machine, etc), and getting away from the failing hardware that likely caused your problems to begin with. Continuing to provide a production service on hardware that has already caused downtime and data corruption is a bad idea.
Even if you did manage to repair the database it's not a good idea to continue running a production Exchange installation from a database that has been repaired. If you manage to repair it you'd be best off moving the mailboxes off the server to another Exchange instance and throwing that repaired database away.
If you have no backups at all then you may have lost your Public Information Store (pub1.edb and pub1.stm). Since yor say your Private Information Store did repair successfully (priv1.edb and priv1.stm) you may yet be able to get user mailbox data back.
If you don't have a backup then, at least, I hope you backed-up the database files before you attempted repairing them. You could try repairing those files on another machine (Exchange doesn't have to be installed for ESEUTIL to work-- a copy of the "Bin" directory from Exchange will do to supply the necessary files to run it).
