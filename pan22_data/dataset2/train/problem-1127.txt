I will delete this after you look at it, but compare your settings to this default found in Tools>Options>Content>Fonts & Colors>Advanced:
If IE doesn't show the same problem, however, you can first try to change the default font in Firefox ( Tools > Options... > Content > Fonts & Colors > Advanced... ) to any other font, restart, change the font back as before, and restart again. If this doesn't work, you'll have to wipe your Firefox profile, and create a fresh one. See here for more information on that.
Otherwise, I might agree with the font corruption answer. If you post a pic of these settings, I may be able to help you re-download the font.
Have you checked if the same happens with IE? If yes, some of your fonts are corrupted. You can fix this by extracting the fonts from Windows Vista installation disc (if you have it) or use your favorite search engine and do a look up for Microsoft Core Fonts and Microsoft ClearType Fonts Collection. I assume you already know how to install fonts.
Font corruption is one possibility. Wrong firefox setting is another. https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Some%20text%20shows%20up%20bold%20after%20upgrade
