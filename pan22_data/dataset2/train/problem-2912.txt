If you want to communicate between vlans you need a Router which is connected to switch with trunk port. 
On a Cisco Layer 3 switch (also known as a multilayer switch), the term is inter-vlan routing. As Tolga pointed out, if you're talking about a router it's called Rotuer on a Stick.
I am looking for a specific networking feature or set of features that was used on another project that I previously worked on. (I don't know my POC for that project otherwise I would ask them.)
Although two different terms are used, they do exactly the same thing but they're done on different devices (switches and routers) and are connected in slightly different ways.
In the previous project we had one switch with a dozen or so computers plugged into it. We had at least 3 VLANs configured on the switch. I managed all the devices on one of the VLANs. I was given a block of static IPs. Some of the IP address were mapped to another device that was on a different VLAN. And that device existed on it's own VLAN with a different IP.
