for convenient i move my bookmarks (folders) to "other bookmarks" to separate bookmarks and conclude that you can use native other bookmarks, 
I just edit the descriptions to make them smaller, allowing more to fit.  Try simple 3 character abbreviations.  Right click on the bookmark in the bar to edit it.
What I've done to save space is basically the same as what the previous person wrote;  i.e. edit the bookmarks so that they're only the icons and not the text (except in a couple cases where the icons were the same [like for multiple instances where the bookmark in question goes to a google sheets document, or a folder].
I put them in alphabetical folders with sub-folders in those and then dragged the bookmarks into the sub-folders. Drag them by the folder icon next to the address bar, but most of you probably already know how to do that. You can make the sub-folder and then drag it on top of the alphabetical folder.
