although as this is CodeReview I have to say, your use of ternary operators nested in linq statements with more terniaries is damn near illegible.
Unless I am mistaken you are dealing with a int32, string key value pair, why not use a simple struct consisting of an int and a string?
A level down from that is, if the current gamestate and name match a certain condition, filter the returned Entities. 
you method is doing a search, a filtering and a conditional grouping, these are different tasks and need to at least be method separate, certainly not be all on one or two lines.
could the OrderByContainer method not even be a method on a ContainerOrderer interface of some kind defining the rules for deciding relevancy? would that not separate your concerns, make testing easier and over all make it clearer what each piece of your code is doing?
You are trying to define relevance in your story entities, I get it, but a hard coded nest of grouping ids is scary to read and very easy to mess up. 
you are basically talking about a rule engine, Given a name and a gamestate, find the right StoryEntities.
