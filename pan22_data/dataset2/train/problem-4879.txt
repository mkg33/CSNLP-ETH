So, thin client for keyboard input, mouse input, and displaying the GUI. Everything else (desktop manager, all software, all processing) on the workstation.
I don't need hand-holding, I'm just not sure what my options are. It's obviously possible, we used to do this back in the early 90s, I just don't know how. The thin client has plenty of hard drive space, plenty of CPU power, and 32GB of RAM, it's just that the workstation is more powerful. And better controlled. But sits in a closet, without a monitor.
How do I accomplish this? VNC doesn't really fit as it requires (or seems to require) I sign in locally, on the workstation, then just echo the desktop remotely. I could use ssh, but that requires that I run a full desktop environment on the thin client machine, but I really want as little as possible there.
I wish to set up a headless workstation machine running Debian Linux. I'd like to actually run XServer on another machine. Think thin-client, though the "thin client" machine is actually fairly beefy. To the maximum extent possible, I want the thin client machine to feel like I'm doing everything locally, while actually storing all files (apart from config, cache and maybe ssh private keys, I suppose) on the remote workstation and doing all the CPU processing on the remote workstation. The two computers are hooked up on a LAN.
