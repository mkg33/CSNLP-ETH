That, by the way, is why you should always not merely reformat but completely overwrite or destroy a computer's hard drive before disposing of it.
Notepad will often corrupt binary files, as it is only intended to edit text files. Just open and save a good PNG file and you will afterward find it unreadable (messing with CR and LF characters, stopping at the first null byte, etc.). You may be interested in a hex editor. I have Frhed on my computer, but there are many alternatives. And you might want to read about the PNG file format so that you know, for example, where the beginning and end of the file are.
On recent versions of Windows it should then open with the standard Windows Photo Viewer, just by double-clicking on it.  Internet Explorer will probably open it too.  There are a variety of viewers available if none of those work for you.    
Um, how about making a copy of the file you are interested in and renaming it so it has a .png extension.
Did you know that automatic "file carving" programs exist? One such program is PhotoRec. You can drag your database file to that program and have it look for all the PNG files for you. The next step would be to run it on an old hard drive to find deleted files, which are only removed from the operating system's list of files and not actually erased until other files take their place. Your luck depends on how fragmented the files are, but it is likely you will find a lot (including cached web pages and old virus infections).
It's not a real PNG file. Specifically, it does not contain an IEND chunk and there's a random string at the end. The only things it legitimately contains are an IHDR and IDAT block.
