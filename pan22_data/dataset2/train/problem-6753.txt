However, the double click problem seems to be caused by a defect micro switch, which you should replace with a new one (solder) in order to repair.
Once the new one received, I dissected the old mouse, and found two screws, one under each of the sliding pads under the mouse's nose.  Back of the bottom part still firmly attached after removing the screws, though.  
If you had the mouse for less than 3 years and still have the proof of purchase, contact Logitech and they will send you a new one (after asking for some minor and completely irrelevant troubleshooting).  Mine arrived a few days ago.  The original had a severe case of left button mushiness and would almost always generate a double-click.  
I guess it's too late for the original post, but I hope this helps other people searching for a solution to the same problem.
I just fixed two of my broken mouses doing this method. No need to bend any metal. If you still have your receipt you can also get a replacement mouse sent before attempting this fix. 
This is the second Logitech mouse I've had the same problem with. The microswitch is not defect, because if I dismantle the top and actually press the microswitch with my fingers it works fine.
Simply super glue two piece of cardstock paper to the two worn in groves and everything works again.
The problem is with the underside of the button where it meets the microswitch. This plastic is softer than the microswitch and with time the microswitch grinds a groove into the button, which is when the problems start, as the switch is then not completely pressed. I glue a very thin, hard foil over this groove and the problem goes away.
