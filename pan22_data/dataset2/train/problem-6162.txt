The net effect is the same, you end up with a tunnel from port 2222 on localhost to port 22 on myserver.com, but they do work a bit differently.  In the first example you are doing ssh localhost and adding some flags, so fundamentally, you're logging into localhost again.  In the second example, however, you are running ssh myserver.com with some flags, so you are creating a connection to the remote host.
So the net effect ends up being the same thing, but the host to which your ssh must authenticate (in order to setup the tunnel) is different.
-L take (here) 3 arguments, the port on the local machine that's one end of the tunnel, the host (after the connection is established) on the other end that's the target of the tunnel, and finally the port on the remote end of the tunnel.
If you tunnel to localhost and create a tunnel to myserver.com you have a connection to, well, myserver.com.  If, on the other hand, you connect to myserver.com and tunnel to localhost from the remote side of the connection you have a connection, once again, to myserver.com.
