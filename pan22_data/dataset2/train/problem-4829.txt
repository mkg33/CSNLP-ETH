clicking on that, on the right side there is 'EnableLUA'. Right click 'Modify' this to value '0' instead of '1' and that does the same thing of disabling UAC. Which apparently, is exactly the same thing as 'built in admin approval', or that the admin approval only works when there is the UAC enabled to 'control' the different user/admin account privileges/access rights.
I've ended up giving up and making an admin enabled shortcut to cmd prompt and placing it above the 'programs' folder on my start menu, as this is pretty close to near my 'run' button (just above shutdown on my modified 'classic Start Menu' modded Windows 10 Home edition). Otherwise with UAC off, I am able to get admin rights on my run command in the start menu BUT CANNOT get rid of the error (doesnt seem to do much, stuff works after clicking 'ok' on it but don't like seeing it) - http://www.bleepingtech.com/windows-8-fix-this-app-cant-open-for-built-in-administrator-account/ This app canâ€™t open for Built-in Administrator account please sign in with a different account and try again .. trying that fix but I don't think there is any way to get admin rights on the run command, without disabling UAC, which in turn gives that error.. 
"Okay, I figured it out. It seems to be caused by new a feature of UAC called "Admin Approval Mode" or "AAM". You can disable this feature and (at least with UAC turned off as well) Win+R will run applications as elevated by default. -- I have tried this on 3 machines now and it has worked for me every time."
This indeed seems to be the only way to make the Windows Start Menu 'Run Command' ALWAYS run with administrator privileges. If you have a machine like me that is a Windows 'Home' product, the registry key can be found at
