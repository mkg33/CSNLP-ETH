It's at this point that I can see my wifi with all the correct info. However, NONE of the devices I have associated with my wifi appear? I have a phone, two kindles, a surface pro 3 and an xbox one all on my wifi. I would imagine at least one of them would appear in the associated devices output. Yet, nothing. 
First I did a test packet injection with aireplay-ng -9 and it said 0/30 packets made it through. If that's the case then why did the deauth work? 
I decided to put one of the tablets in front of me and watch it as I sent deauth packets. It, as you would expect, drops it's connection to the wifi and then re-establishes it. What is interesting about this is two things. 
So further interesting details. I decided to attempt this attack on a separate machine. I booted up my Wifi-Pinapple MK5 and launched an identical attack. Worked first time no questions. 
I am only about 10 feet from my router so I don't think it's a distance issue. Also, as I mentioned earlier, I tried this about a week ago and had success. I'm not sure what's different. Did I miss something? 
So I wrote all the packets to a cap file and then inspected it with WireShark. Sure enough I can see the deauth packets then shortly after I can see each device re-establishing a connection (no handshake captured though)
Since I am using a live version of Kali and this attack did work a couple weeks ago, I am lead to one of two conclusions. Either my usb wifi adapter has gone bad or it has some internal setting that was changed. This is beyond any knowledge I have about it so feel free to add input. 
Here is the process and results. I am not sure why this isn't working when a few day's ago it was. This is my network, I have full control over it and all the machines on it.
