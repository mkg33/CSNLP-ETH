I have been asking the same question and from what I've researched and found out, there is no way to remove the "extra" applications that are not needed.
I believe the Office Deployment Tools doesn't fully support Home User version (note that only ProPlus seems to be available for your choice). I've used it several times while installing my copy and each time it neglected the Exclude parameter and installed a full suite. Other parameters though (e.g. icons not pinned, update channel etc.) worked as intended.
This answer is specifically for users using the Home subscription (or "Home Premium" subscription ... whatever it is called by MS).
There is no out-of-the-box way to selectively un/install Office 2016 apps. From Your top questions about Office 2016 answered:
There is however an Office 2016 Deployment Tool which is supposed to allow full customization of the install options:
If you are trying the configuration tool with Win 10, it probably needs to be a Pro version to fully access any Windows Admin functions. Also, Office will probably need to be Pro Plus to allow modification. If neither of these parameters allow selective installation of truncated Office 16, you probably have excellent grounds for a class action suite against M$aft, if you can find an activist attorney.
That said, my personal advise is to use Office 2010. License keys can still be purchased online. It is cheaper as you don't have to pay the subscription fee yearly, and the "new" version of Office is not necessarily better anyway.
