If these are SQL .bak files you're copying, I would highly suggest doing one of the following to shrink your files down prior to copying:
I don't think you'll have a problem automating this once you figure out what is causing the failure. It may help to list more details about your hardware and any relevant errors you may see in event viewer.
I don't think finding something to transfer faster is your problem, double check to make sure your target file system is NOT FAT, as others have said. Also, make sure the NICs on both sides have updated drivers and aren't otherwise acting flaky.
I don't have experience with such a large file, but could you use robocopy or even xcopy with the /Z option that claims to be restartable.  It seems like this is intended for large file copies where the network is not reliable.
The other thing to check would be to see if the quota service is set up on the target server; I think it uses 2 GB as the default quota per user.
With that said, are you moving many many small files or just a few large ones? I've seen RAID controller problems when trying to move millions of tiny files.
