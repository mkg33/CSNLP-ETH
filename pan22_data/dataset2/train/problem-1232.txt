What you are looking for is the Recurrence button on the Appointment Series tab. When you click on the button it will bring up the recurrence details and you can change them.
The confusion with this is that when you edit the time of a meeting, you do it in the first screen. But when you need to edit the time for a RECURRING meeting, you need to click on the "Reccurence" icon, then choose "Custom" to go to the pane that you originally used to set up the recurrance. 
I have a situation where I have a few reoccurring meetings in my Outlook calendar for which I want to change the start and end time for.  I didn't create the meeting in the first place, and I don't want to change the time for other users that are invited to the meeting.  I only want to move the start/end time on my calendar.  I can do this easily if I open only a single occurrence of the meeting.  However, if I open the series, I cannot.  I have Outlook 2010.
I solved it today: open the event series, click Recurrence and then set the appointment start and end times to 00.00 and then find the "1 day" in the Duration drop-down menu.  
You must also have permission.  In my situation, I was able to view but not edit the recurring appointment.  At the bottom right, it said who had created this recurring appointment.  When I logged out and logged in as that user, I was then able to adjust the appointment.
As I am not (yet?) eligible to comment directly under a post I am trying this method...in response to maxhugen's note of 4 Mar 15 about there being no All Day option when changing the timing of a Recurring event.  This was frustrating me, too
