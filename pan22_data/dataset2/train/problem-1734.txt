Only if you notice sites breaking on you.  It hasn't really been much of an issue and I think more than anything its a warning signal from W3C to browser vendors that "hey: your browser isn't standards compliant!  fall in line, please, or people will not use your browser.."
I have always believed that passing any test is only truly a measure of the ability to pass that test - extrapolating to other abilities is dangerous. This is also true of these Acid tests. What matters in a web browser is the ability to view the websites you want to view without any problems, not the ability to jump through hoops like this. A browser with a good score is likely to render most sites pretty well, but then so do some with low scores.
No. Acid3 is a goal or benchmark for browsers; it tests compatibility with the latest standards. Most sites/apps are designed to be cross-browser, often supporting different versions of each browser, any way. So those new features won't even be utilised for years after all major browsers pass.
FWIW, my copy of FireFox scores 72/100 which is pretty good. My copy of IE6 scores 12/100, yet a very significant portion of the world use this browser every day without real problems.
No, your browser passing the Acid 3 test isn't important for your average web browsing (or web development).  The acid tests are designed to give browsers a benchmark to test their compatibility with cutting-edge web standards.  Switching browsers to one the pass Acid 3 would have add no net benefit to your internet experience.
