I used the Zero Assumption disk space visualizer. It worked pretty well and gave me a map with nested rectangles of different sizes representing the folders on the drive and their contents.
Without a utility, right-clicking a folder and clicking properties will calculate the space it's taking up.
I have tried some other apps but this one is quick and has very little overhead, it's kind of a no-frills product.
I use Folder Size Explorer Extension version 2.4 You can download it from Softpedia. It attaches itself to Windows Explorer. When you open Explorer it scans all your drives and gives you a complete breakdown of all folder sizes, down to individual files. I've used a dozen different programs looking for the right one. This one's perfect. If you don't like it, it's easy enough to uninstall.
JAM Software also have various pay versions with different features but I find the free version to be good enough for me.  Some of the other suggestions may be better for what you are trying to do.
