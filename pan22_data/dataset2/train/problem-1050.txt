You can perform a batch conversion on an entire folder of SVG files to PNG. I used Inkscape command line interface to produce png files with a width of 80px.
ImageMagick's convert command, using some other parameters, is what did it for me. Here's my batch Bash script solution that divides the task across multiple processes to make use of all your cores! Modify as needed.
You can also use phantomjs to render the svg.  The advantage is that it renders it like a browser would since it's basically a headless WebKit.
ImageMagick is an extremely versatile command-line image editor, which would probably rival Photoshop if it had, you know, a GUI. But who needs those anyways. :P
Once you download it you need phantomjs (binary) and the rasterizer.js file from the examples folder.
P.S. To enlarge the .svg image if it's too small, try opening the .svg file in text editor and append 0 to every number except in the meta-attribute. This can be done by a global regex substitution from (\d+) to $10, where $1 is the placeholder for back reference, for example.
