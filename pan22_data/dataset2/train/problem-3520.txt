I'm not sure how Oracle Linux recommends you configure your firewall rules (Ubuntu, for example, encourages the use of ufw). One simple thing is to insert the HTTP rule before the REJECT (iptables -I INPUT $INDEX, where $INDEX is the index of the REJECT rule). Another, which is more in the "spirit" of iptables is to remove the explicit REJECT rule and change the default policy to REJECT. This causes packet rejection to be done implicitly for any packed which hasn't been matched with a rule, so you can simply append ACCEPTs to the end and not worry about placing them before the explicit REJECT.
Yet I cannot access these ports (except for ssh, which was apparently auto-configured) from any devices on my network (all of which start with 192.168.0.*).  If I flush the tables (iptables -F), all connections are functional.  I have saved and reloaded the table.  Any ideas as to why this is not working?  
I recently installed Oracle Linux 6 on a home server, and I've been having trouble with allowing ports past the firewall (iptables).
iptables processes packets according to every rule in order. You're appending the rule to accept HTTP traffic after the rule that rejects all traffic:
If a packet hasn't matched any of the earier rules, it ends up here. If it's a new TCP connection to SSH, it matches the first rule. If it's not (for instance, if it's an HTTP packet), it proceeds to the next rule which rejects any traffic that hasn't been matched up until this point. Because of this, the last rule will never be matched, because any new HTTP traffic will have already been rejected by the previous rule.
