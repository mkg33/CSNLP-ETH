The only way around it is to set up a DNS (if you have an AD then you already have a DNS), or jailbreak your iPhone and edit your hosts file to manually map IPs to names...
The iPhone however does not support NetBIOS name resolution - because it is not a PC and it is lacking in this protocol. You will never see it included either, because it's fairly left-of-field.
I get the DNS provisioned from my wireless on my iphone and DNS seems to work just fine.   Check under Settings > WiFi Networks > [SID] > DHCP  should show DNS and search domains.
Alternatively setup a web proxy on your wireless lan which has a hosts file for the servers you want them to access. Again this needs config'ing on the iPhone by hand or via DHCP.
When you're in a windows environment, it can (and does) use NetBIOS to resolve the computer names, so if you do not have a central DNS server (like on a home network), it can still map names to IP addresses.
Either setup an internal DNS, ie one that you company manages themselves with all the server records, if you have an Active Directory domain then you already have a DNS server. Then have dhcp deliver the DNS servers` IP address or manually config as described in the 1st answer.
I'd like to know how to setup something like hosts for the iPhone where some of the servers I want are not on the DNS.
