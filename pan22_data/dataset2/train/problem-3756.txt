Currenly, I can take pictures and video with my Canon Powershot, and then upload them to my computer's hard drive.  I'd like to bypass my memory card altogether, and store media directly to my iMac.
What you're attempting to do is called tethering.  It is possible with most digital SLR cameras, but I'm not aware of any point-and-shoot cameras (such as the Powershot) which support tethering.
It has the high benefit to work with most of camera with SD cards; some recent models even integrate the possibility to disable/enable the wifi connection of the card. You can check which cameras are supported here
You could get an EyeFi memory card which will automatically save photos to your computer as you take them via your wireless home network. (If you take photos away from home, when you return, it will transfer the photos then, automatically.)
Normal capturing occurs in real-time, with the computer recording what the DV tape plays back.  Simply setting your capture software to record while the camera is running should let you capture directly onto the hard drive.
I've done this in previous versions of Adobe Premiere (v6 if I remember correctly); as always, you may get different results on different hardware/capture combinations.
Is there any way to do that? Would I need special camera software, or special OS X software?  Are there any ways to do something similar, if not exactly this?
