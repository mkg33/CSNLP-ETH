Isn't setting up an Asterisk box essentially providing the VOIP service yourself? Is the VOIP subscription just for the phone number?
VOIP has caught my interest today as it seems to be a great solution for somebody who travels frequently and needs to make cheap/free calls from wherever.
Even some parts of Unified Communications (http://telecom.toshiba.com/Products/Unified-Communications.cfm) are available on the mobile phone with fantastic applications that can be downloaded and used on Android, and iOS. 
A lot of technologies have changed since. Today, you don't need a VoIP PBX at all if you subscribe to a cloud based VoIP phone systems. In reality, if you have a data plan on your mobile phone, you can make and receive calls from anywhere and any time. 
Correct. As long as the client knows the IP address of the PBX it can connect. VoIP providers usually provide PSTN connectivity.
I know I can setup my own PBX server with something like Asterisk, but where I am getting hung up at is the service itself. A lot of the documentation out on the web states that you need both the VOIP PBX AND a subscription to a VOIP provider (For a VOIP phone number).
