Once a request with a virtual URL like /anotherURL, for which no physical entity exists, comes in, mod_rewrite imediatly begins to apply it's rules. Here it maps it to /index.php and pushes the information /anotherURL into GET-Parameters, which are used lateron to identify the Typo3 page.
If anyone know how to apply Location directives before mod_rewrite kicks in, i am very open minded for such a solution :) Until when this seems to work for me.
Now to the solution, which works for me. Since i cannot rely on the URL i have to find another information. For me the Referer suits me just fine:
Had same thing with Jboss backend not unsetting a header and above fixed it. Can't remember why again now (something to do with order of processing when including always keyword).
The main problem, why my Header statements are not executed inside the Location-Directive lies in mod_rewrite.
Now for every request the referer is checked. By default the X-Frame-Otions Header is added, except when the referer is set to the two URLs, from which i want to allow iFrame embedding.
