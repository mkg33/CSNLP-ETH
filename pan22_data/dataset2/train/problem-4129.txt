I'm wondering why would people choose to go for cloud with budget about $50 a month for only about 1-2 cores of CPU power..
If your load doesn't fluctuate a lot or can be handled by a single server, then the cloud is probably not for you.
The time-value of money is what drives people to the Cloud.  It may cost more in the long run, but can you get more for the dollar you have now, versus the dollar you MIGHT have then? 
Because they have a services that will not be always on?  Cloud providers allow you to dynamically add servers during heavy load.
I am currently 16 Cores Shared CPU VPS with 512MB of memory. I'm thinking to upgrade to cloud, but it seems not worth it for me as it costs more, and lower spec (2 Cores and about the amount of RAM)
But the problem is that of capitalization.  A lot of that is underutilized, even using tools like Surgient or VMware/LabManager. So you move to the cloud on-demand.  Have a huge process that needs to run for 3 days at the end of every month?  Deploy it to the cloud.  $10.  Versus $10,000 for having a server sitting around doing nothing for 25-28 days a month losing money. 
In datacenter-grade equipment, you're looking at at least $1000/core currently, with large memories.  Which is a pretty damn good price, IMHO.
