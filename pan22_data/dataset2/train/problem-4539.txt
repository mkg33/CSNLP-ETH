It's good practice to run edge networks connected to OSPF routers with passive interfaces, especially where the OSPF network type is "broadcast" by nature. For example, this is the case in the proverbial "25 client VLANs" of a large campus, each with a few dozen of hosts each at least:
OSPF's use of multicast is to a link-local scope group, with IP TTL set to 1 to ensure it says link-local. [ 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6 (RFC2328 pp.185-186)]
However - and I believe that's the part you didn't consider - a host can still discard these multicast earlier than if they were broadcast. If the host isn't interested in (any/this) multicast group(s), it can drop the ethernet frame (at L2) or the IPv4/IPv6 packet (at L3), without even looking at any inner payload. A broadcast packet however would have to be passed 'further up the stack' to see if it is of interest to any of the running applications/services/deamons. 
OSPF aside, for the multicast pruning functions of switches to work, yes, something has to cause group membership reports. All IGMP joins (unsolicited membership report) will eventually expire (RFC 2236 IGMP v2, p.18). If the switch doesn't see periodic reports (ala IGMP snooping of membership reports), that multicast group may be subject to pruning, or flood to all ports. (depending on how your switch is configured)
In terms of what happens to OSPF hello/discovery multicast packets, you're right. The switches send them to everyone on the subnet/VLAN/broadcast domain, as IGMP isn't happening for 224.0.0.0/24, just as Ron explained.
