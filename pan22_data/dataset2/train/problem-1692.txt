Fiber is better than copper where the bandwidth is over 100G and distance over 1 Kilometer and number of users per network exceeds 1,000.
I would like to add one benefit with fiber connections. Consider a connection between two buildings with different ground potential. If you where to use copper in this situation you could end up with current leakage and possibly a dangerous situation. This is not the case with fiber because it isn't a conductor.
Both Fiber and Copper have massively lower cost expansion capability than wireless, but for many of the domains between copper and fiber, wireless is a rapidly deploy able, unreliable, ever degrading connection medium.
Copper is better than fiber over short distances (under 10 meters) where bandwidth requirements are currently under 40 Gbit per second.
At higher rates and distances the packet loss rate rises to over 50% quite rapidly. To correct this requires repeaters which rapidly raise the latency, and cost of connections.
I believe another reason fiber propagates "slower" than copper is because the light is, by definition, refracting across the fiber along the distance of the cable. The physics stack exchange has a different take on this:
Any mechanism that can be used to expand wireless bandwidth, can almost always be used to immediately expand copper and fiber bandwidth.
No, the numbers are right (Page 46).  If I can reword your question, it's "Why should I use fiber if the propagation delay is worse than copper?"  You are assuming that propagation delay is an important characteristic.  In fact (as you'll see a few pages later), it rarely is.
