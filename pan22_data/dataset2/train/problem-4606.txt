I've got an XP SP3 machine with an odd problem when coming out of standby sometimes. After starting back up the machine will rhythmically stutter at a fixed interval with one of my four cores pegged at 100% during this time. Also, if my speakers are on, I will hear a high frequency hum during the stuttering.
Machine was last known not to do this about 2 months ago before I moved. Since then there have been a few driver updates and patches installed. I recently installed a Wacom Bamboo Tablet, however, uninstalling this device and driver did not change anything. I've also uninstalled and updated my sound card drivers, which also did not change anything.
Even just reading the title I suspected a bad hardware driver, before I got to reading about your checks. :)  It's entirely possible that an unrelated update is interfering with a previously installed driver, or even that you have a device that's actually got something wrong with it.
The tedious, but probably foolproof thing to do is to manually uninstall each and every device in the machine one at a time until the behavior stops, and there's (at least a big hint towards) your culprit.
A look at Task Manager shows no tasks taking any CPU time, but it does report 25% Kernel Time during the stuttering. A look at Process Explorer shows no tasks taking CPU, except Hardware Interrupts are the culprit during the stuttering.
I've exhausted my sysinternals-fu and cannot figure out how to determine which of my hardware devices is the problem child. Where should I go next?
