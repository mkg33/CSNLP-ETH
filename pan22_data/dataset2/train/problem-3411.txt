Do this is if you HAVE an OEM partition: Boot into the BIOS and there may be an option (most Acer notebooks have D2D recovery etc.) and try to do a recovery from the partition. In some cases I have seen where you do in fact need a Windows install DVD in order to complete the recovery.
Try downloading Speccy, and writing down your Windows serial number, so that whatever happens, at least you have your license key and you won't have to buy another copy of Windows if you can't find a recovery disc.
Do this is you have no OEM partition: Find yourself a local computer shop and ask them if they can burn you an OEM Windows 7 disc. Show them that you have a product key for it and that you just need the disc. Offer money if needed to cover the cost of the burning of the disc and the cost of the DVD. The only valuable thing about owning a copy of Windows is that 25-digit product key, not the disc as it is the license to use Windows. Once you have the disc in your possession , pop it into the notebook, boot off of it and delete all partitions on the HDD, then create a new partition and install Windows on that. Of course, BACKUP IMPORTANT DATA FIRST.
After doing that, try pressing F10, F12, F2, or some key of that sort when your computer is starting up, and seeing if it goes into some sort of restore mode -- my VAIO does that when I press F10.
If the computer has a sticker with a Windows key on it (formatted like xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx), you could possibly use someone else's Windows 7 disc to re-install Windows and use your own key for activation.
You will need the 25-digit product key on the bottom of the notebook in order to reinstall Windows. Jellybean Magical Keyfinder is a way better tool for finding the product key of the OS without navigating through the registry, as well as allows you to save it to a text file.
