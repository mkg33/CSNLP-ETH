When you tried to talk to the server the most likely decision your laptop will make is that 192.168.1.1 is on the local network so just send the request out the local Ethernet (or wireless) so the traffic will hit your router which assumes the request is for it has it has the same IP address.
Alternatively if you somehow managed to convince your laptop that 192.168.1.1 was through the VPN then your laptop would try and connect over the VPN which means that it would try and send the VPN packet to your public IP address, which as far as it is concerned is via the gateway on 192.168.1.1 which is over the VPN so the VPN will never get there.
The only other alternative you could risk if the specific IP addresses of the office machines you are trying to reach are not going to conflict with your local net would be to have more specific routes applied over the VPN - e.g. 192.168.1.241 netmask 255.255.255.255.  This would work until your local router handed that IP out to your machine or you needed to talk to a machine on your local network with that address.
If your office network was 192.168.1.x and your server was 192.168.1.1.  If your laptop was connected to a network where the network was 192.168.1.x and the router was 192.168.1.1.
The ideal solution would be if you can change your office network to one that is less likely to conflict default network addresses of ADSL routers and public WIFI.
