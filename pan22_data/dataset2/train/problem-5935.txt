It is possible to extend this to work with folders in subfolders too, but out of fear for this to become unnecessary complicated, I've decided against posting it. It would require the /s and @relpath options (and further testing xD)
rsync is a program used to synchronize directory. From the many (really many) options you have there are the self explaining --ignore-non-existing,  --remove-source-files and --recursive.
Any NC-style program, like Total Commander, has a directory difference command that selects files in both tabs that are different from the other tab. Call this command, tab to the larger directory (B), invert selection using * and delete. This has the advantage of not deleting files which may have changed (somehow) and are not the same albeit they agree in name. You can use the same directory diff command to locate these after the deletion.
After this is done, Folder B will have all files removed that are present in Folder A. Keep in mind, that if folder B has files with the same name, but not the same content, they will still be deleted.
I guess I'm stuck in the nineties... but I haven't really seen anything more elegant since :-) So far this is the only answer that requires as little as some 5 keystrokes and no scripting / command line whatsoever.
Sure you could be more more safe by checking if the file is there, or checking if the filename is safe. But assuming you just want to get this done, and don't have any ridiculously named files in folderB - this is a quick and dirty way to get it done.
