It is possible that this traffic is back-scatter. If incoming email is being addressed to "aabbccddeeeff@[yourdomain]", you'll get outbound mail destined to the listed MAIL FROM: address, as a delivery-status-notice gets sent informing them that no such user exists on your system. This is a form of directory-harvest attack that relies on an actual receiving mailbox to determine which addresses did NOT result in a DSN being sent and are therefore valid email addresses.
I have noticed huge amounts of email going to random .com.tw domains. My Exchange event log its erroring with them every few seconds. I am wondering is it possible to see which computer this is coming from maybe its a virus? Has anyone had similar experience with this? Im running Small Bussiness Server 2003.
You should be able to turn up the SMTP logging using the Exchange console.  It is on the Diagnostics tab, SMTP transport.  Then you will have a log written to your Logs folder under your Windows directory for the SMTP service which should capture the SMTP conversation between the client and your exchange server leading you to the offending machine.
