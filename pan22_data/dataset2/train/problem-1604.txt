How true is this? I figured that since PPTP uses TCP there should be no data corruption. Am I wrong about this?
If an unreliable connection can cause database corruption, then the problem isn't the connection but that the software is poorly designed.
What is the best way to connect to the server remotely without risking data corruption if the VPN fails? I was thinking that the computer from home can connect to the SonicWall router through VPN and then connect to the server through remote desktop in which case no data will actually be stored on the client computer at home. Please advise. Thanks.
According to the Sage technical support staff, this is not recommended because VPN connections are unreliable and can lead to data corruption on the database if there is a problem with the VPN connection.
We have a small office with one server and one client that connects to the serverâ€™s database for the Sage 300 accounting software. The server is also being used as a workstation for the Sage 300 software. I want the person who uses the server was a workstation to be able to connect to the server from home so I figured the best way to do this would be to install the Sage 300 client software on the home computer, connect the computer to the office via VPN and then open the database that is on the server in the Sage 300 client software.
