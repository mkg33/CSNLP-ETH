I'd consider OpenFire, its free enterprise grade, jabber server.  You can log all convo's which is nice for the "what did we talk about in IM last month?"  And also do secure connections.  As you grow and might have people not working in the same office all the time this is a great tool to have.
For code-review we use ReviewBoard which is much more mature than others. I think it's a good idea to install something like Laconi.ca internally so that people can post quick updates about their work.
The one "red flag" I see is no discussion of server drive redundancy (your running RAID 1 or 5 right?) or backups (with atleast a months worth of recoverability).
I would recommend Unfuddle. It is a web-based project management system. It has projects, milestones for projects, issue tracking, messaging, and integrated source control (svn and git). Some of the more expensive plans include Time Tracking, too.
I also recommend a project management tool like Basecamp, a bug tracker like Lighthouse or if you can afford, the venerable FogBugz which is excellent.
Definitely need a bug tracker and a project management setup.  Assuming things start going well, I would recommend a spreadsheet to start to track all hardware assets and software licenses.  Document management is important too and integrating that into a wordpress blog which maintains revision history is excellent.
