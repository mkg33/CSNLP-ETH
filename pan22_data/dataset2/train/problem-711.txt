Does the provider supply the equipment on a rental basis or will you need to purchase the needed equipment outright?
I.e. a spec of some kind - if you don't know what the organisation and users need, then you won't be able to provide it.
There are a number of variables to take into account when looking at transitioning to a VoIP system. The first thing you have to decide is what type of system you are going to want to implement. When it comes down to it there are basically four types of office telecom systems (all terms mine).
Once you have reviewed all of these things, the decision  you are really going to come to is where does price and performance meet that is acceptable to the business?
I'd say the first thing you need to address is what services is the phone system expected to provide?
I apologize if some of this is a little vague, but as you said this is homework so I'm trying to point in the right direction without giving you the answers :) If you need clarification on any of my points please let me know.
Personally I still believe that the Hybrid approach offers the best of both worlds, the portability and ease of management of VoIP inside the office, with the reliability and price of traditional POTS out of the office.
I'd suggest two routes for further investigation; the open source Asterix (Clicky) platform and Cisco's Small Business Voice System (Clicky) - they're not bad starting positions ok. In terms of basic models both of these work in a fairly similar way to a traditional PBX (central switch/es with star topology, management system, gateway to outside world, voice mail system).
