Slicehost was purchased by Rackspace and their technology rebranded as Rackspace Cloud Servers - same technology, same people, but they did some very nice things with pricing:
Shared I would go with Dreamhost. On a VPS I've used Slicehost (great documentation), and VPS.net - both work well. I've also heard good things about Linode too but haven't used them. For colo or dedicated it's pretty tough to beat FDC Servers for price and the sheer amount of bandwidth you get.
Linode is an "infrastructure sponsor" for the Rails Rumble and provides VPSes (what's the plural for VPS?) to the teams.
I've been using Rackspace Cloud (used to be called Mosso) and went with the lowest plan. As for me this is cheaper than the majority of VPS. It's also much more flexible as I can setup my server the way I want it. It's kinda like VPS, only they charge you by hour. If I don't use my server, I can get a cheaper rate per month. I can also add another server on the fly with the bandwidth grows, something that you can not do with regular VPS. So with the flexibility and feature, I reckon that is really cheap.
As someone else mentioned, Slicehost (Rackspace), Linode and most of the other hosts listed here all provide basically a blank server that you have to setup (install your database, webserver, rails, etc. on). If you are just getting started, you should really check out Heroku which abstracts away a tremendous amount of the work necessary to just get going. 
You might hear some horror stories about Dreamhost but if you want to keep it cheap and moving later is an option go with them to start. I launched a Rails site with them and got hit pretty hard right away (thanks TechCrunch!) and they kept me up and running through the traffic surge. 
My favorite is RailsMachine. Pretty cheap and they are really good at ruby/rails (they have some cool things out there: http://www.railsmachine.com/projects )
