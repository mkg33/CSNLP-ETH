If restarting y`our router fixes the problem, you can always get an outlet timer and plug the router into it.  Then schedule it to power off and on.  This will resolve the symptom, but not fix the underlying problem.  However, it till work...
NIC Configurator 2018 can schedule NIC resets on multiple computers and its pretty easy to do.  However, this is not a free product.  Check the Youtube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg_lpF63KMc or google NIC Configurator.
My question is... is there a way that I can just SCHEDULE to restart the connection of my wifi internet in my PC (thus restarting my network connection)? Or will this just get fixed once the computer has restarted?
I schedule my PC to turn on an hour before I arrive work so that it can run tasks while I'm on my way. However, one time, there was a task which needs internet connection but unknowingly, the wifi connection on my computer has an error and i arrived with a pending task. I usually turn on/off the modem/router (physically since its web interface doesn't have this functionality). Only then will it restart and the wifi connection is then fixed.
