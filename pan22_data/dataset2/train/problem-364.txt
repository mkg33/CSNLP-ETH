The IIS application pool runs under the "IIS AppPool\DefaultAppPool" account, so you want to give it Modify permissions.
There is no such thing as 777 permissions on Windows. You set access to a resource by adding Access Control Entries (ACEs) to Access Control Lists (ACLs).
Assuming you are using the defaults for IIS8, you can grant write permission to the directory like this:
better way is to add a user IIS_USR to it instead.. way more secure.. but meh.. if you want 777 then you obviously not too stuck up on security. i use everyone for my dev machine
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\ should be you site root, so 'uploader' should be accessible via 'www.mysite.com/uploader'. If not check the settings of your site.
I am trying to figure out how to grant 777 permissions on a website i added in IIS. i need 777 permissions for that folder because its a php uploader and needs those permissions to write the uploaded file. i tried giving IIS Users full access but it just wont work..and when checking that folder in a ftp program it says 755. cant change it from there either..
You can give it Full Control... but you should not do this because that also gives permissions you (likely) won't ever need, even on a Dev box.
the "not so secure" way of doing things would be to right click on the folder (uploads) then go properties -> security -> add "everyone" and give it read / write
