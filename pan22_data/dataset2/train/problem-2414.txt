Are you using Windows RDP? I've had some very weird problems in the past with Windows RDP - but on my linux box I find Remmina is much better. Maybe you should download it (it's open source > > for Windows and Linux) and give it a try to isolate the problem better. It could be a latency problem as well, what connection are you currently working with?
I use RDP to login to my work computer from my home tablet and have intermittently experienced the problem you describe, including requiring a reboot of the work computer before being able to login remotely again. In my environment, the intermittent nature of this problem was directly related to whether or not bluetooth was active on my tablet when initiating RDP.  If bluetooth is active, RDP will hang 100% of the time. Since I use a bluetooth keyboard with my tablet, I must complete RDP login prior to activating bluetooth on tablet to avoid a hang.

I've had this kind of problems in the past when I used client computers with buggy out of date nvidia graphic drivers.
This may be unrelated to your problem, but you might want to check that your drivers are up to date.
Try this - RDP into the machine. Click Start => Computer => System Properties => Remote Settings => Advanced => Settings => Turn off any/all custom options => Apply => Ok. This appears to have fixed it for me.
