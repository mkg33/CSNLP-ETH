I am bringing my old laptop for recycling, and removed my hard drive beforehand.  The drive is a 320GB SATA drive, which is the same as my current laptop's drive. I would like to be able to easily swap between the two drives, in order to dual-boot that way.
My laptop (Toshiba Satellite A500) needs a tiny Philip's screwdriver to get at the hard drive bay.  I would like to replace that with something that is more easily changed, while still allowing the hard drive to rest on the desk.  It can stick out a bit due to the laptop's feet, but not too far.
Why don't you just buy an empty external usb HDD case and put it in that then make your bios see it as bootable first and have it plugged in when you need it and unplugged when you don't? Sure saves opening the laptop case each time and they are pretty cheap to buy.
I looked at the disassembly instructions for your model. You can buy an additional cage for your drive. Yes you still need to have a mini screw driver, but now you only have one screw to remove the entire cage.
There's hard drive caddies that fit into your optical drive bay - a google search yielded a few, though the specific one would depend on your laptop - if your CD drive is sata based, or you get the appropriate caddy, just pop your drive in there for a hot swappable option.
