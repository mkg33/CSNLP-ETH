Something like that. And once you set up a working environment (like every driver, usual apps like firefox, foobar, what do you use), do a full backup of your disk. Much better than always reinstalling from scratch.  
The performance of a properly Windows setup configuration should degrade only slightly with time. I've used computers for periods of years without noticeable degradation of the performance.
First of all, no app can replace human sanity. Check what you install. You can also use Virtual PC, Virtualbox. Other side, use PORTABLE applications. They will run without messing around with the registry, program files, whatsoever. They can be also upgraded easily.  
Generally, I'd just reinstall Windows. It takes about 10 minutes to install and if you plan a bit beforehand you have a working system in half a day again. (Well, unless you want to install Visual Studio or Adobe CS.)
To the topic: You won't get a system as fast as the original one if you installed too much... uhm.. dead-weight on it. But maybe you can tear down some fat from your sys. Give it a try. Judge which one takes more time. :)
If you mean to uninstall every application, defrag & install them again, then just do defrag, there is no reason here for reinstallation.
However, I wonder what you do with your system as mine usually survives at least one or two years without degrading too much in performance.
The message I'm trying to pass over that you're using Voodoo magic to solve problems that you yourself are creating. Most likely, your machine simply gets infected to the point that it becomes a slave. The hacker that controls it is using up the resources, and Windows is not to blame.
