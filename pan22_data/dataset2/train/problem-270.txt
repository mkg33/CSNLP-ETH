I got a notebook that is thing less than an inch, but it overheats sometimes. Is anyone of you also having a thin laptop and is it overheating? My cpu cores are usualt 45-55C and in playing games up to 65-70. Is that okay? ( The laptop gets really warm while playing games )
Additionally, the reason you are seeing this temperature is because laptops usually only have 1 or 2 fans to cool them down. Since the laptops, or ultrabooks are so thin, they more heavily rely on heat-sinks in order to cool them down. These small heat-sinks allow the manufacturer to shrink the size of the laptop and allow for a lighter design.
You really have nothing to worry about with that temperature. However, if you want to help the laptop cool, you can look into a laptop cooling pad. 
Depending on the specs of your laptop, you don't really have to worry about them overheating at the temperatures you are seeing (65-70) under load. The fairly new generations of laptops's hardware can handle this heal without problem.
