I have a camper on vacant property that I use frequently.  I also have a neighbor that has a home roughly 150ish yards away, and yet somehow I am still getting a faint WIFI signal from his hot spot( which he says I can use).  
What it basically does is turn a omnidirectional WiFi antenna from a cheap usb wifi adapter in to a directed one. Boosting the strength in the direction it is pointed.
I have looked online at extenders, repeaters, etc. And I am at a loss as to which is the best way to go.  USB WIFI Adapter? Antenna? Do I need to spend more to get better quality? Any help is appreciated, even if its just to point me in the right direction.  
The most popular solution is to use a "cantenna" they are cheap and can easily be made using household materials.
My laptop is finding the hotspot, but it is to weak to use.  And the cell phone, will actually connect from time to time.  So my question is, is there a product I can by that will strengthen his signal in my camper, so I can access the internet?
Just search cantenna on Google and you will find both instructions on how to make your own or places to buy pre-made ones.
