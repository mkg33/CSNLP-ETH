Not really for the safety of the server, but for the safety of your end-users getting their stuff off of the server.
If all the clients are Windows, I'd certainly recommend installing some kind of antivirus software on the clients, since they're the most vulnerable.
ESET Antivirus (NOD32) have a linux version available.  I've never used it, but the windows version of their software is excellent, and about the best I've seen as far as resource usage goes.
ClamAV is generally regarded as a reasonable anti-virus.  Although that said it doesn't have herustics (last I checked anyhow).  It does however have on-access scanning.
I also think Anti-virus is not really required on a Linux server, although it is best practice to have it, so you can say you do everything possible to keep things clean. There are exceptions where I would recommend an anti-virus on a linux server though.
ESET Antivirus (NOD32) have a linux version available.  I've never used it, but the windows version of their software is excellent.
Anti-virus on Linux systems really isn't required, the threats just aren't out there for it.  However, if you can't get around the corporate mandate, follow Node's advice and just install ClamAV and a small cron job to do a periodic sweep of the system.
Examples would be a mail server (you should scan attachments on your end, and incoming mail) or a file server with outside access (prevent your server hosts contaminated files).
