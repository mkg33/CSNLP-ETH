SSH is a fully encrypted protocol for point-to-point communication.  They will see the source and the destination, but not the contents of the packets.
SCP is as secure as any other SSH based traffic, unless they're particularly talented and/or determined then your ISP or anyone else won't be able to tell what data you're sending at all, to them it'll look like just a hell of a lot of SSH traffic.
Now, you say "intercept", which I take to only mean "read" or possibly "hijack/inject." They could inject packets,  but they won't decrypt into anything useful (to you or them.) They could block them, and you'd know about it right away.
Basically, an attacker will find it more useful to compromise the end points (perhaps by beating you with a $5 wrench) than to try to snoop the traffic itself.
If you're using SSH, the data is encrypted. As long as your keys are secure, your data is secure. Anyone running a sniffer or netflow, etc, will only see that there's an SSH connection between the two IP addresses. The contents will be secure.
So I'm not saying it's impossible for them to know what you're up to (what are you up to? :) ) but it's improbable that they will.
I am working on distributed architecture where we have automated data distributions using bit-torrent. But sometimes we need instant access to some data stored on remote server. So I wanted to know how secure SSH (SCP) file transfers are (generally tar.gz of Images OR 2-3GB access logs). Can my ISP or anyone else sense what I am transferring and intercept them?
The SSH/SCP traffic will be practically impervious to snooping (presuming you validate server fingerprints the first time you're connecting to prevent man-in-the-middle shenanigans).
