of $G$. Thus, for fixed $r$, the $r$th powers of bounded tree-width graphs have bounded clique-width. 
Dawar and Kreutzer have shown that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable on nowhere dense classes of graphs, which includes the planar graphs, the graphs of bounded (local) tree-width and all classes with (locally) excluded minors. 
Furthermore, they show that this is the best one can do, in the following sense: an algorithm with running time $O((2r+1-\epsilon)^wn^{O(1)})$ for $\epsilon > 0$ would contradict the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Ars Combin. 24 B (1987) 23-30), and (2) Domination is solvable in linear time for strongly chordal graphs 
The following facts are well known: (1) All powers of a strongly chordal graph are strongly chordal 
There is a recent paper by Glencora Borradaile, Hung Le: Optimal Dynamic Program for r-Domination Problems over Tree Decompositions (IPEC 2016). Here they show that there is an algorithm that given as input a graph $G$, an integer $r$, and a tree-decomposition of $G$ of width $w$, computes an optimal $r$-dominating set of $G$ in time $O((2r+1)^wn)$.
One can keep for each vertex in a bag the shortest distance to some vertex in the partial solution and the distance to future solution needed to dominate the undominated vertices.
that the clique-width of $G^r$ is at most $2\cdot (r+1)^{\text{tw}(G)+1}âˆ’2$, where $\text{tw}(G)$ is the tree-width 
An (optimal) $r$-domination for $G$ is an (optimal) domination for the $r$th power $G^r$ and vice versa 
Dvorak has shown that there is a polynomial time constant factor approximation for classes of bounded expansion, which includes the planar graphs, graphs of bounded tree-width and all classes with excluded minors. 
This in total gives a table size of $O(r^k)$ so for fixed $r$ this problem is FPT parameterized by treewidth, however if $r$ is not fixed this becomes an XP algorithm.
