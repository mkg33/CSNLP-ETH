I am receiving a strange error when I try to mount the 2nd volume on the image to the file system. Despite my research, I have not yet discovered  why I am getting this error or how to work around it.
I am doing all of this inside of a virtualbox (5.2.6) virtual machine running ubuntu (17.10.1) where the host os is mac os (10.13.3 Beta). The image file itself resides on an external hard drive which is accessed by the vm via a shared folder with the host os.
However, there is a step in the procedure where we improve the compression of the image by filling empty space with zeroes. This requires mounting the image on the filesystem like so.
I have done surgery on this image by (1) using gparted to shrink the file system, (2) fdisk to change the partition table and (3) truncate to to remove the unused portion of the file, as specified by the procedure. The image itself appears to be okay insofar as I burned it to a microSD card and the raspberry pi booted successfully.
One suggestion was to extract the file system from the 2nd partition to a new image and then mount that directly. This would allow mounting without specifying an offset. This seems a little extreme. 
The procedure works fine and I am able to get the shrunken image to boot correctly in a raspberry pi.
