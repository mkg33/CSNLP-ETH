Actually, your problem is that the WAN port has an internet IP address and the modern has a private IP address. But these two interface are in the same network segment.
That would work for you, unless you need to use some special features of the router like firewall rules, NAT, etc.
On the WAN port of the Asus router it is connected the VDSL modem. The IP of the VDSL modem is 10.20.31.1
my home network is connected to an Asus RT-AC88U router. The IP addresses are in the range of 10.20.30.X, with 10.20.30.1 assigned to the router.
Do I have to tinker with the routing features of the Asus router? Can you please help me configure it?
How can I connect to the modem from my PC? I try to enter 10.20.31.1 on the address bar but it doesn't work.
BTW, make sure your modem itself isn't a router too, because if it is you won't need an independent router unless you plan to have multiple subnets. Use a regular switch instead.
When you request 10.20.31.1 from your client, the router will try to find a route for it. But it finds that the 10.30.31.1 doesn't belongs to the internal subnet or the external subnet.(Your WAN port gets an internet IP address) So the router will forward your request to the ISP's gateway. Of course, the gateway will just drop the packets because it's oriented to a private IP address.
Connect it to a normal LAN port and give it an IP address from your LAN range 10.20.30.0/255.255.255.0, e.g. 10.20.30.2. 
I can only help you so far as giving these places to look, the actual procedures are dependent on your router itself.
