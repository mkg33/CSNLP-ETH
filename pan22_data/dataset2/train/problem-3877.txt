So in client specific override in field "Common Name" try to write username instead of the Common Name.
I have tried to assign static IPs with the client specific overrides in pfSense. I used the commonly advised ifconfig-push command, but the clients I tested with(Windows 8 and Arch Linux) just don't take the IP assigned in their respective override. I've tried ifconfig-push with different arguments(client-IP + server, client-IP + subnet mask, ..).
The LAN network is 10.0.0.0/24, the pfSense machine is 10.0.0.10 and clients DHCP range is currently 10.0.0.200-10.0.0.220.
After some deep digging I found a bug in pfSense's Redmine tracker. This states that the OpenVPN server is missing the client-config-dir variable. 
if you have problems with assigning static IPs, try to inspect your openvpn server config in "/var/etc/openvpn/server1.conf" for that option.
If I leave the DHCP for the tap-interface on, clients will take an IP address from the client DHCP range, if I switch DHCP off clients don't get an IP at all. I have tried to push the static IP inside and outside of the DHCP range.
Is there any way to make the override work and force the assigned IP to the client? I would need this especially for access limitations with pfSense's firewall.
