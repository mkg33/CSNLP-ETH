Check the logs on the server. It's usually in /var/log/auth.log (Debian/Ubuntu) or /var/log/secure (RedHat/CentOS). Any problems with connecting usually are logged there.
I have had problems where on OS X the hostname lookup acts like it fails; the connection just times out from waiting so long, or when the prompt does come up it's been waiting so long it gives about ten seconds for you to enter a password before dropping the connection. I never could trace it despite people suggesting adding the host in question to the host file. I guess it was just a "glitch with OS X's DNS lookups" and it was expected to be tolerated...if someone else had this problem and solved it I'd love to know about it.
Another thing you might check is looking at the contents of /etc/hosts on the server to make sure that nothing is wrong there. 
Disable DNS lookups on the server by editing /etc/ssh/sshd_config and making sure "UseDNS" is set to "no". 
If it's because of a saved key, you should be able to delete it from your ~/.ssh directory in the known_hosts file. Just find the entry and delete it then it should prompt you again.
Run "service ssh reload" (or whatever causes your ssh daemon to reread the config), then try again. 
Check the permissions on the ~/.ssh directory and files therein.  Your default umask might be too permissive & when you recreated the files you might have inadvertently given them the wrong permissions. I have been burned by this a few times myself.  None of the ssh clients (or servers) I used ever gave a useful error message about this either...
