According to the bugtracker, this was due to enabling hardware accelerated virtualization - but it was also supposed to be fixed in 3.2.0. Since Win2k isn't an actively tested guest OS, maybe there's been a regression; try disabling vt-d/vt-x.
If it does boot this time around, after removing the virtual hardware, update all drivers if possible.
Windows does not respond well to certain types of hardware change. It is virtually guaranteed to generate blue screens if the storage controller for the system drive (C:) changes. It'll keep using the same old (wrong) driver indefinitely. You cannot fix this without opening up the Windows partition and doing some serious brain surgery. Windows 2000 in particular is notoriously terrible at dealing with this.
From the looks of it, you pulled down a VMware image and imported it into VirtualBox. Unfortunately, VirtualBox doesn't manipulate the disk image to allow it to work with the VirtualBox-provided virtualized storage controller.
At a guess, i reckon it could be the additional devices configured on the image. Try and remove all USBs, cd/dvd drives, floppy drives before booting.
