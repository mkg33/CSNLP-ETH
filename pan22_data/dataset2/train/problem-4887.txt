The produced output.pdf file has about the same size as the input one, looks good enough and (what's most important) can be printed by my printer... with the drawback that for whatever reason my printer processes each page for ~5 minutes before printing. I left printing for a night anyway, so I didn't care looking for better option.
Another option can be converting with pdf2ps and the reprocessing the ps in the server to reduce the image dpi before sending to the printer.
Then I concatenated PDF files into a single file using pdftk (other tools would probably also work, but it was what I had already installed):
The HP Laserjet 2200dn should also support the PCL 5 drivers, the processing PS->PCL5 will be done on the desktop/server and the resultant PCL5 file will be smaller for the printer to process.
Firstly, I dumped all the pages into 600DPI png files using ghostscript. Note that in my case document was B&W, so the device chosen in this invocation is reflecting this:
Then converted each single image into a single PDF file using imagemagick. It was actually pretty quick operation, so it wasn't worth to try to parallelize it (with GNU Parallel or similar software).
