In any server OS (Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2008R2, 2012, 2012R2) where the TS or RDS role has not been installed, two remote desktop connections for administration are allowed.
I'm not simply trying it, because I want an answer that is global on all versions of Windows. - Any new connections will be refused.
This question isn't about how many connections are allowed in the various versions and editions of Windows and it isn't specific to any version of Windows. If you exceed the number of allowed connections then any new connections will be refused.
I've trying to find what happens when we try to connect to Windows via RDP and all the connections allowed are being used. - Any new connections will be refused.
In any server OS (Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2008R2, 2012, 2012R2) where the TS or RDS role is installed , the number of remote desktop connections allowed is defined by the settings of the RDP protocol on the server or may be governed by Group Policy. In all cases where you you set a limit on the allowed number of connections then all new connections will be refused when that limit is reached.
