One idea is to create a tunnel (you will probably want to encrypt it with IPsec) between the external interfaces of your border routers.  You can run your IGP in the tunnel and adjust your metrics so that tunnel is less preferred than any of your internal links.  Should your internal link fail, the tunnel will be used to connect your locations.
You should consider what kind of bandwidth will be required if the tunnel is used, and apply QoS as needed so that you don't oversubscribe the tunnel capacity.  Also consider if the tunnel MTU might cause problems and adjust accordingly.
If I understand your question (or the question behind the question), you want to know if you can use your two ISPs to create a backup link between your two locations in case your primary link fails.
Assuming a link between routers in my AS fails and now I have two groups of routers not connected with each other. Each group is connected to a different AS through one of the routers. Will BGP find a possible route between them? Or it will refuse to re-route because it creates a loop (based on rejecting advertisements with its own ASN in AS path)?
