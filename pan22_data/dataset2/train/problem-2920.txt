We just switched to Lync 2013 at my company and I ran into this issue.  I coded a very quick, very basic workaround in AutoHotKey.  It will resize (but not move) your chat windows.  Recall that this particular bug in Lync 2013 will remember your window position, but not window size.
This is indeed annoying. My Issue started all of a sudden on Skype for Business 2015. Here is how I fixed it:
This worked for me. Under Settings / tools / Options, select IM to show the IM options. The "Enable tabbed conversations" is available in here...
Tried all the above nothing worked. Then I opened Skype for business by accident, which reverts back to Lync due to Group Policy settings, now all my Lync IM window sizes stick and work when they are resized.
The default window size is 430x430; this resizes the window to a much roomier 850x600.  Feel free to change the size in the script to suit your liking.  It only changes the size the first time the window appears.  If you proceed to resize the window, the script will not resize the window, nor will it remember the window size after you close it.  It will only set the window size the first time the window appears.
