Find the programs that are "portable" (sorta), programs that do not rely on many parts and pieces, they can make thier own few registry entries on run, and can sit alone in a nice little folder you make for them.  Later these "portable" programs can be transported again, to 8 for example.  Most of the "portable" like programs I used in XP worked portable again in windows 7, and without many compatability issues.
    Think of it as an opertunity to clean-up , replace old stuff with better, and find the portable items.  
uhh 3 :-( reinstall them. Looking at it from the inside out (registry and changes in system) I did not feel there was any full proper way to accomplish this, even with some magic program that attempts it.
Virtualizing is not a solution (for me) it is a workaround for stuff that simply will not function in windows7. Most programs when properly re-installed into the windows 7 system from XP will function, if they do not there is the compatability modes. My system had all the virtualising ability, many of the programs responded slowly, didnt have tight fast links to the hardware, and it was "virtual" :-) cause that is what it is.
