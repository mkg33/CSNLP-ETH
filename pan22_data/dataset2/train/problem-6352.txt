I note that both your eth0 and wlan0 are connecting to the same 192.168.2.x LAN network. I have noticed previously on other computers (such as my windows laptop) with multiple connections to the same LAN - that the LAST interface connected is the one used to send packets out.  Unfortunately when this is disconnected, the computer doesn't automatically switch to the first interface. 
Since the wireless generally takes longer to connect, it usually ends up being the one which is used, even though the wired interface is faster. 
Well, it seems that the wifi dongle itself is the problem. I disconnected the dongle and the ethernet connection worked.
Try disconnecting the Ethernet cable and reconnecting it.  I think you will find that now disabling wlan0 has no effect because eth0 is now the default. 
I'm connecting my pi via ethernet to my router and is assigned an IP address (via static DHCP) but I'm unable to connect to any outside network. The strange thing is I can also connect via WIFI dongle and able to access outside networks:
