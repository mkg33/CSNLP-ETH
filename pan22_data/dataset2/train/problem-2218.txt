The manual for your motherboard doesn't say it is a requirement, but it does advise using the same size memory modules. It's possible that having 1gb modules being scanned first is preventing it from detecting the larger 2gb module.
I would try swapping which bank the modules are in ( 1x2gb <-> 2x1gb ) and see if that helps, failing that I think you just need to get two 1gb modules to replace your existing 2gb module.
I would check whether new BIOS firmware is available if that setting is not in your current BIOS firmware.
If the BIOS doesn't recognize all 4 GB, there's no chance Windows will see it.  It's possible that the reason they provide a memory support list is because the board is very choosy.
Of course, the up-side of the latter would be that you'd re-enable dual-channel and get faster memory use of the system.
It looks like the 945 chip set doesn't support more than 4 GB of address space (and some versions only 2GB).  So you end up with the same limitation as Vista 32 bit - you won't be able to use all of 4 GB of your RAM since address space is used for more than just RAM.
Memory hole is there since all devices must fit in 32-bit address space during boot (since BIOS is not aware whether you will use 32-bit or 64-bit OS later). Remapping takes care to move affected memory to memory area after 32-bit boundary.
