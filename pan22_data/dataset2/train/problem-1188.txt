The point is not about servers. It is about storing people's info after they delete something. It is about allowing other people whether advertisers, your friends of a friend, or anyone to see anything abut you without your permission.For college kids it is fine, at that age showing off is biggest thing people want to do. But once ou cross that 25-30 age and mature up, facebook is a no no. 
In the end is is simple: Without a user's permission no one should see anything about you. It should be like you don't exist unless you want to share something. And when a user hits delete you need to remove it from your servers, no soft deletes. But companies like Google and Facebook do the opposite, they will track every inch of your life which is dangerous in the long run. My drunk photos I posted on my album have ended up all over my friends of friend to n degrees because my friends comment on it and it appears on their friend's wall and they comment and it it was a whole mess some time back so I just quit facebook in the end until someone comes out with a privacy friendly network. Diaspora has a good idea but is weak with their business model and features. Apart from privacy you need to offer users features too which will make them stay and use your service.
