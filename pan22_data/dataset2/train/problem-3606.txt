Discussions with another victim have us thinking this is a graphics issue specific to virtualization. Like it might be a depth issue with the graphics almost as if the Wacom pointer is on the gamma layer instead of in the foreground.  This is not going to be an easy fix obviously.
Unfortunately, Adobe Creative Cloud Suite runs in Windows. Otherwise, I would not use that OS.  My problems would be solved if Adobe would provide the suite in a Linux version.
I have been struggling with this as well using a Wacom Intuos Pro.  What I will update you on is this problem has been tested with guest Win7 running on a CentOS 7 host.  The problem exists in both VirtualBox and in KVM environments.  So I purchased Win10 just to eliminate the Windows version. Win10 guest under KVM still has this problem. I haven't tried Xen or VMWare.  I can confirm that ALL Wacom features work as designed in the CentOS 7 environment and Linux based art applications. Hence, I believe it is the virtualization that creates this headache.
