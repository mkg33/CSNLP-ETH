I am working on a project in which we need to do IP Address lookups. So for this we have got the datasets which will look like below and now the next steps is to populate this datasets in to the MySql table. Below is the dataset example containing columns-
I am planning to store the START_IP_NUM and END_IP_NUM as BIGINT in the MySql database instead of storing IP Address in the table as doing a lookup against a BIGINT is far faster than searching a string (dotted ip notation). 
If not they will be the same, if you want the ranges for each a whois 24.32.116.116 will reveal this information.
So my question is we will be having separate Java Program that will populate the above datasets in the MySql table. So I need to device some sort of logic which can convert the above datasets into like below-
Why you may ask? you are not storing a range of ip addresses; take for example a /24 range: 192.168.1.0/24 this provides a range 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255, whilst really only ip's 192.168.1.1 though 192.168.1.254 are usable (.255 being the broadcast).
I am confuse given a IP Address how should I device start_ip_num and end_ip_num here and store it into the MySql table
