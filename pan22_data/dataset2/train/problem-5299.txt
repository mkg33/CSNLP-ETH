So my first guess was that something is wrong with file associations or environment variables. Checked those but they seem fine:    
Ok i think i figured it out. Apparently before i posted i was missing C:\Windows\System32\ from PATH variable. Adding this and making the post did not change anything until i did the oldest fix in the book: a restart. That fixed it. Also for some reason (not sure this is default) the USERNAME variable was SYSTEM not my username. Putting %username% to cmd returned my username correctly. Bit odd but everything seems to be working now.
This sounds like an encoding issue.  Unless you know you need UTF-8 or Unicode, try saving a copy of your batch file encoded in ANSI.
This error is not limited to specific commands im calling via batch files. Even the simplest commands seem to fail.
Okay this is weird. I'm at a loss as to why this is happening or how to fix this. The title pretty much says it all but i will elaborate further:
Opening batch files by doubleclicking: ...is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
