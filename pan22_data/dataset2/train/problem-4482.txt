Pasting "text only" from other programs does only seem to work in Word 2007, if the option "Show Paste Options Buttons" is selected. If this option is not selected, Word 2007 is ignoring the specification given for "Pasting from other programs". To me, this is clearly a bug.
I'm stuck using word 2007 at the office. It has options for retaining formatting, pasting as plain text, and pasting text to match the destination's formatting. That last option is the one I want, but word is blatantly ignoring it. 
I can work around it by pasting to a plain text file, then pasting into word. Or I can do paste special --> unformatted text. But this is so irritating... I just want to ctrl+V and not hassle with it every single time. Is there a better fix?
However, if does not work in your case you might want to give PureText+ a try. This utility tries to extract only the text from the current clipboard content and paste it into the active application.
Tom's answer is the only one that worked for me (i.e. making sure the "Show Paste Options Buttons" is selected in Options -> Advanced). I had disabled it because of the annoying box that pops up and obstructs the text when you paste.... so you have to choose which of the two evils is the lesser! I therefore also agree with Tom that this is a bug.
Have you tried un-checking "Use smart cut and paste". It's the last option under the "Cut, copy, and paste" section.
I copy some text from a PDF, paste into word, and it retains the PDF's formatting... even though I went into options --> advanced --> changed all the dropdowns to "Match Destination Formatting". It also ignores "text only" option... It retains the exact mix of bold, italic, normal text & fonts.
