The only solution here is to recompile KScreenLocker with the given timer patched to some low value (setting it to 0 might me racy; I haven't checked).
Open /etc/pam.d/system-auth, find the "auth … pam_unix.so" module in there, then add the nodelay option to the line. (See "man  pam_unix" for information about all options, and examples of how to specify them.)
I feel this is too long and was wondering if anyone knew whether this timeout was defined in a config file somewhere (hopefully only affecting the lock/login screens and not other software where the timeout is a good bot-bruteforce deterrent)
I'm using plasma 5 right now (on Fedora 22, if that matters) and whenever I enter my password incorrectly at the lock screen I have to wait around five seconds before it will let me try to enter text into the password input again.
The reason updating the pam_unix.so entry does not work (see grawity's answer) does not work is to be found within the source code of kscreenlocker:
Or try proposing a different value to upstream. From I know they aren't very open on making stuff on the screen locker configurable, so you may be out of luck there.
Before forwarding a received password to the authentication program (that is, kcheckpass) the KScreenLocker greeter application will start a three-second “grace lock timer” and will refuse any further unlock attempts until that counter has expired. That three-second number being hard-coded of course. So when you attempt to remove the PAM-level time, as suggested in the other answer, all you'll actually do is wait proportionally longer on this timer instead.
