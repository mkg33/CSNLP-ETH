The mice have been damaged permanently, perhaps due to faulty USB ports on the motherboard. I say this because this is the 3rd mouse I've had develop this problem.
If you're using a laptop on a docking station.. and both the track pad on the laptop, and a separate mouse are enabled to be used, pay attention to the surroundings on both. 
I would look for other reasons you have been re encountering this problem. Maybe the way store your mice? Do you wrap them and put them in a bag? Just a thought. You could just be having statistically really bad luck.
When I initially checked there probably wasn't enough time for the problems to surface, or it had good days and bad days. But now as it progressed, it's obvious that the mouse is bad. It's evident in Safe Mode, as well as on another machine running Ubuntu.
If it is the switch that is damaged and causing double clicks it is pretty impossible/unlikely for the usb port to be the issue. There are multiple IC's that sit in between the switches and the USB's UART bus.
I would constantly pile things onto my laptop since I didn't use that track pad. The weight of a notebook and a phone were holding down the click on the laptop track pad so I kept having random things dragged and dropped. As soon as I removed the items, the issue went away.
