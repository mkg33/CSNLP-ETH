Skype is a P2P network. That implies it may use your connection to help other members of the network to communicate with or without your participation in that communication. 
Anything 'free' still has to pay for servers, which means it has a business model to get revenue. Generally: advertising, perks, extra options.
skype DOES use your connection sometimes as a node regardless of what you or anyone else says - it remains in its coding (hence you will get 1-2kb data up and down)
ALSO: skype streams advertising to your client whether you selected it or not (the option only stops skype SHOWING the advert to you, not streaming it). This means that skype can tell advertising companies that they have a 'high' consumer base that regularly gets advertising, therefore get more business (keeping skype free for the non-payers).
Why is Skype uploading and downloading data when I'm not even using it? It stays between .25 KB/s - 1.5 KB/s up and .30 KB/s - 1.2 KB/s down. (I'm streaming music with Chrome.)
