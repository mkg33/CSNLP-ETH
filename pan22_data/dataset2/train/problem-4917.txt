To achieve this on my local network I install Apple's Bonjour for Windows on all my windows machines and Avahi on all my linux machines (if it's not on there already, it often is). Then I can access each machine in the Zeroconf ".local" domain. So if a given machine's hostname's "Stan" or "Cartman", I can access those machines at stan.local and cartman.local
The easiest solution that I have found is to install Tomato. DD-WRT probably works too. If you're also planning on forwarding ports and stuff like that, then you also want to look in the "Static DHCP" section, where you cna instruct your router to always give the same computers the same IP addresses.
DNS isn't used for this, SMB is. By default, yes, the machines should be addressable by name automatically. Make sure the workgroup name is set the same on all machines for this to work
I've got a standard Linksys router and a few laptops - mix of Windows Vista and Mac OS X. Shouldn't my router act as a DNS server to resolve hostnames for the machines within my local network? If not, how else can I solve this? Static hosts files? Other solutions?
