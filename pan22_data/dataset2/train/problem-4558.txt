I would imply from this that the sql server is caching the credentials are OK and hitting this normally, but invalidating them after some time.  Because the connection back to the DC was down, it couldn't refresh the cache and started failing queries.
The setup is server A is a domain controller in the main network, and server B is on a remote network connected back via VPN.  Server B has SQL Server 2008 on it.  There is an application running on server B that for the purposes of this discussion, just inserts/queries the database every minute.
I have tried looking around but not found any information on the situation, so am asking if anyone knows if there is a setting somewhere I can tweak to relax the rules related to this?  Or is the only solution to deploy a DC on the remote network too, which seems a little overkill given this scenario would be the only benefit.
Just have had an interesting situation with a remote database server which I did not think happened.
Today the VPN dropped out for a tad over 30 minutes due to some network problems between the 2.  Database queries are done using trusted_connection=sspi; credentials, and worked for maybe the first 20 minutes while the VPN was down.  However eventually the queries started failing with the error Cannot generate SSPI context.
I would like the remote database to work for as long as required (up to hours) without the VPN or DC being available.
