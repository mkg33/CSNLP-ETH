Also, since I only mentioned 2 potential methods here and potentially only one, do any of you have a better method for me that I am overlooking? 
B. I add the caribbean domain as a sub domain in my current AD Forest (Im not sure if this is even possible). I would actually like to go this route and I think it would be simpler and faster to do but once again this is why I am here.
If I go route 2, I need to have the "sub-domain" replicate as well to the backup domain controllers.  So I guess my next question is, if I can have a sub-domain in my main AD forest will this replicate to the backup domain controllers?
A. Migrate their users and computers to my primary domain in the states and we all operate off one domain.
Currently I have a remote office in the Caribbean that is on its own network, domain, etc.  Recently we upgraded our networking/firewall equipment to Cisco Meraki and what a pleasure it has been.  With the Cisco Meraki equipment it has the option for the Mesh VPN which we have currently setup and it is working beautifully.  Since we are essentially on the same network now i figured it was time to essentially manage AD in one place, so I have decided it would be beneficial to do either of the 2 procedures:
Adding a trust will not reduce your administrative work much. I recommend doing a migration to a single domain. The ADMT works as it says it does.
