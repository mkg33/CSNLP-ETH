Also, regarding raid level, if you have space to spare (and it sounds like you do), consider raid 10. You lose half of your usable capacity to overhead, but you can compensate for that by buying larger drives. With raid 10, you can lose as many as half your disks before losing data, the performance for reads (which should be 70% or more of your IO) will be as good or better than a raid 5 with the same number of drives, because you have the same number of disks being used for each read both ways. Also, sparing in a replacement for a failed drive on raid 5 takes longer since the server needs to rebuild the spare from "parity", which means doing a lot of math and a lot of reads on your existing drives.
You don't want to use a small number of large drives because doing local virtualization can cause a disk performance bottleneck, and the only way to increase disk performance is to increase the number of "heads" (or "spindles") in your raid.
The size of drive doesn't affect performance- 8 250GB drives will go the same speed in terms of IO/s and MB/s as 8 2000GB drives, so long as the spindle speeds (7.2k RPM) are the same.
