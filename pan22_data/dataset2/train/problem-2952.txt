With USB-PD, the situation is a bit different. Since the laptop can communicate with the charger, technically it can discover the charger's capabilities. From there, it is possible for the laptop to e.g. limit charging rate by using a lower current. Whether a laptop does so or not would depend on the laptop; this is optional.
Most likely, the laptop only supports 15V input. It will try to negotiate with the charger, discover the charger does not support 15V, and abort. Nothing will happen.
In short: the max power you can get at 9V is 27W (3A). To get 45W, you need either 15V on 3A or 20V on 2.25A.
But we run into an issue: with USB-PD, it is also possible for the voltage to vary, and chargers can supply different voltages. Again, it is possible for the laptop to accept different voltages, but this is vanishingly unlikely: it requires significant additional circuitry that laptops tend to not include on the power input.
Firstly, it's quite clear that it won't meet the 45 W the laptop expects. With traditional chargers (those that are a 'dumb' DC SMPS) what will likely happen is as the laptop requests more current, the voltage will start sagging until it reaches a cutoff and the laptop stops charging. Unlike phones, laptops tend to not 'test' supplies for the max current they support - they assume you're using a properly rated charger.
In this case, the biggest problem you'll likely run into is the USB-PD's power rules, as seen in section 10 of the revision 3.0 specification. Wikipedia has a simplified reproduction of the table, on the right.
