Head to C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\ and manually delete the offending task -- this may take some trial and error if you don't know which task(s) are causing the problem.
To solve the problem, follow these steps (a few answers above gave good advice--my answer give a bit more detail and steps you can follow; the usual warnings about editing the registry apply--just be careful!):
Windows 7 also stores tasks in the registry, so delete tasks from both C:\Windows\System32\Tasks and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree
I've deleted the problem task from C:\Windows\System32\Tasks and the Windows registry tree and problem disappeared.
With the following root path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache, it goes through the subkeys of tasks and tree to find the ones that do not match.
If this Event Viewer Tasks branch is empty or doesn't have an entry for System_Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Power_41, then the issue is that the registry thinks there is an entry when in fact there isn't. Gee, thanks for wasting everyone's time, Microsoft. You should provide a "Clean-Up Now" button on the dialog so that the user has an easy way of fixing the underlying issue. (I'm not entirely sure why the issue occurs in the first place--that's a story for another day.)
You will not be able to run it directly from Visual Studio but instead you'll have to compile it and visit the release directory and run the exe from an elevated command prompt.
I posted this answer because I found a YouTube video with close to 200,000 hits that had the title "KERNEL POWER EVENT ID 41 Easy solution 2016 - 2017". It advised downloading and installing software that has absolutely NOTHING to do with the problem. That angered me, so I hope my step-by-step solution helps others.
With that entry highlight, hit the Delete key on your keyboard to delete it (or right-click and delete it). 
The selected task "System_Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Power_41" no longer exists. To see the current tasks, click Refresh.
The reason this is happening has to do with the Event Viewer Tasks branch in the Task Scheduler Library. Here is what this looks like from the Task Scheduler Windows application (I've highlighted the offending branch):
