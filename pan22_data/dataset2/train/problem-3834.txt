So from what I could gather what you want to do is to pre-render your level into one surface, so that each frame you can just blit that one surface that you need to.
As a side-disclaimer, you might want to take a look at SDL2 and it's accelerated hardware rendering support. You might get a performance boost, and moving on to the newer SDL stuff might really be a good idea. The alternative there is to use textures and render targets instead of surfaces.
The difference between the two calls is that the former version blits directly to the screen, while the latter uses the surface you created previously.
This is quite straight-forward. You can use SDL_CreateRGBSurface to create a surface of your required size. You can do this in your main() or some other appropriate place that gets only called once.
Now, in your game loop you are probably calling your function aff_map. Instead of doing that, you can now call aff_map before the game enters the main loop, and in the main loop you can just do SDL_BlitSurface(yourPrecreatedSurface, NULL, exe->screen, NULL);
Now, you just need to change the call SDL_BlitSurface(exe->sprite, &srcrect, exe->screen, &dstrect) to SDL_BlitSurface(exe->sprite, &srcrect, yourPrecreatedSurface, &dstrect).
