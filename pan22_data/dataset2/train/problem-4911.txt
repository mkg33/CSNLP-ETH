I experienced this issue as well. I found that I can use CTRL + ALT + DEL at the black screen. This allows me to start the Task Manager. Within the Task Manager select New Task (RUN) from the File menu. Type CMD and select the check box to run this command as an administrator. Within the command prompt, type sfc/scannow and let it scan your system. Once completed, reboot the machine by pressing CTRL + ALT + DEL again and select restart from the Power button on the bottom right.
Sounds like explorer took a dump. Rather than troubleshoot for hours, just refresh the PC with the built in utility. All your documents and data will be left intact and the operating system will be re-installed completely. I LOVE this feature in WIN 8 and have used it several times. Note that you will have to reload programs but this is a minor inconvenience for getting a fresh OS back on your HD knowing there arent any other bugs lurking in the background.
Boot up to the login screen, hold down SHIFT and reboot the PC to get into the advanced boot menu. Here you will find all kinds of goodies to troubleshoot, refresh or reset the system back to defaults.
