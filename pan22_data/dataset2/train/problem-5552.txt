Take a look at AX.25, as well as other digital modems, such as MT63 and PSK. fldigi is capable of many, although it's built for text, so you'd need to base64 any binary data.
I've done this before, not because it made sense to, but because I felt like it. Ham radio has all kinds of things for this, notably AX.25. Anything you send through a non-digital radio is audio being encoded into radio waves, and back by the receiver. Take the radio out of the equation, and you get what you're looking for.
One of the first computers used soundwaves within a medium of mercury to store data so though it was not a networking medium it was still a method data retention and the same concept could be used for transmission and networking
In other words, could you implement layer 1 of the OSI networking model using sound waves or am I totally misunderstanding the physics/networking concepts?
There was the TCP/IP over bongodrum project. But the homepage for the actual project seems dead now.
Is it possible, in theory, to use sound waves as the physical medium to transmit data over a network?
