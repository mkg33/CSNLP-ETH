We are in conversation with machine manufacturer - they are doing their best to get a hard drive replacement with preinstalled software, but it's taking them very long. Plus it seems that the problem may be solvable and I'd be happy not to spend a fortune on something we may not need.
I realize this question most likely won't benefit anyone, but hope that there is a Windows NT guru here on Stackoverflow that can give me some hints.
I am battling a problem with old computer and hoping someone here can help. The computer is running Windows NT4, and is serving as an HMI for LVD Omega 1500 metal fabrication center circa 1998. A few weeks ago the usually automatically starting program (Fanuc's "Basic Operation Package 1") failed to start, outputting two different messages, depending on the user being logged in - for Administrator it is "Runtime error '5' - Invalid procedure call or argument" and for other users it's "Runtime error '9' - Subscript out of range". I have no idea how to begin debugging this, it could be related to the list of WinNT users, but that is as far as I can get...
