Meanwhile, your "world" maps; the strategic and tactical maps, should be treated as part of the world space. As Philipp has suggested in his answer they should each have a parent GameObject that can be disabled and enabled (thus disabling the map entirely), and likely separate cameras, and place them on different layers to avoid physics interactions. 
As you have pointed, many of these screens are UI like in nature. Thus, the obvious solution is these should be implemented as UI. This will also allow things like fancy transitions. This should be for things like the City Management screen, and Research screen ect. Have them start off screen, and swing into the map when clicked. Or as prefabs that get added to the UI when a button is clicked, and removed when clicked off. You can have UI elements have their own cameras, but just as easily implement something to add and remove, and move about, a single UI layer (or perhaps one per map). 
Finally, while Unity was originally intended to use Scenes for this, a large number of developers do not, and scene transitions can have issues with keeping data between scenes. I would not recommend using scene transitions for this, except maybe for transitioning between maps.     
You appear to be treating all screens as the same; they are most likely not. What you really have are UI screens, and Maps that form the game world.
