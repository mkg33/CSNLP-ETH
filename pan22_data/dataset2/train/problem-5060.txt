From here on it is very simple. Right click on the partition you want to shrink. Click on Resize, then put the size you want to make it in the New Size field, press Tab button, then click on Resize/Move. And it should be done in a bit.
You should now exit from that GParted live session, to do that just double click on Exit from the Desktop.
GParted will now run after a short while. When it does, it will scan all your hard drives on your computer and provide you with a list of your partitions. Note that all your partitions will not be specified like in Windows. In Windows you have drive letters(example: E: F: G:), here you will have the likes of sda1, sda2, sda3, etc. Here, the sda means your first hard drive, if you a second or even a third hard drive, they will be specified as sdb and sdc respectively. sda1 means first partition on your first hard drive, sda2 means second partition on your first hard drive, sda3 means your third partition on your first hard drive, and so on.
You can do it very easily using GParted. It is a very advanced tool for partitioning hard drives and will of course suit your need specified.
For resizing you will need to know which partition to shrink. You can easily find that out if you have a Label for your E: drive, and the size of the drive, i.e 107 GB can also be used to figure that out.
To make a new partition, you will now see some 'unallocated' space. Right click on that, select New, fill in the details of the size, Label you want it to have, etc. But do notice the File System. Select ntfs as your filesystem. Then click Add.
