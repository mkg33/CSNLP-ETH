For the record: A cell reference consists of a column reference and a row reference. In the cell reference "A10" the column reference is "A" and the row reference is "10". You seem to use the term "row reference" for something completely different, which is confusing. 
If I understand correctly, you want to sum all cells in column B where column A is not empty, like in this screenshot:
I want to do a SUMIF or similar which works for the returning the balance values, however won't work for the rate values. I am trying to avoid a formula that targets a prescribed cell number in case the report adds or subtracts columns in the future as products are added or removed, therefore returning the incorrect value for this.
I have a report that on one row has a row reference (product name) in column A and a value (balance) in the columns next to it, with the immediate row below displaying a corresponding value (rate) without a row reference in column A.
Is there a formula that will allow you to return the value in a cell where there is no row reference?
