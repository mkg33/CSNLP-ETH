Are *.fr3 files something special as far as OWA is concerned that I'm unaware of? How can I convince OWA to treat them the same as other file types, which all save without issue? This isn't a show-stopping problem but is just one of the annoyances I'm trying to clean up for the client.
When the client uses OWA (Exchange 2003), even on the same machine, and tries to save the attachments they result in zero byte files. The solution they have employed for those staff members who only have access via OWA has been to ask the software vendor to zip them up and resend them. This works fine as far as the file goes but involves extra steps and bother that shouldn't be required.
I can find nothing to explain why this only happens with *.fr3 files. All other attachments they receive, such as *.zip, *.pdf, *.doc(x), *.xls(x), etc. save perfectly. The anti-virus software (Avast) is not treating *.fr3 as anything special either.
I have a client who uses an application that uses *.fr3 files, which as far as I am aware are nothing more than binary files in a proprietary format. Those files are periodically emailed from the software company to my client. Using Outlook (2003 or 2010) the client can save the attachment and then copy the file to the application that uses them. No problems and nothing unusual so far.
