These servers are combined with MX records behind securemail.hostdomain.com with their respective priority. 
If you want the client to use their own domain, you need to use a certificate with with multiple SAN (Subject Alternative Names), one for each domain you want to answer as.
Some mail server support multiple certificates on the same IP address but they need a SNI aware client for this so that the proper certificate can be provided. Not all clients support SNI so you can not rely on this.
This means that you have to live with a single certificate on your mail server. The easiest way would just setup the MX for the client domains to point to this server securemail.hostdomain.com and not to mail.theirdomain.com as you currently do. 
If you don't want to go this simple way you need a multi-domain certificate which includes all domains you want to serve on this server. Of course it is necessary for this the you actually own all these domains or at least have enough access to be able to react to the challenge used in DV certificate validation. If these domains are instead in full control of the client you cannot do this.
