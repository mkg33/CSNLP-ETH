For the fifth key for each player, you could potentially use a letter next to each of the players, such as X for with WASD, Ctrl with the Arrow Keys, M with IJKL, and Space for GVBM.
I'm planning on making a multiplayer game for up to four people on a single machine. We want to have all input coming from players using the same keyboard (or multiple keyboards connected to the same computer). What keys should I use for each player?
If the keyboard has a number pad, you can use that for the fourth player. Otherwise, GVBM is the most spaced set of letters in the WASD shape.
I'm aware that many keyboards limit the number of keys that can be pressed simultaneously, however for this particular game we will be controlling the hardware and using multiple keyboards. It would be nice to have a set of keys that would work on a single keyboard if that keyboard didn't have that input limit (although it might be difficult fitting everyone's hand)
Each player will be able to move around at a minimum, which will require four directional keys. They might potentially have one extra action they can take, which would require a fifth key.
I'm mainly interested in what positions of keys to use, rather than the letters, so just answer using the QWERTY keyboard layout. Potentially we can let people map this to their own preference for the other keyboard users.
WASD and the Arrow Keys are somewhat obvious options for a single player game, but what other sets of keys should I use?
WASD and Arrow Keys are good options for two players. According to Wikipedia, IJKL is a common option, so that could be used for the third player.
