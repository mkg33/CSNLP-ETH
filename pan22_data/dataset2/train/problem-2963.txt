you should be able to automatically reach a NTFS from the filesystem browser (if the partition is actually mounted). Just keep going "up" from your home directory (from nautilus) and you'll get there at some point.
Opening your Windows files is so easy in Ubuntu and you don't need any tools for that, I think you can find the hard drive under systems.
If it is an external harddrive, i simply would open the filesystem browser and click on the harddrive that i want to open - then it magically could open it :-)
/dev/hdb1 is your disk (you can find the proper designation by typing lshw in the terminal), /media/backup is where you want to mount it.

I'd like to access my Windows 7 files from within Ubuntu (and preferably vice-versa).  I've not been able to find any tutorials online to tell me how this is done.  There seems to be many tools for Win to Ext2/Ext3 but nothing really providing the solution I need.
