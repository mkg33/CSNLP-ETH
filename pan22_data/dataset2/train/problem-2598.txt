Many hardcore gamers also build custom PCs from scratch that are at the edge of their fan's specs, in which case a hot day and the heat your game generates may cause the safeties to trigger in the machine (at best) or even make parts overheat and die (at worst). So if that's your target audience, you may want to ensure you're always leaving a bit of space "at the top".
You're wasting CPU cycles. That means lower battery time on notebooks, tablets and phones, higher electricity bills, more heat generated by the machine, noisier fans. Also, you may be eating cycles from other important system processes (e.g. the window server could become jerky), which could then affect gameplay. Some system schedulers on today's pre-emptive multitasking systems also penalize applications that use too many cycles, so you may be fast first, then suddenly see strange jerkiness when you're throttled by the system.
Finally, there are gameplay issues where you might be advantaging players with faster machines over those with slower ones. Having the game loop capped at a certain frequency and using additional cycles solely for non-gameplay-relevant aspects (like rendering higher fidelity graphics, surround sound effects or whatever) will make your game more fair.
