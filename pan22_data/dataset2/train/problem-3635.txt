If the webserver is a public webserver, you'll need to set up security both to control access to the data and to secure communication between the working clients and the database.
I really like the idea of migrating to a web database. Interfaces are easy to set up, and freeing your data like this allows for great flexibility. However, you'll need to be aware of the security issues, access issues, backup configuration, to name a few considerations.
If your web host goes belly-up, how will you get your data? How will people work if the internet is down? Who is responsible for backups? Is there a transaction limit on your webhost? Is there a data transfer limit for your webhosting account?
As for recommendations, if your SBS server contains SQL Server (or even if it doesn't), I would go down the SQL Server route as with Entity Framework and more, this could probably be set up in no time at all.
I think your proposed solution would certainly work. But if you haven't purchased the license for the Microsoft products yet. I recommend simply using the free MySQL database and use a free apache+PHP web server to host the front end, would also work.
