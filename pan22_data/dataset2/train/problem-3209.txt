Since I use Apache's mod-itk for PHP hosting, all emails are generated by username@host.mydomain.com and submitted to Postfix via standard means (sendmail???).
Postfix handles smtp separatly submission from pickup (mails submited by sendmail command are entering postfix via pickup)
Configuration is pasted to http://pastebin.ca/2374363. Please note that I have only dkimproxy.out enabled for the moment
Currently, when I send an email via SMTP/TLS on port 587 it gets DKIM-signed. When a process on the server sends an email using mail command or PHP builtin mail function, the mail dorsn't get signed by dkimproxy.
My web hosting server features a Postfix setup up and running. That postfix is also open with STARTTLS on port 587 for authorized users (only me, myself and I right now) to send emails to any domain after signing it with DKIM.
One thing to note is that bounce messages and NDR reports generated internally by postfix will not be DKIM signed
Every email I send via Outlook authenticating myself is fine. All DMARC reports display no error. The problem is when web applications send email via that Postfix.
