Another disadvantage of just reading books is the risk that you might pick and choose the parts you like (or the parts you understand!) and skim over (or just copy/paste) the rest.  You don't have that option with a course; you have to knuckle down and learn all the horrible stuff, you have to learn the theory behind it and the reasons why.
Going to college and doing a 4 year course gets you one thing that no book in the world can give.  You are able to demonstrate straight away that you are able to begin a 4-year project, stick to it, see it through, and get a result at the end.
Reading books on it's own can get you to a certain level of knowledge, yes.  You can become quite competent and capable, even.
Yes, there are the occasional mavericks who never went to college and who obtained their knowledge other ways (John Carmack is probably the best known example) but you'll find that they're extremely rare and that they are generally people who start their own companies rather than people who get jobs at existing companies.
