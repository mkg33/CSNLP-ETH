I am seeing a problem where a cookie being set by my site while using HTTPS is not being returned to the server when the connection switches to HTTP (again, IE8 Win7). The cookie is present on other HTTPS requests.
Switching to "/" as path for the cookie solved the problem for me. I had a more specific path before.
Microsoft has yet to admit that there is an issue, so there is no fix for the issue. This and numerous other crippling BUGS in IE8 are being ignored, likely because they are too hard to fix and a result of serious flaws in the new process model that would require a ground up rebuild (IE9).
To be very clear, it is not on "some machines" and not a 3rd party plugin or software issue. The problem has nothing to do with the cookie expiration date, the PC date or any other user or site controlled setting, it is a BUG in IE8, PERIOD. 
There is some evidence that the problem has to do with the process model in that I am able to get around the issue by running IE as administrator (obviously not advised, just for testing this problem).
It is an IE8 bug. The IE8 process model is new and very flawed. If (when) IE8 processes hang or the computer is rebooted with IE8 open, cookies are lost. 
Cookies can be set with an expiry time. In my experience it's normal for most sites to not let you remain logged in for more than a week.
