I'm not sure that's what you're referring to, but it may be the case that your keyboard is indeed working and it's just that you're not used to the lack of visual feedback?  If your keyboard works in one place it should work everywhere ;)
Same problem in Ubuntu10.4 64-bit beta or release. My work-around has been to turn on the on-screen keyboard that is part of Accessibility settings. It is available right on the login screen. Icon: look for icon that looks like human with arms open-wide(Star Trek) or Leonardo Da Vinci's human body proportions drawing (art class).  One on-screen keyboard is checked I reboot and next time I go to log in the keyboard is there. I Click on my user id, I click on the password frame then use mouse to type out password. Once I'm logged in my regular keyboard works fine.
Shutdown the Ubuntu Session and in the vmware player, click on your Ubuntu image then click edit Virtual Machine Settings. Click the options tab, Make sure General is highlighted in the left pane, then check the box that reads use enhanced virtual keyboard in the lower left corner. Should fix your problem.
I can't remember the last time I used Ubuntu on the desktop, but generally the "Linux thing" so to speak is not to show the little asterisks when you type a password.  It's just a security thing so observers can't see how many characters you've typed.
What worked for me was logging into Ubuntu from putty and installing the VMware client tools (before I could do this I had to make sure the appropriate Linux headers were installed, sudo apt-get install cpp gcc build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)).
Try Martin Pitt's solution. Worked fine for me. This was found @ https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/548891 but to save you the time from reading, below are the quick steps to get it working.
