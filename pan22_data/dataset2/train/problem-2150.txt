Note: diskpart may not tell you exactly which is which, you may have to try using the cd /d F: (replace letter) and dir in combination to figure out which drive is which.
Let's create 2 batch scripts for our purposes (since you seem consistent on batch scripts today, you can also run these individually by line if you wish). If you have access to a Windows Administrator account you should create part1a.bat; if not, you need to create part1b.bat. You will create part2.bat in both cases.
It seems you want access to a command prompt before the login screen of Windows. It also seems like you want to run a batch script with it to reset the login credentials of a profile. Even if I am wrong about the latter you will be satisfied enough with the former.
Note : Googling with this topic only i can able to find bootable USB via cmd. But, pls note, I don't need how to boot usb via cmd. I need cmd in bootable USB. 
First and foremost, it is not possible to run a batch script outside of Windows, outside of CMD; the best you can do is before login during startup.
You cannot run a batch file like an OS, it just doesn't work like that. The batch interpreter is a part of Windows and if you boot your computer from a pendrive, you aren't in windows anymore and therefore, there is no way for your batch to be executed.
In order for a bootloader to actually load your software (i.e. boot it) you would need to write a boot sector for the bootloader.
