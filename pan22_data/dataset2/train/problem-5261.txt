At least in XP networks (you don't state what your computers are running...) I've seen instances where that makes a difference.
I have this exact configuration working on my network at home, its very convenient.  One setting that may make a big difference is in the "Advanced" settings under "DHCP/DNS" turn on the "Use Internal Caching DNS Forwarder."  That will enable the DNS server on your router which will also deliver your router's IP as the DNS server in all DHCP requests.  With the DNS server on, you should be able to now lookup all of the hosts on your network.  I am even able to lookup the hosts which get a Dynamic IP address by hostname using this configuration.
So a problem with the DNS server results? The fact that it works sometimes and not others is problematic.
Since it is not using NetBIOS to get the IP, it will use the hostname to resolve IP, it is first going to check itself, then the hosts file and then the DNS server to do this.  
If you're trying to connect via Remote Desktop, check and see if all of your machines are in the same workgroup. (I'm assuming based on your question that you're not running a domain at home - feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)
