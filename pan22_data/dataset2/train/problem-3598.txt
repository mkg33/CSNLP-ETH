Are you trying to boot to the 6TB array or just use it as a data volume?  You would need to partition it with a Guid Partition Table (GPT) in order to address that much space, and you can only boot to a GPT volume if you are using EFI instead of a legacy BIOS (not sure what that Tyan board has... EFI is still pretty uncommon).  Some more information here:
While NTFS can support volumes greater than 2TB there are other limiting factors. The important bit from that article is this:
You didn't exactly say which drivers you tried to use or if they were the latest ones from the manufacturer. As such, I suggest getting the latest official drivers from the manufacturer's web site and try with those.  I just searched and found Server 2008 drivers for that exact model. Unfortunately, the way they use frames on the site disallows me form posting a direct URL. Also, you might want to consider flashing the firmware to the latest version as well. If all else fails, contact their support with questions. It sounds like a strange hardware interaction that they might be very aware of.
