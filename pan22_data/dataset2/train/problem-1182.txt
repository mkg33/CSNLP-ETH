This does not occur with gnome-screenshot, but I need something that is powerful enough to do the equivilent to this:
Using the information on that blog post I have created the following python function which I use to take screenshots of a window with "mywindow" in the title bar.
As I have been capturing a window that is a 3d opengl app, i imagine xwd would be robust enough for your application
and gnome-screenshot does not seem to have the options available to do this.  I have not found any way to make the artifacts in the shots of import go away.
I have had some pretty good luck with xwd. I screenshot the whole desktop then use imagemagick to cut out just the portion I want.
I've been using import from Imagemagick to take screenshot of my second monitor every 15 seconds, and then later assembled the images using mencoder - thus creating a timelapse of what has been going on on my desktop during the time.  This worked great when I used Gnome 2 - but as of late, my shots has gotten several artifacts in them.  Black rectangles appearing in various places.
