I have a dell studio laptop with slot load dvd drive. A dvd got stuck inside the drive, i tried to insert another dvd but it didn't even enter a millimetre. I noticed that there was a clamp like  thing preventing the dvd from ejecting, exactly in the center of the slot load. With another dvd i tried to lift the clamp along with pressing eject button pressed simultaneously, suddenly the stuck dvd ejected out. Hope this may help someone.
Using a sharp knife I was able to prize the edge of the DVD out just enough to get a grip on it. I was not worried about damaging the DVD, so I was able to force it a little and get it out. 
I had the same problem, dvd jammed in my Dell Stuido 15, no disk drive showing in Explorer, and a really annoying noise coming from the laptop!
I had this happen on my Dell Studio with slot-type drive. Pressing the Eject key next to the function keys didn't work and the drive did not show up in My Computer.
Before I moved it, I could see the very edge of the dvd in the drive and this is why I used the knife to yank it out!
I pushed in another DVD about 75% a couple of times and managed to 'pull' out enough of the DVD that was stuck to get that out.
I ran into the same issue.  I took the Studio Hybrid apart and removed the DVD drive (screw on outer case, screw for cover, screw for HDD/DVD Assembly, 4 screws to remove DVD drive).  there were 4 small screws on the DVD drive that, once removed, allowed the DVD to be pulled straight out.
As soon as I did I got back in (admitted via system restore which allowed me to take it back to an earlier point)
Finally this is a last resort this may make it worse so only attempt understanding there a possibly of knackering your DVD drive.     
Eventually it ejected itself when I switched off, switched back on and repeatedly clicked on the above mentioned eject key whilst the computer was booting.
