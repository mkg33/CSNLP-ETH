We do it once a month or whenever we change something in the rack, but it's really up to you. There is no right or wrong answer here.
Do you meant that it failed or it ran out of power, because there's a big difference between the two. If it ran out of power than that's due to the load on the UPS. The runtime is based on a particular load and the more you go beyond that load the less runtime you'll have.
The UPS we have has a self testing system where it will monthly go thru and do a simple test on the batteries (with automatic notification)  I think it has a power out situation for a very small amount of time then sees how much power is drained, then multiplies it out to make sure that it is still good.  Beyond that I would say it depends on the SLA which you are trying to reach.  I have worked at companies where every 6 months would be fine.  I have worked at others where Quarterly was the standard.  What is the cost of failure?
During a recent power fialure our rack mounted UPS failed after 17 minutes( design time 30 minutes). How often should a rack mounted UPS be tested?
