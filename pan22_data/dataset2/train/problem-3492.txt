We're just trying to play on the same server. I've tried running his world and my world on lan but that doesn't work because im pretty sure i'd have to port forward his port given every time and that's very tedious. I'm just looking for way to do this that is reliable and will take care of itself without input every time we want to play. I've also tried running a dedicated server on my computer for minecraft but I don't know what ip to run and in which order to forward the port. 
I'm using a linksys router with tomato installed as a wireless access point for my computer upstairs... But the computer downstairs cant connect to the minecraft server im hosting on the computer upstairs. The router upstairs is using a subnet with 192.168.2.xxx and the one downstairs is 192.168.1.xxx. My ip is 192.168.2.31 and the ip downstairs is 192.168.1.143. Im running the minecraft server on the normal port but this computer apparently cant talk to any computers on the routers network downstairs. I'm pretty sure this is because of the subnet im using but this is the only way i could get internet upstairs. I can't connect a cable because there is no way to drill through the floor and i wont run a cable because it would need to be around 150 feet.
