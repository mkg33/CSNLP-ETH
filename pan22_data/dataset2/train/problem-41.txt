Note: the problem you're having right now is probably that the host OS (you're using right now) doesn't have access to the Windows folder of your infected guest OS. Using a Linux Live CD would allow you to "ignore" these permissions and restore whatever files you need. 
Disk drives do not have registries.  Your antivirus software should be able to scan a disk, which the USB drive should be recognized as.
Alternatively you could use a virus scanner within Linux to scan the drive as well, but I'm sure a clean install will give a better and more efficient result
Antivirus scanning of registry hive alone does not make sense, as there's no executable code in registry. There are only links to filesystem, and as long as filesystem is clean, registry is fine too.
But if you need to edit/search/replace something in the registry hive outside of Windows, or in the registry hive on USB HDD, you may use Emergency Boot CD ( http://www.prime-expert.com/ ) which contains standalone offline registry editor.
