I must emphasize that this isn't real security, just reduces the number of automated brute force attacks. Too much work to check every port I guess.
There are a number of good suggestions offered here.  I respectfully suggest that three things should make this relatively secure:
Something which isn't mentioned here and really should is limiting access via firewall. This doesn't suit every situation, but if you're connecting to the host from a consistent location with a static IP, you could just block off SSH entirely except to that IP. This will ensure that intruders cannot get in. As I mentioned though, this doesn't always suit every situation, especially if your IP is dynamic and changes often.
Only authenticate with this site via pre-shared SSH key pairs.  Man on ssh-keygen to get started with PKI based authentication.
If you use iptables it is more efficient as it operates at the network layer and you do not have to install an extra application.
There is a better way to do this, using fail2ban means you have to add an application, and it operates at the application layer.
"Sshguard monitors servers from their logging activity. When logs convey that someone is doing a Bad Thing, sshguard reacts by blocking he/she/it for a bit. Sshguard has a touchy personality: when a naughty tyke insists disturbing your host, it reacts firmer and firmer."
An option (to be used in addition to other security measures) is have sshd listen on a port other than 22. I haven't tried it myself, but have heard it reduces the number of pure brute force attacks by bots.
