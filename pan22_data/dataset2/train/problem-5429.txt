To restate: I'd like to direct all requests on certain domains, example.com for instance, to  http://localhost/blocked/.
Make sure a NameVirtualHost *:80 line appears somewhere in your Apache configuration. (Or if you want to catch requests on ports other than 80, that can be arranged as well)
The hosts file is only concerned about well, hosts. Not directories within that host. In order to do what you're hoping, you'll need to do a redirect from http://localhost/ to http://localhost/blocked/. You can accomplish this with mod_alias or mod_rewrite if you're running apache.
I have a directory setup with a nice error message at http://localhost/blocked/. I'd like to direct entries in my hosts relating to sites I've blocked to that instead of just 127.0.0.1. 127.0.0.1/blocked/ doesn't work. I'm clueless about the host file and this may not even be the best way to accomplish my goal.
and move the whole contents of the blocked/ directory (on your filesystem) to /var/www/blocked.localhost/htdocs. Obviously the pathnames are just examples.
