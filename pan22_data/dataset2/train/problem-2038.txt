From the EC2 console, click on Launch Instance and proceed to enter dummy info until you get to the security group section..
Due to lack of a proper way of doing this online, I created a super simple script to handle it. Have a look if you're interested.
From here click on "Select an Existing Security Group", and below you will see all the security groups you have for that particular VPC. You should see a "Copy to New" link under "Actions", use this to copy all of your ACLs to a new SG.
We have some security groups that have quite a few rules in them. Rather than having to recreate the same rules for a number of security groups just to accommodate minor differences, is it possible to copy a security group to use as a starting point, or use inheritance, etc?
Within the same AWS region, you can copy a security policy using the online GUI. However, sometimes you want to copy things programmatically. For instance, if you have a lot of security policies to copy or if you want to copy across regions.
AWS EC2 Console allows you to select the Security Group and perform the operation "Copy to new" in the UI now.
