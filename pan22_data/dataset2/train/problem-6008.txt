In regards to throttling traffic, it sounds like it's not only Windows update traffic that needs to be throttled, but all traffic, but that's another question. 
It could also help save bandwidth on your connection in general if you had users browsers and other such things using it. The catch is that it needs to be configured properly to work well.
What firewall are you using? Perhaps there are some advanced things that can be done to control traffic. Especially something to allow VOIP traffic to override other traffic (QoS).
By doing this, you will not only solve your bandwidth problem (each update is only downloaded once, and you can control when this happens) but you will also solve another problem, which is how to control and audit patch levels on your client and server systems.
You could look into running a web cache/proxy like Squid. There may be alternatives (maybe better), this is just the first I thought of. 
The canonical solution to this is not to throttle this traffic. Rather, stand up a WSUS server in your network and point your clients to that for updates.
