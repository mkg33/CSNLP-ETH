I'm not sure how ASR would come into any use here? This is only for a faulty system. Alternatively you could set up the new server manually and migrate the files and settings.
My only concern with cloning would be if you aren't installing on similar hardware anyway? what is the reason for the migration?
You will need to check the folder structure and the standard that was setup when the server was brought into action.
I have a Windows 2003 Server that I want to migrate to new hardware. All the setup and configuration was done by my predecessor. Right now I'm in a real time crunch and I just want to copy all the files and settings to the new machine. Is there an easy way to do this or do I need to manually copy all the files and add all the settings?
You could use imaging software such as Acronis to take an image of the system and then restore it on the new hardware.  This is assuming you can have the downtime on the current server, and that it is acceptable to install any necessary drivers for the new hardware after the image is restored.
Symantec Backup Exec Syatem Recovery 2010 will allow you to capture a backup image of the existing hardware and restore it to the new, different hardware easily.  Works great and a tool will allow you to assure you have the right drivers at hand for the new hardware when you restore.  There is an eval at Backup Exec Family.  Not sure of any limitations on the trial.  Have used many times and it svaes many hours of time.
The first thing you need to do is make sure migrating your hardware will conform with Microsoft licensing requirements. You need to check if your OS is OEM or Retail, if its OEM it dies with the hardware if its retail you should be ok.  
I'd suggest either Norton Ghost or Acronis as above. You'll need to be taking it down though, definitely. There are other alternatives, though. You could move the harddrives if they are similar hardware, but still best to create a clone first.
