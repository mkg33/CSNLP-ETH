I would not change the global gravity. This will cause numerous complications in the future. Instead of changing the gravity, have you considered increasing the friction on the player or the slope? Maybe attaching a physic material to the player and then modifying the PhysicMaterial.staticFriction in the editor or at runtime via code might help? Static friction seems to work on objects that standing still which would stop the sliding on your character.
You'd apply the anti-gravity force in the same FixedUpdate frame that you apply your movement force.
I've had great success by the following method. The idea is that, under the specific circumstance that the Rigidbody is in contact with a surface appropriately angled in relation to gravity(which is to say, 'a slope that isn't too steep'), it will be pulled toward the surface normal instead of in the direction of gravity.
Not saying that turning off gravity is the right approach, but if you want to cancel gravity, you only need to apply a force equal to gravity. The sum of the forces is then zero, the object doesn't move. Thus, anti-gravity is enabled.
