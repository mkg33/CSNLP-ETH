in future changes in username only require change in the ~/.ssh/config file locally on users machine
(https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/pu/doc/1-INSTALL.mkd for the instructions, but if you've cloned the repo you have that already)
I've done this before on Ubuntu boxes, and it works, but having multiple accounts share a single UID always seemed a bit "icky" to me.
When you use the "root" method of install, you're supposed to be able to run gl-system-install as root, and then run gl-setup as any user (and in fact any number of users) so that they can all be gitolite "hosting users".
So my answer would be: dont bother with UIDs etc.  Just install the RPM, add user 'git', su - git, then gl-setup yourname.pub.  Should do it.
If you're using key based auth in sshd, you can add a forced command in the authorized_keys file to sudo as the target user. 
Create a "git" user with the same UID, home directory, etc. as "gitolite".  Not my favorite thing to do, but it should work.
My second attempt was to create a standard user, then install manually following the non-root method instructions. Simpler and easier. I too wanted the "Git" username and used that.
what you could try on client end, is edit the users ~/.ssh/config file and add some lines along the basis of this
