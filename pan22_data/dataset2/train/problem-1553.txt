I say "of last resort" because if the boot sector is infected, there is a chance that it could render the computer unbootable, but it can be fixed, and the data is still there. You just may be back with a different question. That said, it does not happen often.
You may also want to flash the BIOS with the latest firmware. Just yesterday, an IT friend told me that he had to flash a BIOS because the virus was written there. So every time the system booted, even with a new hard drive, it would be reinfected.
Before I went on, I would also try Hitman Pro, and then, if necessary, use the following tool of last resort: Combofix.
After setting it up, image the hard drive, so that if this happens again, it will only take a few minutes to fix.
Quit messing around with it and just wipe it. In the time you've already spent trying to fix it, you could have probably re-installed a dozen times.
In addition, you have a backup of the current state, and a backup of your known-good state, so in 2 weeks you don't have to do any work.
