For some reason on some machines I don't see this, and on others I do.  I tend to not like having these extra options - how do I disable this from showing up for pinned programs and just have it be a shortcut.
You can't. Having menu's is a feature of Windows, that Chrome and Firefox take advantage of. Windows cannot override what an application does.
For Firefox specifically it is a new feature. I am running 3.6.10 and I do not have these options, but when I run Firefox 4 Beta 5+ I do have these options.  I believe these options are handled on a per application basis.  As far as I know there are no options to disable these context menu options. 
Having items in a pin menu is a feature of Windows, that Chrome and Firefox take advantage of. Windows cannot override what an application does.
In Windows 7 when I pin certain programs, somehow there is something that allows them to have a sub menu.  Examples of this are both Firefox (Enter private browsing) and Chrome (New window, New incognito window).
