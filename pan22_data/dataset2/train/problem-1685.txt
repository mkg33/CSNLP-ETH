By default Security Essentials has "Run a scheduled scan on my PC" checked. Also "Check for the latest virus and spyware definitions before running a scheduled scan" is checked by default. If you run a scan on schedule (default) you will get updates automatically then also.
I recently installed Microsoft Security Essentials.  I have Windows Automatic Updates set to "Notify me but don't automatically download or install them.", however, I can confirm that the virus/spyware definitions are still updated silently (i.e. without prompting), on a daily basis.  Great - as this is the behaviour that I was hoping for.

NO you can't stop MSE to downloading the latest virus definition. AFAIK it will update itself at least once in a day, if not then you can change the update time of it according to your choice for some long. I've used it once so now I've not any idea how to configure it manually.
