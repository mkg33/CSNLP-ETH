That vif1.0 is the virtual interface of the guest.  Now the guest will be able to ping the gateway and communicate just as if it were directly attached to your network with a bit of cable.
This is saying, "give this VM a virtual interface and add it to the br0 bridge, and give it the following mac".
This will create a new bridge when the network stack is started (such as at boot), and added your interface to it, and given the bridge the IP address of the host.  Here you can see the bridge:
It helps to picture each of the VMs and the host with their own interfaces, however only the host has a physical cable coming out of it, so the guest VM interfaces need to be bridged to the host interface.
Note that setting a MAC address here isn't needed, but I prefer it so that I can use DHCP to allocate a static IP address to the guests - that way I don't need to hard code any IP addresses other than the host (and the DHCP server, which in my case is a VM itself).
I have tried multiple things with bridging and, to be honest, I'm kinda losing hope of finding a solution on my own. How would I be able to get Xen to use one specifc IP for each of the domains?
The IP addresses for each of the VMs should be configured in the VM themselves, rather than the host machine.
I have a server which has a number of IPs assigned to it. I would like to set it up as a Xen hypervisor so that each VM has its own dedicated IP. The way I have my multiple IPs setup right now is:
