Please try to run OVPN GIU as administrator. My OVPN connection is marked as public network in Windows 7. And it works fine.
For example EA was stupid enough to program Origin in a way that only checks for that network flag in windows to see if it is online.
I had this issue before. And initially I believed Windows is blocking the access because it treats OVPN network as a public network. But I was wrong. The only issue was missing route.
It looks like the way openvpn sets up the network interface on Windows-7, Windows forces it to be public.
For Windows 7 network types, the secret lies in the GATEWAY entry. Any network you connect on that doesn't have a DEFAULT GATEWAY provided with, becomes PUBLIC and you cannot change it's type.
I suspect this is really simple and obvious, but I've clicked through every link I can find in those control panel dialogs and nothing works. It feels kind-of like playing Myst.
I'm torturing myself with the task of trying to get an OpenVPN connection to a work subnet working under Windows 7.  After some travail I've gotten the OpenVPN client to work and properly connect. However, though the connection is apparently up, Windows considers the network a "public network" and won't let me browse it.  It tells me that I need to change the networks profile (or something) to "Home" or "Work".  The problem is that I have no idea how to do that, and I see no obvious place in the Network control dialog(s) to do that.
you have to use the run as administrator with open vpn for it to write the proper routes to windows if not it will not route the traffic properly. 
Usually OVPN server pushes a route command into a client. If you run OVPN GUI as a user (it does it by default) you will see you OVPN client connected but it will not be able communicate with the remote network because OVPN client was unable to modify your routing table.
