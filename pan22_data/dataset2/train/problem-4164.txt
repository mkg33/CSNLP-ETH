One thing to keep in mind is that there is a minimum length for copper wires, go under that and you'll start seeing more cross-talk, causing lower performance. There may be a lower length for optical fibres as well, but these days the optics in SFPs and GBICs tend to be able to take a fair bit of over-light without too much of a problem.
No attenuators needed on multimode and any performance difference is on the order of fractions of a microsecond, which is well below the tolerance level even for tightly coupled HPC.  
Technically there's increased latency by running Cat5/6 wire vs Fiber or direct Copper GBICs. But the latency is in the order of microseconds and unless you're running a HPC isn't usually worth mentioning.
We have 7 switches in one rack that are all connected to each other via SFP mini GBIC fiber connections running at 1GBps. 
I know fiber provides benefits in terms of extending the distance that cables can be run between switches but since the switches are right next to each other is there any difference in performance or other reasons why I would want to use fiber to connect these switches instead of cat 5e with a 1 GBps Ethernet connection?
