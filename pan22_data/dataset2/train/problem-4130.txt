I don't know if VMWare is required for you and I don't like to promote software without permission but I find VMWare to be anything but usable for me.
I'll retract my answer if I'm just outright wrong, but if you're starting with an (installation) .ISO for the O/S (Ubuntu in your case) I think you want to run VMWare Server, not Player.  VMware Server is also free.  My understanding is that Player is for running existing VMs, not typically for creating new ones.
I've also used Virtualbox and setup Ubuntu by mounting the image and running the install, but downloading a pre-made VM is much faster and I've found VMWare Player to be more stable than VirtualBox and faster to save state on exits.
Sun VBox makes it easy to mount/unmount .iso images to your virtual machine just by a drop-down menu.
ok, I have downloaded a linux .iso and the VMWare player, but I'm missing a VM file to allow me to run the OS in the VM - how do I create this file, or where do i get one from?
I got an Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop VM from http://linhost.info/vmware/ . Download, unzip using 7-zip (free download), create a user account and delete the default user. 
Basically you use a pre-used file and then hack it a bit.  The instructions are very clear in that post.
