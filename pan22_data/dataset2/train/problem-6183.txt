If you do it correctly and securely there are no real downsides to that besides having one more user and group in the system, which doesn't really matter. However, if that user was being used for administrative access to the daemon, then in the case if somebody unauthorized were to gain access to the user it'd be a problem - however, this is the case for anything else, especially the root account, so it's not any different than that.
How to do it correctly depends on the Linux distro you're using. If you're using Debian-based distros (with Debian apt package manager) I can provide you with the following:

And as I said, it all depends on the daemon. If you believe there is a use for that user - for administrative access, management, or something else - then yes. Otherwise if you can't find any use for such an user - just don't make one, it's not neccessary.
Yes, it is, and it's not just for security. Many daemons have wide range of functionality and that includes having its own user for administrative purposes - for example postgres.
