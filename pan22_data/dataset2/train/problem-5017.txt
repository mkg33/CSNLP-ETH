I do not have made a Debian repository before so I can give only some pointers. Here I have fond an entry for a Debian Repository Setup. You also can google for "how to make a debian repository".
Raspbian is a derivate from Debian and it also uses Debians infrastructure. As far as I understand you want to setup your own package repository like that one used by Raspbian and Debian. First of all: the used repositories are configured in /etc/apt/sources.list and in files in directory /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. On Raspbian there are two files by default:
Relativity new to Raspberry Pi and Linux in general, but essentially I'm trying to create an update repository for my Raspberry Pis via a separate Linux server, how would I go about doing this? On the Raspberry Pi website I've only seen so far that it allows me to download the entirety of Raspbian when I just need the update files in order to push updates out to my other Pis. Hope this questions makes sense and thanks in advance for the assist!
The former repository is mainly the Debian repository http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ just compiled for armhf. The latter repository is from the Raspberry Pi Foundation and contains specific software to run the Raspberry Pi hardware, e.g. the kernel, firmware and drivers. This could be an example for your setup.
On the assumption that you're trying to save bandwidth, whilst updating several Pis, then apt-cacher-ng may be what you're looking for.  It's quite simple to set up:
Now if you install something with apt on one of the clients the package and dependencies will be cached on the server, so when you install the same package on client 2 it will download from the server instead of the online repo.  
You can browse the repositories with http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/ and with http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/
