As far as your request for failover / firewall configuration goes there are a lot of options. Pretty much any product will handle a manual failover as long as you have access to the building to make the change from the inside. 
Use one of sets of CAT6 for connecting to each switch. Keep the second in reserve in case of a failure. Keep a spare switch on site if possible.
I would personally go with both a switch and a router on the IT floor, allowing separate subnets for each floor. The router isn't strictly required but it allows more room for future growth. Untangling subnets that have static IPs thrown in when you are growing is not fun.. Since you have a clean slate this would be a good time. 
Product recommendations are a bit out of scope but I will share a couple additional thoughts - Cisco and Juniper make good networking equipment, both routers and switches. HP and Dell make decent lower cost switches but there can be some compatibility problems in the way they detect network loops. I don't have much love for the Cisco ASA series of firewalls. SonicWalls, Forefront and the various Linux derived firewalls have treated me well.
