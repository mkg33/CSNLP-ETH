I created a worksheet/spreadsheet with functions and references to cells in other worksheets/spreadsheets within same workbook to create a report of other worksheets within the same workbook.
2) Now copy the sheet to where you want it. Excel does not recognise your formulas as formulas since they are now just text entries
I have lots of workbooks/spreadsheets on which I have to copy this worksheet lots of workbook, but I when I   copy the worksheet to another workbook, excel create references to the workbook where I copied from.
1) "break" the worksheet - do a find/replace across the whole sheet for "=" and replace with something that you know you have not used anywhere ever. "##" might be a good option.
Your question is vague.  Relative/absolute cell copying does generally perform as you describe.  When you create a formula in excel, by default it is relative.
3) un-break it using find/replace to restore the = signs. As long as your formulas refer to worksheet names which actually exist in this target workbook, you should be fine.
