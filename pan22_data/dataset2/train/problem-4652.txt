An easy solution, that does not involve your pi coming into contact with mains voltages, is to grab a cheap wirelessly controlled power outlet like this and then attach your Pi to a 433Mhz radio transmitter.  You will find several sites online that walk you through this process.
I'm trying to switch the light with my Raspberry PI. I've seen some guides on the web, suggesting I'd need a relay. However I'm very bad at electronics and creating circuits. So can somebody give me a list of items I'd need.
The Kankun Smart Wifi Plug Socket is a wifi access point that actually runs a ssh server so you could control it that way. 
Usually, you will cut one wire coming from the power and pass it to COM of relay, after that, grab the other side of the wire and put it on NO or NC. Applying or removing V on the correct pad (usually labeled as INx on modules) it will change the state of the relay, thus, changing the "state" of the thing connected through it.
Yes please avoid messing with mains voltage especially if you are not confident. That said there are still nerdy ways to accomplish this. 
Another solution is this computer-controlled outlet from AdaFruit, which is designed to hook directly to the GPIO pins on your Pi.
As some other users said, is not a good option to mess with that voltage if you don't know what you're doing. Although, if you want to take a look, this is a common schematic of a relay controlled unit:
Relays have three pins: COM, NO, NC standing for Common, Normally Open and Normally Closed. It will depend on how you want to interface with the relay or relay module, you'll need to change your wiring.
