Which allows you to combine multiple rows of the same column into a single "cell" using concatenation.  This is explained in great detail via this Stack Overflow Question.
And you are looking to combine all these rows into just the NON-Null values for each column.  Something like:
For the purpose of the examples I will show below I have created the below table.  (For the sake of cleanup ease on my side I am using Table Variables instead of a physical/temp table.)
This approach allows you to get more than just a single value for that row.  (Say there was some additional 5th column and you wanted that value from the "Request" row.  You can just add a Req.[ColumnName] in the SELECT).  This does have a possibility for returning multiple rows per ID = 1 AND [Status] = 'Approved' combination, if there are more than one row with ID = 1 AND Request IS NOT NULL OR ID = 1 and Approved IS NOT NULL.
We are simply running a second and third select, selecting a single value (the TOP (1) to avoid an error where a subquery returns more than one result), and having that display as the result for that column.  The benefit of this option is it guarantees that we only get one row per instance of something in the table WHERE ID = 1 AND [Status] = 'Approved'.
