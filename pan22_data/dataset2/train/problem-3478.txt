a more modern alternative to screen, alas not available to some types of "virtualisation" (e.g. in cygwin you can have "screen", but not "tmux" due to the way it's designed), but wherever you have the option to install tmux, I'd strongly recommend to go for that one insted of screen.
While screen will keep your shell session open on the remote server if your ssh session drops, it won't do anything about the problem of ssh connections being dropped.  As zero_r suggests, try tuning your ssh connection with keep alives and long timeouts.
I'd install and start screen to fix your problem. Screen will let you reconnect to a previous screen session. 
I suggest you track down the cause of the lost packets causing the problems and fix that instead of working around it.
As others have pointed out, screen is generally the best solution for this and it adds a host of other useful features too.
Apart from that, screen also let's you do cool things like split your screen, view the console etc. You can find more info here and here.
See http://tlug.dnho.net/?q=node/239 (or search Google for many other examples dones slightly different ways).
Try to set ClientAliveInterval (e.g. 60) and TCPKeepAlive (yes or no) to appropriate values on the serverside sshd.conf .
You can setup your profile on the remote machine to automatically start and/or reconnect to screen on login, which saves you forgetting to start screen the one time you need it because you suffer a connection drop.
