If you are debating whether it is worth it to upgrading to managed switches, here are some criteria:
One additional thing: Most managed switches allow some form of port binding (so that you can use multiple NICs in a device to effectively multiply the bandwidth to the switch. Also, VLAN support is often not found on unmanaged switches, but are common on managed ones.
Managed switches normally have settings that can be modified remotely. This might include turning ports on or off, managing port speeds, throttling, segmenting and more.
Unmanaged switches have a set behavior that works from the time they're powered on until they're powered off.
Managed switches support Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) via embedded agents and have a command line interface (CLI) that can be accessed via serial console, Telnet, and Secure Shell. These switches can often be configured and managed as groups. More recent managed switches may also support a Web interface for management through a Web browser. 
Unmanaged switches are basic plug-and-play switches with no remote configuration, management, or monitoring options, although many can be locally monitored and configured via LED indicators and DIP switches. These inexpensive switches are typically used in small networks or to add temporary workgroups to larger networks.
I've seen some documentation discussing the use of an unmanaged switch. What is the difference in functionality/performance/etc. between an unmanaged and managed switch?
