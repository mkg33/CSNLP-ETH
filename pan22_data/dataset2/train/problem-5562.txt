Also try getting latest drivers from the AMD/ATi site rather than from Dell. the Dell ones are usually just OEM branded anyway.
Optiplex 790 Machines will only use the built-in graphics card or an expansion card but not both. You first need to go into the BIOS and disable the integrated graphics. This will allow the BIOS to recognize the card. Bear in mind that because the BIOS was programmed this way on purpose, you cannot run both at once.
if that still fails, go into your display properties and look for dual monitor settings and see if it's showing up as a second disabled monitor that needs enabling.
first, try re-booting with JUST the DVI connected. it may be that defaulting to VGA as primary is causing you problems.
Two quick notes. If you plug a video card into a PCI slot, the BIOS will automatically disable the onboard VGA adapter. Also, if your Optiplex 790 came with two ATI graphic cards, and you can only get a display on one of them, go into the ATI Catalist Control Center and disable crossfire. Then go into your display settings and redetect your display. BaddaBoom, problem solved.
