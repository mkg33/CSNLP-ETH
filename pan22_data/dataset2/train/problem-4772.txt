Disable the automatic reconnecting of the network drives and use net use to reconnect the drives when you need them.
Im running Win7 Pro in bootcamp on a Macbook Pro with an SSD and 16gb RAM but am getting a horribly slow boot time including a black screen (with usable mouse) for a long period before desktop shows. I'm not in a position to do a reinstall but would like to get the issue resolved if possible.
I've spent the last few days trawling the net trying to find a solution to the very slow win7 boot but have come up with nothing so far.
I should mention that I'm very new to this kind of troubleshooting but would appreciate any help I can get!
So far I've done all the clean boot stuff eg disabling startup items and services and I've checked event viewer to see are there any problems and I can't see anything significant other than the fact that each boot entry (100) has a level 'Error' but I can't see what that error is. I've also used process monitor to see what is taking so long and there are a couple of processes that take a long time and show a result of 'CANCELLED', one being svchost.exe 110secs (path: ...system32\drivers\etc) and the other Explorer.exe 23secs (path: ...appdata\roaming\microsoft\systemcertificates\my)
I had a similar problem (dual boot OSX, win7 on macbook, very long delay before Win7 started loading after selection in rEFIt). 
The largest delay occurs because Windows displays the Welcome Screen and hangs while restoring the network connections:
