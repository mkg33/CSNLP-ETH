Notepad++ does this. Simply copy & paste the part of the message you want to size up into a new tab and read the length off the length field in the status bar at the bottom:
If you are sending your email as Rich Text or HTML then there is no easy formula. In general the longer and the more complicated the formatting of the text is, the larger it will be in bytes.
If you set the encoding to match your email client (Encoding menu -> UTF-8), it will count Unicode characters correctly (for example, â˜ƒ is 3 bytes long in UTF-8 encoding).
Drag the message from your email client to the desktop and open the resulting file (probably .EML) in a text editor that supports different encodings and shows the size of the data (eg Notepad2). Then you can simply cut the message before and after to see the actual size of the desired block (in the status bar for Notepad2).
If you are sending your email as plain text then the number of bytes will be roughly equal to the number of characters in the selected text. If you paste the text into Microsoft Word it will be able to do a letter count for you to help.
