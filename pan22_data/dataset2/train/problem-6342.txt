Does the computer work "acceptably" when you're in the windows environment (web browser, browsing computer content, viewing documents - in word, office-like activities), and problems start only when playing games?
Beyond that, if you don't see the improvement you're looking for, keep the Task Manager open while you go about using the computer. If you notice it being slow try to identify which process is causing issues by ordering them by CPU and Memory.
There are a few things that can be done. Here's the process for clearing startup items. If you've never done this before you could potentially have dozens launching with your OS.
I'm not the best computer expert but I would say your Processor isn't the best for a game like skyrim. Also Runescape and LoL may be laggy if your internet is bad. I would suggest checking background programs too that may be slowing your computer down.
If you suspect malware you should ensure your antivirus definitions are up to date. See your AV software documentation (google) for instructions. If you use Norton because it came with the system I recommend tossing it and grabbing Comodo Internet Security. It's free and works well. Spybot is still good, and I always recomend Malwarebytes.
Note: If you have any questions about the items in the startup list, or on the processes tab, you can Google them. If you come across any that are just random letters, they're likely malware.
