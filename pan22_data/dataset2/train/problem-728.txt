If you're using ActiveSync (aka Push), Gmail will use the the name and primary e-mail address you can set here: https://www.google.com/accounts/EditUserInfo
Is there anyway to change this Reply To setting?  I know I have done this with many blackberries.  It is just an option under Blackberry Internet Service.  Does iPhone have this option some where and I just do not see it?
There's no option for something like this. The built-in Mail app doesn't have a lot of customization options, unfortunately.
If you're using IMAP to access your Gmail account from your iPhone, your From: address can be set in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > [Name of your Gmail account] in the Name and Address fields.
My work uses Microsoft Exchange.  I can not receive this mail on my iPhone because my exchange account slot is being taken up by my Google Sync account.  I can't seem to get IMAP or POP to work for the life of me.  
I have resorted to simply forwarding my work email to a gmail work account I created.  The only problem I have is when I reply to emails that come to my gmail work account the recipients see my @gmail email instead of my @work email.
