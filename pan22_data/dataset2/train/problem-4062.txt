"Virtual memory is simulated RAM. When you have used up all your RAM, your computer will shift data to an empty space on the hard drive." -delete-computer-history
"Virtual memory is a technique that allows the execution of processes which are not completely available in memory" -tutorialspoint
The second is describing how a processor decides which part of memory (normally actual physical memory) to access for each program running on a system.  It could be decribed better as virtual memory addressing.  This way each program running on the machine can think it has it's own dedicated memory block, starting at address 00000 but in actual fact the memory blocks are actually spread across the physical memory.  Try looking up memory addressing, pointers
The first is describing how the system copes with not having enough physical memory by swapping some of the information back and forth between physical memory and a disc drive.  This is hidden from the running programs by the operating system and makes the physical memory appear larger than it actually is.  Try looking up RAM swap files
It seems that there are two definitions of virtual memory, and I'm wondering do they both describe the same thing or is it that two similar but distinct concepts are called the same thing? 
and virtual memory is what's responsible for giving a program it's own address space, so it can assume it's beginning is at address 0x00
"Virtual memory is a feature of an operating system (OS) that allows a computer to compensate for shortages of physical memory" -techtarget
"virtual memory is a memory management technique ...It maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory." -wikipedia
