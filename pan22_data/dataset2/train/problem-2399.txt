Have only one class directly interact with your database. It doesn't make sense for your admin class and it definitely doesn't make sense for your index.php to be executing PDO methods.  Think of what a nightmare it would be if you decided to change database drivers to MySQLi or the next greatest thing? You would have to go into all your classes and even your regular scripts to make adjustments! A much better approach is to interact with the DB only from your database class.  Put the generic runQuery there.
As much as you can, avoid writing queries in your general scripts (such as index.php). Instead, craft them within methods that live in the class you want info from; methods such as getAdmin() and updateAdmin() would make sense.  The reasoning is the same as for my last advice; if in the future you decide to change your DB table structure, or use a different storage mechanism altogether (not MySQL), it would really suck to have to go into all your scripts to change your queries. It would be much easier if your queries are concentrated in a few methods
