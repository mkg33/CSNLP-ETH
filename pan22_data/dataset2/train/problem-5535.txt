We use replication across datacenters in several European countries (so they aren't across the world from each other, but they are certainly not local) and it works without any problem.
I would suggest that you ensure that you are replicating over SSL (i.e. set the replication user to require a SSL connection).
Replication will automatically restart if possible.  If there is a problem with a query (e.g. a database is present on the master and not the slave, and a query uses it), then it will require manual correction by default (but you can set it to ignore such errors).  If the databases are exact mirrors, then you should never need to manually restart replication.
If you have two servers and the master disappears, then to turn the slave into the 'master', just stop replication and alter your code (to write to the new 'master').  If you have three or more servers and the master disappears, then stop replication on the slaves, change them to use the new master, and start again.  If they aren't exactly in sync (depends how much data is being transferred, how busy the servers are, how good the network connection is, etc), then you might have to do more work than that.  The replication section of the MySQL documentation covers this in more detail.
