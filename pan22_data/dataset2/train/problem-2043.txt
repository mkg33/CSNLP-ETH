Preventing silent data corruption is actually a job of the file system, not a backup software (well, not primarily). Modern file systems like ZFS and btrfs (see https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/) will automatically detect and (if possible) prevent data corruption. Apples new AFS filesystem used in iOS, tvOS and watchOS does this but for metadata only; btrfs will actively search for data corruption (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs#Checksum_tree_and_scrubbing) and repair if possible.
There are several programs capable of incremental backup.  Each backup is in a separate folder and consists of only the files that changed since the last incremental backup.  So if the latest version of the file is corrupted just keep going back in time until you find a non-corrupted version.  Mac's Time Machine does incremental backups.
Undoing user data corruption (deleting the wrong paragraph in a text file) however is the job of a backup software. How long you want to be able to undo editing mistakes is your decision.
What if a file becomes corrupted on my computer (e.g. a random photo or something), then I accidentally backup the corrupted file, thereby overwriting my nice backup! By the time I notice the file's corrupted, the corrupted version has already propagated into my backup and so I don't have a backup version to restore from.
