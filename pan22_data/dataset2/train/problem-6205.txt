Assuming all of your "sensor" tables are the same structure then I would think the easiest way would be to construct a view that does a bunch of unions.
Again that does assume that all of your "sensor" tables have the same structure.  This way you have a single view you can run your queries against.
One way would be to use a cursor and dynamic sql. Granted the solution below would need to be modified to accommodate your actual data, especially if the number of columns is variable, but for the example you gave it does work.
I can search for my desired sensors with this query, which returns the table name and columns containing the readings:
I have a database that was provided by one of our vendors that I am trying to tie into another system, but I have never come across something designed this way.
Is there a way to get the readings in one request to the sql-server? I can't figure out how to do it with the dynamic table names that may change depending on the name of the sensor I search for.
I want to search for "sensors" named x, and get their readings as the result. There is one main "Xref" table, and then about 500 other tables that contain the sensor readings.
