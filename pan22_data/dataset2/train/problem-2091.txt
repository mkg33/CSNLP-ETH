This would reduce the screen resolution two steps.  Use more "down" steps at the end to reduce it all the way to the minimum.  Again, this is for XP, test on Vista (in Safe Mode) before trying this.
Since the display settings won't stick in safe mode, download NirCmd in safe mode and add a batch startup script to change the resolution:
You could also boot into Safe Mode and change the video driver to "VGA" instead of whatever accelerated driver you're using.  After you reboot into normal mode, reinstall the real driver and set whatever resolution you like.
Your OS is trying to force the TV to use a refresh rate/resolution it can't support. You have to check your TV manual. It will list the supported combination. Contrary to a monitor, depending on your TV set, you may not have many choices here.
In Windows Vista Home Basic 32bit, the easiest solution is just to go to Control Panel, and in the menu that the option to change the resolution is for you. Then, you need to go to More display modes of something simiral, search the tabs and find the option:Display all modes. When you press that button, a message will pop up saying that it will now show all modes and those that the monitor doesn't show properly. Ignore that and press OK. Then, when you try to change the resolution, it will let you choose more than 2. In my case it showed me 4 modes in 32bit and the maximum was 1600x1200. Hope it works!
The refresh rate will be almost certainly 60 Hz. The resolution is entirely dependent on the TV screen size. Meanwhile if your video card has settings for TV display you should use those instead of setting anything from within Windows normal resolution dialog box.
