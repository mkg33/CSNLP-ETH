I believe that the answer to this question bears on the "file giveaway" security issues that have resulted in most modern Unix-like OSes not permitting "file giveaway".  "File giveaway" is when a non-superuser user changes the ownership of a file to someone other than that user.  This capability provides many opportunities for mischief.
Security by default is quite usefull, but if you dont make it an option, you are just creating a winghtmare.
According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid#setuid_and_setgid_on_directories the setuid bit is ignored for directories on both UNIX and Linux systems.  Its possible to make it act as you expect on FreeBSD however.
I can think on quite a few scenaries with sftp-only that it would save me a lot of trouble, both with acl's and the acl-mask-set that sshd does, and the reset that i must do to that mask.
On Linux systems, you can successfully chmod u+s $some_directory, but instead of forcing the ownership of new subdirectories and files to be the owner of the containing directory (and setting subdirectories u+s as well) as you might expect, the system just ignores the setuid bit. Subdirectories and files continue to inherit the UIDs of their creating processes, and subdirectories are not setuid by default.
Since file giveaways are not permitted, setuid on directories, which would perform the same function in another form, is not permitted, or ignored if set.
