We're running an increasing number of VMs rather than buying new kit where computational requirements allow.
Used virtualisation to help get rid of over 8,000 physical servers, allowing for the closure of 3 data centres.
This has nothing to do with being green and everything to do with saving money as far as I can tell :)
I developed freelance a few applications web oriented that removed all the papers previously required, for signature and approval.
For my part, I've made a pledge to not use styrofoam cups for my coffee and to only smoke in the designated smoking areas of my building.
Currently replacing all old CRT monitors with new, low-energy TFT monitors. Studies have shown greatly diminished power consumption.
Hmm... this question smacks of socio-political undertones. Not everyone buys into the green movement. Are sysadmins who aren't "green" not good?
We're introducing wake-on-LAN for our Campus Grid (distributed computing system that runs on the student PC clusters on campus) so the machines only run overnight when there are computational jobs pending rather than being on 24/7
