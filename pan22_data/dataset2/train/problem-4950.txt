I have a TL-WN725N v2 WiFi adapter and I can't get it working on Raspberry Pi running Arch Linux. Linux kernel version is 3.18.5-1-ARCH #1.
Some time ago, to make this adapter working, it was necessary to compile driver for every kernel version. Now I found that not so long ago the driver was included into kernel. I have tested it on Raspbian and it works. However I can't say the same about Arch Linux.  
But I found that the curl command for that Dropbox content not working nowadays. Since they removes that from Dropbox. But I saved this file on my Google drive. I don't know is it working however I am sharing TP-link driver software.
For others, who stumbled on this question, try this https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=192404.
However wlan0 is listed here. If I try ip link set wlan0 up it says IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready .
Inside the /etc/modules file add r8188eu (also add ipv6 if needed in the same file) and then reboot. This might do make the module available for the WLAN dongle and making the link ready for usage.
This might also come in handy when using USB Dongles with certain drivers, where making the module available on during boot process can help set up the link for wlan0. I tried this, however on Raspbian Jessie with a LogiLink WL0145N WLAN which also has the r8188eu driver on it.
However, today I just reflashed my SD Card with Raspbian Stretch and the old WiFi dongle worked out of the box: no config required at all.
I have an old model B and had all the problems with the TP-Link 725N and the RTL8188 drivers years ago. I got the same problem when I updated.
I am also using this Wi-Fi adapter. I have some problems with this Wi-Fi adapter on my Raspbian Wheezy. After installing the TP-Link drivers on my Raspbian wheezy it become working. But on Raspbian Jessie we do not want to install TP-Link drivers. However we can use following commands to install driver software:
