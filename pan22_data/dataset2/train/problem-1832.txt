Definitely not. You are writing portable, reusable UDFs which take a range as a parameter. Using a global variable just ties you down with no flexibility.
This is an 'it depends' answer. For speed, writing your own routines will generally be faster. However, some of the more complex functions, using the built in worksheet function may be easier. Trade off against your own requirements, just remember that every switch to the Excel model costs.
I don't know - I hope they are otherwise this post is off-topic and I am wasting my time on this response! However, you can derive tests to ensure your own correctness.
I was going to use a Collection instead of an expanding array - but turns out not necessary in this case. However, for the more complex formulae, consider using a Collection instead of an array, or try to resize the array only once at the beginning. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/56842847/9101981
You don't use ws (yes, you have a With statement, but how the code is written, that With is not used. Nor is it needed!
Leaving the function return type as Variant is deliberate, it means that you can control what is returned and use the in-built error types to indicate to your user any issues. It also means that if you link the results cell to any other cell, Excel knows how to handle chained errors. Excel might misinterpret a random string ("error") potentially hiding issues from the user if you didn't use the built in types.
