First I'd like to start with for example a CPU of 1 GHz. The second test would be with 2 GHz. When we know the limits (number of concurrent clients) of 1 Ghz and 2 Ghz, we can see how it scales on the hardware (is it lineair with the CPU etc.).
In ESXi and Virtualbox you can modify numbers of cpus. So in some way you can do this but its  not excacly what you want. There was something like  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed you could change vaules of cpu frequency by editing only this file but i think that it's no longer supported option (it is not supperted on my Fedora 16)
I need to run some stresstests on a new long polling technology we're using. To know what the capabilities are, I'd like to run 2 (or maybe more) tests on a VM.
In fedora repo there is something like cpufrequtils that contains several utilities that can be used to control the cpufreq interface provided by the kernel on hardware that supports CPU frequency scaling. You could try that.
Is it possible to increase/decrease the CPU frequency of a VM in a fast/easy way without physically changing the hardware? I think this should be possible, because many VPS providers allow their clients to dynamically scale their VPS.
