Another handy addition in Path Finder which may be what you're looking for as far as "directory history" goes, is that when you option-click the back/forward history arrows, you get a dropdown menu which shows the paths that you have been browsing.
The two arrow buttons on the toolbar go backwards and forwards through your directory browsing history in that Finder Window.
The sidebar can be used to easily drag folders or smart folders to save as "bookmarks" for quick access.
Although not (yet) providing all the functionality you seek, and not primarily a Norton Commander clone, TotalFinder is an interesting concept that extends the existing Finder with additional functionality. Most useful is the system-wide keyboard shortcut to pull up a finder window. It also seems it will provide better keyboard shortcuts in the future.
If you're looking for something a little more "beefy" than the Finder, take a look at Path Finder. It has browser-style bookmarks, a very handy "drop stack" which helps for gathering files to move/copy to another location, dual pane file browsing, built-in command line, and more.
