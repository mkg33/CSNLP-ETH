Is it possible or likely that the earlier "kmod" issue is related to the subsequent keyboard/mouse problem?  What might the resolution for that be?  (What is a moddep file?)
Do the messages relating to /dev/input/event* indicate why the keyboard and mouse don't respond in the GUI?
If fixing this requires interacting with the system, how can I prevent the system from launching the GUI on boot?
We have a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B using Raspbian installed from/on NOOBS card.  The GUI desktop was fully functional for several days.
and another instance of the same "Error opening '/dev/input/event*'..." a few lines later, after entering runlevel 2.
If I press Shift immediately after power-up, I can get into the NOOBS pre-boot screen.  On that screen the keyboard and mouse work just fine.  If I let it begin booting Raspbian I can pause and resume the boot process (pause and resume message display) using Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q.
Ones from usb 1-1.2 and usb 1-1.3 reporting that it detected the mouse and the keyboard as new USB devices, apparently without issue.
