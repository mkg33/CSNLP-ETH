My company restricted the network speed by IP as 200K. That mean my maximum download speed is 200K per second. However, since the restriction is IP based, I can install a virtual machine and set its network mode as bridged. Then I can download at the speed of 200K in the guest and host at the same time (for different files). Now my question is, I can add multiple virtualized network card to my virtual machine, but how can I actually get the maximum speed? It seems that just add those network cards is not enough (I still got 200K).
If the IP address is truly the factor by how they are limiting traffic, then your physical machine and VM should each be able to download up to 200Kbps/sec.
No, you cannot "combine" your VM NIC and real NIC to get 400Kbps/sec.  TCP doesn't work with multiple simultaneous endpoints and a single connection must live on a single NIC for its duration.  A protocol using UDP or plain IP could but that intelligence would have to be built into the protocol AND used by both sides (client and server), and there is no common protocol in use that does that.
If I'm not mistaken, bridging will have the effect that your system responds to incoming traffic from two MAC addresses.  So it will get two IPs via DHCP (one for your physical system, another for your VM).
In Ethernet/TCP/IP, the MAC address is the only standard way to uniquely identify hardware from a remote end, and things like ARP, etc. completely depend on the answerer to be honest with the MAC address.
