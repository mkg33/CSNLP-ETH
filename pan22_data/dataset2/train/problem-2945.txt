Does anyone have any ideas at all how to register a new file type IN WINDOWS 10??  The instructions I have found do not match the registry keys I can see on Win 10.
To associate a custom-built app to the file, put a shortcut for the app on your desktop, then browse to the desktop when you use "Look for another app on this PC."
Create a file on desktop, it can be left as new text document, change the extenson to anything. Eg (.my,) Now right click on the file U wish to change to NO ASSOCIATION choose properties, then change then more apps scroll down to choselook for another app, Click desktop in left menuthen change the box above open to All Files(,) then pick the text document U created from above list & click open. The file U created on desktop can be deleted leaving the file U want no longer associated to anything
This is because the .mus file type does not appear on the list of file extensions, AND (even though the application is associated with other file types) the application does not appear on the list of applications when trying to do this by application, rather than by file type.
This is driving me nuts.  Right-clicking on such a file and choosing "Open With" will show the correct application, but it does NOT contain a check box for "Always use this..."  Instead, "open with" has opened some (IMHO) piece of junk called "File Association Helper" that Winzip decided I could not live without.  It has a "Never ask a about this file type" checkbox WHICH DOES NOT WORK.
I just want to be able to double-click on a .mus file and have the correct application open it.  This should not require wading knee-deep in the registry in order to fix this.
