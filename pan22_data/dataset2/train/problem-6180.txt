I ended up getting a cooling pad and that makes a big difference and got new rubber feet that cause it to be slightly more raised up.  Again, not quite ideal, I really would love to see it run like it did on day-1, but it's sufficient for now I suppose.
Here's one answer: When the laptop is hot, remove the back cover while its running. If the laptop begins cooling down. Look at the intake vents for the fan in the cover. You will probably see they are not positioned directly over the fan. Drill holes in the back cover directly over the fan area and your laptop will be fixed. 
I also have a HP 8470p, which also has the intake vents away from the fan. This restricts airflow, especially if the laptop is sitting on something other than a hard flat surface.
I personally repaired an old pavilion years ago. It was constantly overheating. I drilled holes in the back cover above the fan area. It never overheated again. It is still in use with my grandson 10 years later. 
Once the heatsink/fan is removed from the CPU you should use cleaner to remove the old and put on the new stuff. Make sure you look for dust build up inside the fan.  Dust can become so plastered on compress air from the outside won't remove it.
So I went ahead and tried re-seating the heat sinks and it didn't make a significant difference.  I don't know what else I can try to get it running as cool as it did when I first bought it, or if it's even possible.  It seems like there is only a single fan in the laptop, so unless I pulled out the motherboard and found a dust build up or something, I can't think of anything else to try to make it run like it did.
Yes, get some thermal paste like artic silver 5.  Some of this http://www.arcticsilver.com/arcticlean.htm
