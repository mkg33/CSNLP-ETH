Now from your wireshark output we can see that your window size is relatively big and thus your transmissions are not throttled and you receive an ACK for every packet that you send (as it should be in the general case scenario where no ACK aggregation is used). Currently the mostly used maximum size for ethernet frames is 1500 bytes. If you remove all the headers you will see that the bytes that remain are actually the number by which your ACKs are increased.
The Window Size is used to prevent congestion at the receiver (as opposed to the congestion window that tries to prevent congestion in the network). 
The functionality of it is relatively simple: the receiver informs the sender about its window size, which usually represents the available buffer size. Therefore this number should be decreased every time a new packet arrives at the receiver and should be increased each time a packet is processed at the receiver. 
On the sender side, the sender tries to make sure that at any given time he/she does not have in transit more bytes than the last received advertised window and therefore lower the probability of flooding the receiver.
