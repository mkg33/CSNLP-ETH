Interesting side note - when running on the battery, the clock in not very accurate and the time can drift.
How does a CMOS battery store information on it? I know it stores information such as the time, date, passwords and drive configuration, but how? How can a battery store data?
The computer is alive even when it is not powered or off. Thanks to two button cell batteries, which are on every mother board. They keep the CMOS DATE/TIME RUNNING even when the PC is off. They last for a while.
CMOS is a battery not a storage it just maintain that there is an enough power to keep running the data storage in the chips.
The battery itself does not store the info. The battery is used to keep a small amount of memory (static ram to be exact) running so that the settings are not lost. Additionally, the battery keeps a clock running so that the time and date are correct when the computer is turned on again.
The battery itself doesn't store data. The CMOS battery (or BIOS battery) powers a CMOS that stores data for the computer itself which can be viewed on the BIOS. All of this is done through the motherboard.
