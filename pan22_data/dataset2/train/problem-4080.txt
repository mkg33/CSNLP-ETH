S.1: I left a shell open. Two seconds before I pressed a key without pressing enter. So, any input received works even without a line return.
Idle time is reset when a character is read from the terminal input. Blocked input doesn't update idle time even if it does affect the screen display. Applications may update under different rules. For example, I used write which reads input by line, so it only updated my idle time upon pressing enter. The same was true for perl (literally executed as perl with no arguments).
S.2: I ran while true; do echo "foo"; sleep 30; done. I even typed a character in the middle of it. Since the input was blocked (never read), I still appear idle there.
What constitutes "activity" for the purposes of the Unix "who" command? We're trying to find idle sessions but have disagreements as to the precise meaning of the activity in this context.  One person contends that the activity time is only reset by user input--that is, data coming into the session from standard input.  Others are saying any CPU activity.  An authoritative answer would be useful.
in one terminal, and open another terminal, you will see that idle time of that other session is reset to zero, only when user inputs something (presses a key). If you run:
