They depend on many things, like the quality of the media themselves. CD and DVD lifetime also depend on the speed of the writing (they don't like being written very fast). CDs usually last longer than DVDs. I heard somewhere that modern flash drives last for about 1 million writes.
Flash drives are limited by writes - most say that they can stand about 100,000 cycles, but this is harder to quantify due to tricks like wear leveling that the manufacturers build in.
Floppies/Zip drives and other floppy type media have lifespans defined either by how abrasive the read/write head is (keep your drive clean) and also by storage. They are especially susceptible to magnetism and mold/mildew issues.
Google labs did a study on Hard Drive failures found here. It goes in dept on rates and indicators. It seems SMART detection isn't as good as one would think.
Hard drives are more limited by obsolecence (MFM or RLL controllers anyone?) and by physical dropping.  They are very resistant to time, relatively to heat/cold...
CD/DVD and probably Blueray and other dye type media are susceptible to fading and exposure to bright light (say putting them on your dashboard) will cause them to erase.  Some other types are also susceptible to rotting where the metallic layer oxidizes.  They were originally said to have 100 year lifespans, then later 30 year, but it has been noticed that some rot after only a couple of years.
