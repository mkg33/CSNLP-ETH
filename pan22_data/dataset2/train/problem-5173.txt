As Zac67 points out, LLDP is widely supported by business network devices, but it is limited to the link. It uses a layer-2 multicast address which will not be forwarded beyond the interface.
I've heard a bit about DLEP and LLDP, but aside from understanding that LLDP is older, and DLEP has only recently achieved an RFC status, I couldn't find much more.
DLEP is used between a router and modem to help the router make better routing decisions. It is not really a device discovery protocol the way LLDP is. I know that some Cisco devices support DLEP, but the RFC was only posted a few months ago, so it will be a while before it is widely supported.
I haven't seen a device supporting DLEP yet. LLDP is widely supported but only works on the link level, so it would discover only directly connected devices. LLDP messages from devices behind (802.1D compliant) switches will not reach you. However, given access to the discovered devices you could use SNMP to query their LLDP database and work your way through the network.
Trying to compare the two protocols is really comparing apples and oranges. They are two separate protocols for two separate jobs.
What you're looking for may be ICMP Router Discovery Protocol for IPv4 and Neighbor Discovery Protocol for IPv6.
