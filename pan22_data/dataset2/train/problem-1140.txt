I encountered the same problem and resolved it by closing Thunderbird, killing the process in the Windows Task Manager (it didn't disappear on its own) and then re-starting Thunderbird. All is good again.
Well, sitting with Thunderbird closed for a few hours and starting it using the Profile Manager seems to have resolved the situation - I am no longer working offline. Starting Thunderbird via the profile manager is discussed here. I created an empty second profile, unchecked "Don't Ask on startup" and selected my original default profile.
I had the same problem and resolved disabling automatic offline mode detection which sometimes triggers when there are network problems:
I just had this problem too. It turned out to be an "unresponsive script" dialogue displayed just off the screen so I couldn't see it. Some things seemed to work in Thunderbird, so it appeared like it was running as normal, and the dialogue box was not modal, but other threads were - I guess - queued behind me responding to the dialogue.
