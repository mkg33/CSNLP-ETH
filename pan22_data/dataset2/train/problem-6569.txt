LAN 1 is not connected to the internet and is completely wired Ethernet. A single instance of GNS3 runs on a Windows 7 Enterprise host. The same host also runs a VMWare Ubuntu 10.0.04 guest. R1 is connected to the Microsoft Loopback adapter (C1), and R2 is connected to the normal Ethernet adapter (C3) as shown in the topology below. ipconfig shows that the Windows 7 host (running GNS3) has IP 10.10.10.167.  An nmap scan from this same host, with target set to its default gateway of 10.10.10.252 says that we have a Cisco router (but I don't have physical access to know what model it is). 
Also, your topology has the router directly connected to the cloud. You will want to use an Ethernet switch device between the router and the cloud.
I've set the  Gateway of last resort to 10.10.10.252 which is the actual default gateway for the real LAN which my GNS3 host is on. Still for both R1 and R2, the ping on 10.10.10.167 (the regular ethernet adapter of the GNS3 host) and the loopback adapter 169.254.230.131 has no success. Why can't R1 and R2 see my real LAN? What am I missing here?
I am building a lab environment for CCNA training, using GNS3. The GNS3 network is connected to a real network, let's call it LAN 1. 
And the second thing, why is R1 that is connected to MS loopback network having IP address from your LAN IP range (10.10.10.170/24)? This will not work for sure...
I actually have run into lots questions so far and (assuming this is not off-topic) plan to create a series of posts after this. 
If you really want to simulate the scenario where Ubuntu VM and R1 router are connected to one subnet (let us call it Subnet1), and R2 is connected to your regular (LAN) subnet, then follow next scenario:
The problem is that neither R1 nor R2 can ping the Windows 7 host (running GNS3)  10.10.10.167 as shown for R2 below (the console of R1 and R2 are basically the same).
