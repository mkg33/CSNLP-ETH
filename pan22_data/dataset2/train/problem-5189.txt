I'm dealing with java projects which often result in deeply nested folders (/path/to/project/com/java/lang/whatever, etc) and sometimes want to be able to jump, say, 4 directory levels upwards. Typing cd ../../../.. is a pain, and I don't want to symlink. Is there some flag to cd that lets you go up multiple directory levels (in my head, it would be something like cd -u 4)? Unfortunately I can't find any man page for cd specifically, instead just getting the useless "builtins" page.
Turns out the correct answer is 'cd +n', where n is the number of levels you want to go up. Too bad this isn't documented anywhere!
Got sick of this exact same problem and ended up writing cd-plus as a result. A single file CLI utility that lets you cd up multiple directories.
I tend to use pushd and popd quite a lot. I tend to use CDPATH to let me hop between project trees rather than subdirs in a project - but at the moment I'm working on a lot of small projects, not a few big projects. :)
Not exactly what you're asking for but you should look into pushd and popd. I find them much more useful for folder navigation than some cd... alias
Try the rarely used environment parameter CDPATH. Then you might not have to explicitly set the level.
If working on multiple projects, you can make the CDPATH setting into a project specific environment file. And trigger it with a shim for additional automation.
