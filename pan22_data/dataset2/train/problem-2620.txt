You can boot a liveCD with the hard disk disconnected to see if that device is a problem.  You can even stream and watch video off Ubuntu or Knoppix.
If the other soltuions don't work, I would check your memory as well... especially that it's seated properly, and clean.  Test the memory using Memtest86+.  Here is a simple guide on how to use memtest and clean the memory.    You also have to make sure that the memory is seated on the same channels as well.  This is an article on what the separate channels are.
One way to diagnose this is to remove as much hardware as possible (all but one RAM module if you have more than one, all but one disk drive (either CD/DVD or hard disk, drop down to the motherboard video chipset if any, etc.)  If this configuration is stable, add one more device (say the video card) and see if it's still stable.
If you have or can borrow spare parts, you can try swapping in, for instance, a different RAM module and a different video card (one at a time!) to see if those devices are the problem.
Look at the Window's "Event Viewer" and see if it logs any errors or malfunctions to be followed up with.
