It's really too early to tell from what you've described - not enough detailled information. There are those who say (probably correctly) that NoSQL systems can update rapidly - even more rapidly than RDBMS technology. However, that speed comes at a price (no SQL/poor indexing) - this is the ONE thing that people should realise about NoSQL. 
What you should also realise is that NoSQL represents a gamut of technologies, some of which may suit your use case, but an ordinary RDBMS may well be suitable also. You should perform some tests using both RDBMSs and NoSQL systems (or hire a consultant). Also, consider your own areas of expertise - maybe the devil you know is better than the one you don't? If you're comfortable with an RDBMS solution, maybe that will be more important than a 5% performance gain?
It does have use cases, but IMHO, a decently designed RDBMS can cope with most (the vast majority) of work given to them. Indeed, some of the reference users of NoSQL (e.g. Google) have been rowing back on its benefits and not using indexes and SQL. Take a look at Brian Aker's talk here - he was MySQL AB's chief architect.
