I use these for entertainment systems and monitors/projectors.  If you want to have backup power for your computer as well it may still make sense to get a larger UPS.  Either way it's always better from a wear and tear perspective to shell out a few extra bucks for the full sine wave equipment if your protecting expensive gear.
I see two types of UPS devices which differ on the output waveform - it's either a stepped approximation to a sinewave or a pure sinewave (rather expensive SmartUPS series). I've heard stories that some devices are intolerable to a non-pure sinewave and their power units just burn out for some reason.
Can anybody tell me whether it's a good idea to attach an expensive designer monitor to such a UPS with non-sine output or better grab a more expensive one which generates a pure sinewave?
I imagine you've already solved this but just for future reference, several manufacturers including Monster and APC make comparatively cost effective solutions that are what Max was referring to.  
The ones I typically use for LCD tv's, which can be quite sensitive to bad power run about $159CAD and will support up to 30A of 110V or 15A or 220V so they would be sufficient for your entire computer system including the monitor.  They won't give you the backup time but utilize the same technology and a large capacitor or small battery depending on the model.  The power is conditioned down to 12/24V then regulated and inverted to 110/220V within 2V and full sine wave.  These also condition out any ground noise which can actually be just as much of a problem.
I've got a quite expensive LCD monitor (~$1000) and I wish to protect it from instabilities in the power line. So I intend to get a UPS for it.
