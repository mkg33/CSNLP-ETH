The United Kingdom doesn't seem to be that bad. Can't really comment on the bureaucracy, but it doesn't seem overly onerous. Communications are getting better, especially in larger cities.
The US is slipping down the desirability scale on several of your points, but I wouldn't personally consider taking a startup anywhere else.
I regularly come to think of what would be the best place to create and run a small IT company say a start-up. By safe I mean:
Traditionally, "California" has been the answer to that question, which is one of the reasons Silicon Valley happened here.
Singapore meets most of your criteria.  I'm not sure about the patent lawsuits -- never heard of any but...  I've been here in Singapore for 5 years now, working in my 3rd start-up.  The government, via the EDB (economic development board) and other agencies has tried to make the country start-up friendly, though they are more focused on BioTech than silicon valley types.  Staffing is one concern, there are lots of entry level and mid-level technical people here at reasonable costs, but senior technical people are very hard to find, that's just not the typical career path.  But all-in-all; if you can stand the heat then Singapore is a great place to be.
Delaware in the US is the most common choice for start-ups, primarily due to it's advanced fair and effective corporation laws.
