I'm adding this here because it is high in the google results and I had a similar issue for a folder named NUL. Unfortunately the above fixes didnt help. Neither did a ton of other stuff I looked at.
Alternatively if you have Cygwin installed, you may want to know, that it has no problem with such files or folders. Particularly,
typed in the Cygwin terminal deletes the file or folder named nul or a folder, containing it. This is also applicable to other special file names such as CON, PRN, AUX, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8.
I tried rmdir\\?\C:\My\Path\NUL and  rmdir\\.\C:\My\Path\NUL without any success and also tried several commands using bash from my SourceTree installation. No joy.
In the end I used DIR /X /A from cmd to list the short names in the parent directory. This returned NUL~1 for my NUL folder.
NOTE: These screenshots show the removal of file nul.topo.json which is another file that I could not removed with a simple delete.
