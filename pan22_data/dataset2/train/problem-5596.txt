Looking at the docs online this should leave me with a unique text entries, but I get an error This range does not contain a valid query.
After lot of trials, I've found that the error is caused by the range selected is not the same as the range entered in the selection box:
Like @simlev had said, if you had choose cell A1:A3, in the selection box, you need also enter A1:A3, but if you had choose A2:A3, but in the selection box, you had enter A1:A3, that will cause the problem we had seen.
You get that error because you are not selecting the cell range. When in advanced filter, you have to write something like $Sheet1.$A$1:$A$256 in the top text box, or you can click the top-right button (shrink) and manually select the cells.
I tried to remove duplicate rows of the same column in LibreOffice by using Data->More Filters->Advanced Filter then selected the whole column and checked Options->No Duplications. 
Note that you can also use standard filter, checking No duplications and unchecking Range contains column label if you want to use also the first line.
