I have created a dev environment of my website... using VirtualBox... and now I need to make it accessible outside of my home office network.  I am using Virtualbox 4.1.18 installed on a Win7 desktop host.  The virtual machine is running CentOS 5.6.  My home office has a static ip.  I am using a Linksys router e4200.  The virtual machine is setup to use a bridged adapter.  My virtual machine can access the web.  My host pc can ping the virtual machine successfully.  Other PC's on my home network can successfully ping my host pc and the virtual machine.  I have given the virtual machine its own static IP on my network as well.
You need to go to your Router and set the virtual server to have the static IP; not your virtual host. 
How do I test if others outside my home office network can see this dev server?  Which ip address will point to the dev server in this scenario?
Alternatively, you could forward ports using Virtualbox (not sure how easy that is), but it's more work than just giving your CentOS box the static IP. The router doesn't really care that it's a virtual server, because you're using bridged networking. 
You will need to forward the ports to your virtual machine. If it's set to bridged, it should be sitting on your network just like any other physical machine would. From that point it's a matter of getting your router to direct incoming FTP and SSH traffic to your server using port forwarding.
