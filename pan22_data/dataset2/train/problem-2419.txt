It's annoying in this case because it's not a one-liner but for longer commands (like writing a bash script), it works great.
To solve your original problem, try using single quotes, rather than double quotes. With the latter, bash will attempt to expand certain characters before passing the result on to the command (echo in this case). With single quotes, bash passes the entire string, unchanged.
! is used in commands to refer to the command line history. See: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/abs-guide.html#HISTCOMMANDS for a full set. With the above example, bash is trying to expand !" as a reference to an event before echo gets a look in, hence the error. 
The only one I use on a regular basis, is !$. It expands to the last argument of the previous command. It's a useful shorthand in places. 
Can anyone please explain what is "bash events?" I've never heard this concept before. Also, how should I output "!" at the end of the sentence?
Note that in scripts, all of the history commands are disabled, as they only make sense in an interactive shell.
