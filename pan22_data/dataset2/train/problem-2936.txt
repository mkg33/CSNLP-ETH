Using VirtualBox, make sure you configure the network cards in "Bridged Mode" so that they appear as normal network cards to the router, as though you were plugging in a physical machine. Configure the DHCP server with a static address, set up your lease pools etc. then disable the DHCP on your router.
Yes that will work provided the DHCP server is connected to every network that you want to provide dynamic addresses to.
I have an internet cafe with A small setup of 5 computers with a generic ISP given router and many customer wireless devices. I need to create a small network. I'm wondering if I installed windows server 2012 with AD DHCP and DNS roles in virtual box and turned of the DHCP on the router, would I be able to configure the virtual server to give IP addresses to the other physical machines?
I would consider finding that old computer in the loft and installing Linux on it and configure a DHCP server on that. Although I admit this requires a bit more work, it's free and just as powerful.
Does this new network need to be isolated from the wireless customers? You could consider an all-in-one open-source router/dhcp server such as pfSense or Zentyal, then place that on the network in-between the router and your new network.
