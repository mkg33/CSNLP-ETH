It sounds like your TV may be configured with overscan, meaning it throws away a bit of the edges of the 1920x1080 image, and enlarges the rest to fill the screen.  This is done to avoid artifacts that sometimes show up in TV broadcasts.  The best approach would be to look for a way to disable overscan in your HDTV.  If that is not possible, you can probably compensate for overscan in your video card driver, but the image quality will not be quite as good because the computer's pixels don't map exactly to the TV's pixels.
Edit:  Wait, this is a 1680x1050 monitor, but you mention 1920x1080 in your question.  What resolution is your graphics card set at?
(If I set my laptop display as primary, the 60hz is fine on the external. BUT. If I set it to primary (the external, that is), then I have to switch it to 59hz.)  
Check the hz setting, I had to use 59hz setting. (Which gets recognised as 60hz on the display.) Yes, ATI hardware. On my NVidia there is nothing like this, beats me what causes this.
