The Synaptics TouchPad setting on an HP laptop allows you to customise or turn off a lot of irritating stuff as well as the swiping thing and is well worth checking out.  
For my Dell, I went to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Devices and Printers.  Right click on the laptop picture and select Mouse Settings.  Click on Dell Touchpad, and in that screen select the link that says "Click to change DellTouchpad settings".  Go to Gestures.
On my gateway, go to the charms bar, type in mouse and select the first choice MOUSE that comes up. Select the Edge Actions and uncheck. simple as that.
However, after experimenting with drivers I found a Synaptics driver from ASUS that comes with something they call ASUS Smart Gesture. There, under the Edge Gesture tab one can disable the different swipe gestures. Easier and safer than messing with the registry.
However this only works for ASUS computers, while Daniel B's answer should work for most Synaptic touchpads. 
I have an HP that also has a Synaptics TouchPad and I just searched (in the main Windows 8 search thing) "touchpad" and it brought up a few different results under "Settings", one of which was the Synaptics TouchPad that I have, so I clicked on it and it opened a window with settings for my touchpad.  One of the settings says "Enable Edge Swipes" and I just unchecked it and now it's good.
