The problem is unfortunately an old bug with ATI cards under some multi-monitor setups that is being reported since at least 2009. I experienced it with an HD 4770. It was particularly recurring when I would host a virtual machine in fullscreen mode on my secondary monitor. But would also happen without it when I moved between screens. Just not so often.
After setting the above options my mouse pointer started to behave normally, and the the cursor distortion has gone forever! (After two PCs and two weeks I am almost sure actually)
Here is another solution that hasn't been stated and is a bit better than setting mouse trails, etc.
That's it. The mouse corruption will "not" happen again. The constant redrawing of the mouse trails is effectively hiding the bug from view.
This is going to make the movement of your mouse pointer crazy I know, but now slide to the trail delay to the shortest. (slide it to the left)
Workaround: Try to enable pointer shadow (apply settings), and then disable it (apply settings). The mouse pointer should be fixed.
If you are using Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI) take the following step: Power-off the VDI-router box, count to five, and power it on again.  The pointers on both primary and secondary monitors return to their normal arrow shape.
I had this problem, too,  my mouse pointer sometimes looked very trashy, like I have serious memory or display driver problems. Windows 7, dual screen, Vmware, integrated Intel display adapter, HP desktop PC. I don't think this problem is connected to any specific hardware component. The problem is with Windows and VMware, but I believe it's only in dual screen mode. Hardware doesn't matter.
(FYI: Restarting your VDI-session will not help; the text-select or garbled pointer will persist; you need to power-off/on the physical box; you will of course be required to log back in to the VDI).
