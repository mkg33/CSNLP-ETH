In case anybody was wondering, I ended up settling for 120Hz which works fine - no flickering or corruption.
I set it by running 'xrandr -r 144', and the command works (the display is in 144Hz mode, I can feel it) but I get strange flickering windows and graphical artifacts. The flickering is intermittent, and it has a pattern - it seems to be motion-triggered. For example right now, as I type, the flickering rate corresponds to my typing speed. As I stop typing, the flickering rate slows down to the speed of the blinking cursor. 
Setting it to 120 Hz fixes it. Also the new (proprietary) AMDGPU-PRO driver works with 144 Hz, if that's an option for you: http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Radeon-GPU-PRO-Linux-Beta-Driver%E2%80%93Release-Notes.aspx
Is this a limitation of the open-source Radeon driver? I don't want to try installing fglrx (unless they've improved it since my last attempt).
I have a Fedora 20 64-bit installation that has a problem when running my 144Hz-capable monitor (BenQ XL2411Z) at 144Hz.
