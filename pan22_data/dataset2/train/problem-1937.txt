I recently had this problem and have been on the phone with my cable company numerous times to solve the issue.
Then, there may be wireless interference coming from those appliances causing your connection to drop for a period of time.
I finally found someone technically competent that could help me. He ruled out the service to my cable modem in the house was a problem by asking if the lights on the modem changed when the service went out. They did not change at all. This observation led him to ask where my wireless router was located. He mentioned:
Check your DSL router and check if the Internet is working well. So maybe the problem is with your Internet connection, and not with the operating system.
Harry's turn off ipv6 thought is probable.  Another thing you might look in to is setting DNS to an external server as opposed to using the router's built in dns.  In my experience with running connection intensive applications(think torrent), it has tried to resolve all hostnames for a really large number of connections and has unpredictable crashes.  In my case it had to do with trying to hold/push through too much DNS data on the router.
