To find this settings on the Windows 2012 R2 : right click on "My Computer", choose "Properties" then "Remote Settings". 
Probably XP does not suport "Network Level Authentication" and when the server requires this, the XP client cannot connect. 
After reviewing all the answers and comments, also trawling the internet for similar problems, my conclusion is that it's a file corruption problem on the Windows 2012 Server computer.
I had the same problem with WINDOWS XP client  wich could not connect to Windows 2012 R2 Remote Server. 
On one server, I had removed the US keyboard (that was by default configured during installation), then tried to enable RDP, and it did not work.
I solved the problem by unchecking this box on the server: "Allow connections only for computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication (recomended)". 
I have noticed that sometime enabling remote desktop does not correctly enable the firewall exception for port 3389. Please check whether the appropriate rule is enabled. If it is, try disabling and immediately enabling the firewall. This worked for me on several occasions.
