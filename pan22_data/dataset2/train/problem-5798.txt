I've created a FreeFileSync batch script with options that will preserve file permissions, this requires the script to be run with Administrative Privileges.  I can't find an obvious way to run the script as an admin and because of that I created a shortcut to the script and attempted to have the new shortcut run as an admin, trouble is, the option to "Run as administrator" is grayed out. 
What is happening is you are launching another process(FreeFileSync) from the batchfile. Unlike commands in a Command Prompt, which run inside the Command Interpretor, the new process is run as a User by default.
To elevate commands inside a batchfile, you'll need to use VBScript or JScript and the Windows Scripting Host. My recommendation is to use the Elevation PowerToy for Vista. The download contains example scripts.
There used to be an old hack where you could elevate to the system account by using the task scheduler, I think this is no longer the case since Microsoft closed that hole in Windows 7. However, I'm pretty sure you can still do this and create a shortcut that will run the program as administrator. The instructions are for vista, but the article suggests that they should be valid for windows 7 - I speculate the same thing.
