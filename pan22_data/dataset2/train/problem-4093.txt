If you are talking a separate web page, an html page and a text page, I'm not sure if that is possible, but it could be researched more.  So far I'm not seeing anything about that, although I am finding a lot of pages for prettying up alerts.
I was wondering if it is possible to set up nagios to both display its normal page (e.g. critical alerts) in its normal format (red for all alerts on its critical page) and in a basic text format (no colors or graphs, no links to hosts either). What I am looking for is the normal page to display on our wall mounted monitors for all to see, and for a basic text page so that if alerts have to be emailed to certain groups it can be in plain text. Was thinking of creating my own page and stick it in the nagios /html folder but trying that with a test page does not seem to work (page is visible but does not update). Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.
When you say page, do you mean alert, or web page?  You can create separate alert types by creating new commands, then selecting the command as host_notification_commands or service_notification_commands in the configs for the hosts and services.  So you would create a different notification, that sends the data you want in the format you want, and use that in your service or host definitions.
The Thruk add-on for Nagios allows export to JSON for a lot of its pages, including the "problem hosts" and "problem services" page.  I swear it used to do CSV, but I can't get my thruk install to do anything other than JSON and XLS at the moment.
This isn't exactly what you are looking for, but if you end up writing something yourself, it should be something you can make use of to make your scriptwriting a little easier.
