Yes, but it's more than a router. There doesn't appear to be a way to make it do plain IP routing between two subnets. So it's more properly referred to as an NAPT gateway (NAPT = Network Address and Port Translation, which is what people mean 99% of the time they write NAT).
Also note that in many home gateway designs, it's slightly more complex than this, but in a mostly transparent way. For example, the Wi-Fi AP radios may not be connected to the same physical switch chip as the LAN ports, but the LAN switch and the AP radios are bridged (switched) together via software switching in the main SOC (CPU) that runs the whole gateway.
While we're being so precise, note that a Wi-Fi AP is much more like an Ethernet hub (repeater) than a switch, because it does not allow full-duplex operation. So it's as if all of your 2.4GHz devices are on one "hub", and all your 5GHz devices are on another "hub", and those two hubs are connected to the same switch as your LAN ports.
Yes. In this kind of device, the LAN and WLAN ports are bridged (switched) together. You can think of your box like this:
