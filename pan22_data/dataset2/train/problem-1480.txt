I think that's all. If you need more info, comment and I'll edit this question. Also, If you want to recommend another product that's better or cheaper maybe, you cando it. I'm from Spain btw, just in case, for the shipping.            
A clean microfiber cloth with a little bit of clean water has proven really effective for me. I wouldn't mess with vinegar or other stuff - could mess with delicate coatings, and/or leave residue. Get one corner of the microfiber a bit wet, and use that to wipe the whole screen - gets off fingerprints, etc. Then use the dry part of the cloth to completely dry the screen.
I have used a soft cloth or J-cloth . Make very wet, add a drop or two of “green “ dish detergent, work into suds, wring out excess water, clean the screen and keyboard. Just suds - no excess water. Wet the cloth to remove all suds and wring out the water and wipe off the suds. This cleans, removes grease and fingerprints and does not damage screens. I have done this for years on many computers and iPhones. Free (assuming you wash dishes)
