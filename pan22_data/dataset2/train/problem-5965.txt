just a guess - how many/which Google MX servers did you include in the zone file for that particular/sometimes failing domain?
I've played with Google mail too (a year ago) and at that time Google recommended to set about 6 MX servers in the zone file. Today Google asks for 5 MX entries: Google Apps mail servers.  It could be that your zone file points to non existent MXs?
I have a mail server and web server running on the same IP. Most domains use both servers so their respective DNS records all point to the same spot.  
There is one domain that uses my server for web and google servers for mail.  The DNS record for this one domain has only the A record point to my server and everything else pointed to google.  Over the past 4 days, there have been 6 emails that hit my mail server (and were rejected forwarding) while all others (hundreds) went directly to google with no problems. 
It sounds like the MX record for this domain doesn't exist or can't be found. Have you verified that an MX record exists and that a DNS query resolves it correctly?
