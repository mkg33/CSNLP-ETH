My company has a field engineering force which works onsite at customers.  Many of those customers have very restrictive rules.  One cannot usually connect a non-customer owned laptop to the network, our employees can't install non-approved software on customer workstations.  The customer network frequently has restrictive firewall rules in place that prevent access to external resources.  Even our webmail is often blocked.
One idea I was thinking of is a browser based VNC that can talk to the my company's web server via http/https.  In this way we should be able to access it from a customer machine using a customer web browser over ports that the customer would have open in the firewall.  The web server would then forward the VNC connections to a generic Linux box.  The Linux box would provide a web browser, rdesktop, and other apps and would be sitting within my company's network, with access to all the internal resources.
Meanwhile, we have a large number of useful resources on our internal network.  Lots of wikis and similar resources, mostly browser based.
