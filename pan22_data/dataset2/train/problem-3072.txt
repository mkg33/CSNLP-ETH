If you created the VM on the same computer then it's already in the left pane of the main program window.
In VirtualBox 4.3.8 running on a Win 7 host the solution works very smoothly by doubleclicking on the .vbox file of the machine - it even found the respective disks and associated them. Earlier I tried the registervm command line option but that complained about the attached hard disk not being found, as the documentation predicts. I then associated the .vdi virtual harddisk filetype with Virtualbox.exe, not sure if that helped.
I'm not sure I see a problem here. In VirtualBox if you are opening a new VM (one you might have created on a different computer) you use File/Import Appliance and then browse for the file to open. After importation it can be found in the main VM panel.
On Debian, I edited ~/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml and also the machine.xml I want to import : ~/VirtualBox VMs/$machine/$machine.xml
Relaunch VirtualBox, add host-only network if needed, import ext pack if needed (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), install virtualbox additions if needed : sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso.
