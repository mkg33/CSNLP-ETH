My real question is: Would creating a VPN from UK site to AWS UK VPC, and then  VPN from UK VPC to HK VPC make sense? Or is it more sensible( aside from security concerns, which would be controlled) to connect a vpn directly from the UK site to the VPC in HK? 
This would be straightforward enough, however due to a business demand, there is a requirement for us to offer an SFTP(or similar option) in the HK region quickly( before any need to have one in the UK), essentially escalating the move to using AWS. Ultimately, this new VPC in HK would eventually have a set of services shared to users in a remote site in HK. In the first instance only a SFTP is required however, which will mean I can make an externally facing service with credentials or tokens etc, forgoing the DC or VPN to the HK site for now. 
Essentially I'm looking to connect our UK based site to a AWS VPC. I have been looking at both Direct Connect and VPN options for this purpose. In the initial instance I would like to use a VPN to get things started. Naturally, I was going to have this VPC in a UK AWS region.  
I was hoping to get some help from you. At this point the information I'm looking for is probably quite high level. I have been searching for information, and for the most part have found what I'm looking for. 
I really just need to move some data from our site about 3-4 times a day and make it available to an EC2 instance in the HK region?
