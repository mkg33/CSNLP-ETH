I also see Windows XP Mode base.vhd file that, by looking at properties, seems to be a virtual machine hard drive image.It looks like it should show up in Programs and Features to uninstall. I deleted the file when I was unable to find it in Programs and Features.
Also, I am unable to remove the virtual machine because it does not exist under any of the User names. 
I would install Windows 7 from scratch, but you can also install Windows XP Mode again and then uninstall, so to avoid any leftovers on your system besides the Windows XP Mode folder you found.
Any thoughts as to why Windows XP Mode is on my computer? And does this sound a bit odd regarding the removal?
As Izam indirectly pointed when asked if you installed Windows 7 yourself or if it's an OEM install (or factory reset), maybe it was captured when the OEM built the repair/factory reset image.
Is it normal to have a Windows XP Mode folder in a Windows 7 Pro, Program Files Directory? I see this key: K49H2-RPR94-QBGG4-DBCTM-YT64G. And I see the VXPEULA.txt file with EULA. Window XP Mode has never intentionally, or knowingly, been installed. 
To summarize, Windows XP Mode was not visible to uninstall so I deleted the file Windows XP Mode base.vhd; unable to remove Virtual Machine because it does not exist under any of the user names; and Virtual PC does not exist under installed updates.
