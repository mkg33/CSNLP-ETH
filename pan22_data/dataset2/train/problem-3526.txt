I have a printer that is installed on a Windows Server 2012 R2 machine and being deployed to the Windows clients.
According to the User Manual page 55 (page 65 of the PDF), here's how you set up network scanning on the HP LaserJet Pro MFP M225, M226.
I would like to be able to scan from it, not having to install it locally which is what I've been doing so far.
Review all the information, then click Save and Test to save the information and test the connection, or Save Only to save the information only.
How can I enable/add Scanner as a category to the deployed printer so I don't have to install it locally on every machine?
NOTE: The network folder must be shared for this feature to work. It can be shared for only you or for other users.
When it's installed locally, the categories under properties for the printer says "Multi function printer; Scanner", but when it's deployed from the server, it simply says "Printer" and Windows Fax and Scan is unable to detect a scanner without having it locally installed.
