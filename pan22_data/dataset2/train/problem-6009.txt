The slots probably* don't matter, however, if your RAM tests out fine in one slot, but not another, it's likely that you have a bad slot. Depending on how the first bad set of RAM failed, you might have fried the slot and the RAM.
The order of your modules can matter, but on most setups it shouldn't. There are some misc issues (especially regarding timings) that can be fixed by changing the module order.
You should read the manual for your motherboard to see which RAM slots need to be filled as it varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.  As @Satanicpuppy mentioned, it is possible that you fried a RAM slot, so that is something you want to be aware of as you perform your testing.  Typically we like to test RAM one stick at a time in the slot closest to the processor (or whatever slot your motherboard manual says should be populated).  If all sticks tested in that slot fail then the slot is probably bad and you should discontinue use of that motherboard immediately.
In any case, I became causious and as soon as I got them I put them in the PC and run KUbuntu memtest.
*Some systems require slots to be filled in pairs, and others require slot 1 to always be full, yadda yadda.
In a new PC I had constantly BSoD. I tracked it down to bad memory modules and took them back to the shop.
