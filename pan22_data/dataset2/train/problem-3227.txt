Is the connection intermittent, so that it comes back up? Or is it down for a period of time until you do something to reset your connection? Are the period these blackouts last long, short, are they giving specific errors? Nothing else hiccups in the connection, are all the other websites working well at the same time?
I'd first try checking your access logs (if you have access to them) on the web server to see if it is seeing your access attempts from your home computer's IP address.
Does your modem have some form of logging that allows you to see if there's a connection issue to your ISP?
You say that you can connect to your server via a proxy when you're experiencing difficulties; that would indicate that your ISP isn't stopping you from web browsing. But that doesn't rule out some issue with your server.
It's also possible that there's something odd with your machine or browser. Are you able to check from another computer within your network, assuming you have a NAT'ed network connection?
As you hinted you'll first need to diagnose if it's a connection issue from your computer or an issue with your ISP.
I'd also try pinging the server to see if you can see the server from the system. Traceroute as well to see if you can establish where the connection is possibly being dropped (although some routers may be dropping packets that are needed to trace that route).
