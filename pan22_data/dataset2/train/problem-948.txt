where the last element is the "Sort Depth". This is the parameter that will be used by your sprite batch to choose the order in which to draw things. Since the draw method you are using doesn't set the "Sort Depth" value all sprites will be drawn in the same order you called draw in.
BackToFront is the sort order recommended for drawing sprites which have some transparency. If your textures have no transparent areas then you will want to use FrontToBack. Also, if you have some with no transparency and some with transparency, you might consider drawing the non-transparent ones first with a sort mode set to FrontToBack and then draw the transparent ones with the sort mode set to BackToFront. Unless performance becomes an issue, I would stick with BackToFront for all sprites and set the "Sort Depth". You can always change it later.
As an alternative, you can simply change the order in which you are calling Draw for each sprite, with objects at the back being drawn first so they don't get drawn over the top.
