I'm sick of going through all the email alerts or logging into servers to check the status of my backups.
You can use CheckCentral for this. You setup your backup emails to be sent to CheckCentral, and then it takes care of logging them as success or failed, and sends a notification if the email is overdue.
I keep coming back to this question and wondering just how many instances of BackupExec are involved here, because you're making it sound like there are vast numbers. This should already be automated and you should not need to go through all the email alerts or log on to the servers or even open the BE console. 
If email alerts aren't cutting it Backup Exec also supports SNMP - see here and here for help from Symantec on setting it up.
I use zabbix to monitor backupexec jobs. What I did was to enable SNMP in backupexec. So, when it executes a job, it sends a trap that is listened by zabbix, that records the traps on it's database.
I find the simplest solution is a filter for my email (we use Outlook but the principles apply elsewhere). Any emails from the backup systems that include warnings or errors are moved to a separate folder and I get a pop-up telling me about them. That, coupled with a monitoring system that let's me know if the backup hasn't run or completed, lets me see at a glance when things aren't quite right. After all, I'm not really all that interested in the emails telling me the backup was successful.
No rocket science, just a little constructive laziness - the most powerful tool any sysadmin can have.
