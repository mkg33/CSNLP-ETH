Still trying to get GPU passthrough working and decided to change machine type from older 440fx to q35 ie pc-q35 but if I do virsh edit on the config it refuse to save saying "PCI Bridges not supported"... by current qemu binary. What do I need to fix/change in the virtual machine xml file?
btw. those <qemu:arg /> at the end might be causing trouble as well. If you run into problems, try removing those as well.
After some research seems q35 only allows PCIexpress PCIe and not PCI but I don't know what to change in my xml file so that virsh stops complaining and accepts change from 440fx to q35.
With virsh edit, I am guessing a little, but I would try removing the PCI controller and all bus related parameters (like <address />. 
Latest virt-manager (1.1.0) supports setting architecture on VM creation. You can not change it later. 
There is a patch available for the underlying issue (being that QEMU won't allow you to bind to a PCIe root bus, which is needed for Windows guests on Q35):
Normally i'd offer this in a comment, since its more of a guess, but it's too long. I'll remove it if it does not work.
Then it will complain about anything with a bus-related parameter - I think you can leave the item but remove the specification. I also had to remove USB-related 
Not sure if you're still trying to do this - but I tought I'd put it out there for anyone else who searches for this.
I just did this today - pretty much as 'Fox' described, except change the pci controller entry instead of deleting it - changing 'pci-root' to 'pcie-root'
I'd run qemu manually with -M q35 or -M ? to check the version you have installed really supports it
