There are some potential downsides to be aware of, like the fact that you pay for doing simple things like file listings. Not much, but if an automated process does it a lot, you could be in for a surprise. (So you probably don't want to leave the filesystem mounted and accessible to anything except when you're intentionally using it.)
You can use the Fuse (filesystems-in-user-space) feature of the Linux kernel to mount an S3 bucket as if it were a normal local filesystem. There's several implementations of this; here is one that I know is being actively developed.
I do not have any experience managing fsbackup, and I do not want to break or lose the backups. Googling fsbackup gives surprisingly low quality results...
I'm thinking about moving backups to Amazon S3, but before that I have to free some space, so the server can work.
Moving those files shouldn't be an issue. This article is what I used. Its a little sparse on details but it will basically let you mount Amazon S3 to migrate those files. Best of luck!
Now it came to a point, where fsbackup backups take more space than the rest of data in the system. The filesystem is 100% filled, and I already cleaned up all that I could, aside from actual backups.
