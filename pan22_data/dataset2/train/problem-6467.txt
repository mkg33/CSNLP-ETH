Try this Email Server Test. It has some additional content checks in addition to the standard IP/DNS ones and might give you some idea on what is wrong.
Regardless it's nearly impossible to get off a blacklist. I suggest moving your server to another IP address, changing the hostname in you CNAME and testing it again, that way you'll know if it was the IP that has been blacklisted and not you hostname.
The easiest way to get reputation which "drowns out" the IP reputation of your netblock is to set up DKIM.  Send your mails signed.  This will establish a per-domain reputation, instead of per-IP reputation, and provides more signal to the automated scoring systems.
The more you work to help the recipients of your email figure out who you are and how trustworthy you are, the more signals they have to work with and the better a job the automated systems can do in deciding that you're legitimate, unlike whoever else bought a virtual machine in the same netblock, pumped out spam and then left, bills to hosting service unpaid and everyone else's reputation tarnished.
If the only factor is your IP and you don't mail often, this might be "the reputation of the /24 my IP is in".  If you mail a lot, you might get your own reputation.
Are you running your email server out of your home?  With, say, a cable modem/DSL connection?  If so, they're probably getting tagged as spam because your IP address is known as a DHCP address for an ISP.
Just an idea, this could be do to the fact that you've moved to an IP that has been blacklisted? It is possible.
