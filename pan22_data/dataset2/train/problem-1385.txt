I haven't found a way in the Metro interface, but if you hit the wrench icon next to the URL and click "View on the desktop," it'll load the "good old fashioned" IE10 browser and that will load up local IP-based URLs just fine.
One workaround would be to use our public IP and NAT specific ports for each of the servers, but this would be a hassle. Any ideas?

Alternatively, you could just add an IP outside your subnet to the web server's NIC and have the webserver bind to that IP.
Has anyone found a way to enable local subnet sites in the Metro version of IE10? Currently, if I try to access a site in my subnet block, e.g. http://192.168.1.50/index.php, I just get the error "Internet Explorer cannot display this web page.".
If you make the site WAN-accessible and access it via a proxy, then it should be no different from accessing a WAN site. Installing a personal certificate on each browser you intend to test the site on should allow you to transparently deal with the security issues. Otherwise, you can restrict access to the IP of the proxy you're using.
