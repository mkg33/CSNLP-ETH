Router C replies, it doesn't know about Router A LAN Subnet, but it knows via Static Routes that Router B knows, it sends traffic to Router B, Router B sends it down the VPN tunnel to Router A.
Not only is this possible, it is standard. For the router a VPN is not different than a physical connection and those form that funny thing called "internet" where a packet may traverse a lot of such routers from the beginning to the end of it's journey.
HOWEVER, it is VERY RARE that this setup would be in place like this.  Most tunnels have source/destination restrictions in place for the tunnel AND most people don't use VPN tunnels for their default routes, unless they don't have separate internet connections at those locations.
Yes, it's possible, and generally they way they're set up.  They are simply an encrypted "tunnel" between two routers, and unless there are rules in place to treat it differently, the VPN traffic is treated just like any other once it arrives at the destination site, and that can certainly include being forwarded onto another site, if that's where the traffic needs to go.
Most likely a network won't have ONLY site-to-site VPN tunnels, to where Router A's default 0.0.0.0/0 route is going out the tunnel.  IF router B has routes to both Router A and Router C...AND Router C has its default route sending to Router B...AND there are no restrictive policies on the tunnels...then yes it should work.
The problem is introducing site-to-site VPN complicates things, especially if those site-to-site VPNs have policies in place that only allow traffic to/from certain subnets.  You can set them to just be route based and not mess with policies that restrict traffic, but a lot of times they do have policies in place as such.
Router A doesn't know about Router C LAN Subnet, but I static route tells is that Router B knows, it sends traffic to Router B, Router B sends that traffic down the tunnel to Router C.
