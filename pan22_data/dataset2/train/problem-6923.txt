In addition, if Tomcat is installed as a Windows service, you might take a look at the Windows event log (Control center > Manage > Event Log).
I've installed a tomcat instance on a clean Windows 2003 machine (VM running on an ESX cluster).  I have an IIS background and I'm not familiar with tomcat. I'm hosting a single java/jsp based vendor app. 
How would I go about troubleshooting why this is happening?  I'm not finding anything in the event viewer (though tomcat probably doesn't log there)
As Christian suggested, the Tomcat logfiles (catalina.out and the application specific logfiles) will be the first point to look at. Depending on your Tomcat version, the directory may differ, though. 
The Tomcat log files will help you determine if the shutdown has a specific reason (e. g. a memory leak in the application you deployed) or if it has a different cause.
Take a look at the tomcat logs. They are placed in the directory logs in the tomcat install folder (e.g. C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 6.0\logs). this might give you some hints about whats going on.
