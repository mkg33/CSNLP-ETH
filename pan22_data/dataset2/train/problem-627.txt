Modern CPUs, especially mobile ones, feature thermal throttling in order to protect them from extreme temperatures. What this means is that if a fan fails while the system is in operation  then the CPU will limit itself in order to prevent damage caused by overheating. Your system performance can be severely hampered by this throttling.
The fan heatsink may be connected to the CPU, but by keeping the CPU cool it also allows other components (such as power converters and interface chips) to shed heat easier.
I would only use such a system lightly and with caution.  It will not be working at peak performance and will be at risk of further damage due to high temperatures around sensitive components. 
While this can ensure that a system is likely to be protected from a failure you shouldn't count on it as a permanent saviour. Electronic components don't like being at their maximum limits for extended periods. Extreme hot/cold cycles can cause mechanical stress and lead to components breaking prematurely.
