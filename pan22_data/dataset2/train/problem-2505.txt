Ghosting happens when the fuser applies insufficient heat to melt the toner onto the paper. There are 2 main reasons for it. 
The first one is a faulty fuser. This can happen when the fuser gets too old. The fuser is actually a "consumable". Typically it lasts about 100,000 pages, but that varies from model to model. It also depends on what types of paper you have been printing. The thin, vertical bands suggest that there are other problems with the fuser.
I would start by printing a single page that has a large image or photo on it (to ensure the problem will occur). Print 1 copy of that on plain, 80gsm paper and then remove the fuser from the printer. You should see toner sticking to the fuser rollers. If there is, the fuser is faulty and you need to decide whether to replace the fuser or the printer. With low-cost printers it may be cheaper to bite the bullet and get a new model.
The paper is the second reason ghosting happens. Unless you are printing on plain 80gsm bond paper, the fuser needs to apply more heat. This can be done by a higher fuser temperature, or by slower paper transport, so the paper spends more time in the fuser. Either way, to achieve this the printer needs to be told what type of paper is being used. In Windows (and OSX) this is done in the driver settings.
