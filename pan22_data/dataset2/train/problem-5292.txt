I would be especially interested in one what would let me set a default limit for everyone but certain computers.
My ZyXel VDSL router (P-2802) allows me to prioritize bandwidth by IP/packet-type/port.  Maybe this would meet your goals?  (I've got mine setup to do so for Skype calls and ssh.)
Are there any wireless routers that would allow me to see what clients are hogging up bandwidth and that would let me limit them so that they can't grab it all? Both wifi-wise and internet-wise.
Example usage could be to set up a hot-spot at an event with many visitors and prevent some of them from grabbing all the bandwidth by running bittorrent transfers or something like that.
Make sure you read the documentation on the aftermarket firmware.  There are a few versions of the Linksys WRT54G that are NOT able to be switched back after the DD-WRT conversion.
I don't know the specifics of each, but DD-WRT and Tomato are two firmware options I've heard a lot about; they might be able to do something like that.
