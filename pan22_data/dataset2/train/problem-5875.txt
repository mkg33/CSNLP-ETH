At this point I'm out of ideas. I have this working on a couple of other computers because I had installed Labkey Server, which uses a PostgreSQL database and apparently installs the right DLL's alongside it. It shows up in the menu as simply "From PostgreSQL database". Of course I could just install Labkey Server on this computer but that seems like an ugly solution I'd like to avoid.
Finally got this working. It looks like for some reason you need the Professional Plus edition of Microsoft Office to enable PostgreSQL connections. With this version freshly installed on a new computer I had the PostgreSQL option under Power Query -> From Database available by default. Once I selected this option, gave the host and database name, then username and password, I got an error telling me I the Ngpsql data provider could not be found. So, the option appearing in the menu is simply due to MS Office version and not whether the Ngpsql provider is installed. I went to this page mentioned above, downloaded the Setup_Npgsql-2.2.5.0-r3-net40.exe installer, ran, restarted Excel and everything worked.
I want to pull data from a PostgreSQL database on my local network with Power Query. By default my version of Excel lists three options under the "Get External Data/From Database" menu on the Power Query ribbon - "From SQL Server Database," "From Access Database," and "From SQL Server Analysis Services Database". PostgreSQL is not a default option.
Luckily (or so I thought) there is this article on the official Microsoft Office support page on how to install/enable  the Ngpsql data provider for PostgreSQL for this purpose. I followed these instructions, but I still only see those three options showing up. I haven't been able to find any other instructions on how to do this through Google. Here's what I did exactly:
