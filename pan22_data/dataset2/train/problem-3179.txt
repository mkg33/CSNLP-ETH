Once you've installed those fonts, you'll have Helvetica, although it might be under a different name.
You can use Ghostscript (even on Windows) to create PDFs that have all Fonts (even TrueType fonts) embedded.
URW++ has released GPL versions of all the standard Postscript fonts. Unfortunately they're hard to find on their own, the easiest way to get them is from a Ghostscript installation.
If you are lucky, you might be able to create a PostScript file (which will serve as the input for the PDF-creation process run by Ghostscript) that has the fonts embedded, by following these steps:
(Above UI strings have been translated by me back to English -- so the exact wordings you see on your PC may be different.)
In order to embed a font in a PDF document you must have that font available on your system and the font needs to allow embedding. Almost all fonts allow embedding, so that shouldn't be a problem.
Ghostscript will use it's own (very good) clone fonts (donated by the URW Foundry under a FOSS license) in place of the original Adobe 'base 14' ones. Specifically, it will use:
A manual way to embed a font in Acrobat (I'm using Acrobat 8 Professional, so hopefully it is available in 7 - I don't have access to 7 anymore) is to use the "TouchUp Text Tool"
When you print, you'll be prompted for a filename+path, with a default extension of *.prn. Save the file as "somename.ps" (it will be PostScript).
