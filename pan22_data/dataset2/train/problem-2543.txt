You say you are using Dell Latitude notebook. Are you using wired connection? It is tricky for notebooks to support wake-over-wireless. . But if you do use wired connection, make sure your BIOS supports it. Usually if the motherboard supports WoL there is a switch to turn on and off this feature in BIOS settings.
I played with it a while back and did get it to work on a Optiplex 3040. Tried a few others and the only problem child I found was a Vostro 230. I woke my Optiplex 3040 up from a dead power off with Team Viewer. What are you using? One of the biggest diags I was given is that when it is turned off you should still have an activity LED on the NIC be active. If it isn't something isn't set up right. Usually the BIOS Power Management Settings. I'll reboot my Optiplex and write them down for you.
WoL is the feature of the motherboard and network card so the Windows settings shouldn't matter. If machine is powered off (either in S4 or S5 state) Windows is far from being able to affect anything.
I can't able to wake up the machine with Windows 10 OS. Is there any support required from the N/w drivers or BIOS for Windows 10.
I could only get WOL to work on a Dell optiplex by putting it to 'sleep' rather than a full shutdown. Works fine then. Power goes off on the system but the network card stays active .
