Having looked at "tunlr.net", I am skeptical that it does what it claims - Specifically if you look at the "How does it work" section in tunlr.net/faq it says "Tunlr is transparently creating a network tunnel from your location to our U.S.-based servers. Any data that’s not directly related to the video or music content providers which Tunlr supports is not only left untouched, it’s also not even routed through Tunlr.".  This means that it is rerouting the requests THROUGH THE TUNLR systems [equivalent to using a VPN, but probably doing it by tricking DNS and acting as a proxy]- IF YOU DON'T HAVE SERVERS/SERVICE/VPN IN THE AREA BEING GEO-BLOCKED, YOU WON'T GET ROUND THE BLOCK.
Are you sure about your statement "I believe this is the best solution for me because I just need to use the proxy for the validation but not for the actual streaming of the content eg.Hulu or Netflix." ?  This does not make sense to me as most "regional only" sites use the IP address the request COMES FROM - possibly in addition to using DNS to route requests.
What I am having trouble with is understanding what is being said with regards to the Tunlr documentation (provided in the 'link here' hyperlink).
I am wondering whether or not I can recreate the router mechanism on the VPN itself or completely disregard it
There is nothing magical about DNS lookups, and you can use any nameserver which will let you. You can also run your own or even use a hosts file to force lookups if you know the IP addresses you wish domains to resolve too.

I have recently been researching about products that allow users to evade geo-blocking and i have come across:
