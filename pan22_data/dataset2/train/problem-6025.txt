Click on the Wheel tab - it should appear if your mouse is properly connected and drivers are properly installed
For some reason, smooth scrolling (using the mouse wheel) was replaced on Windows 10 (in my case, at least) with scrolling of entire page and sometimes even more.
Even though my mouse was sparkling clean inside, rubbing alcohol with a cotton swab and carefully tightening the sensor with pliers worked A1 and solved (so far) my jumpy/jerking wheel mouse and improved scrolling.
I was facing the same irritating problem. I have the correct drivers and everything. However, I think scrolling one screen at a time is what was causing the problem. So here's how I updated that setting to make things nice again:

none of the answers I found on Microsoft support or here worked, so I found this video and tried it out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=981KfZez7Ws
Change vertical scroll from one screen at a time to a number of lines ata a time. I set it to 10, however, you can set it to anything you prefer.
That's even though I've set smooth scrolling on the mouse setting, and even on the apps themselves (including the special flag on Chrome).
