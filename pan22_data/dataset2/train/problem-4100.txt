The Worksheet_Change event could essentially accomplish what you're asking for, but you need to be sure the user intends things to change. I've added a 'Yes/No' choice box to my solution to prevent any accidental changes. Doing this without a choice box is risky because if you tried to edit an existing value the it would change back to the original formatting.
I had to go to an advanced setting "Change Time and Date Format" and change the "Short Date" setting.
Highlight the column in question, right click on the selected column, then Format Cells...  Select Custom and click in the field that says General, type "dd/mm/yyyy".  That should work.
Option 2: Request that the user enters the 'day', 'month' and 'year' into three separate cells or fields, which might be better or worse depending on your set up.
Option 1: We could accept the inputs in text format and put them in the cells, this way Excel won't try to interpret them as dates. Then, in an adjacent cell we could use the function DATE together with LEFT, RIGHT, and MID. For example (specify that the user must enter the date in full MM/DD/YYYY):
12-02-2018 would be swopped to 2 dec 2018 althought the format of the target cell was in the same format. 
I do not think you can change the default. It's especially awkward to fix when you import data from overseas.
I know exactly what you are talking about. I like to type YY-MM-DD. The setting to change it to what you want is not in Excel. The setting you want is in windows. It is hidden somewhere in the control panel "time and language".
I had the same problem when assigning a new data value to my cell using the same format it already had
