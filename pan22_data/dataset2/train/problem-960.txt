This works to initialize a headless RaspberryPi connected by Wifi (no screen/keyboard never needed attached to RPi):
Problem: for a Windows user, step #3 is not very convenient. An alternative would be to initially connect via ethernet cable, SSH with putty, and edit /etc/network/intefaces with nano, but it's not very handy too, because it requires to connect the RPi to the router with a cable.
NOTE the etc/network/intefaces you listed is obsolete and is not needed. Even in 2015 it would have been poor practice but it has been replaced by dhcpcd which is far more robust.
Once again, the goal is: to be able to set up a headless RPi connected by wifi, without using a keyboard/screen/ethernet cable ever, 100% from Windows, so that we can SSH with putty and never have to boot Linux (some users don't have any Linux installation), and never have to use an ethernet cable.
Question: which method would allow to initialize a headless Raspberry Pi, including the Wifi ssid/password setting, 100% from Windows?
