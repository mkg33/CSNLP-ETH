Load the Linksys FW, restore to factory defaults and then install tomato again. It should solve the issue, at least it did it twice on my E2500.
This was specifically for my E2500 V1 and it only works if using CH13 on 2.4Ghz band - your mileage may differ...
So I flashed down but the overall experience was not as good as V2 - dropped connections etc. So I went back to V2 and lived with only having the 2.4Ghz band.
My 5Ghz has not worked since updating to V2 of the firmware. Nothing mentioned in any of these threads could resurrect my 5Ghz on V2.
The other day I was searching for a new channel and tried channel 13 for the first time (had some old devices that could not use 12+) and voila!
Just do a 30/30/30 reset. Hold the reset button down, wait for 30 seconds, then unplug the power while still holding the button down. Now wait for a further 30 seconds and then restore power. Wait 30 seconds more and then let go of the reset button. Your 5ghz network should be back.
Funny thing is that 5Ghz was broadcasting even when disabled on router when used in conjunction with 2.4Ghz channel 13 (SSID was just blank)
Just flashed the firmware to 2.0 on my Linksys e2500, lost 5ghz band. I immediately re-flashed the same 2.0 firmware and regained my 5ghz band. seems to be doing good. Hope this helps to answer the re-flash question. Thanks all
