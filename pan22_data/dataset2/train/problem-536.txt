If neither of these work, you may have borked the motherboard and the videocard.  You'll have to get replacements.
If card has no visible damage, you may have corrupted the onboard BIOS of the card.  Check to see if ATI offers a BIOS that you can use to flash the card (this might not be helpful if you can't get Windows installed).
You don't mention any hardware specifics.  I have a recent AMD dual-core CPU, and with both the on-board video (nvidia 7025) and an stand-alone card (a 9500-class card) I regularily get hard lockups running Ubuntu.  I've talked to a number of people who have the same experience, and some have mentioned that the same thing happens with Windows.
Windows 7 requires a decent video card to work properly with all the fancy Aero effects, and the default driver might enable DirectX effects instead of being a simple fallback driver.
Check the card for any visible damage; something may have been shorted or you may have blown a capacitor.  If you can find it, contact the card's manufacturer immediately.  The HD4830 is relatively new, and you may be able to get an on-warranty replacement.
Since your motherboard's BIOS got turned into gobbledygook, you may have corrupted that somehow.  Remove the CMOS battery, unplug from the wall, press the power button 2 or 3 times, and let the computer sit for 10 mintues or so.  This will reset the BIOS back to factory settings and may solve the issue.
