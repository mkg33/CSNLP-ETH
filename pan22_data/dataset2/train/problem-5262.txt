Various backup tools support different types of backup.  One is the so-called brick level backup which backs the server at the mailbox level.  A brick-level backup is far easier to restore in older versions of Exchange, but it comes at the cost of taking far more storage space.
My backupexec is setup to integrate with exchange, to backup the information store, versus just backing up the data file path.
If you are backing up mailboxes as individual mailboxes you will see your backup set grow in size depending on the amount of duplicate data in each mailbox.  Exchange 2003 uses SIS (single instance storage). 
This is because the exchange database does a lot of de-duplication aka single instance storage.  A message sent to multiple users will be stored once and each user will have a pointer to it.  When a brick-level backup is performed this de-duplication is undone, and each mailbox is backed up separately.
My exchange mdbdata folder is 17 gigs. But my backup exec is backing up 40 gigs worth of data. I have gone through it a million times, and it's strictly backing up exchange information store. 
A recovery storage group can be used to restore individual mailboxes or mailbox items when you have only backed up the information store.  Whether or not you use a recovery storage group or third part "brick level" backup depends on the following:
