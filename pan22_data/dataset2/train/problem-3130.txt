This Ubuntu dhcp3-server documentation gives an example of a multi-subnet configuration.  It sounds like you need three things:
It may be possible with an ethernet alias to your LAN-side NIC, but I'm not sure.  Due to the way DHCP works (see examples of DHCP initiation packets at Wikipedia), I don't believe the server will be able to distinguish DHCPRequest packets from the AP from those on the LAN -- they're both coming in on the same wire.
It's definitely possible if you can add another NIC to your server.  So if your WAN is on eth0, your LAN on eth1, you need another NIC to be eth2.  You'd set eth2 to a 172.16.x.x address and plug the wireless AP into that NIC.  (You can do this with the steps below; just change references for eth1:1 to eth2.)
But I could be wrong; your edit seems to suggest it's possible.  (Are your wireless clients actually getting assigned the correct addresses?)
I don't know the specific DHCP server software you mention, but it's certainly possible in general. You need to create multiple DHCP "scopes", which would allow you to configure all settings independently. (I presume you'd also want to give them a different default gateway, etc.)
