We're using Trend Micro in production, and I've recently installed it on all our TEST VM's (after one got a virus) and have noticed no noticeable performance loss (20+ VMs on one eight core host), these machines get thrashed by our support department when trying to reproduce customer environments, it's a barebones AV and does the trick. It's picked up a couple of things that would have otherwise infected a machine after visiting the dreaded underground sites
I prefer not to have antivirus installed, but the average developer (and I mean 90% of the developers) sure needs it, I've been using McAfee (forced by company policy) and have had no major issues, if you have the option to filter out the folders where the source code resides that'll fix most of your problems
Install antivirus software on the computer but give the devs permissions to activate and deactivate the scans, set up exclusion directories etc.  When they are doing things that the virus scanner doesn't play nicely with (e.g. working with large managed code apps like OWB or VS2005+) they can turn it off.  They then have the option of turning it on if they want to run a scan.
