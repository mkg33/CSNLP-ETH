In modern LCD monitors, is there any noticeable difference between a 15000:1 (e.g. this monitor) and a 50000:1 (e.g. this monitor) contrast ratio? Or is it just marketing  hype?
Contrast ratio is something desirable to look for when purchasing a monitor. You see colors at their "fullest" so to speak. Whites at their brightest, black at its deepest and darkest (even though you will probably never set them very high). Wikipedia explains it better than I can:
A lot of it is marketing spiel. I see monitors all the time that say fastest 2ms refresh - never see blur again e.t.c. - I am using a 7 year old NEC monitor (1880SX) that has a refresh rate of 33ms and a contrast of (I think) 250:1, at its time, it was also rated as "never see motion blur again!" - I think it is brilliant and would not change it for the world.
I have a second monitor that is newer, MUCH higher specifications, however you would think it is older when you look at picture quality (however, it is still not bad!)
Also, shockingly, Manufacturers lie! even if one has a higher rating than another, it may have been under a special condition that you would never be able to repeat. The only real way to compare is to buy it, or look at the model and see!
As with response time, it is what it sounds like - How long the monitor takes to respond and change its pixels from black to white or vice versa. Typically you won't notice, but to gamers it's pretty important and makes things look smoother :)
If I was you, go to your local big computer shop and try to find either the same model or ones with similar specification to compare.
