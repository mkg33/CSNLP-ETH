Spinning down and up will wear the drive, but to be fair so will it's spinning - just at different rates. Realistically,  I wouldn't expect having this on or off to make any measurable difference for a home user in terms of drive health.
To answer your headline question - "effective or dangerous?" - I would say that in general it is neither. However, it can be effective under the right circumstances, but very rarely dangerous.
However, for those of use with multiple drives (some of which are only used only for data storage and therefore used "rarely") this is potentially useful.
If your machine is regularly going to be complete idle for 20mins, park the drives and then suddenly get busy a few moments later... well, that's either one hell of a big reoccuring coincidence or a scheduling problem.
As for being spun up while being spun down; any non-ancient hard drive will handle this gracefully itself (remember that the drive controls the spindle, not the OS).
Yes, in general, you would expect the occasions that the drive containing your system partition can switched off using this method to be very rare (unless you set the timer to be very short).
