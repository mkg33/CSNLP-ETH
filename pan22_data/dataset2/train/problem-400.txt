Since you are new to RabbitMQ clustering, so I highly recommend that you read our documentation for it -
Both nodes must be running the same version of RabbitMQ and Erlang. You create the cluster according to the documentation by running the clustering commands on one node. If you were successful the rabbitmqctl cluster_status command will indicate so.
However, one library that does support multiple nodes and reconnection is called rascal. You can either use rascal or borrow code from it (here, for example).
You don't provide details about what RabbitMQ version, Erlang version, operating system, or Node.js library you are using. Please in the future always provide people with details like this to make it easier for them to help out.
I am assuming that you are using the squaremo/amqp.node library. That library does not support providing multiple hosts in the connection URI. You must implement that yourself, and you would also have to implement connection recovery yourself. Please see this GitHub issue.
