I had the same problem in my Raspberry Pi B+, the reason of no blinking LEDs is that there is power but the SD card isn't being read at that time. So Pi is nothing but a brainless powered card. You should make sure SD card hub is clean and dustless, it might cause corrupt connection which will end with the situation you have.
Thanks to everyone who helped. This should give an extensive answer as taken from http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Pi_boots_sometimes_but_not_always
I've run into strange issues where the RPi is not getting enough power.  I wouldn't power the RPi from a USB port on your laptop and make sure the wall plug supplies at least 2 amps.
If you've got a display connected to your RPi, check to see if you have a little 4 color square in the top-right of the display when it does boot. If so, that's a sure indication you have inadequate power. 
A lot of cheap power adapters have sufficient specs, but cheap cables or other factors result in inadequate power making it to the RPi. I recommend some of the heavier-duty adapters from Adafruit and other RPi sellers.
