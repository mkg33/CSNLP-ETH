2 - also check there for any BIOS update that can help this issue but be careful about updating bios.
I had a similar problem with my cursor moving to the sides of the screen by its own :). Yesterday I have disabled my AccuPoint, as explained above, and as far as it goes, the problem is fixed. Lets see what happens after transporting the laptop in the backsac, it was when I used to have more problems with it.
This means that the rubber top piece (if your cursor stick has one attached) is most likely the cause. See if it is installed incorrectly or if it is sitting at an improper angle. Mine works as long as the rubber topper is removed, so i pretty much just threw my topper away, fixing the issue permanently.
This stopped the mouse drift, so I assume one of those onboard devices was a little faulty causing it.
3 - check touch-pad or pointer stick driver option under control panel for any option to auto disable them when you connect external mouse. my current Lenovo thinkpad has this option.
I was unable to correct this fault by the means described so I removed the battery of my laptop for 30 seconds....when I replaced the battery everything was perfect. The cursor moved by mouse control as if there had never been an issue.
I have same issue with a Sony notebook, connect external mouse + disable touch-pad and pointer stick but check below steps:
I have the same issue on a Lenovo Thinkpad running Windows 7. I usually flail it in all directions then rip the rubber top piece off out of rage, and this usually fixes the issue. When I replace the rubber piece, the cursor starts moving again.
On my Toshiba laptop I found a setting in Control Panel -> Mouse -> Advanced -> that set the track pad and little pointing stick to be disabled when a USB mouse was present.
