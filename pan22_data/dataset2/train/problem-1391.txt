Any dimensionality reduction technique suppose you are dealing with algebraic values, and categorical variables do not have such meaning.
What you can do is create dummy variables, usually a 0 and 1, which then describe the category.  In our example:
This can be done across different columns to make things easier.  It's all part of the mungification of data, getting it into shape so you can run an analysis.
So, in those cases, you do the one-hot encoding of the variables, a.k.a. dummyfication. Then you can safely apply PCA, or any other dimensionality reduction technique.
A categorical variable is just that:  a category.  It might be represented by a number but it cannot be treated like one.  For example, if you have a list of cars with their colors, and the colors are denoted this way:
you can't really work with them as numbers.  You can't say that blue is the average color, for instance, because the average of 1 + 2 + 3 is 2.
If you have a categorical variable which indicate - as example - families' pets in one of (cat, dog, red fish) mapped to (0, 1, 2), you simply cannot say that the distance between cat and dog is equal to one, because those categories do not lie in an algebraic space.
