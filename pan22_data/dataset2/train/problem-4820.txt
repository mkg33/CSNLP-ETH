But even if you get the full header, you cannot trust anything other than the last Received header (everything else can be faked). See also How to track the original location of an email via its IP address.

It looks like gmail won't show the IP if the message was sent from the web interface, but messages sent from an email program, using gmail's SMTP server will have the sending IP in the mail headers.
I think Gmail is one of the few that hide the IP for you.  Anytime I receive responses to for-sale items on Craigslist I always check the IP before replying.  I have noticed that hotmail and yahoo IPs are present, while Gmail is not.

Looking at an email from y'day sent from Gmail I'm not seeing the sender's IP anywhere in the transport header (just one Gmail server). Google has it, no doubt, but it would probably take getting a subpoena involved to get it.
As you can see its only server-server transmissions. If you wanted to know who connected with what IP, google would have that information more or less in their front-end logs instead of the backend mail logs.

Mail servers hide their senders addresses, especially if they use 'web mail'. In email exchange its server to server and the client always retrieves their email from their server. When they send an email they don't send it directly to googles mail server but it gets sent to their mail server who than hands it off to google.
