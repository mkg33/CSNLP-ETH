I am not sure this would work but, I think you should give it a whack, install Windows once, then go to install it again, on another partition and see if it let's you specify the name of the new drive that will be created. you may only get a d: but it would still be similar to what you want enough that it might do what you need
You could actually take the empty hard drive and a couple of drives that already have an OS on them and hook them all up to the same motherboard.
An ugly hack I have sometimes resorted to is create 23 tiny partitions before the destination partition. (Can be deleted afterwards.)
This is not possible with the setup of Windows. You can try to use DISM /Apply to apply the install.wim to a different partition. Maybe this works.
I am not sure that this answers your question, but hopefully it helps you to identify something that makes it easier to do what you want.
There are also tools that can change partition letters post-install (Powerquest PartitionMagic). That must be done as early as possible, because not all occurences of the drive letter in various files get corrected.
the Drive lettering isn't really static to the OS.   if I plug in a hard drive using SATA to USB cable it comes up as drive i: 
If you endeavor that, turn off the swap file first, at least Windows XP crashes badly, if swap file is unavailable.
I have a brand new PC with a blank HDD, and I want to install Windows on a partition called X: instead of C:.
