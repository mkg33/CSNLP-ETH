It lists many engines, and lists the features, helping you to select one that suits your needs. Captcha is a must. Manual intervention, Flood Control and Blacklisting are also useful. 
Fruitshow is a very simple forum that's based on the look and feel of the old Joel On Software forum.
I use Invision power Board (i have a lifelong license they don't sell anymore, it might be a little bit pricy now that they dont have that option) and its really good. I find it has a great community and i would not change it. I've never got spam if i have the nice reCaptcha and email validation. I'm sure they sell support and other tools around that. I would email them with your concerns and wait for a reply.
All forums get spam now and then, but I find that forums that use reCaptcha (as stated before) receive less spam than those with other verification services. Depending on your forum software, there will most likely be plugins for spam prevention.
I've had amazing results with Akismet. There are plugins for most major forum software - here's an implementation for phpbb3.
The primary example of Fruitshow is Crazy on Tap, which is a distant descendant of Joel's OffTopic forum.
