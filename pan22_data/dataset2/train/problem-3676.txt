So yes, ask the artist to sign over all the rights to the art, but do it before they start to work. 
And have that written. Don't delete your emails. Store them so you can easily retrieve them. If you can have a written contract, that would be the best.
It may be unlikely, but I wondered if a hypothetical vengeful artist could later decide to accuse a developer of unauthorized use of their art/copyright infringement if the art sale wasn't more explicit and "formal." 
It's not said that the artist wants the dev to only use the assets in a specific context, and since there is a transaction, it could be assumed that the artist allows the dev to use them... but it does not say anything about how they could use them.
Example: A developer commissions an artist online, and receives an email containing game sprites in return for a PayPal payment to the artist. Would the developer have full legal rights to the art at that point, or are they still vulnerable to legal jabs?
So to be on the safe side, agree on the license of the art, specifically the ownership of copyrights to the art, before anything else. Agree on what's going to be delivered (.psd, .png?), agree on the price, and agree on the dates, and agree on how the assets can be used (e.g. "I'd like to use it in game X, but also in game Y/you can use it in any of the game that you develop, but you can't resell the assets, unless you sell the whole IP."), again, before any work is done. 
To cover all worst-case scenario legal bases, does a developer need any form of written communication from an artist confirming both the purchase of, and explicit transfer of all rights to, the art assets used in a game?
