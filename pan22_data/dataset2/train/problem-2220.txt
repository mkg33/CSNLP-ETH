Are you prepared to restore, potentially, months worth of log files to reinitialise log shipping if need be?
Do you retain your log backups long enough to reinitialise log shipping from the original Full backup, or will you take a fresh Full, potentially during business hours, should you need to reinitialise?
You also need to consider other scenarios in your DR plan besides your primary server going offline. Not taking Full backups means that if you have a user-initiated bad data event (someone drops a table, deletes a record etc accidentally), your options for recovering the correct data state will be limited by the retention of your original full backup.
Full backups will not break your log chain. You should still be running regular full backups even when utilising log shipping, the key is to avoid ad-hoc log backups as these will break the log chain.
There is a question on SE and the answers provide really good information on restore chains in SQL Server. Have a read through to get a better understanding of the restore chains in SQL Server.
Log shipping utilises transaction log backups on the SQL Server. A T-Log backup will mark portions of the log that contain committed transactions as inactive and available for re-use after the backup is complete. If your backup frequency is up to 1 hour then your transaction log file could conceivably grow large due to the low frequency of backup and high volumes of transactions. Does it grow constantly or only at certain times (weekends, overnight etc)? Regardless of the cause, increasing the frequency of backups will likely fix this.
Given some of your databases have such low RPOs (30-seconds), have you considered other technology such as Availability Groups to provide much lower RPO\RTO without the overhead of shipping log backups?
