As it's the Citrix client that will drive on the remote workstation, having an RDC with multiple monitor won't help. It's encapsulated in the citrix client.
You also have to be running Windows 7 Ultimate on the machine you are RDPing into.  The other Windows 7 versions don't support the multi-monitor feature.
We have been using dual monitors in Xenapp for 4 years now since Xenapp 4.  I don't think this should be a problem.  This will work both with web interface, pnagent, receiver etc.  If you are on a very old version of Xenapp then it may not work.
What you want at the end is using more than one monitor on the client side for one single published application ?
We have a client running dual portrait mode monitors to a Win2k3 terminal server via Citrix from XP clients, but I'll have to check what the details are - I wasn't involved in setting it up in the first place. 
This will depend a lot on the version of XenApp, and the ICA client version installed on your client.  It is possible in XenApp 4.5 SR1 and up.
