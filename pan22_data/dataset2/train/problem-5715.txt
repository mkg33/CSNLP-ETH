Firstly I should say great question usr. Sean, Robert and Max have both correctly stated that due to the re-negotiation between the Primary and Secondary, that the correct LSN is always resolved so that there is not possibility of any discrepancy in that scenario.
Other thing to consider is that if you are using delayed durability, this alters the mechanics further, and could actually result in lost transactions to your Mirrored database as a whole (due to the change in behaviour of the log buffer flushes - which no longer flush on commit), but resolution would between the two would still be able to occur to find the correct lsn point.
In response to the discussion with Shanky, in Synchronous mode, the Commit first has to occur on the Mirror (as you have correctly assumed usr) and this does indeed mean that the log has to be written to (those respectively log buffers flushed to disk on commit). Remember that this only means the log file has the transaction hardened to it, but at this stage, the transaction would still be "in the redo queue". This allows for a very fast commit to the Mirror, meaning that the commit on the Primary can also occur very quickly afterwards - this thereby reduces the chances further that there would be a discrepancy in the first place.
