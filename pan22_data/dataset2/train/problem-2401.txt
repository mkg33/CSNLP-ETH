Traditionally, the WAN topology would be a hub-and-spoke with the headquarters serving as the hub (forcing site-to-site traffic to hairpin and creating a single point of failure).  More modern WAN topologies leverage the telco MPLS VPN offerings which can save money by eliminating the expensive point-to-point circuits in favor of less expensive MPLS cloud connections.  Besides money, an advantage of this is to give you any-to-any site-to-site connections and guarantees for things like QoS that you just can't find on a traditional Internet VPN.
I think where you are getting off track with OSPF is that you are envisioning the headquarters site as Area 0, but you are forgetting that OSPF works on router interfaces. If you set up the WAN interfaces of each site's WAN router in Area 0, and the LAN interfaces of each site, including the headquarters site, into a local stub area, this makes the WAN itself Area 0.
While I'm not a fan of IGP over WAN circuits (mostly due to the low circuit speeds which could cause convergence problems if there are many branch sites), I have seen this work well.  There is no single answer of eBGP, iBGP, or IGP for a WAN since there are a lot of factors to consider.
