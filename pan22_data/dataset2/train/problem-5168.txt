You should consider using a standard Linux box with the appropriate number of gigabit NICs. You can use Pfsense as the OS, it will do everything you want through a website interface.
We can't spend 10k on new firewall and i am aware that new one will have proper modules to deal with different kind of attacks...
Our network separated into two networks, one behind vintage Cisco Pix 6xx firewall and other one based on Win2008 native firewall?? mainly for media (images/videos). Pix has a limitation of 100Mbit while applications and databases never exceed 80Mbit , media (outside of firewall) grown to 300Mbit this is why it is outside of secured by firewall network.
My question is is there some fine quality and cheap firewall to support 1Gbit bandwidth or better to get 1Gbit switch layer 3 with an Access List to prevent unauthorized access for cheapest and best solution.
I think the answer to this question relies heavily on what your actual throughput is expected to be. You can push gigabit speeds with a Linux host but it would require some careful tuning that might be outside of your expertise. At the less than 500 megabit mark you are in a different situation though and a reasonable fast host should be able to do it. This is also true for Openbsd and other bsd family members which make excellent firewalls. I think the above poster got it right in that in that price range you are solidly in the "do it yourself" category. If you want a slightly more managed package you could speak with the Vyatta people who have built a fairly pleasant network centric Linux distribution based on the Xorp router that runs on re-branded commodity hardware.
