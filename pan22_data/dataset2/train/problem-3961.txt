If each query needs 75MB then are they running in parallel or serial? If parallel you must be using more than 100MB today.  If serial than I do not see why you need multiple tempDB files.  
Does this mean that a query when processed cannot make use of all the tempdb files? If I had a single tempdb of 100MB and most queries needed 75% of this file to process. 
Then I decided to split the tempdb into 4 logical files of 25MB each (giving me the same 100MB in total). If a query cannot work with mutliple files at the same time, then it won't take long before all the tempdb files are grown to 75-100MB each and I've effectively quadrupled the space requirements.
There are a lot of blog postings about splitting tempdb into multiple files, and I understand the logic and reasoning behind this, but there is one question that never seems to get asked about a multi-tempdb architecture. TempDB file growth and disk-space consumption.
The argument is always to grow tempdb files at the same rate to prevent undoing the benefits (and I may be about to answer my own question here).
If all queries combined need 75MB then you can have multiple smaller files and you will not increase overall space because those files should not grow.
And the more files you add to tempdb the more overall disk-space you have to commit. IS that correct or does the query processor use any combination of files if needed?
