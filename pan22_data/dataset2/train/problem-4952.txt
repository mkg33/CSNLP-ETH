As a one-off operation in the editor, I'd like to reset these objects' transforms, without changing the world-space positions and orientations of the children. Put another way, I'd like to push the effect of the transform down to the children.
What's the easiest way to achieve this in the editor? I've seen a lot of questions from people who want to achieve this in code, to have the effect of detaching the parent and child transforms while keeping the relationship, but that's not what I want. I'm just looking for a one-off, manual operation to make my scene file easier to edit.
I've inherited a Unity scene with quite a deep object hierarchy. Some GameObjects in the hierarchy don't have any geometry of their own, and just exist to group their children and apply a MonoBehaviour to all of their children. Because of the way the scene was authored, some of these objects have arbitrary transforms, which makes it hard to edit the child transforms, to align the children with other objects outside the group.
