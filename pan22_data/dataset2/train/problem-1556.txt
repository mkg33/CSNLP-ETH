You can also look at Centrify's Direct Control.  When we looked at it the cost of a Mac Hardware was more affordable than Direct Control so I haven't actually implemented it.  
On my company's network there are a small collection of iMacs. Currently they use Active Directory. We looked in to Apple Open Directory, but $500 for a copy of OSX Server (not to mention the Apple hardware to run it on) seemed a bit expensive.
I'm wondering if there's an alternative to Open Directory that completely or near-completely emulates Open Directory.
FreeIPA is an integrated security information management solution combining Linux (Fedora), 389 Directory Server, MIT Kerberos, NTP, DNS, Dogtag (Certificate System). It consists of a web interface and command-line administration tools.
The open source options for this are extremely hard to manage I would highly suggest you pay the $1000 for a Mac Mini Server (or two if you have the money so they'll be some redundancy).  It's VERY easy to pick up how to use the build in software (Work Group Manager) to pass out preferences and if you have it setup correctly you can use AD for your accounts and Open Directory for the Mac Preferences.
