You can get pastebin source code and deploy on your server or hosting. And secure with password. Or look to some other open source pastebin app.
I think you're going to have to make some compromises between convenience and privacy. Sites on a similar vein to pastebin are never going to guarantee any high level of privacy. 
http://www.iPaste.eu allows to protect your pastes by password. A search engine bot will get only a page where will be written that the paste is password protected.
http://codepad.org allows you to make private pastes, as a bonus you can run your code to test output. If you click the small question mark beside private, it will explain that search engines should not be able to crawl them.
I stumbled upon http://mymsg2u.com, which appears to offer sending and displaying of password protected encrypted messages, but it looks like it requires registration. 
Sites where you can share encrypted rar files of code would allow pretty much guaranteed privacy, but obviously with the loss of pastebin-esque functionality.
