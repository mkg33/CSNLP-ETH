Opening the document in LibreOffice didn't do, as it just shows the page as a big picture without a way to select a section of it.
A quick test of this would be to run a search in the document for words you know exist in the document. If the words can be found, it means the document was "printed". If words cannot be found, it was probably scanned and is an image.
If the file is an image, you can only remove entire pages, or manipulate it like an image in order to cut sections out, but you'd probably leave artifacts and jagged edges, and it wouldn't line up correctly.
If it was scanned, unless there is some awesome OCR (Optical Character Recognition) the pdf itself is a big image, hence what you're seeing in LibreOffice. If it was "printed" from a document, then it should contain the actual text and be capable of being edited.
Does someone know why? Is there a way to edit a PDF directly, saving the PDF/TIFF/PDF steps, ideally in Windows?
When saving it as TIFF, editing it PaintShopPro, and reopening it in LibreOffice, the document is displayed as about 1/3 its size in PaintShopPro, even with zoom=100%.
