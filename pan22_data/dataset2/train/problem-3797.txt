allow-hotplug tells the system to react when a specific event occurs, like plugging in your adapter.
I have a problem with one of my Pi's (running MotionEyeOS as it happens) that it appears to be suffering from low power issues, or brown outs (I also have a USB camera connected).
I have two USB wifi adapters plugged into a powered hub. When I reboot, one of them (wlan1) does not show. In order to get it to show I have to unplug it and reinsert it. Then wlan1 shows on a ifconfig and all is well, until the next reboot. If someone can help me figure out why it is misbehaving. Or, maybe help me with a script that simulates the unplug/reinsert after boot. Something like Windows Device Manager "Scan for new hardware..."
It took me a while to realise that this was caused when I use low power phone adapters, and sometimes when plugged into extension sockets.  I get much more reliable results when I use a 5v 2A power supply.
I did not try to swap the two adapters in the fist place, I asked the author if it could be a difference.
When this occurs, the WiFi never comes online and the Pi reboots (part of the MotionEyeOS featureset).
