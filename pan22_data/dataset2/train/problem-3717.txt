After you have turned the tv and back on, is it possible to unplug the HDMI cable from the tv and plug it back in?
I'd double check the output with a display on another port, and check the sleep settings in windows power saving and media center.
I think you need to diagnose the problem a little more.  You need to find out if media center is blanking the screen or if windows power saving is, or if it's showing the screen but the TV isn't picking up that input right away.
I have had a similar issue with my Apple TV. It has to do with HDMI handshaking. The TV "wakes up" but doesn't immediately notice that there is a signal. It seems to be different from device to device. I had to switch my Apple TV to component when I bought a new cable box. The cable box never has any HDMI issues.
I believe it's a problem with HDMI - as far as I know, the computer doesn't output an HDMI signal, but a DVI one (which is subset of HDMI) when the TV tries to hand-shake, there's nothing there (handshaking isn't required for DVI).
I can add that I've never quite had media center sleeping and coming back with the "power" button.. I generally just let it timeout and it wakes up with the green button.
If I'm correct, you should also see signal appearing after cycling the TV input a few times (like from HDM1 to HDMI2 to Component, etc, until you get back to your Media Center HDMI input again).
