Then you will see your all interfaces with all information. Check the metric numbers and check the interface index.
In french I saw "Service de configuration automatique WLAN" and "Service de configuration automatique WWAN". I needed to stop the second one (Wwansvc) and it worked (on windows 10)!
I found a solution for me on https://www.dell.com/community/Networking-Internet-Bluetooth/Wireless-is-disabled-when-Ethernet-is-connected/td-p/4529436
"There is a service in the Windows called "Wired AutoConfig" that you need to disable to the Wi-Fi adapter do not be automatic disabled. Do it, and enable the Wi-Fi adapter, he wont be automatic desabled again."
A ethernet (Lan server) connection makes the WiFi disable automatically in windows 8.1. By switching on the WiFi manually let only WiFi to run for few moments and the WiFi goes off again. How can I fix this?

For my Laptop HP ZBook 15u G2, it was HP LAN/WLAN/WWAN Switching UWP Services that caused it. After disabling the service, it resolved the issue. LAN/WAN Switching in BIOS was not enabled.
The key is the interface metric number. The lowest number is the first in the order. My problem was: if I connected for VPN on wired Network then the adapter get the DNS from outside because may VPN adapter metric number was higher than Ethernet adapter...
Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceIndex (the number of selected interface) -InterfaceMetric (the number of metric)
If you cant find any related service, make this changes to "WLAN AutoConfig" service. But this is strongly not recommended.
