Unfortunately, as you already broke it, only Paragon HDM & WinClone used together might be able to rescue it. Each has a different set of tools & capabilities I've used in the past to recover a drive wrecked in a similar manner.
klanomath is one of the only people I know who can pretty much knit you a new hard drive if you give him the wool. I think, though, that he has tired of spending entire days over TeamViewer fixing these messes for people; he hasn't been so active in recent months.
Golden Rule: Never attempt to modify the partition structure on a Boot Camp machine from inside Windows.
There are two companies who make software that is capable of adjusting the partitioning without having to completely remove then re-install the Boot Camp structure to resize it.  
Unfortunately, to even get that far, you need to be able to get into macOS.  Your best bet is going to be to attempt the rescue from another Mac, either by physically removing the drive if possible, or by starting up in Target Disk mode.
The third alternative, as mentioned in comments -  & by far the simplest & cheapest - is to just reformat the whole lot & recover from your backup.
