In all honesty Alexv, the easiest way would be to simply copy the data off the floppies, onto your harddisk. 
Is there something like this? I use Windows 8 64-bit (but have access to all Windows since 3.11 in visualization).
I am using RawwriteWin which is FREE and then Virtualfloppy to access them when needed, on a mounted drive
Something like an ISO but for floppies would be great. I just want to mount the file to a virtual floppy (either in a regular environment or in visualization).
You dont need an exact copy of the disc, as floppies never had any way of telling if the medium they were stored on was a "genuine" floppy or a copy.
I have used WinImage in the past.  Its not open source or freeware, but it is a great program for making images of removable media, such as floppies.  It can create images in a variety of common formats as well.
I have some old games and softwares on 3.5" floppies that are worth archiving. Since floppies demagnetize themselves with time I would like to "clone" them to another medium before it's too late.
