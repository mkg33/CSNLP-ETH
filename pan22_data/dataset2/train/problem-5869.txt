After this is done, I would recommend to go with GParted live CD and execute all partition modifying commands from there. This seems to be the most secure way of doing it.
The Risk Free way would be if you can copy(mirror) all your data from /dev/sda1 to some other partition. 
Then you should change some references (UUID or partition name) to the new partition in /etc/fstab to match the new partition, and reinstall grub on that new partition : 
I don't think you can easily extend a partition to another physical drive, although I may be mistaken. Anyway, a more straightforward thing to do in this case is to constantly mount a partition from your other drive (say /dev/sdb1) into your filesystem. For example, you could keep your /home on /dev/sdb1. That would make some space in /dev/sda1. Look into fstab on how to achieve this and don't forget to backup first.
The answers given so far don't seem to take into account that the free space you have is on another drive.
You need a live CD/temp OS to boot on it, resize the new partition to the right size, mount the old and new partitions and copy your files first with
