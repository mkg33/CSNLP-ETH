The NIDS piece usually uses heuristics along with provided data (from BitDefender) that knows when a device is acting out of line and can disconnect connections before they happen to compromise a system that may or may not have malware protection (ex. an IoT device). The Box seems to have a simplified version. 
A black box (or honey pot) is a device usually connected to a network that passively waits for connections to its systems. A normal user would never usually access the box, but automated viruses will. The system will analyze the access pattern, cross checking it with BitDefender and narrowing down the options that are available for the specific malware.
As for communications between PCs, it can use software based scanning to detect issues and if one is found, disconnect it from the network before it can cause harm to another system.
The system acts as a black box, a network infusion detector and a central hub for communication between PCs.
(Please note that most of this is generic assumptions and should be cleared up with a more detailed analysis of the device)
