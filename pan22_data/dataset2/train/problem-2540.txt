The solution was to strip the unneeded symbols from the kernel modules. I am not a kernel developer, so symbols in the modules are of no use to me. I found this thread that provided a quick way to strip the symbols: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/270390/how-to-reduce-the-size-of-the-initrd-when-compiling-your-kernel
I just ran into the same issue. It was because my initial ramdisk was too large. I don't know how big is too big, but my new kernel's initrd was about 10 times bigger than the default ones from Ubuntu. 
I found that using the previous kernel fixed the problem. So far here is the list of working and broken kernels.
Once that was done, I rebuilt the initrd and it was close to the same size as the default initrd images. Then I ran update-grub, and then I was able to boot to the new kernel.
Shortly after the new kernel versions were released for the Spectre and Meltdown issues (perhaps unrelated) I installed the latest kernel update, which at the time was 4.13.0-25.29. As soon as I rebooted I received the Grub error "Couldn't find suitable memory target".
