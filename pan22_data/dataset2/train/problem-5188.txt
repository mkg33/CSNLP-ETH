I'm not terribly familiar with administering Windows, so I'm not sure what all this means. It seems that Windows doesn't recognize that Partition 4 is an NTFS partition, which I imagine is the root of the problem. The Hidden: Yes has me a little worried too, but I (speculatively) imagine it is a symptom of not recognizing the partition type. Any ideas how to address this? Hopefully without wiping the partition and making me have to copy it again?
To do this, I connected both disks, booted into Ubuntu Live, created a new partition (using GPartEd) on the new disk, and used ntfsclone to clone the partition. Since the new partition was bigger (the whole point of migrating to the new disk), I also used GPartEd to "Check" the new partition which supposedly dealt with the partition size discrepancy.
The new partition works fine in Ubuntu Live (I can browse around, has the right label and size, etc.) but not in Windows 7. If I go to Disk Manager, I see the new partition as a "Healthy (Primary Partition)" of the correct size, but there is no drive letter assigned. If I right click, only the "Delete Volume" entry is enabled (even "Properties" is disabled!).
