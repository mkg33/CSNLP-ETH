By setting up the tunnel through the VPN server you effectively give yourself an adapter on that network - through the tunnel.
If both networks use the same network range then your system can't tell what machines are where, and will normally identify the local connection as having a lower cost to the remote connection and so send all network traffic locally.
In terms of routing, if you are already on subnet 192.168.0.0/24 then you will access it on your local connection and not route anywhere.  What you would normally exeoct is a VPN Server on a public IP address, supporting access to a private network behind it.
However you will probably find it easier to do this at the server.  Setup a second tunnel on the VPN server accessing a different private network range.  Then define an adapter on the server using that range (depending on your setup that may be easy).  You can remap IP Addresses using IPTABLES for example, but you will probably also need to remap ARP which is a bit tricker.  You can use arptables (often used in load balancer environments).
