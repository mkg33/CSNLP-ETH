Your hosting company should have a way for you to trigger a backup manually of your database via their control panel that they have provided.  Failing that you may need to call them to have them start a backup.
If you do have the ability to do backups and restores (these are different permissions) then you can backup and restore the database using the BACKUP DATABASE and RESTORE DATABASE commands.  Do keep in mind that restoring a database requires that you kick everyone out of the database.  You'll also need to be VERY careful which backup you restore from as if you restore from the wrong backup, and don't have the correct backup available you've just lost all the data.
First you'll need to know if you have the rights to backup and restore your database using SQL Server Management Studio.  I'm guessing that you'll discover that you don't, unless you have a dedicated server.  If you are in a shared hosting platform (other people are using the same SQL Server that you are) then I can pretty much guarantee that you won't have this ability.
