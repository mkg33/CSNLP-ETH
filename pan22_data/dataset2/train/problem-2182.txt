You can use screen within an xterm.  This is a program that allows you to attach and detach terminal sessions.  So you would start an xterm, start screen within the xterm, and use the xterm as normal.  To move the session, you would detach from the session within screen and exit the xterm.  Start up another xterm somewhere else, and reattach to the existing screen session.
CryoPID used to be able to move GTK+ applications (like gnome-terminal) between X servers. It's been unmaintained for a while, so it might not work at the moment, but some people have picked it up and started working on it again.
No.  Out of the box X does not have this facility.  If you want to do this the best way is to use XVNC which is an x server that renders to a VNC virtual frame buffer.  Then you can connect to your X session using a VNC client.
As shipped?  No.  There used to be a "xmovex" application which would sometimes kinda do what you are asking, but it wasn't very popular and didn't work very well.
If you want to do it with any X program, you can use NX.  It works like screen, in that you are able to detach/attach to a X server.  It also understands the X11 protocol, so it does a good job at speeding up X over slow networks.
...Crazy how many people seemed to have answered without actually reading your question. Xpra will not only let you move applications from one display to another on any machine, it will allow you to totally shut disconnect the apps from any real display and then re-attach later.
