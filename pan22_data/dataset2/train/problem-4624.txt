What does the document sensor do by default? As in, does it open up the scan dialog box on your computer or just "wake" up the scanner? 
That's sort of a Rubegoldberg / Jeri Ellsworth solution - which is why I kind of love it. I'll reiterate, obviously you'd find a software-only solution. Though my minor experiences with driver hacking were painful and maybe something like this will get your needs met with fewer tears?
People who are more comfortable with hardware, like myself, may try something kind of hacky... In the end, it always depends on what your needs are. You could attempt:
If it triggers a response on your computer then the easiest thing to do would be to create a macro that clicks the scan button for you. Another more complex option would be to write a small application that listens for the packets from the printer (would probably have to dissect the driver though and use a packet sniffer such as Wireshark for this though).
Otherwise if it just wakes up the scanner then I think you will have to do some form of hardware hack.
