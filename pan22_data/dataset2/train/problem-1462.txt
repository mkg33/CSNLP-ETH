[LAN access from remote] is triggered anytime an external connection is routed into the internal network via a forwarded port. This can be either an explicit (ie: a specific port or range of ports set with port forwarding/port triggering) or automatic (ie: UPNP) route. Most of the time, this message indicates success, but if you have invalid port forwarding rules, this message will still appear even though the connection was not successful.

According to the netgear forum, if you have a torrent or a number of other valid applications, you may see traffic like this. See here 
In my case, whenever I've seen these remote connections, the local  port was being used by Skype, which I suppose makes sense since Skype uses P2P connections to other Skype clients.
Try getting a tool like TCPView and check which program is using the local port in question (8085 and 59850 in your logs above).
Using a P2P application, such as Bittorrent or Skype, will result in many of these logs if you have UPNP enabled - this is normal.
