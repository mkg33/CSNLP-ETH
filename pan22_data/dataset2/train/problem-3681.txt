You might want to try cfg2html, which dumps your configuration to an HTML file, which you can then fetch at regular intervals and serve from a central server.
If you want something that would work on a server that has no X, have a look at htb (seems to be abandoned), or at VOoM vim plugin.
All these tools use plain text files or XML as backend. Teamed with some version control, they make a powerful combination.
But we also lock down our wiki, users can't see almost any page unless they are logged in. Also, the page where spreadsheet file is installed is controlled using  tags which uses accesscontrol extensions. 
Another alternative would be fossil. It is a distributed version control tool with built-in wiki and ticket tracker. It's a single binary which can also work as CGI and serve a web interface, thus making it available over network. fossil as a mini-CMS for a website is very powerful.
My suggestion would be just to build a wiki to centralize information and get a script to edit pages so that configuration files are updated on the wiki automatically through a cron job.
What distro are you using? There are some quite convenient tools for managing and auditing conffiles, and they generally depend on the package manager.
We have 4 data centers in 3 countries. We have over 500 production servers. Like some ppl said above, we use wiki and attach spreadsheet files on wiki. The good thing about that is, when you update your spreadsheet and attach it back on your wiki, it keeps the history of that. Like who updated the file and when.
Next time you tweak a machine, you should install etckeeper on it first. That way you will keep a log of configuration changes.
