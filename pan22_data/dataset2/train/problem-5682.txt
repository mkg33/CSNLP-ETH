3- Now assign position w.r.t. these percentages. Like, GUI.Label(new Rect((50.0f/428.0f) * Screen.width, (50.0f/321.0f) * Screen.height, 300, 300), ("Hello!"));
2- Find out the percentage of current position with resolution. If I consider GUI.Label(new Rect(50, 50, 300, 300), ("Hello!"));, then it'd be 50.0f/428.0f width percentage and 50.0f/321.0f height percentage.
I have a work around for this problem. Idea is to assign position in percentage instead of hard coded coordinates.
1- First find out your base resolution, on which further work will base on. Print Screen.width and Screen.height. In my case it is 428 x 321.
I recommend watching this series of videos by 3DBuzz on youtube.  It goes in depth about how to set up UIs in Unity.
Instead of using a gui label, you could simply add a text object to your project hierarchy (Create->UI->Text).  This will automatically add a canvas object as well.  Changing the UI scale mode on your canvas scaler to "Scale with Screen Size" will make the UI scale based on the screen resolution.  You would then set the anchors/pivot of your text object depending on exactly how you want it to behave.
