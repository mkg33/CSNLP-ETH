Modern Antiviruses are a little rubbish, don't assume you're fine because you've got one (though they can help)
You first need to find out which system process it is. Go to Task Manager, Processes tab, and click twice on the column "CPU Time" to sort descending (if it's not there, add it from the menu View / Select columns...).
The System process taking up an entire core shouts "Driver issues!" quite loudly to me, anything been updated or changed recently? Any devices showing a bit iffy in Device Manager?
Many a times, when Windows is trying to update, the corrupted AV/FW can interfere with Windows Update. Badly updated Windows can also wrack havoc on CPU usage time.
I've once had that with the IDE controller reverting itself to PIO mode. Though that was on an ancient system, dunno whether that even happens anymore with modern OSes :-)
Also don't forget that AV software can even cause this themselves. It's not uncommon for them being a performance problem :-)
If not, right-click on the system process and choose "Go to service(s)". This will open the Services tab and highlight one or more services. Please include their names (or a screenshot) in your post for us to see.
This could be a process doing heavy I/O. Since that is performed by the System "process" you would see the CPU usage spike there.
