I would suggest installing an older version of VMWare's hypervisor (ESXi 3.5 may run), or any very-stripped-down Linux system & VMWare Server.  You could also look in to any of the Xen stuff (http://www.xen.org/products/) for an approach that might be a bit better on less robust hardware.
Even at that though, a Celeron is a pretty wimpy machine for a VM Hypervisor -- How much RAM do you have & what's the processor speed?My gut says performance in VMs on this box will probably be pretty dreadful, and it may be better to just dedicate it as a (physical) development machine...
Well, if it is a single core celeron processor, you will end up with VMs that will be painfully slow. Get at least a dual core processor; that gives at least a core for all VM's. I usually keep 2.5 vCPUs for each core.
I echo someone else's sentiment about OpenVZ.  I just went through this a few months ago, and I was able to effectively run ~40 VMs on an old Thinkpad laptop.  ESX is probably a more full-featured solution, but I can't really see an old machine keeping up with full x86 emulation on 40+ instances.
