Good luck getting Wake on Lan (WOL) working - I've tried every variation from every forum for my hardware over the past month and failed on all of them, including:
You can modify a wireless doorbell to turn your pc on and off rather easily. Check out the 3-page guide here
There is a Wake-On-Lan feature for BIOS. You can use a relay with circuit (to send appropriate current at appropriate voltage) to trigger it on.
Windows has the feature that it can listen to events even while asleep (not sure this is the correct way of describing it). In Windows power management its called "Allow wake timers". When this is active, software can wake up the computer at a specified time. Alarm clocks for Windows use that feature.
One way to wake up a Windows PC at a scheduled time is to create a scheduled task using Task Scheduler and check the "Wake the computer to run this task" option. Then put the PC in hibernate/sleep/suspend mode instead of powering it off.
It's rather off-topic, but may prove useful to others in similar situations but slightly different requirements.
