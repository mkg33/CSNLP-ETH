please if some one knows the solution, i tried different directories and rsynced files always land not in created folder with date but higher, for example in /home/lol/
i think a better solution for your goal is to use python's datetime and makedirs. then start one os.system bash process for rsync.
In the second line, $DATE isn't defined anymore as you start a new shell and it has lost the variable definition of the first call. 
I have this problem with bash in python. I want to make script that will make folder based on system date - and this works just fine. The problem is when I want to rsync two directories one with my files to backup and other that is created with system date in name. 
in your example you start a bash and you set the DATE variable so the DATE variable is only available in this bash process. when you start a new bash (for your rsync) you doesn't have set a DATE variable. When you read this variable it is empty. that's why you copy to /home/lol. so for your script just set the DATE variable in the second (rsync) bash process. 
Why don't you wrap this into a single shell script or feed the date from Python?  Why are you using Python anyway? Frankly, your approach is nonsensical.
