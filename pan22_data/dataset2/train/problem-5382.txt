PHP Warning:  move_uploaded_file(): Unable to move '/tmp/php7qcj4A' to '/var/www/html/test.zip' in /var/www/html/*snipped*/upload.php on line 86, referer: http://foobar.com/*snipped*/upload.php?dir=/
Next step is to remove the '777-junk' again. It is never ever a good idea to open a directory worldwide, and it is almost never needed either. Not even for temp, cache or other folders like this. Just ensure that the webserver can read-write-execute it.
I don't know if that has anything to do with my problem really.. As I've changed that yesterday and it still worked.. But today I decided to update PHP from 5.1.6 to 5.3 and I've restarted apache.. 
(check your apache configuration for the user directive and take the value from there. It doesn't necessarily have to be www-data).

If /var/www/html/ holds all your web-files, you have to take care that your webserver user has appropriate rights to access the directory. You can fix this by changing the owner of the directory recursively to whatever your webserver user is
