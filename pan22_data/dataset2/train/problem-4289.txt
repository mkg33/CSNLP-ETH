On top of 'features' and 'load' that everybody else here is thinking about, I would think very carefully about brand...
If you are putting it within easy reach and deploying 1-5, think about Netgear/Linksys, if you are deploying these to a location you don't want to go back to think about Cisco/HP. You pay a premium for the Cisco ones - and it only really makes sense to buy them if you have lots of other Cisco kit, otherwise I'd go for HP.
We had a heck of a job finding a quiet, smallish, PoE switch for our cabinet that would allow the doors to close :) ended up with 2x12 ports of PoE (with 12 non PoE each) rather than one 24 port PoE. Gives a little less single point of catastrophic failure too. 
If you have a small network, you probably don't really need most of the features, and a simple inexpensive switch will be fine.  If you have high security demands, a VoiP system, a complex network, you'll need more features.
I can't believe no-one has mentioned size - often switch cabinets are small, and switches large - especially PoE ones. 
The other main consideration is management. Do you REALLY need to logon to it and look at the traffic running across it. Really..? It will cost you a hefty premium and if you just want to check connectivity/disable the occasional port, check temp/power, etc... Most decent ones (again, HP/Cisco) will give you that in the 'non-managed' version.
