If I go to the test directory eg. cd /var/www/html/test and type in ./sendMails.php my script runs perfect. 
I think it is not good to hardcode the absolute path in each script, at least if there is no real necessity. This is a strong portability limit.
In the test directory is a folder called template and in the template folder is a file with the name index.htm. index.htm is being read in sendMails.php via the php function file_get_contents .
Now I run the script from my home directory eg. php /home/roland/sendMails.php and I get the following error file_get_contents(template/index.htm): failed to open stream: No such file or directory and don't understand why, now this will then also fail if I setup a cron. 
Create a shell script that changes directory and runs the php script; then call this shell script from cronjob.
I'm running a Centos 5 server and want to set up a cronjob to run on every 10th of each month, but I have to following concern.
The right way is to calculate the absolute path at runtime using dirname(__FILE__) to retrieve the dir of the current script (the script itself, not the includer of the script if it exists)
