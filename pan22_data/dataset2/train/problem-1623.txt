A machine on your network running on a botnet providing bandwidth for ICMP PING saturation of a host is one realistic scenario.
2) written by people to make your network hard for diagnostics and to make you call a company that will fix it for you :)
Security is frequently thought about in a "blacklist everything, whitelist whats needed" context, aft to a tinfoil hat level of limiting outbound connections until someone complains.  While its easy to ask "why block" .. a security expert will ask "why do you need" ...  This is why a corporate network is very restrictive (blacklist first) vs a standard home network (whitelist everything outgoing).
I think this is not a big deal but this can be considered as a practice used in "default deny policy" used in systems administration. The reason for blocking ICMP would be avoiding ICMP DOS attacks against another host. (To be ethical)
Another reason to block outbound ICMP is to (attempt to) foil port scanners. Many firewalls will silently drop inbound packets denied by security policy (usually an ACL). However, if a packet is allowed through, and the destination application itself isn't running, most servers will return an ICMP Unreachable packet of some type. This difference in behavior for an unavailable port can give an attacker valuable insight into your network.
These icmp dos attacks were useful 10 years ago. Nobody will use them now and this is stupid thing to filter all icmp packets.
