In an ideal world you could just turn UAC off and everything would hum along fine with no isues.  It's not an ideal world, and UAC exists for a reason - to warn you that an application you're using is about to make some potentially serious changes or do some deep-down OS-level stuff that might make your system unhappy IF the app is in any way malicious or plain-old-fashioned badly-written.
We've just upgraded to Windows 2008 server, and I'm already getting really sick of approving dozens of UAC messages.  I normally disable UAC on my personal Vista machines, but I'm reluctant to do this on our server.  Is there any particular reason I should leave it on?
Added safety, to be simple. If users aren't regularly installing software on the server, it's probably best to leave it on there.
It depends on your environment really.  I'd say if you consider yourself a decent admin with a secure environment, then it's probably safe to turn off.  I've turned it off on a few of our boxes partly due to my ignorance of forgetting to run things as an admin.  It saves me time and hassle.  And honestly some of these boxes are so protected and locked down already, I'm not missing much if I turn it off. 
Yes diabling UAC is a bad idea.  You should not disable it on your personal machines or your servers.  It's a minor inconvienience with a sizeable payoff.  The UAC on the server should be annoying as a reminder that everythig you are doing should and could be done without being logged onto the servers desktop.
I'd be seriously concerned about the kind of apps you're running on your server if you're generating a lot of UAC prompts.  On the other hand, if it's something like Lotus Domino that might just be the way things have got to be (we don't all have nice clean servers that only require the MS admin tools to manage...)
