That's a pretty tight grip the customer has on its wallet if there's no interest in upgrading a 9-year-old PC at today's entry-level system prices.  
Anecdotal info ... Just this week we were exploring memory upgrades for our accounting staff.  For recent PCs (18 months old), we got 2GB of RAM for $32.  For some older PCs (3+ years old), we could only get 512MG sticks at $80, so 1.5GB would cost $240.
Don't waste time talking technology/speed/life cycle with this guy .. he doesn't care.  He thinks that you are using the project as an excuse to do PC upgrades and increase your fees.
I think my microwave runs an 80286 processor.  Although newer processors exist, I haven't felt the need to upgrade my microwave - as it still heats up food just fine.  
I was given the task to determine the life span of a computer with a Pentium 1 processor.  One of our clients is unwilling to upgrade their computers in order for our software to run and we are looking for documentation on how outdated these computers are.
I think you'll find the experience of most has been that the CPU is one of the more reliable components in the PC. The drives, fans, and motherboards are more likely to fail due to age than the CPU. Like the other responders, I'm unaware of any official end-of-life documentation from Intel.
If the client is wanting a field added to their VB4 data entry application, it might not make economic sense to upgrade the computers it runs on.  I think you need to determine how much it's going to cost you to maintain support for the Pentium 1.  The client may be happy to pay you additional costs to maintain support than to upgrade a fleet of old computers.
I would change the subject from the age/speed of the computers to the time it takes people to do the work.  Install the software on one of the dogs and test it.  If the software performs acceptably, leave it alone.  But if it doesn't, the argument is about how much the people cost and their productivity.
