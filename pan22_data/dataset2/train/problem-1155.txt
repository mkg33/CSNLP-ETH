The default SQL Trace of my instances shows the following issue for native SQL logins (non-domain accounts):
On a hunch, we remove the Symantec Endpoint Client which was a full deployment.  We've had issues with the Network filter-level driver in the past.
What edition of SQL Server? Have you checked whether you have logon triggers enabled? (Your logon trigger could have a performance issue.) 
This is SQL Server 2005 with Service Pack 3 on Windows 2003 R2 with Service Pack 2 on VMware 4.1.0 with the latest VMware tools installed.
I've done some digging and haven't been able to find what tolls to use or metrics to gather to better assign the login validation performance issue.
On reboot we saw significant improvement in general performance and the login timeouts.  We'll adjust the SEP deployment for AV only to eliminate the troublesome network filter driver.
Definitely sounds like most of the time was spent validating login - so if it's not a logon trigger, then maybe it's some other resource constraint - for example, how many logins in the system?
