If you need zero touch refresh/update capabilities, add SCCM to the mix (which will still use templates and other stuff from MDT).
I have discovered various Microsoft tools, including WDS, WAIK, MDT, but I'm struggling to find anything that gives a coherent overview of how they fit together and how to do it. (I fear that my reliance on googling will not serve me as well for MS products).
This may help your understanding but from what is sounds like you don't have a green field, all your doing is moving existing infrastructure that's already been designed to 2008, which has it own problems.
This is just to start with, but I would use Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT). It uses WAIK internally (to create a boot cd/dvd for starters).
If your looking for overview architectural descisions for Windows Servers and differing roles then have a look at Microsoft's Infrastructure Planning and Design documents.  It's very thorough, at a high level covering all the different services that encompass a Windows Server deployment.
I've been given the task of defining a server build and build process for a move to Windows Server 2008 for a few hundred physical machines and a few hundred VMs.
I realise that this is a big topic, but is anyone able to make any recommendations as to the best tools and techniques for creating a Windows Server 2008 build including applications.
I'm from a Solaris background and am trying to pick things up from someone who has moved on and left no documentation for previous processes.
As suggested for a large server deployment then you should look at System Centre Configuration Manager  This used to be called Systems Management Server (SMS) in Win2k3.
