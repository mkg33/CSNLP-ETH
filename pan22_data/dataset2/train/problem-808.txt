Right back to my original problem - the server is full. I found a 42 M file under / that I didn't need anymore, so I deleted it. But yum install lvm2 still gives me the exact same problem. This makes no sense to me - I removed 42000 k worth of file just now. That should have easily given yum the 100 k that it says it needs.
If your host simply added 300GB to /dev/xvda2 all you need to do is grow the partition with fdisk and the filesystem using resize2fs
Okay... could be a rounding issue where it's showing something like 24.5 G as 25 G and 24.499 G as 24 G. So I double check without the h and see:
So I need to install them. I found something suggesting that yum install lvm2 would install those commands for me. This spits out a lot of output, ending with:
My understanding (which comes from this article), is that in order to continue adding files to my existing file system, I need to add this new 300 GB drive to the existing logical volume.
To add it to my existing logical volume, I need to use a whole variety of commands... pvcreate, pvdisplay, lvdisplay... but none of those seem to be installed on this server.
I have a CentOS 7 server on SoftLayer. I only gave it 25GB of storage initially. Now it's full, so I ordered an additional 300GB of storage for it.
