Indeed the configuration wizards assume that all required Windows accounts (AD or Workgroup) exists (you see a Test link aside each input box).
I'm a developer and got the order to install a Team Foundation Server (2017) on a Windows 2012 Server (no RC) in our Network. All Clients of the network authenticates over a Active Directory, so it would make sense to stick to the same mechanism with TFS. (I know that it would work with workgroups but i would rather use what's in place...) 
Honestly, i'm a bit scared to interrupt our Active Directory which would have direct impact on our network.
TFS stores users and groups, permissions and security, into its own database. To integrate with Windows Security by running a background job every hour and reading users and groups from AD.
As a TFS Administrator, you have no dial for this job, but you should periodically look for errors in the Job Monitoring page (see New tools for TFS
Instead, you should prepare your DNS configuration, if possible , to facilitate future changes and reconfiguration of your TFS infrastructure: see this and this posts.
