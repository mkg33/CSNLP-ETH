In the options section there is a place to specify HotKeys.  You can see screenshot where I've setup a hot key for Crtl + Shift + C
but on the issue of finding your mouse you CAN turn on "pointer sonar" so your pointer will be  honed into when you press the control key. (currently on a mac but I will try and get screen shots in a moment and edit it in)
Turning on "Show location of pointer when I press the CTRL key" is one option. This is especially useful if it is currently changed to some custom mouse pointer by an application, like a paint brush, that is harder to see. 
regarding macro idea. I guess its plausible...but I dont know of any app that has this already programed, or how to program this myself
I have a three monitor set up on Windows 7 and I sometimes lose track of where my cursor is. Is there any Windows shortcut to reset the mouse position? I'm guessing there is not, but might there be a way to set up a simple macro I could bind to a key combination to set my cursor to a default location, such as the center of the primary display?
Here's an AutoIt script to do it. AutoIt can compile its scripts to .exe, which you could then assign a hotkey.
