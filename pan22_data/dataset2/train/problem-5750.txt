My advice WRT wifi adapters is to buy them from a store and not online if possible.  The reason for this is they are pretty cheap to begin with and do not vary greatly in capabilities by size, so there is no advantage to spending hours browsing around for one with has better specs for fewer bucks, etc.  Presuming you don't spill coffee on it, a brick and mortar store will usually do a refund or exchange, no questions asked, within 7 days (at least most of them will in N.A., be sure to check).  So if it turns out not to work properly, you can just bring it back and get another one.  Also, stores tend to have much less selection than online retail, and that selection will be the most popular and commonplace items (which are more likely to have well tested linux drivers).
The official Realtek N10 driver is here http://www.asus.com/Networking/USBN10/HelpDesk_Download/ and can be used to build for RPI, but usually there are people on github who already integrated them ( just google the driver name and rpi - example result for this dongle is https://github.com/ksclarke/rtl8192cu )
I am running the 8192cu version of the Asus N10. I needed to disable power management by creating the file /etc/modprobe.d/8192cu.conf with the contents: 
Unfortunately you will not be able to tell which one this is by looking at the box or an online ad.  You have to stick it in a machine and get the USB ID (in this case, either 0b05:17ba or 0b05:17d3).
After reboot it was stable. Running on Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry B with jessie and kernel 4.1.15. Driver was included in the OS.
1. USB IDs are what the OS uses to identify a device and select an appropriate driver.  Sometimes there are devices whose IDs aren't listed, but for which an existing driver will work if loaded manually.
I'm using a Jessie Raspbian 4.1.19+ with that Asus N10 Nano / 0b05:17ba and it will work out of the box, but it seems the 8192cu precompiled driver in the distro might not support AES, so in my case it only worked to set router to TKIP explicitly.
My router was on Auto AES/TKIP choice, which worked perfectly fine while N10 was plugged in the PC, but on RPI it failed with an error in /var/log/syslog or /var/log/wpa-supplicant.log
I suggest a free driver USB wifi adapter for raspberry pi.it uses RTL8188UCS chip. I order a one from amazon on line,and works well.the links is http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014SP9FN0 .
