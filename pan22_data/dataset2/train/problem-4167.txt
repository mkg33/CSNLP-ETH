In sublime text, we can press ⌘⇧P to bring up the command palette. Are there any similar tools for vim?
This is exactly what Vim's command-line is for. The only difference is that you don't get the cool but ultimately unnecessary fuzzy search you get in ST.
I’ve been trying vim-ctrlp-cmdpalette, and although it works relatively well (there are some small issues), it depends on ctrlp (not a huge problem), and it looks like it won’t see much development (it has 14 commits over the course of 3 days, 5 months ago, for an “Initial experimental version”), so I was wondering if there are any known alternatives, since searching for “vim command palette” is a bit limiting; maybe there are some other terms more appropriate for this.
It would help if you elaborated on what you meant by a command palette. I am guessing you mean this:
If you want to go down the plugin road, it's probable that you'll find what you want for unite or you could try Paradigm's SkyBison.
