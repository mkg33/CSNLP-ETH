The solution is simple: You installed the dropbox App; You have to install the desktop client (the classical windows application).
Note that I also disabled Windows Defender ahead of this step, although I am not sure that it made any difference, but just in case, you may want to try that as well. Search windows defender in the start menu, go to settings, in the left hand menu, select administrator, then uncheck the box and save.
I was unable to locate the system location of Dropbox, therefore unable to display Dropbox in file explorer. What I was able to do was open Dropbox, once open, right click to bring up the bottom bar options and select upload and select the destination of the files/documents you wish to retrieve and save into Dropbox.
I had the same problem. I tried downloading the dropbox installer from their website but it would not launch.
In Windows 7 I had a folder for Dropbox in File Explorer. It is not present in Windows 8 although I have installed the Dropbox App for Windows 8?
However, after you download the installer, view it in folder (whichever destination folder you chose, in my case it was Downloads) and right-click, then select run as administrator. It may give you a warning message, and just continue. Voila, dropbox on your desktop.
