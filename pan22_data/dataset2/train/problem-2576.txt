where public_html is your DocumentRoot for example.com (couldbe called httpdocs or some other name based on your hosting env)
On my shared hosting, I have just created a new subdomain static.example.com but it has also create a new folder www.example.com/static/ . 
I guess the reason why this folder is created is simple. The hosting company just adds a entry into your DNS zone file, something like:
static is now a sibling of old DocumentRoot and not a child of it. It will be no longer addressable via www.example.com/static now. /static is a new DocumenRoot for your new subdomain.
One solution is that you can ask your hosting company to put the static folder outside your current document root so that it is not addressable as a subfolder of current DocumentRoot. 
On a shared hosting site the hosts software normally does this. I think this is an unintended behavior and you should contact your host provider. It is not normal that a subdomain can be accessed via appending a path to the main domain.
where W.X.Y.Z is the IP of your existing site 'example.com'. Then they'd creates a virtual host in apache config - static.example.com and sets its DocumentRoot to  <server_path>/public_html/static.
I am sure your problem is not with the folder itself (how else will you organize all the files for static sub-domain if not in a subfolder) but with the fact the files are also accessible via the URL www.example.com/static
