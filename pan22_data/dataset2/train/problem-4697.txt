On both of them, the anacron setup is broken, ... and they have been broken since I first installed Ubuntu.  It has only come to my attention recently, when I realize my log files were not rotating.
Upstart actually uses config files in /etc/init for each service, not /etc/init.d.  I assume the /etc/init.d links are there to preserve compatibility with sysvinit.  Here's the upstart getting started guide which explains this.
/etc/cron.daily/logrotate can be started without anacron, when /usr/sbin/anacron not existed(/etc/crontab):
I don't have an ubuntu system so I can't check the contents of /etc/init/anacron.conf, but I suspect from gooling it might just be exec anacron -s.  Check in /etc/init.removed/ and see if there is an anacron.conf there that was removed by some upgrade process.  You might be able to reinstall anacron to fix this as well.
Take a look in /var/log and see if your log files are being rotated (as opposed to growing indefinitely).  If they are being rotated, then you probably have a working anacron, so please check your setup and let me know how it differs from mine.
This part works correctly:  Every morning at 7:30am, cron executes this command to start up anacron.
