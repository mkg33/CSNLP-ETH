I'm assuming you're talking about this and i'm doing this under windows 7 ultimate not sure if it matters, anyway...
The Library Recorded TV exists, as you can add it to the right side of the Windows 7 Start Menu, but It doesn't appear in the Libraries Folder? Is it possible to make it appear there? I went to start menu, properties, customize to show the Recorded TV library on the right side of the start menu and changed: name of the library and directories it was linked to; to kind of add a custom item to the menu. I discovered a way to change the icon on libraries, but only the ones that appeared in the Library drop down of the explorer window. Therefore, I was wondering If there were alternatives to this method as well.
If navigate in windows explorer to "C:\Users\Public\Libraries" right click on "Recorded TV"  and click copy.
I figured it out as I remembered that this was possible but had forgotten since I had Windows 7. You basically need to navigate to C:\Users\Public\Libraries and copy the file/shortcut you see for Recorded TV and paste that into the respective user location for libraries, which is C:\Users{Name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Libraries.
Then navigate to "C:\Users{your use name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Libraries" and click paste.
