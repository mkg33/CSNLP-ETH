Another option is to "special" paste the Excel information into the Word document as a picture.  This allows you to resize the entire table to fit on a single page.  Drag a corner of the table-picture to ensure the ratio of the sides to the top and bottom stay the same.  The drawback is that a reader can't copy your table into Excel and do more with it nor can they add columns or rows in Word.  I like to do this when I want to ensure someone won't mess with my numbers, but still might want to edit the wording. 
I have a MS Word 2010 document with many small tables. I would like to prevent those tables from breaking up over pages. I know it is possible to prevent a single row to break up. But I would like the following:
You can also adjust properties for multiple rows os a table by selecting the whole table before setting row properties. Hover on the top left corner of the table to get the table selection icon which looks like a + with arrows on its ends.
Yes you can. Highlight the entire table by clicking the icon with the arrows at the top left of the table. Then click Paragraph Properties from the toolbar and tick Keep with Next.
I don't think there is a setting to allow the entire table to stay on the same page, simply because your table may be too long to contain within a single page.
