It also has file association options, so that you can set windows to use liberkey apps by default rather than it's regular ones. This means you don't really need to install any additional apps on your system apart from some anti virus (Microsoft Security essentials is what I use). Although the image below shows how detailed you can be - there is also just a simply file associations on/off button!
Depends on the application.  Some will function well, many will not.  The listing at http://portableapps.com/apps may be of interest in selecting and setting up apps in a Dropbox.
Yes, you can place them in dropbox. But the catch is you either need to download the app from a browser then find them in your downloads folder using a file explorer then place it in dropbox, or you could also use a file manager that allows you to share apps these file managers are extremely hard to come across. There is one on android 4.0.1 (androids with google framework). Have fun sharing your apps!
I will add that I put a lot of applications in dropbox and for the most part it works great as long as it's nothing too complicated. Applications that try to autoupdate from the Internet can cause problems though. For applications that require installation in Windows I usually install it, copy the folder from Program Files into Dropbox and then uninstall the application. This works fine for maybe 80% of applications. Alternatively you could install it and create a symlink in Dropbox which should enable automatic updates to work, as long as they are only installed on the original machine. Of course portable apps all work great in Dropbox where that is an option.
