So, what is the best approach (considering a Gentoo with a 2.6.36 kernel) to remedy this?  I recon that there probably are two approaches:
i'm guessing if its a text only system, vbetool may do the trick. For the graphical system "xset dpms force off" may work, if dpms is set up for the x based system (which would need the option for dpms to be in the xorg conf file) 
On a couple of Linux laptops I have the built in screen never turns off it's backlight, regardless if a 'black screen' sort of screen saver is activated (this both for a laptop running an X-based desktop as well as for a laptop only having a text console) or if I even close the lid of the laptop (looking carefully in the dark, I can tell that the screen still has the backlight on, even if the laptop "know" it is closed).
The laptops I have in mind is a Dell Latitude CPi (built 1999, yes, it is from another millenea), a Compaq Armada M700 (built 2001) and a Dell Latitude D630.
If this can be accomplished only by configuring things in the Linux OS (be it kernel setup or editing config files) without touching anything in BIOS, that would of course be preferable.
