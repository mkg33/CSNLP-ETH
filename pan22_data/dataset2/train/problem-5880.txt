Also note that at any time if you wish to make a linked clone an independent one, you can make Full Clone of that linked clone, and you will have it. I think the reverse process is impossible (making given clone linked over a given base in order to save disk space). Please, someone correct me if I am not right.
The linked clone is also faster to take, but you have to be careful when removing VMs - if you delete the base image for a given linked clone, that linked clone will die. I am a VirtualBox (happy) user: there you can see for a given machine (Settings -> Storage -> stop the cursor over the virtual HDD image) whether that image is based on another one, and what is the base. But for now I don't know how to make sure before deleting a VM that it is not a base for any other linked clone.
I've seen documentation for the Full and Linked virtual machine clones, but I can't seem to fully understand when I should use one over another. I see that the full clone creates a copy of the VM, but what about the linked one -- does it mean whatever I do in one VM will be reflected in another? That doesn't make sense to me...
