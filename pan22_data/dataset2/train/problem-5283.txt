As the other answer suggested, using static IPs is the easiest route, otherwise if you have a decent router with advanced options you can usually enable the setting to resolve hostnames so you can ping your computers by name. If you don't have a router that is that smart, you can try using something like dnsmasq running on a Linux VM to keep track of the hostname<>IP mappings.
On your server machine you can set up "aliases" in newer versions of Synergy for the client screens, but that doesn't help with the client trying to resolve the server.
Absolute worst case (may introduce some latency) if you have Synergy Pro with the SSL encryption option (huge security risk if you don't) you can open a port in your firewall (don't use the standard Synergy port) and then forward that to your server and use any of the dynamic DNS providers (dyndns.org/noip.com/etc) to register a static DNS name and then your router or your server machine can run an update client to up your "hostname" with your external IP and the port forward will allow your clients to reach through and talk to the server.
