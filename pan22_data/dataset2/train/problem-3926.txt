If you have a RHEL subscription then you can login into your RH account and download the RPM then install it with yum -y install x.y.z.rpm. Otherwise, you can also take the package from a CentOS repository, it should be 100% compatible. For example this URL. By the way, the latest version is .65 and you should really use that.
Do you have outbound internet access from the machine? If so, you can download the RedHat OpenJDK RPM from here and then run rpm -i open_jdk_file_name.rpm.
Serverfault is for business environment, so the optimal solution here is to purchase Red Hat support and use it.
I read some tutorials but they seem to use yum to carry this out but the server is not configured so that it is registered on the Red Hat subscription network.
If the security rules stand in the way, you can use a regular proxy with yum. If more security is required, you can set up your own Spacewalk repository, or get an entire ISO, configure it as a repository and yum update from that ISO.
I believe this will perform an upgrade, but you can always run rpm -e old_java_package_name first to remove the old version before installing the new.
