I am new to IBM MQ, although i have some experience with RabbitMQ. There are people in the company with a lot of experience with IBM MQ, but none of cloud applications. I've been told several times by them that we need to run a queue manager on the box with our application, which can then forward to other queue managers, but on a cloud machine with an ephemeral disk, that doesn't make any sense to me - it doesn't add any reliability.
My team is in the process of building an application that will be deployed on AWS EC2, and will communicate with on-premise legacy systems via IBM MQ (formerly known as WebSphere MQ, formerly known as MQSeries).
We already have IBM MQ queue managers on our premises. Do we also need to deploy one in EC2? Do we need to deploy them on the EC2 boxes where our application will run?
To add some bonus fun, we're not deploying the application directly on EC2, but on Cloud Foundry deployed on EC2, so the app instances are running inside containers that we don't have much influence over.
We could deploy a queue manager on an EC2 machine with an EBS volume, which would make a bit more sense, and have our applications talk to that. But is that really any better than just talking directly to the existing queue managers on our own premises?
