Caveat: For a slideshow you usually want a certain order and this is easy if you sort it in Explorer, select all files and open it with the Live Photo Gallery. This only works if you choose yes when you open Photo Gallery on its own the first time and it's asking you whether you want to open JPG,.. with it by default. Otherwise you can only open a single picture with it via Open With in explorer. Don't ask me why. If you don't want the default stuff, then you can alternatively open Photo Gallery and use its integrated file explorer for sorting etc.
Just download Windows Live Essentials and install the Photo Gallery. Different from the stock photo viewer in Windows 7, this photo gallery can actually play videos and also does that in slideshows.
Drad & Drop all photos & videos to standard Windows Media Player and enjoy! (works in windows 8, it auto rotates videos from iPhone)
I Know this is an old Post. But If some one is looking for Slideshow that has both video and Image and mostly from command line, also video will be shown as image with play button an user can click play to play movie.
Taken snapshot of the movie using VLC and had naming convention to Identify that this is a movie and file name of original movie
You can use GNOME's gThumb image browser. It can sort media by recording time (EXIF) and present both photos and videos in a folder in the same interface / slideshow.
Feh Configured Action button 0 ([Return Key]) to execute a shell program which is playing in VLC full screen and stop after playing.
