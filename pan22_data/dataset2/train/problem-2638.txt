As you can see from the example above whenever the gender is undefined, there are missing values in both age and tenure and this is the case overall in the entire dataset. What would be the best way to deal with such a situation? And this what is called a Missing at Random data, is that right? Any suggestions would be extremely helpful. Thanks a lot.
I have a dataset with 20,000 observations and 19 variables. To start off with I have a gender column which has three levels namely 'M', 'F' and 'U' where U can be taken as not disclosed. Whenever there is a 'U' in the gender column, there is an NA in two of the other columns namely Age and Tenure. This could basically be interpreted as a person who is not ready to disclose their Gender is not ready to disclose their age and tenure. How do I deal with such a situation? Apart from these three columns there are other 16 columns in the dataset that have got meaningful data in them. Would the normal imputation techniques out there like a KNN Imputation help me out in such a case?
