I've inherited a LAN where there is really no name resolution being done for local resources... i.e. all users enter IP addresses manually to access printers and network shares. There are no LDAP servers or domains either....workstations simply connect to the network without authentication. DHCP is handled via a core switch... And DNS settings are also handed out by this same core switch. Currently, the DNS assignments are as such, and in this order:
I work for a university and we use internal DNS server for internal-only entries, other than that, all lookups are forwarded to Google's 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 without any issues.
If you also use it for local hostname resolution, then you'll benefit from easier to remember, meaningful hostnames for the hosts on your network.
There a couple thousand clients on the LAN....and most of the activity is web browsing ( this is an educational setting ).
First of all, the server seems woefully underpowered for this task...yet there is virtually no slowness when web surfing by clients....
Finally, wouldn't it make sense to have a robust external DNS server listed first? ( Google's 8.8.8.8 would seem to be a logical candidate )
You'll get faster response for web surfing and reduce your network traffic if you set up a local DNS server, even if you only use it as a proxy DNS server (e.g. all your client machines do their lookups to your local DNS server, which then does the lookups on the public/ISP DNS of your choice, and then caches the answers).  Why will you get faster response?  Ping a host on your 10/100/1000 Mbit network, and compare the result to pinging a public DNS server over your 1/2/8/10 Mbit internet connection.  My guess is that you will benefit immediately from a local DNS infrastructure which won't cost you all that much.
