*You should look for these cache sizes because you get the highest performance boosts with the smallest jumps in price.
Buy a modest system, throw in a big hard drive for your media/files, and pick up a small 32gb or 64gb SSD drive.  Due to the near zero seek times, nearly everything you do that involves any degree of I/O will feel snappy and make your PC a joy to use.
It may not be "bang for your buck" but I find that the problem most "average computer users" have is that they don't know how to look after a computer. You need to be defragging fairly frequently (once a month of so for an average user), keeping track of what programs you have installed and deleting things you don't need, taking a look at what programs are starting up as soon as you start your PC and getting rid of ones that aren't necessary.
Absolutely the best performance probably goes something like ram, graphics (if for gaming) CPU, hard drive. If your not gaming put the graphics after the CPU. If you've got money to burn Solid State Disks will shorten your boot times and load times for applications.
I'm going to have to assume you're looking for an overall good at everything, cheap yet powerful PC.
If you look after a computer properly it runs quite smoothly at little to no cost what so ever :) Of course, if you do look after it properly and want a hardware upgrade then RAM is definitely your cheapest option.
Core2Quad (don't need to max it out), 6GB Ram, 750GB HD, Any HD Video (I would purchase an aftermarket video card if you're looking to do any gaming).  If you need more speed, it means you're probably running a lot of higher end applications all at once, so you should go with more RAM to see the greatest performance increase, but it's going to be cheaper from a manufacturer, such as Dell, to go with a faster processor.
  1Gb of GDDR5   ~$150-190  (reviews are your best friend when picking which model, I prefer Nvidia)
