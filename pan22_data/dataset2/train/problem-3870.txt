You can do something like the following - which uses a formula to filter, rather than the column's filter drop-down.
Instead of being presented with a list of the possible values and then whichever you select you get those filtered, such as in Office version 2003 and before, you get a series of checkboxes in 2007 and later. This is less efficient for those times that you only want one particular value, but it's much more powerful in the custom selection capability.
In your google doc spreadsheet, go to Data->Filter.  Click on the boxed down arrow that appears in the header of the zip column.  Click on "clear", then type in your desired zipcodes and click on them when they come up (they should be checked).
I've included it in a single view for the sake of the screenshot below, however in practice I would put the output (columns F:G) in a separate sheet to delineate the two sets.
Cell F3 contains =FILTER(A3:A8, MATCH(A3:A8, D3:D5, 0)) where A contains the complete list of data, and D contains the subset used to filter. 
In Excel 2007 and 2010 the filter options use checkboxes on all applicable values to allow custom selection of any given combination for any given filtered column.
Note that in Google Sheets, you just need to complete cell F3. F4 (and onwards) will automatically fill with the remaining results. Updating the filter output is easy - just edit column D.
