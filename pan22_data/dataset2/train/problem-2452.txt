I run two computers with double monitors through an Aten KVM. The kvm has only VGA input/outputs. One of my new computers has a VGA and a DVI-I adapter so no problems here. I use a DVI-VGA converter and 2 vga cables to the KVN.
The issue should be caused by the HDMI-to-VGA converter which is not passing correct EDID information
I think this is an issue with HDMI handshaking, but I don't know how to solve this. Latest drivers on everything. Any ideas?  
The second computer has a VGA and a HDMI output, so I bought a HDMI-> VGA converter and connected it to the KVN. Everything runs as expected. I get good picture on both monitors and both computers BUT, when switching sometimes (very often) the monitor connected to the HDMI adapter forgets the resolution and is switched to a very low one. I need to switch back and forth several times and with little luck I get the normal resolution back.
