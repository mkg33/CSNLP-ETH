As for your "why?" question - it's really just a convention that the networking community has settled on. If you want to put the default gateway somewhere else, feel free, but really you may be asking for confusion at some point in the future.
It doesn't matter what IP the default gateway has, but it's good to have a consistent policy throughout the network. It's usually easiest to say "lowest usable" or "highest usable" since those two are available on any network from a /30 to a /0.
From what I've seen, it's almost entirely personal/organizational preference. As long as you are consistent, neither way is wrong. If you really wanted to, you could set up the router to have both IPs (but this would be silly.)
I am of the "put the gateway at the top of the subnet" religion. It makes absolutely no difference, though.
There is no hard and fast rule about this, but on nearly all of the networks I've designed and/or worked on, the lowest IP in the subnet is used for the router/default gateway. In your case, this would be 192.168.100.1.
For kicks, I've put the gateway in a /23 on the ".0" or ".255" address (i.e. 192.168.0.0/23, spanning 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.1.254, with 192.168.0.255 and 192.168.1.0 both being valid host IPs)... That's some good fun, that. I enjoy watching the heads of people who don't understand IP subnetting asplode when I tell them-- "The default gateway is 192.168.0.255..."
Toss a coin - it doesn't matter - what's more important is to stick with the result for all subnets to maintain consistency.
