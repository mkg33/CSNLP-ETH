It occurs to me that one of the reasons that bootup is so slow on some machines is that several startup programs are loading at the same time, causing lots of head seeks on the hard drive.  It is essentially the same problem as occurs when you have a hard drive that needs to be defragmented.
Is there a way to load startup programs in series so that the next startup program loads only when the previous startup program has completely loaded?
All Windows versions since XP do rearrange files on the harddisk to reduce this problem. See this wikipedia article.
Take a look at a program called WinPatrol free edition. It lets you delay the start of whatever programs you want. And you get to pick the delay time. I put all my insignificant start ups in the delay section. It loads Windows faster, allows you to start using your computer faster and over a short period of time loads the rest of your start up programs.
I have used a batch file in the past for things that needed to be started serially. Even though this was because of a different reason (some things depending on others) you can still use it to cause programs to start one after another (with appropriate delays).
I've tried Startup Delayer in the past for this. But beware, I found it didn't really end up speeding up the PC that much since basically until each program is loaded, the PC isn't very useful anyways.
