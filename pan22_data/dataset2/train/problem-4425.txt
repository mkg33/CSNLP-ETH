It's not sufficient to check /bin. Not knowing what unix flavor you are using I'll say you should at least also check: /usr/local/bin /sbin /usr/local/sbin and possibly another dozen or so to be sure :) The fact that you didn't know this means that you probably have a bit of a road ahead of you - a fun and interesting road if you are the type of person to enjoy it (I was).
Most modern unix distributions including a packaging system of some kind and, ideally, when installing new software into the system you should use the package manager to add the package.  Sadly this can be a bit of a challenge since not all software is available packaged in a way you can use. I suggest you find a community support site for the relevant unix distro and see what package format your system likes, then see if you can find the tool you are trying to build (mcrypt for php?) in a compatible package format. If you can't find it packaged for your distro then you should try using a generic installation package for it (name-version.tgz typically) and read both the README and INSTALLATION files that are probably in the root directory of the package once you un-zip or un-tar it.
