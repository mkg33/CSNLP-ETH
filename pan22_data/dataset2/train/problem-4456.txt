I in the very beginning of making a small game, and I'm having some problems getting the basic movement of my character.
My character is a square that can be moved by rotating around a corner. The user chooses what corner to rotate around by pressing a button. Here is the (malfunctioning) code I've come up with this far(Java and slick2d):
How would I prevent this 'jumping', and how will I later do collision detection on the image? Or asked in another way, how should I be doing the 'rotation walking'?
Im not sure this works 100% but here is an idea to get you started. Let your square have x,y as center and r as its current rotation value. Let dx and dy be the displacement from center to one corner of the square when r is 0;
This will rotate the square correctly, but when I switch rotation direction, the square jumps two times its lenght to the side I switched to. I think the problem is that I never really move the square, just rotate it away from its original position. I think this will also make collision detection difficult.
