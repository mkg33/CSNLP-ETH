You can use a CGI script - this basically means you can get scripts run by the webserver. Here are some samples from a old project I did (not necessarily the best way of doing stuff, but it worked quite well if with some latency over a WiFi connection):
Hi everyone I am trying to run a python script on my raspberry pi 2 via web server running apache2, php, and raspbian jessie. What my plan is to do is have a timelapse camera using python (code below) and when I go to a webpage it and click a button and it will start to run the script below.  
I haven't done this using python scripts directly (I think CGI scripts can various languages, but you need to define the shebang on the first line)). There is also is a python module as well (see here)
So basicly what I am trying to do is insted of me connecting to my pi via remote desktop and executing the script what I want to do is want to go to a webpage and hit a button and run the script.
This I think I did following this guide. My script above was used to invoke commands that are the $PATH, which were python scripts that used GPIOs to control motors etc. Note with some apache server setups, you may need so setup the security for a directory to have the CGI scripts in - this often is /usr/lib/cgi-bin/, /var/www/cgi-bin, etc.
