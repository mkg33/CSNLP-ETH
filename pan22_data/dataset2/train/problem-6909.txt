For owners of Linksys WRT54G family wireless routers look at the this link listing the many versions of the product family: http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/WRT54G
Buffalo actually ended up entering a partnership with DD-WRT, so WHR-HP-G54DD actually ships with DD-WRT installed, but I've never had one of those.
I've been using DD-WRT for more than 2 years now on a LinkSys WRT54G. Works like a charm. It covers all my needs for a basic WiFi router for home use, and if I plan to extend my network there are still many options I have not yet tried out.
It is not the most feature-packed router, but it's cheap and reliable and works very well with DD-WRT. All the networks I've done with them are effectively fire-and-forget. Never goes down or requires restarts, and the coverage is quite good for 802.11g when you boost the transmitter power (Default is 70mW, DD-WRT lets you boost it to 254, although I've only tried it with 100mW, since that is the highest radio transmitter strength allowed in Denmark without a special permit).
I never used it, but FON is about to release their new Fonera 2.0N. If I understand correctly then this is also preloaded with OpenWRT (the current Fonera 2.0 surely is).
I've had great success with the WRT54GL v1.1 devices, as they have plenty of power for all of DD-WRT's advanced functions, and from what I've seen, run rock-solid for years on end.  They require a mini (or micro) version of DD-WRT to first raise the allowed firmware size, followed by the full DD-WRT flash.  While they can be a little pricier than other routers by a few dollars, the excellent performance and stability they afford can't be beat.
I have set up about ~15 Buffalo WHR-HP-G54, 5 in a mesh network at my old workplace, 3 for WiFi client bridges and the rest as standalone routers for home, family and friends, all running DD-WRT.
