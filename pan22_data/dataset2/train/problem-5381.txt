Since none of the answers take on what speed step does exactly and how to disable/enable it here is what I found:
I would suggest getting the notebook hardware control tool that is mentioned above and use the custom dynamic speedstep funtion. It lets you put a cap on the slowest and the fastest speeds. I also suggest dropping the multiplier voltage by 1 or 2 options in the drop down menu. This will lower the wattage consumed by the processor and help with the amount of heat generated. Just don't drop the voltage to much or the system will crash. I use it with a Dell Latitude D400 with no problems along with http://www.diefer.de/i8kfan/index.html to control the fans speeds based on temperature.
There is a tool notebook hardware control, it allows changing the speed stepping options on the fly. In your case the option would be full performance.
It sounds like SpeedStep can be found in either the BIOS or the OS and maybe even both.  My guess is that DELL maybe lying to you about the performance, I say try disabling it and see what happens.  
I did some searching for a third-party vendor-neutral taskbar utility (like Lenovo's Energy Management utility) and found Power Switch. I tested it quickly with CPUz; in power mode the CPU maxed out and stayed in that state, in balanced while playing a video it would jump all over the place and in power saver mode it just stayed at 800h MHz. Tested on a laptop with an Intel i7-4720 CPU.
To disable it under windows, select the Power Options and select High Performance.  Make sure that the minimum and maximum processor states are 100% and the System Cooling Policy to be Active.
